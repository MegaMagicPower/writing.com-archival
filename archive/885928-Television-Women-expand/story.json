Sweat ran down her beautiful face as she repeatedly pounded on her punch bag, releasing all the stress she had gained through an annoyingly long day at Sunnydale High. As she performed a particularly energetic round house kick to the bag, Giles entered the room and coughed to get her attention. Buffy wiped her brow with her wrist and rearranged her white tank top she always wore whilst training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be trying your utmost to reduce that bag to dust\" Commented Giles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy slowed her breathing before she spoke, \"Just a bad day\" She said simply, \"Nothing to worry about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles regarded her interest before continuing \"Well, as long as your okay..\" He said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The night air was slightly cold against Buffys skin, giving her goose pimples, and she shuddered slightly. She loved the feeling of the cold air on her hot body as it cooled her down after the intense training sessions she often under went. Buffy strode through the dark, quiet streets heading purposefully for the graveyard which was often a hot spot for evil activity in Sunnydale. She smiled to herself enjoying the thought of taking her anger out on something which could feel pain. Upon reaching the graveyard Buffy immediately saw a dark, suspicious figure walking between gravestones some distance away, and with the speed and stealth of a ninja she darted off in silent pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

The creature was a good 7 foot tall, with dark green scaly skin which had a number of horns protruding from it, the largest of which were on the top of its head. Buffy had never seen this form of demon before, so she was a little apprehensive about attacking it before she had formed a strategy. This quickly passed however due to the fact that Buffy really wanted to channel her anger into a serious ass kicking, and to initiate this conflict she craved she stepped boldly forward and coughed to get the demons attention. The demon growled threateningly as it turned and saw Buffy standing there, it's eyes glowing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Said Buffy, \"I wasn't expecting good looks or anything, but you sure are one ugly son of a bitch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature sprang forward but Buffy was ready and she quickly dodged its attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\" Gloated Buffy, \"You can do better than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise the creature stopped and looked at her, and she saw a lot more intelligence in its eyes than she was used to from a demon. Generally demons were single minded creatures, only caring about killing and very little else, but in this creatures eyes she saw something very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes slayer\" It said in perfect English, it's voice little more than a rasp, \"I can do better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can speak English can you?\" She said with forced confidence, \"Gee.. Sorry if my comment about you being an ugly son of a bitch offended you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature smiled widely at Buffy and then rolled it's glowing red eyes into the back of its head. It then started mumbling incoherently, speaking a very ancient sounding language as a substance which resembled black smoke began to rise off its skin. Buffy knew that this could not lead to anything good so she launched herself at the creature, attempting a spin kick to its skull. The kick landed, but an explosive force from the creatures skin sent Buffy flying backward into a nearby grave stone and the creature continued mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When Buffy came to she found herself lying on top of an incredibly soft bed, in a strange house which she didn't recognize. She groggily sat up and caught a glimpse of herself in the reflection in the window, which made her start. Her hair was now platted into two pigtails which ran past her shoulders, and her white tank top and other clothing had been replaced by an old fashioned dress. The dress had puffy shoulders with a lace up, almost corset style body which clung to her body rather tightly and exaggerated her cleavage. Her dress was thick and soft, with multiple layers and went up to her knees, exposing her legs which were dressed in long red stockings and buckled shoes. As she examined her long pigtails Buffy was brought back to Earth when she heard a noise coming from right next to her, and she was startled to see somebody else lying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Both girls moaned with pleasure as they savored the amazing taste of each mouthful and before long they had completely lost their minds to their insatiable hunger. The speed at which the gluttonous girls stuffed themselves was astonishing but the faster they ate the hungrier they felt.

As Dawn huffed and puffed from the amount she'd just eaten, Buffy felt another strange sensation inside of her. She smiled a strange smile as she grabbed another handful of gingerbread wall and slowly approached her panting sister, who hadn't noticed Buffys strange behavior. Without warning Buffy crammed the handful of cake into Dawns open mouth, and Dawn squealed in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MRRFFFF!\" She cried, \"Buffy what the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy didn't respond, instead continued smiling her strange smile as she grabbed another handful of fattening confectionery and stuffed it into Dawns protesting mouth. When Dawn had swallowed this mouthful she batted Buffy away, backing off from her crazed sister. Suddenly as Dawn backed away she began to feel very strange herself, it was like a wave of sexual arousal that she shouldn't control.. the urge commanded her to stuff her sister and allow herself to be stuffed. She returned Buffys smile, grabbing a handful of cake wall and proceeding to cram it into her sisters mouth. Buffy ate it without protest, moaning happily as she devoured the cake feeling an amazing orgasmic feeling as she swallowed. Once she had swallowed she returned the favor and proceeded to cram more of the gingerbread into her sisters mouth which was hanging open expectantly. Dawn felt the same spasm of orgasm wrack her body for a short moment as she chewed and swallowed, and once she had finished she was desperate to feel the feeling again. This continued for half an hour without interruption, each girl taking it in turns to feed and be fed, and each time they were fed they moaned and squealed with the amazing feelings taking over their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yesss! MFFSHHH, Moresh!\" Bellowed Buffy with a mouthful of cake, the orgasmic feelings causing her eyes to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.. BURP! Oooo.. FEEEEED MEEE!\" Bellowed Dawn in response, desperate to feel the feelings again, and Buffy obliged by cramming more cake into her sisters greedy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they fed each other both girls could feel their once toned slim stomachs bloat outward more and more with the amount of food they were consuming. Their corsets, which were quite tight before they had even started eating, now felt incredibly tight and were quickly running out of room as their bloated midsections were pushed against them. Dawn groaned as she rubbed her full belly, which pushed uncomfortably against her tight dress, but strangely the feeling of her full tummy being squashed only seemed to intensify her arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo-MFFF- Urp!\" Squealed Buffy as a particularly large handful of cake was pushed into her mouth, large parts of which broke off and landed in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURPPP!

Oooo yesshhh-ufff-!\" She cooed as she caressed her own body, paying special attention to her breasts and swollen tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeeed meeeeee!!!\" Demanded Dawn, shaking her sister roughly out of her orgasmic haze until she complied with her demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy angrily grabbed two huge handfuls of the cake wall (the wall now had a rather substantial hole in it) and crammed it into Dawns mouth, causing her to arch her back with the explosion of orgasm she felt. Buffy was annoyed at Dawns selfishness at shaking her out of her orgasm so she grabbed handful after handful of the cake walls and stuffed them one after the other into Dawns mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want it so badly?! Have some more then!\" Buffy yelled, cramming a handful into Dawns open mouth, \"And more!\" cramming the second handful in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn collapsed on the floor, unable to keep herself steady from the force of the orgasms that wracked her body and Buffy climbed on top of her roughly stuffing more and more into her sisters drooling mouth. Dawn squirmed and moaned on the floor, her eyes rolling into the back of her head as she was forced to eat more and more and her body exploded with the most intense orgasms she had ever felt in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it you fat pig!\" Cried Buffy, \"Gorge yourself you greedy bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MRRRF Yesshh, I'm a piggy--uhhh-ooooooo- moreeee, dont shtopp-hic!-\" Moaned Dawn in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of this, Buffy could clearly see her sisters bloated midsection straining her corset top and finally got off Dawn. Dawn lay there panting, letting out the odd hiccup and burp until her senses came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's how you want to play it is it?\" Said Dawn, smiling and rubbing her full belly which was emitting gurgling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn got to her feet and undid the lace on her corset, letting it out a few inches before retying. Dawns stuffed stomach expanded outward, thankful of the new space. Dawn approached Buffy still smiling and Buffy smiled back at her, though pretending to be afraid and backing away. Dawn grabbed Buffy roughly by the arm and poked her stomach which was also slightly bloated, but about half the size of Dawns (it stuck out just over 3 inches, while Dawns stuck out over 5 inches). Buffy moaned at the touch, as her tummy was squashed uncomfortably by her tight corset, and Dawn smiled widely as she grabbed more cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go then you gluttonous bitch!\" Shouted Dawn, and stuffed the handful into Buffys waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn repaid the favour tenfold as she stuffed her sister at an alarming speed. Just like Dawn, the power of the orgasms caused Buffys legs to go weak and she collapsed on the floor. Dawn was right on top of her and cramming more fattening cake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uffff, Uhhhh, Oof!\" Came Buffys muffled cries, as her eyes watered and her body arched with each orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you slay anything after this you fat pig!\" Mocked Dawn as she stuffed more and more gingerbread into Buffys greedy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of this insane stuffing, both girls suddenly snapped out of whatever trance they had been in up to this point. Buffy let out a large BELCH, and groaned as she rubbed her stomach which was an inch larger than Dawns and was causing creaking noises to come from her insanely tight corset. Dawn blushed, completely embarrassed at what she had just been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... let me get that for you...\" She said to Buffy, desperately avoiding eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe undid Buffys corset, letting it out so that her stomach could expand outward before retying it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... BURPPP!\" Came Buffys feeble response as she struggled back to her feet and slumping against the wall cradeling her bloated midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn absent mindedly played with one of pig tails, her face flushed from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. that was weird\" She said finally, and Buffy who was still groaning nodded groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what came over me Buffy, I'm so sorry\" She said, more to herself than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah -hic- I'm sorry to -urp-\" Came Buffys weak response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn examined her taut stomach which was gurgling loudly, the bump of which was clearly visible under her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how much we ate\" She said, indicating the rather substantial hole in the wall of the gingerbread house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know\" Said Buffy who seemed to of regained her composure finally, \"Something very weird is going on here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Duh!\" Said Dawn sarcastically, \"What was your first clue genius? I better not put on weight from this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy scowled at her younger sister, \"Well we'd better find out whats causing all of this and kill it! That's usually how these things work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Buffy and Dawns eyes widened in shock, but they soon felt a familiar feeling in their body and ate the treats without complaint. As they chewed they felt a small surge of orgasmic energy rise through their body, which caused both girls to moan softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you like that don't you?\" Crooned the old lady, and both girls nodded whilst smiling stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please feed us some more\" Said Dawn sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!

Both girls shifted in their chairs as they moaned softly at the orgasmic sensations they were feeling, and the old lady sped up her feeding operation. She crammed in another couple of buns, which were followed rather quickly by another couple and then another couple. Pretty soon both girls were having to chew and swallow very quickly before they were being forced to consume more, but they wouldn't have had it any other way. Dawn arched her back slightly, with her eyes rolling as she let out a small burp and was instantly met with another bun being crammed roughly into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MRRRF Oh yes.. please feed me more... I am a piggy URRRF!\" Buffy blabbered through her orgasmic haze, desperate to be fed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please ma'am.. Feed me quicker -urp-\" Said Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady complied happily, speeding up the feeding even more and relentlessly stuffing the greedy young girls. Crumbs were going everywhere now due to the speed of the eating, and quite a lot were falling into both girls cleavages which neither girl had noticed were subtly bigger than when they had arrived here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrhhhh..

The uncomfortable feeling seemed to turn both girls on more, and they longed to grow big enough to burst out from their constrictive prisons. The old lady noticed the small bulges appearing at both girls waist line as their bloated bellys pushed against the fabric, and regarded them with a smile. After another few minutes small creaking sounds could be heard from the girls corsets, as the binding string of the corsets was stretched more and more by their expanding bellys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrffff -Urp- Oooooh\" Cooed Buffy, as the feeling of her bloated stomach slowly forcing the seams of the corset caused her to reach orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's it my dears, give in to your gluttony\" Said the old lady, stroking their platted heads as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief break from feeding caused both girls to slowly come out of their orgasmic daze however, and they now both stared at the old lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The old lady then shuffled from the room, leaving Buffy and Dawn alone. Buffy blew her fringe from over her face, as her hair had been messed up slightly from the force feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you gooo?!\u201d Whined Buffy in the direction the old lady had gone, \u201cFeed me more pleasssse!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am!\u201d Chimed in Dawn, \u201cWe\u2019re hungry piggy\u2019s that must be fed!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady then returned, much to the girl\u2019s delight, with what looked like two large funnels and large barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go\u201d Said the old lady as she placed the barrel down near the girls. \u201cOpen wide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other with excitement and obeyed the old lady, opening their greedy mouths expectantly. The old lady then put the large funnels into the girls the mouths and stroked their pretty faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWharsh in the bawwel ma\u2019am?\u201d Buffy managed to say despite the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA special treat just for you\u201d Said the old lady with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lifted the barrel, with incredible strength for a woman her age, and aimed the nozzle towards the tops of the girl\u2019s funnels. A thick, bright yellow liquid which resembled custard (and pretty much was custard except a few even more fattening ingredients which had been added by the old lady) then leaked from the barrel and entered the tops of the girl\u2019s funnels. The girls sucked at the funnels greedily as the liquid made its way down the tube into their mouths. When the liquid reached their mouths both girls closed their eyes simultaneously in sheer ecstasy at the magnificent taste of the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrrrf\u201d Gurgled both the girls, their minds lost to their own gluttony once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid came thick and fast and the girls consumed it at an incredibly rate as the old lady merely smiled. The creaking of the girls straining corsets could be heard even louder now, as their expanding bellies quickly ran out of room to occupy and stretched the fabric to breaking point. It felt like they were being constricted by a snake and it was an incredibly uncomfortable sensation, though it turned both of the girls on immensely and they shifted in their seats as the haze of sexual pleasure overthrew their senses. After 5 minutes of gorging, two loud \u2013SNAPS- were heard from the direction of the girl\u2019s midsection as the binding string of both girls corsets finally gave up. Both girls gave a muffled moan as their bellies instantly surged forward and met the next layer of their thick dresses, thankful for the new found space. Their bellies were more visible now because of this, as each girl now had a bump which stuck out some 7 inches and growing by the second. Both girls slouched in their chairs, their bodies weakened by the unstopping barrage of custard they were being fed and the amazing feelings of orgasm that was shooting and reverberating around their bodies. After ten minutes of this relentless feeding, the girls finally finished the entire barrel of custard and lay panting in their chairs. They allowed their funnels to fall from their mouths as they both let out a large \u2013BURRP!- in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u201d Said a very exhausted Buffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Urp- Oooh \u2013hic-\u201d Came Dawns exhausted response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl\u2019s stomachs looked incredibly taut and bloated from the force feeding they had just endured, and they were now emitting gurgling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good girls!\u201d Said the old lady, patting the girl\u2019s swollen midsections which caused both girls to groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo \u2013hic- ma\u2019am\u2026 Please don\u2019t touch \u2013urp!- soo full\u2026 uhhhh\u201d Whined Buffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady stroked the girl\u2019s platted heads fondly \u201cAw diddums\u2026 have my little piggies ate too much?\u201d She said sweetly, and both girls nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are fat piggy\u2019s\u2026 uhhhh\u201d Said Dawn weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked exhausted from the amount they had consumed (not to mention the orgasms they had had) as they lay panting in their chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...

She frowned as she noticed that it had snapped completely, so she tied the ends back together and tightened it as far as it would go. Dawn did the same, and though their bloated tummies had reduced in size since last night there was still a bump there which prevented their corsets being tightened quite as much as yesterday. This new bump to their midsections wasn\u2019t merely bloating, rather new added fat which had accumulated there now that their bodies had had a chance to digest the immense amount of fattening foods they had consumed the day before. Both girls had probably gained about 15 pounds each, which wasn\u2019t extremely obvious (though some of the weight had been added elsewhere on their bodies) apart from their new, very slight pot bellies. The old woman noticed the new bumps at the girl\u2019s midsections and smiled as the girls also seemed to notice them for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my\u201d She said in a sickly sweet voice, poking Buffy\u2019s tummy as she spoke, \u201care my little piggy\u2019s getting fat already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked shocked at this observation and immediately examined their softer tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my!\u201d Exclaimed Dawn, her fairytale style naivety still showing in her voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been fattened up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe to!\u201d Chimed in Buffy, obviously none too thrilled at the discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to us?\u201d Demanded Dawn, sounding confrontational for the first time since entering the strange house, \u201cAre you fattening us up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d Said the old lady, her voice showing a sharp, unnerving confidence, \u201cI have\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we don\u2019t want to be fat!\u201d Said Dawn angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough!\u201d Said the old lady, now with a definite edge to her voice, \u201cI will continue to fatten you up whether you like it or not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if we don\u2019t let you?\u201d Said Buffy, putting her hands on her hips defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as a flash, the old lady reached into the sack she was carrying and removed two large sticky buns, which she proceeded to cram into the unsuspecting girls mouths. Buffy and Dawn looked at each other, their eyes wide in shock as this bun was soon followed by another, and another, and another until soon they barely had time to swallow before another bun was forced into their mouths. Despite their show of rebellion earlier, neither girl had regained control enough to stop what was happening and pretty soon they found themselves in the same position they had been in yesterday. The girls lay back on the bed as they began to enjoy the sensation of being fed once more, and the old lady knelt between them force feeding them more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof! Oh yes ma\u2019am... &lt;urp!&gt;\u2026make me a fat, immobile pig &lt;hic!&gt;\u201d Dawn managed to say as she squirmed on the bed from the building feelings of orgasm she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrrfshh\u2026 Yeshhh\u2026 fatten me up!! Feeeed me morrreshhh &lt;urp!&gt;\u201d Said Buffy as the old lady gradually sped up the feeding even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes of relentless feeding the two girls lay panting on the bed, their eyes watering from the pleasure they had just felt. Their stomachs had doubled in size and were once more groaning from how full they were (their retied corsets were once more creaking in protest). The old lady smiled and rubbed their taut bellies, which caused the girls to moan softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m finished with you my dears, you\u2019ll need a forklift truck to lift you!\u201d Said the old lady manically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dawn and Buffy still looked considerably fatigued from their previous feeding, so they showed no sign of rebellion as the old lady sat them down and secured them to their chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we please have a break ma\u2019am?\u201d Stammered Dawn, as the old lady dipped a large spoon into a huge pot, her intentions clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady seemed to consider the request for a moment, though if Dawn\u2019s mind had been sound then it would have been very clear to her that she wasn\u2019t taking the request seriously. Dawn noticeably relaxed, expecting the old lady to be considerate of her discomfort but her eyes widened in shock and horror as the old lady suddenly crammed the spoon into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Said the old lady simply, as Dawn was forced to swallow the porridge like mixture that had just been stuffed into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy also looked shocked at this merciless action, but before she was able to protest the old lady had crammed a spoonful of the same pale mixture into her mouth. The mixture itself was very sweet, and contained a number of special ingredients which gave it very interesting properties indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow my pretties\u201d Said the old lady in a business like tone, \u201cI have some errands to run, so I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll have to leave you alone for a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke Dawn and Buffy exchanged worried glances as they both felt a strange feeling building inside of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw don\u2019t worry\u201d Said the old lady, noticing the girl\u2019s expressions \u201cThat mixture I fed you just has some very interesting attributes. Aside from being astonishingly fattening, it is also insanely addictive! So what you\u2019re feeling now my sweets is the craving for more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and Buffy were squirming uncomfortably in their seats as they tried to fight the feeling that was growing inside them. The old lady smiled widely as she slowly undid their restraints and handed each girl a large spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let me stop you my little piggies\u201d She said, stroking their heads \u201cI know your growing girls so feel free to stuff your faces\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly neither girl could withstand their compulsions any longer, and they both dove at the huge bowl of the pale mixture and began stuffing spoonful after spoonful of the stuff into their greedy mouths. Each mouthful was like an explosion of almost sexual pleasure that rumbled throughout their entire bodies which caused them to moan and shudder with bliss; though with each mouthful the hunger they felt increased. The old lady watched the two gluttonous girls happily for a few moments before turning on her heel and leaving the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Pretty soon they were completely powerless against the addictive nature of the food and their minds were full of nothing but almost animalistic pleasure. Each spoonful merely increased their need for more so as they ate the size of the spoonful they consumed grew and grew until the size of spoon was no longer sufficient for their needs. Dawn tossed aside spoon and proceeded to dunk her face into the mixture and eat it like a pig, bringing her head back up every ten seconds or so in order to get a frenzied gasp of air before cramming it once more into the mixture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMRRRFSH!! Oo, uhhh, moreee!!\u201d Moaned Dawn as she gorged herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy soon followed suit, tossing aside her spoon in favor of stuffing her face into the mixture like the gluttonous pig she had become. All that could be heard now were muffled moans, punctuated only by each girl bringing their head back up to the surface for a gasp of air before returning to eating. The sexual pleasure both girls were feeling now was very intense indeed, and they both ate faster and faster in order to reach a peak that would never come. Suddenly Buffy grabbed the huge bowl, pulling it away from Dawn and using her slayer strength hoisted it upward so that she could pour the mix into her mouth. Dawn looked like she didn\u2019t know what to do as she was still in an animalistic sexual haze, so she feebly reached out to try and get more of the food for herself. Whenever she tried this however Buffy selfishly held it aloft, just out of her reach so that she could have all of it to herself. As Buffy poured the mixture into her drooling mouth her stomach began to noticeably bloat out more and more until it once again began to make her tight corset (which had already been crudely repaired once due to her previous forced gluttony) creak and groan from the effort of containing her growing form. Due to the special ingrediants which were in the mixture she was consuming she was gaining weight on the spot (though at a slow rate) and her small pot belly was slowly becoming softer and wider as she gorged. As her big sister stuffed herself silly Dawn was slowly regaining her senses, as the sexual feelings she had felt slowly wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dawn glared at her gluttonous sister with a look of anger and revulsion on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so disgusting\u201d She said angrily, her resentment towards her sister making her lose the amazing feelings she had previously felt quite obvious, \u201cYour becoming such a fat, ugly pig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gave no indication that she\u2019d heard her sisters ranting, and the only noises that came from her were that of muffled moans and grunts of ecstasy. Suddenly a snapping noise came from the direction of Buffy\u2019s stomach which indicated the lace of her corset once again giving up its ghost against her expanding tummy. Her growing stomach surged forward, making the most of the new found space as it continued to bloat outward. Dawn prodded her sister\u2019s midriff and found it felt quite doughy, her finger sinking into the soft flesh just past the first knuckle (due to the special ingredients of the mixture she was consuming, every calorie she consumed instantly turned to fat).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness your getting fat\u201d Commented Dawn as she examined the bump of Buffy\u2019s belly, completely overlooking her own weight gain (she apparently didn\u2019t notice that she sported her own small pot belly, which was being squashed by her tight corset).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt was at that moment that Dawn decided she\u2019d had enough of her sister\u2019s greediness, and she grabbed the barrel away from her leaving Buffy grasping after it in a baby like manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to eat you greedy fat pig?!\u201d Said Dawn, her voice suddenly crazy sounding, \u201cHave some of this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn then pulled out a huge chunk of the cake wall and practically slammed it into her sister\u2019s face, which staggered Buffy backwards as she was forced to consume it. Dawn then shoved Buffy back further, causing her to trip and fall onto one of the feeding chairs which she was then secured into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to stuff your face you disgusting gluttonous pig?!\u201d Roared Dawn, \u201cLet me help you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn then started tearing off more chunks of the cake walls and proceeded to cram them into her sister\u2019s mouth. This was met with no resistance whatsoever from Buffy and she sunk back into her chair in complete sexual bliss as she was fed faster and faster. Dawn\u2019s anger was evident as she fed Buffy at a relentless speed, barely giving her time to swallow each piece of cake before another was pushed past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMRRRFSH!!\u2026 URRRFF!!... YESHH, FEED ME MOREEE!!... &lt;Urp!&gt; Make me fatter!!! &lt;Hic!&gt;\u201d Came Buffy\u2019s muffled exclamations through her orgasmic haze, \u201cI\u2019m a fat piggg!!! URFF!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES\u2026 YOU\u2026 ARE!!\u201d Bellowed Dawn, stuffing a piece of cake into her sister\u2019s mouth after each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was fed Buffy was slowly gaining weight on the spot, with most of it seemingly going towards her stomach which was becoming softer and wider. As it grew it pushed open her corset more and more revealing the tightening dress beneath, which was beginning to show stress lines. She could feel her breasts slowly plumpening and pushing against her bra, the strap of her bra digging uncomfortably into her back. The same was true for her ass and thighs which were gradually thickening and pushing against her underwear, the feeling of which was turning her on even more. After about ten minutes of this however Buffy could no longer ignore the fact that she was feeling extremely full, despite how amazing it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 No more... URFFF!!!... Please &lt;Urp!&gt;\u201d Buffy said wearily as Dawn remained unrelenting in her feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw you can\u2019t possibly be getting full yet piggy\u201d Said Dawn, stopping for a moment to prod her sister\u2019s soft midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 Soo full\u2026 Urp!\u201d Said Buffy weakly, \u201c&lt;Hic!&gt; Please no more, ULPP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stuffed another piece of cake into Buffy\u2019s mouth which cut her pleads short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no\u201d She said, stroking Buffy\u2019s platted head as she stuffed more cake into her mouth, \u201cYou\u2019re a growing girl, don\u2019t let me stop you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy squirmed in her seat and groaned as she was forced to consume more and more of the fattening confectionery. By this point the amount of weight Buffy had gained was becoming more noticeable on her frame. Though it wasn\u2019t incredibly obvious, anybody that knew Buffy beforehead would have certainly noticed the extra ten or so pounds she was no carrying. Her tummy was noticeably being accentuated by her tightening dress (as were her breasts), as it pushed out a good 7 inches against the straining fabric and her slim face looked ever so slightly fuller. Dawn was seemingly getting a lot of enjoyment out of feeding her sister, especially now Buffy was no longer enjoying it and she seemed positively gleeful every time Buffy attempted to plead for mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu uh\" Said Dawn, wagging her finger at Buffy who's eyes were watering from the exertion, \"You need to nourishment my little piggy! This is what you get for being so selfish you fat disgusting sow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was now a rather substantial hole in the kitchen wall from where Dawn had been ripping off chunks to feed to Buffy, though Dawn paid no attention to the damage she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her ass and tits were both stretching the underwear that confined them (her bra strap was digging into her plumper back, which she had to keep readjusting), and her face looked slightly fuller and puffier than it had when she had arrived at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when I\u2019m done with you dear sister\u2026\u201d Begin Buffy, her voice becoming angrier with each syllable, \u201cThere will be no mistaking what a fat pig you have become!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Buffy pounced on Dawn, tipping the large pot of fattening mixture toward her helpless mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo\u201d Dawn managed to squeal before her voice was cut off by the mixture and she slowly became a slave to her gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy showed incredible accuracy in her pouring as she somehow managed to get every last drop into her sisters open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it my dear sister\u201d Buffy crooned as she forced her baby sister to consume the fattening mixture, \u201cDon\u2019t fight it\u2026 Let your big sis fatten you up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy\u2019s encouragement was rather unnecessary because Dawn was no longer listening as her body was being wracked with the amazing feelings she had been feeling earlier. Underneath the rubble Dawn\u2019s belly slowly began expanding once again against her incredibly tight corset and before long the strings snapped just like her sisters had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo\u201d Commented Buffy at the sound, \u201cHas that big fat belly of yours broken your corset dear sister? I guess your becoming a real fatty aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn offered no response apart from the usual muffled moans and groans of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just at that moment the old woman returned, and stopped dead in her tracks when she saw the pile of rubble that used to be her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... My house!\" She exclaimed, sounding horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw an arm protrude some way away and slowly a look of terrifying fury spread on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... YOUUU...\" She bellowed, words failing her \"YOU FAT IDIOTSS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh\" Dawn whimpered, her head now poking from the cake rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman strode purposefully toward Dawn, just as Buffys head also appeared next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Su... Sorry...\" Dawn stammered fearfully, the look in the old womans eye scaring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" She yelled, flicking her wrist in a specific manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and Buffy gulped as they exchanged fearful looks, knowing they were in trouble. Suddenly bits of cake began to levitate, seemingly guided by the old ladys hand movements which the girls eyed nervously. The large fragments of cake hovered menacingly around the girls heads before they, rather predictably angled towards the girls mouths. The girls instinctively closed their mouths, preventing the cake from forcing it's way in but the old lady wagged her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't\" She said, opening her closed hand towards the girls which had the effect of forcing the girls mouths open \"You greedy fat ass cows need your food, it's a bit late to watch your figures now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large cake fragment entered each girls open mouth, and the old lady then closed her outstretched hand which made them bite down. She opened and closed her hand repeatedly which forced the girls to chew and swallow the large mouthful before their mouths were forced open once now showing in the next mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of your \"figures\" actually\" Mused the old lady \"Let's see how much you piggies have progressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill using her one hand to force the girls to eat, she slowly raised her other which levitated the girls from the wreckage of the cake house. They slowly rose into the air (still being force fed) but were slowed down by their breasts, which had obviously grown from their numerous acts of forced gluttony, getting them stuck. Their breasts eventually popped out, jiggling above the tops of their corsets which they obviously bulged over. When they reached their waists the girls once again became stuck fast, perhaps even more so than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh my\" Said the old lady with mock concern, as she continued to force them to gorge on the cake \"I guess you've gained more weight than I even realized...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a *pop* the girls were finally pulled free, and the old lady let out a low whistle at what she saw. The force of the pull set the girls bellys and love handles jiggling, bulging as they did through the opening of their ruined corsets (the layer beneath the corset was now skin tight, and on Dawns had begun to tear). The girls had both gained obviously around their midriffs but Dawn was the real star of the show, as she had obviously gained more than her big sister. Where Buffy sported a respectable pot belly, along with juicy love handles that bulged above the waist band of her panties, Dawn had the beginnings of a gut (which remained perpetually jiggling). Buffy now weighed around 155 pounds, which was made even more noticeable by how fit and slim she had been for her whole life, being the slayer and all. Her \"little\" sister probably had a good ten pounds on her however, putting her at around about 165 and most of the weight was definitely collecting around her lower half (her belly and ass in particular, whereas Buffy was getting more weight in her tits than Dawn). The girls continued to chew frantically against their will as they levitated into the air and they offered muffled groans and as they gave each other a weary look of misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I think perhaps a change of venue is in order, others deserve to see what fat little piglets your becoming\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy and Dawn exchanged mortified looks, feeling very embarrassed in their new ridiculous, tight baby attire. With a flick of the wrist the very essence of reality began to bend and warp, and soon the world itself began to slip away. The girls were being transported from the strange world, and soon found themselves in more familiar surroundings. Dawn and Buffy gulped as they found themselves back in Sunnydale, though thankfully they were in an area with no other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your friends would love to see what big girls you to are, don't you agree?\" Said the old lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and Buffys minds were becoming clearer by the second, due to not being in the magical realm any longer, but this only made them feel more self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nn... No!\" Stammered Dawn \"Please... Don't let my friends see me... Us... Like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you old witch!\" Said Buffy, her sudden anger causing her exposed belly to jiggle a little \"You've had your fun, now its over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn shot Buffy a warning look, as the last thing she wanted was to incur the old womans wrath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk\" Said the old woman \"And here I was thinking you'd learnt your lessons... I guess I was wrong\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked ready to attack, something the old woman noticed immediately. The old woman raised her hand just as Buffy was about to spring, which stopped her in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly another lesson is required\" Said the old woman, her voice gaining a rather dangerous edge \"After which I am certain you will learn some respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the old lady raised her other hand to poor Dawn, who merely stared on in fear. She now had complete control of both girls bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then babies\" She said \"Lets get you something to eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were forced to turn around, link arms and began skipping like children down the road. They looked absolutely ridiculous, as their bodies jiggled with each skipping step they took which caused the fabric of the outfits to creak against their pudge. Against their will, Dawn and Buffy skipped into town, where there was a line of fast food restaurants that were a popular haunt of the students of Sunnydale High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After your punishment we will meet your friends\" Said the old woman gravelly \"I just hope for your case that those tight outfits of yours stay intact after this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls exchanged looks of fear, but were unable to stop themselves from skipping into the first restaurant. The staff and customers (some of whom the girls miserably realized they knew) had a few moments to gawp at the chubby baby girls in amazement, before the old lady took control of them to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, take a seat\" Said the old lady \"I'm sure you know what comes next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy and Dawn sighed but nevertheless took their seats, as a line of people was formed either side of them. The old lady clicked her fingers, grinning evilly as food was steadily passed down the line from the kitchens before being shoved into the girls awaiting mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the girls knew it half an hour had passed and the feeding mercifully stopped (due to the restaurant running out of food rather than an act of mercy). The girls were slouched in their chairs breathing heavily, their heads resting on their ample bosoms and their bloated bellys bulging above their stretched diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay my tubby babies\" Said the old woman, clicking her fingers \"Time for your next meal, but first thank all your friends for fattening you up even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls slowly and groggily rose to their feet as the restaurants patrons and staff suddenly seemed to snap out of their trance, and looked around blinking in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrpp! Thank you so much for fattening us up everyone\" Said Dawn and Buffy in unison, the old lady forcing the words from their mouths \"But we have to go now, to become even fatter babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls curtsied, a movement which caused a few popped seams on their tight outfits before they wearily staggered out of the door, groaning miserably as they went. The old lady grinned at the dumbstruck crowd as she followed the chubby girls dressed as babies, knowing that this was a story which would no doubt be spread far and wide throughout the social circles of Buffy and Dawns school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were forced to eat in two more restaurants until the old lady finally decided they had learnt their lesson. In the last one she had had Buffy and Dawn feed each other again, as she had decided that this was one of her favourite sights and therefore the Sunnydale residents would also feel the same. Before the pairs many many many feedings at the hands of the old lady (and many pounds ago) the amount they had been forced to consume would have been impossible, as their teeny tiny tummys wouldn't have been able to take it. These tummys however were no longer teeny tiny at all, but even so they were packed full to the brim and it really showed. Their huge taut, bloated bellys were groaning almost as loudly as they were as they were lead from the final restaurant, and their baby clothing was so tight it looked painted on. There were several parts where seams had popped and ripped, and their chub was spilling through the gaps causing the material to creak and large stress lines to appear on the fabric. Dawn now weighed an impressive 173lbs, but Buffy was closing in at a respectable 168lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that you've learnt your lesson\" Said the old lady \"Where shall we go next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do they go?</span></div></div>",

Caudelia could see several people follow them and inside they were flanked by even more Sunnydale students. Those who swarmed Buffy and Dawn looked like they were in a trance, their faces looking zombified and motionless as they brandished their lunches.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caudelia had spent enough time with the scooby gang to know a case of demonic posession when she saw it, but even so found herself in shock having never experienced anything like this. Even though the zombified crowds had no interest in her, they were so hellbent on feeding the helpless sisters as much as possible that they were hard to fight through. When she got closer to the hapless pair she could fully take in the Shere amount of weight they'd piled on to their once perfectly slim bodies sInce the last time she'd seen them only yesterday. The younger Summers sister was clearly ahead on the scales, as her stupid outfit seemed even more ready to completely explode against her growing girth, with many tears in the fabric visible with bulges of flab poking through. That wasn't to say that the slayer was slacking in any on way on her own journey into obesity as she too looked like a sausage ready to burst from its skin, but Dawns glorious belly was a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to get to Giles!\" Yelled Caudelia \"Something very wrong is happening right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't realise she was doing it at first, but completely out of her control she had accepted food from the crowds and was preparing to join in the feeding of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" She cried out in shock as she forced another donut down Dawns throat and a bear claw down Buffys \"Guys I can't stop myself!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that Buffy and Dawn had a demonic aura around them, which caused all those nearby to cram as much food down their throats as possible. Unlike her completely zombified feeder contemporaries Caudelia was able to think and speak clearly, which made the fact she couldn't stop herself feeding her friends even more alarming. After a little while of being mobbed by a large portion of the school, the chunky sisters seemed to regain their own minds (as the evil old woman wanted them to be fully aware of their humiliating situation). All they could do was exchange miserable looks as a never ending stream of fattening foods were shoved down their throats, as they felt their chunky young bodies expand outward popping seams on their silly outfits. They met eyes with Caudelia as she frantically shoved large slices of pizza into their miserable weary mouths, all the time apologising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!!\" Said Caudelia, grunting and grimacing as she tried in vain to stop herself stuffing food down their throats \"Can't.... Nnnnggh! Stop feeding you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could swear that she could actually see the tubby sisters swell before her eyes, every mouthful of calorific junk food threatening the integrity of their embarrassing baby doll outfits that little bit more. Caudelia knew she had to do something before the husky pair burst completely out of their silly dresses. Acting instinctively Caudelia began to feed the helpless pair even more forcefully, which meant that the volume she was stuffing them increased but the Shere force of it sent them stumbling, so she could guide them away from the feeding mob and towards the library. By the time the library was reached there had been several more rips and popped seams, meaning the chunky sisters silly dresses were being kept on by Shere will alone. The youngest of the Summers sisters was still ahead on the fat scale, as she now weighed in at an impressive 175 pounds, every pound of which was perfectly accentuated by the tight tattered remains of her baby doll dress. Her big sister Bufly however was closing the gap between them quickly as she now weighed in at 173, with especially impressive tits which looked simply glorious as they were partially visible through a large tear over her bulging bosom. They were so full that several students had to hold them up to keep them standing as the never ending food avalanche continued unabated past their exhausted lips. With a grunt of effort Caudelia fed them even harder, pushing huge danishes down their throats and sending the students keeping them standing staggering backwards into the library doors and forcing them open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GILES!!\" Cried Caudelia \"CODE RED!!... Or whatever... Buffy and Dawn are in big trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The Slayer, unable to control herself, opened her maw wide and soon digested the many empty calories present in the nachos. She hated not being able to stop herself from consuming whatever was stuffed into her mouth, and she could feel her belly expand slowly outward each time she swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp! Whats the matter with you people?\" She demanded just as a sweet old woman began stuffing an entire box of cinnamon buns into her mouth \" You.. Ulp!... Hic! Got nothing better to do than feed me? Mrrf!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow in derision as she was fed, trying to make it seem like she wasn't at all concerned and in control of the situation but she was fooling nobody. She could feel the top button of her jeans become more strained with each fattening morsel she was forced to swallow and she groaned at the feeling of the waistband digging into her soft flesh. Her stomach rolled out, causing her tank top to ride up and exposing her tan gut to the world, which jiggled as she walked. After a few hours of this constant feeding, Faith had very obviously put on a fair amount of weight. Her stomach now consisted of two rolls, the bottom bigger than the top. Behind her, her rear jiggled as it too expanded, driving her panties deep into the recesses of her rear end. As she ate and ate she could feel how her thighs were receiving much of the added weight, as they were getting thicker. Soon her thighs were almost touching, pillars of adipose. Her face was noticeably softer and slightly rounder with the small yet noticeable beginnings of a double chin on its way. All in all, Faith was now definitely becoming a fat woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing as she was fed yet again, Faith let loose an angry belch and continued to waddle on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was this happening to her?</span></div></div>",

The fat slayer entered the McDonald's and ordered 10 of everything on the menu.  Faith sat down at a table and began ravenously devouring the mountain of food she had just purchased.  The demon's curse went to work on the food as Faith ate, making it much more fattening than it already was.  As a result, Faith's waistline continued to rapidly expand, causing her big belly to become exposed as her shirt grew tighter and rode up on her body. The demons curse was also still at work on the general populous of Sunnydale, because as Faith stuffed her greedy face other patrons of the restaurant approached her with their own offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp! Oh greatmurff!\" She said sarcastically as a passing woman stuffed a large burger meal into her mouth which she chewed and swallowed \"Is it not enough that i can't stop my own greed? Ulp!! Urp! You people have to feed me to? Hic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Faith had eaten all of the food in front of her, as well as several other full meals she'd been forced to eat. She was panting from the speed she'd been eating and was having trouble suppressing hiccups as she rubbed her exposed gut which was gurgling. She groaned as she felt a stab of hunger and was unable to stop herself from once more approaching the register to order some more food. To her intense annoyance she found that she was force fed by several random people as she approached the register, and she had to physically hold up her buttonless unzipped jeans to stop them falling down. And so as the evening went on, Faith continued to eat and eat and grow fatter and fatter. Other customers began to watch her and soon became fascinated by the sight of the young woman fattening herself up, and many of them felt the urge to aide her in her gluttony. Faith ate furiously and as she did she could physically feel her body grow, with each added pound of fat bulging against her forever tightening clothing. She greedily stuffed her face until her gut became so large that it ran into the table, causing her to become wedged in her seat.  At that moment, she suddenly heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Faith, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

I need you to hunt down the demon that's doing this to me and kick it's god damn ass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Faith was approached by a small family, each member carrying several brown paper bags full of food. Buffy stared in shock as they started removing burgers and such from their bags and proceeded to stuff it into Faith's mouth. What shocked Buffy even more was that Faith showed no signs of trying to stop them as they force fed her, as she opened her greedy mouth willingly as they fed her in between mouthfuls she was feeding herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrp! Another side effect of the curse, Ulp!!\" Explained Faith as she was force fed some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll find the demon responsible... and we'll have you back to your... Err... old thin self again in no time,\" Buffy said, trying to sound reassuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second!\" Said Faith stopping Buffy before she could leave \"Can you get me some more food first? I'm sort of stuck in this seat at the moment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon watched the whole scene unfold through his crystal ball as Buffy attempted to pull Faith out from the table.  He chanted a few magic words and gave an evil laugh.  Buffy finally managed to pull Faith free and suddenly realized that she felt extremely hungry.  Faith didn't realize just how fat she had become until she was standing upright and noticed that she could no longer see her own feet.  Her belly had expanded significantly and now hung down over her thighs, her top was skin tight and unable to hide the tanned flesh.  She also saw that her breasts had become larger and that her hands were now pudgier.  Her ass also appeared to be much wider, as her underwear was riding up it uncomfortably. Faith stood there examining her new blubber for so long that she almost forgot about food until Buffy called her name and pointed to a huge pile of food that she had just brought over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Faith said as she unwrapped a large double cheeseburger and began eating it.  Buffy began stuffing her face as well, causing Faith to become concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the demon?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm starving.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that afternoon, Faith wandered the streets of Sunnydale. Just an ordinary day. Not much going on around here. At least, not while there were two Slayers. And Buffy seemed willing to take most of the strain, leaving her fellow Chosen One with very little to do most days. It depressed the hell out of her. She was supposed to be the big damn hero, and she had ended up just being the spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tried working with the Scoobies, but they were such a close knit group that she didn't have a lot of sway with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to tell herself that it was fine, that she was better off as a lone wolf, but... she really wanted that camaraderie. That friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she found herself staring straight a large buffet restaurant in town. Interesting, she thought. Was this place new? She wasn't sure if she'd known about this place before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, people were running and screaming from it in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a guy in a suit outside the building, she ran up. \"Hey, what's the beef?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My restaurant has been infested with some sort of... creature!\" he complained. \"This monster is stealing food and terrorizing the customers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith peered through the window and saw what was happening. Seemed there was some kind of monster - a demon, most likely, attacking people. Didn't seem to be hurting anyone - just scaring them off and taking their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry little bugger,\" she remarked. \"Still, I can relate... Sit tight, pal, I got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the owner could react, Faith strode through the current of escaping customers and headed straight for her new target. The demon was remarkably slim for a great big eating demon. Tall and scaly with two small horns on his head. He grabbed whatever food he could and shoved it down his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pal! Didn't your mom ever teach you about table manners?\" Faith yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon twisted around and saw her. \"Well, well, well... a little girl with a loud voice,\" he hissed a slimy voice. \"What makes you think you can interrupt my dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith smirked. \"Oh man, you think this is going to go your way? You're looking at the Slayer. I'm about to pull your insides outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon quirked what could have been an eyebrow. \"Oh really? You're a lot less... blonde... than I heard you'd be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was trying to get under her skin. Faith shrugged - it would only make killing him more fun. \"We're a pair, all right. She's the 'nice' one. I'm the 'mean' one. Now you get to find out why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting another moment, she ran at him, did a somersault and landed a solid kick right in his chest, sending him flying backwards into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon right himself and cricked his neck. \"My oh my... So you do have a little punch in you... <br>\r\nAlways up for a good dinner show. Even if I'm in the middle of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reared up and went into a very skilled pounce. Faith was just barely able to dodge it, bounding out of the way and preparing to make another blow. But the demon had surprising rebound skills and was already heading back in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cra --- !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon was on her in a second, pressing his scaly hands to her face. \"<i>Ut eam homo devorator, et adipem eam</i>...,\" he intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith winced, but she didn't feel anything immediately happen. Must not be done talking yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't speak that,\" she replied, giving him a solid kick in the abdomen that sent him flying backwards and away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pity,\" he grunted, getting to his feet shakily. \"It's such a lovely language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith yelled and threw another punch. The demon's jaw gave a crack as he flew backwards and crashed into the wall. He fell to the floor in a heap before glaring up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I shall depart. But this isn't over, Slayer - as you'll soon see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of purple energy, and the demon blinked from existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith sighed in annoyance. Damn - he was still at large. But at least she had probably burnt a few calories during the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the restaurant. Lot of damage, but nothing irreparable. And although a lot of food had been eaten, the majority of it was still intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd damn... it still looked so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around again. No sign of anyone. The crowd outside had dissipated. Not even the owner had stuck around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well</i>, she thought, picking up a spoon. <i>They'll probably just blame any missing food on the demon</i>...</span></div></div>",

Better than letting them go to waste, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a great big vat of thick buttery mashed potatoes. That would do nicely. She grabbed a chair and sat herself down in front of it. With her spoon at hand, she started to shovel the huge vat into her gut. She didn't think she'd be able to finish it all in one sitting. After all, there was more here than could possibly fit in her stomach. She would just load up until she was too full to have another mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a solid plan, and for the first fifteen minutes, she thought it would work just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to her surprise, she found that the fullness wasn't coming. She continued eating, figuring she was just extra hungry. The hunger didn't relent. She just wanted more and more. Once half an hour had elapsed, she tossed the puny little spoon aside and started eating with her hands, getting it all over herself, but she didn't care. She needed more. She <i>needed </i>it. She needed <i>more</i>. So much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating as fast as she could, she could feel her stomach getting full, but not feeling full. She needed to feel full soon, right? Physically, she needed to feel full before she burst. But her stomach continued to stretch to accommodate her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the vat of mashed potatoes was empty, and Faith was looking very full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a belch, Faith patted her stomach - it was very full. But it didn't feel that way. She felt like she could continue eating with no ill effects. She was worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo worried that she went straight for a vat of green beans and began to shovel them into her mouth as well. She followed that up with some ramen noodles, followed by chicken, then steak... Not eating all of it, mind you. Just taking bits and pieces of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, though, Faith found she couldn't quite move normally. Her stomach was swelling to such enormous proportions that it was like smuggling a globe under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she thought, she wasn't full yet, and she wanted dessert. So she took an entire gallon of cookies n creme ice cream and headed out the backdoor, grabbing another spoon as she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling down the alleys, Faith looked down at her enormous stomach. How had this happened? How was she able to eat all of this? Bite after bite of ice cream went down her throat and into the swell that swayed back and forth just ahead of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Faith was laid out on the ground, leaning against a building and slurping down whatever ice cream had melted. She tossed the container in a dumpster and slumped against the wall, her stomach now entirely in her lap. She couldn't help but pout as she couldn't pull her shirt down over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, the insane hunger had subsided, and she was now content. Not exactly stuffed like she should've felt. Definitely not feeling as ill as she thought she would've. She felt... good. She gave her stomach a slap. A small smile on her sticky lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...,\" she sighed contentedly. \"Belly - you and me are gonna have a lot of fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small voice in her head told her,<i> this is wrong</i>, but she found it remarkably easy to ignore...</span></div></div>",

Naturally, Faith didn't care for it. She supposed she ought to enroll in classes one day, but it seemed like such a hassle. Much more fun to just wander the halls and write insulting things about the more annoying faculty members - especially Principal Snyder. The guy was such a sniveling little weasel that tormenting him was one of her favorite hobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, however, Faith was making her way to the library for the regularly scheduled Scooby meeting. She rarely had anything to contribute - they usually just ended up doing whatever Buffy told them to do - but hey, free doughnuts. Reason enough to show up and feign interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had to do something about her wardrobe. The food in her stomach had successfully digested, but her body clung to every calorie. Imagine her shock when she stepped on a scale found that she'd gained seven pounds overnight. She supposed she ought to be concerned, but she was remarkably calm. Weird... Still, she stole some slightly larger clothes from a clothing store - shoplifting was a skill and she didn't care what anybody said - and wore them to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking inside, she saw the usual Scooby gang seated around the table in the center of the room - seriously, who designed this place? - and she strode over to them nonchalantly. They were going through their various leatherbound books that Giles seemed to always have in excess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the Watcher, he looked up when she entered. \"Ah, Faith - glad you're here,\" he said. \"We're just going over the latest catastrophe that's destined to destroy Sunnydale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith scrunched up her face. \"Another one? Geez - didn't we just have one last week? And the week before that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tend to happen fairly regularly,\" replied Buffy. \"Usually on Tuesday, typically around 9 'clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8 o'clock Central Time,\" Xander added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard to plan your life around once you get used to it,\" agreed Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith shrugged and sat down. \"So what's the beef with this latest disaster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles started pulling out papers. \"Yes, it appears there's been a portal opened somewhere in a ten mile radius of here, and various demons have been slipping into the town. Small numbers at the moment, but they've been increasing. We're hoping to find whoever is messing about with this portal and shut it down before the demon population overwhelms the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the lines at the DMV are long enough,\" Xander quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of demons?\" asked Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we got the great big bumper variety pack,\" said Buffy, pulling out a notepad. \"We've had sightings of fire demons burning down buildings, water demons trying to flood the neighborhood, mucus demons turning the place to snot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I saw a demon trying to steal all the clearance items at Walmart,\" added Willow excitedly. \"So I'm calling him a 'Thrift Demon'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seen anything similar, Faith?\" Buffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I fought a demon at a restaurant stealing everyone's food. Remarkably skinny. Tried fighting him, but he teleported away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fun,\" sighed Xander. \"Demons can just vanish into thin air. Ever get the feeling the bad guys don't play fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another demon to add to the list,\" Buffy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did this demon have any powers that you noticed?\" Giles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other than high metabolism?\" added Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Super nimble. Lots of jumping. Can take a punch. Oh, and he grabbed my head at one point and started chanting something, but I kicked him off before he could finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember what the chant was?\" Giles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith shook her head. \"You kidding? I can barely remember how this conversation started. But it was in some weird language. Vaguely Latin-ish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles blinked. \"Yes, well... I'll be sure to pull out my Latin-ish textbooks and find something on glutton demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry - he's a bit grumpy when there's an apocalypse happening,\" Willow whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not grumpy!\" Giles snapped. \"I'm just... just... yelling at teenagers in a library. Fine, yes. I am grumpy. I'd like to find this portal quickly. Buffy, Faith - perhaps you two should patrol the city after school and find out where it's coming from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, and I can work on some kind of 'portal detectors',\" Willow added eagerly. \"Help you find it quicker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, splendid idea. Perhaps you'd all better head back to class now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, but we're enjoying the leathery books and notepads,\" Buffy faux-pouted as she got her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll reconvene tonight at 7,\" Giles continued. \"Be ready for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too hard, since there's a lot of 'anything' in this town,\" Xander said, already following Buffy and Willow out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tonight, Faith,\" Buffy called over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, B,\" Faith replied, getting up as well, already feeling that disconnect she always felt when they went off without her. Sure, they had class to get to, and she couldn't exactly join them, what with her not being a student, but still - seeing them leave in a group while she was left alone with a dusty old librarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course, they just leave their leftover snacks everywhere,\" Giles sighed, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith turned and saw the snacks in question. A half-empty container of glazed doughnuts, a few party bags of chips... She licked her lips. \"Don't sweat it, G,\" she said, pretending to be put out. \"I'll dispose of the evidence we were ever here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles blinked in surprise. \"Oh... Well, thank you, Faith. I appreciate it. There's a dumpster around the back for anything you don't want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" she replied, gathering everything up. She had no intention of visiting any dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she loaded up her arms, Giles couldn't help but notice the way her stomach bulged over her pants and raised an eyebrow. \"Faith... are you certain the demon didn't do anything to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing a little Slayer super-healing can't handle,\" Faith replied breezily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? No... ill-effects? Even if he didn't finish his chant, there might have been some magical transference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, G - I think I'd notice if something was wrong, don't you?\" she replied. \"See you guys tonight at 7.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Indeed,\" Giles said quietly, watching the girl scurry off with an armload of goodies. He shrugged as she disappeared. He'd keep an eye on things, but for now, he wasn't going to worry. The portal needed closing first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening, Faith made her way down to the local cemetery - of which there were several, what with this being Sunnydale and everything, but whatever - carrying her usual stake just in case. She'd made sure to eat relatively light tonight - but she still had a pretty sizeable bulge in her belly as she walked past the gravestones and crypts that lined the place. She supposed she ought to be a little self conscious about it. She was a Slayer, after all. Supposed to be fit. But that was the joy of her special metabolism - any weight gained would disappear soon enough. She just happened to be eating too much for it to remain unnoticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was wearing black, and that was slimming. She walked through the cemetery and approached the other Slayer, as well as the Watcher and the Wicca who were standing off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Faith - roughly on time,\" said Giles in his British-stuffiness. \"Now we can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, fun,\" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, ladies,\" said Willow, reaching into her bag. \"Just got the portal tracker gem things ready. Hopefully, by going in opposite directions, you won't have to worry about missing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the radius has expanded to eleven miles last we checked,\" said Giles. \"Still within Sunnydale city limits, so you shouldn't have to walk too far to find the portal generator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no idea who the portal maker person is?\" Buffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as of yet. Could be human. Could be one of their fellow demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could even be a hacked off squirrel,\" said Willow with a goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm with her,\" said Faith. \"One doofus squirrel just happens to accidentally squeak an incantation when he stubs his toe, portal opens up, kablooie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiles rolled his eyes while Buffy and Willow giggled. \"I could've stayed home and soaked my knee,\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you love it, you know you do,\" Buffy said, gently elbowing him in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better split before his glasses fall off,\" Faith added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on, Giles, let's let the Slayers have their hunt,\" Willow said, guiding the weary Watcher away. \"We can join Xander and Oz marathoning all their Mystery Science Theater 3000 videos...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, joy of joys,\" Giles sighed as he allowed himself to be led away. \"Just a night of eating popcorn, drinking grape soda and mocking black-and-white B-movies... Actually, that <i>does </i>sound enjoyable...\" He looked back to the Slayers. \"You two be careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know us!\" Buffy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy and Faith chuckled as they were left alone in the cemetery. They walked a bit in silence, waiting for the gems to come 'online'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... seen that glutton demon lately?\" Buffy asked conversationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, and it's been a few days... But then again, I haven't heard about anyone having their food stolen, so he might be lying low for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good... So... whatcha been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith regarded Buffy with a funny look. \"You know - the usual. Staking vamps, watching TV, eating, sleeping, rinse, wash, repeat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, great, great... So... how often do you train? Exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith shrugged. \"Whenever I find the time. Although, I have to admit, I haven't been keeping up lately...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked like she was trying very hard not to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You got something to say, B?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Nonononono, definitely nothing to say over here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Let's keep it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked a little further until they were out of the cemetery - it was a big one - and stood at the iron gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Buffy, handling her gemstone. \"I guess... you go that way, and I'll go this way. Walk around for a couple hours waving these things around and see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if one of us finds the thing making the portal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Stop it, I guess? I'm not really sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solid plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they turned back to back and walked off in opposite directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith held the gemstone in her hand, waiting to see if anything happened. Absolutely nothing. She had a feeling Buffy would find it anyway. She was the <i>actual </i>Slayer, after all, and she was just the second rate knockoff. Kicking a tin can bitterly, she continued on her walk, waving the gem back and forth like it was a metal detector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled. She was hungry again. Damn, after the big dinner she'd had, how could she still be hungry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, there was a burger joint up ahead. Seemed there was always something nearby to fill her belly. Licking her chops, she walked over. Might as well get something to tide her over during the search. She walked inside and gave her order - had to keep it fairly light since she was going to have to pay money for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double cheeseburger, no tomatoes or onions, large fries and large chocolate shake,\" she said breezily, already fishing the money out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For here or to go?\" asked the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Faith could utter the words 'to go', there was a rumbling in the air that took them by surprise. You'd think in California they'd be more prepared for earthquakes, but this one made them all jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith looked outside, and she realized she would be staying here for a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air around her seemed to warp and twist before a familiar scaly demon came spilling onto the floor. He did a tuck and roll before landing neatly on his feet, giving her a twisted smile. \"Well, well, well, the other Slayer stops by for a mid-patrol snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith glared at him. \"Says the demon whose whole existence is stuffing his face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the glutton demon smiled again. \"Oh, I think you know by now it goes much deeper than that. How are those jeans fitting, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith blinked. \"... Fine, thanks... Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because in a few minutes, they won't fit at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon snapped his fingers, and the lights in the building began to dim and turn a blood red color. The other people in the restaurant were all running out the doors in fear, including the employees. Damn, she thought, so much for that burger. And why was that a priority right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind whipped up, blowing her hair into her face, and she realized she needed to focus. She rushed at the demon and threw a punch, but her fist shot through empty space and embedded itself in the wall. The demon had disappeared. She looked all around for it, but it was now hovering in the air, streaks of red light flashing around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Losing energy already? Somebody's been a little lazy lately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith growled and pulled her fist out of the wall. \"What the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just making some late night snacks. Seems the light show scared off the people in the kitchen, but I don't mind doing the cooking myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what this is about? Feeding your stupid face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Faith's mouth opened against her will, and a cheeseburger flew into it, jamming itself into her gaping maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's about feeding <i>your </i>stupid face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith tried to make herself not chew, but this demon had some kind of mental power over her. It took a while, but soon, the entire burger was eaten and swallowed. She barely had time to recover before another one flew through the air and forced itself into her mouth. This time, she could swear she felt her esophagus expand because she found herself swallowing the burger whole somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What are you doing?\" she cried, gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's feeding time,\" the demon replied. \"Not to worry. No tomatoes or onions. Those will probably be the only food left in the place by the time I'm through with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Faith could even formulate a witty response, she found herself slowly rising into the air. She tried to run or jump or anything, but without any gravity, it was no good. To make matters worse, burger after burger came flying out of the kitchen, swirling around her before jamming itself into her face hole. Somehow, she just kept swallowing them whole. One after the other. She could feel her stomach swell like a big meat-filled balloon. One greasy fatty burger after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd dammit, it felt good. To be force fed like this, not having to lift a finger, to be this stuffed and bloated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the button on her jeans gave way, and the zipper slipped down next. Faith opened wide and just let the burgers fill her up. Her giant balloon of a belly was swinging around like a wrecking ball as the demon slowly spun her around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, see? Isn't this fun? But wait, there's more! I believe the fries are up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith barely had time to look before an endless stream of french fries went flying into her mouth, sailing single file into her stomach. Oh god, it was salty heaven. She could feel her stomach swelling larger and large, to the point that she wasn't even in the air anymore. Her engorged stomach was too heavy now. She sat her ass neatly on the floor and leaned back against a wall, allowing the food to continue filling her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...,\" the demon continued, \"... time for something to wet your whistle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith let out a yelp as the soda dispensers all emptied, as well as the ice cream and milkshakes. They blended together into a sugary delight. Oh, god, the cascade of flavors - it should've been mush, but it was like she was tasting each of them separately and yet at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis feeding session seemed to go on for hours, but it was really more like twenty minutes before the entire kitchen was spent, and Faith was left sitting with a belly so big that it stretched out at least five feet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, just look at you...,\" the demon said in a growly voice. \"Once all that food digests, it'll be a miracle if you can even move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith was breathing heavily from the gorge, but she managed a few words. \"Can't... get fat... Slayer... metabolism...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" the demon giggled. \"The Slayer metabolism helps you to maintain your fighting figure. But if you eat too fast for it to keep up, it'll probably give up at some point. You have to admit, though... you don't hate all this extra size, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith's head was still swimmy from consuming so much in so little time, trapping her in a sort of food coma euphoria. Her hand couldn't reach far enough to rub her delightfully sore tummy. \"I... I don't... I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the demon smiled. \"I thought as much,\" he chuckled. \"Now then, I have other things to do, but do not despair, Slayer, for we shall meet again. In the meantime, just relax, digest and maybe invest in some stretch pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon disappeared in a flash, but Faith barely registered. She just slumped backwards and felt her eyelids getting heavier.</span></div></div>",

That's interesting... Okay, just give me the address and I'll pass this along to our crack staff... Excellent. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia ripped the paper with the necessary details and took them back to the main office where Angel was going through a few bills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got another one for you,\" she announced. \"82nd Street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could very well be a war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh... Okay, I'll give Wes a ring, and we'll go check it out.\" He got up from his desk, grabbed the paper from her and headed out the door. \"You'll hold down the fort while I'm gone, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" she said casually. \"No problemo, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regarded her briefly. \"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Totally sure! Absolutely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel's eyes could see right through her - she really was a crummy actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cordelia, it's okay to admit you're still sad. I miss him, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia could already feel her lower lip tremble at the mention of 'him'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been over a month since Doyle's death. He'd sacrificed himself to save them and a bunch of Lister demons from a deadly beacon. The poor half-demon had been vaporized right in front of them, reduced to nothing, and all they had left of him were the visions from the Powers That Be that he'd passed on to Cordy before his death. It had taken her weeks to get to a point where she wasn't constantly sobbing. She tried to take comfort in the fact that he'd given her the visions - a testament to the love he felt for her - but it just made her want to have him back so she could have dated him and fallen in love with him properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long afterwards, ex-Watcher and uptight British guy Wesley Wyndem-Price had shown up and joined the team, essentially filling the void with his seemingly-endless knowledge of demons. It had been weird at first, given how useless he'd been in Sunnydale and the problems he'd caused, but she could tell he and Angel were learning to work together, and it was a nice distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't mean the grief wasn't still there. It would catch her unawares sometimes. She couldn't help but let a few tears fall on the job occasionally. Angel did his usual tough-guy brooding exercises to cope with his own grief. Wesley was remarkably gentle on the subject. He had never met Doyle, but he was always willing to listen when one of them needed to talk about him for a while. A pity they would never meet - she hoped maybe they would have been friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Angel,\" she said gently. \"Just... go fight those wrestling thumbs for me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel nodded in understanding. \"If I'm not back before closing, just lock up and head home. And if you have a vision --- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have your pager number,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a small smile back and headed down into the sewers, already dialing Wesley's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia sighed heavily. All alone. Nothing more to do except finish filing and sit on her gorgeous butt until another client called. They were still a relatively new business. They'd had some decent success lately, which meant a few extra groceries in addition to paying rent, but it wasn't quite the \"rolling in dough\" situation she'd been hoping for. She had to buy the cheapest groceries she could get. She'd had a couple of paying commercial gigs here and there, but nothing permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled, reminding her that she hadn't eaten in a while. She grabbed a banana off the break room counter and munched on it. Stupid emotions. They were really throwing her off. She hadn't bothered with going to the gym the entire month. She got plenty of exercise helping fight demons, but that hardly ever happened. Angel was being too nice about her grieving and going either solo or with Wesley - which was just as well as going solo. She really ought to renew her gym membership - she had to look good for her imminent stardom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished off the banana and tossed it in the trash can. There. She'd eaten something healthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fell on the phone, and she immediately started daydreaming about getting a large pepperoni pizza. She didn't get to do that so often anymore. Hardly any friends out here. Angel didn't eat. Wes was a slightly picky eater. There was hardly any point in ordering a giant pizza for herself. But she'd been in such a funk for the past month, and it wasn't like her acting career was going anywhere.</span></div></div>",

Little did some students realize just how 'well-rounding' it could become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina Spellman, for instance, when picking her classes and physical activities, never even considered the idea that they could result in her gaining weight. But a combination of late-night study (and snacking) sessions, plenty of junk food and beer, and a relatively easy-going yoga class, meant that she was suddenly starting to outgrow her outfits. At first, she attributed it to the laundry service shrinking her clothes, but one day, she was forced to come to terms with her, 'growth'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nIt was a Saturday, the morning after an evening of eating and watching bad TV. Sabrina was still in bed, but her roommate, Roxie King, was up and sitting on the couch, brushing her long black hair. She was pretty slim, with small, yet perky boobs, though a slight potbelly was visible under her long-sleeved grey blouse, a result of her addiction to takeout food, which she had been indulging a little too often lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just considering getting some breakfast when Sabrina emerged from their shared room, dressed only in a t-shirt and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie's eyes widened as she looked at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina looked up, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was so shocking to Roxie was that Sabrina had clearly put on quite a bit of weight, probably around 15 pounds, and on her small frame, it really showed. The blonde's once flat stomach had grown into a proper belly, sticking out from under her nightshirt and jiggling when she walked. As she bent down to turn on the TV, she revealed that her weight gain hadn't been limited to her stomach, her wide bottom testing the limits of her underwear, the crack of her butt cheeks just peeking out above the straining waistband<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Roxie had gathered her thoughts, Sabrina was already sitting on the couch, helping herself to some leftover Chinese food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Sabrina began, chewing on a spring roll, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie hesitated. Despite her reputation as a bit of a bitch, it was a delicate subject, and she was aware that she had put on a little weight as well recently. Still, she had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Roxie was spared this unpleasant job by the return of their other roommate, Morgan, from her daily jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red-headed, air-headed fashionista, with a cute face and bubbly curves, Morgan Cavanagh took great pride in her personal appearance, and made a point of exercising every day. While she generally watched what she ate, she also had quite a sweet-tooth, and often picked up pastries and other sweets to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in through the door, resplendent in a hot pink tracksuit with matching running shoes, a Walkman clipped to her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought donuts!\" she trilled, brandishing a brown paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sabrina and Roxie were enticed by this news, and quickly abandoned the couch and moved to the kitchen area. Soon, all three girls were tucking into the sugary treats, as well as three steaming cups of coffee. They soon finished off the entire dozen (Roxie had three, Morgan helped herself to four, while Sabrina managed to pack away five), and sat back, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina stood up to get another cup of coffee, giving Morgan a great view of her expanded form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped and turned to Roxie, who gave her a warning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Sabrina,\u201d Morgan began, \u201cyou\u2019ve put on so much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Coffee!\u201d Roxie interrupted, \u201cMorgan was just saying you\u2019ve put on so much coffee, I don\u2019t know how we can drink it all! Right, Morgan?\u201d she added, threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked confused. \u201cOh, yeah. Coffee\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie sighed in relief.<br>\r\nas Sabrina sat back down.\u201cAlso,\u201d Morgan continued, \u201cyou really got fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina stormed into her room, slamming the door behind her. She couldn\u2019t believe the nerve of Morgan! Calling her fat! For a moment, she\u2019d thought it was just her usually superficiality, until she saw Roxie nodding her head. Maybe she had put on a little weight, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling nervous, she conjured up a full-length mirror and took a good look at herself. She lifted up her shirt and poked her stomach. It looked rounder\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a little bloated\u2026\u201d she told herself, \u201cfrom the donuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands up over her breasts, which felt a little fuller. In fact, she had noticed her bras were getting kind of snug\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 a growth spurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, and looking over her shoulder, surveyed her backside. It stuck out much more than it used too, and the fabric of her underwear was being drawn up between her butt cheeks, giving it a thong-like appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just because I\u2019m\u2026 getting fat.\u201d She moaned, finally realizing how much weight she\u2019d put on. It wasn\u2019t her fault, she thought, sitting down on the bed and rubbing her belly. It was hard for her to keep slim when you could conjure up food at the point of a finger, especially without her aunts to keep an eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Sabrina decided to go ...</span></div></div>",

True she had put on a little bit of weight, but the was certainly not enough to be called fat! She would loose the weight in no time. She would always be a skinny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina arrived at her aunt's house half and hour later. She had put on some sweatpants and a loose shirt. Her aunt herself was not the slimmest woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer aunt, Lisa weighed 235.895lbs and most the weight had spread evenly around here body, but most of it had gone to her belly making it stick out rather boldly under her XL shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina! Darling! Your here! I missed you so much! How's school?\" Her aunt inquired eagerly. \"Horrible!\" Sabrina groaned. \" Oh my! What could have happened? You liked that school so much!\" Her aunt said, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Aunt?\" Sabrina suddenly said. \"Yes? My dear?\" Her aunt listened, while leading her into sitting room. \"I'm not FAT am I?\" Asked Sabrina struggling to fit into her old chair at her aunts. \" No! Of course not! Your not fat until you pass your old aunt! Even I'm not fat. Why would you ask that?\" Her Aunt asked, shocked. She nearly spilt the hot chocolate and the chocolate chip cookies she was making for Sabrina. \" Have some cookies my dear!\" Sabrina, without realising it, grabbed 5 and started gobbling them down like a wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..... a girl who is my roommate, you know Morgan, she called me fat.\" She said shakily, grabbing more cookies . \"Oh dear\" muttered her aunt. \"Well I know you must get back to school. Here's some cookies and hot chocolate to take for the road,\" added her aunt, handing her some more cookies and hot chocolate. Sabrina looked down at the plate of cookies in her hand, except there WERE no cookies. She had finished all of them! Her aunt ushered Sabrina to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer aunt closed her door and Sabrina was left standing outside with her belly actually hanging OVER her sweatpants. She got into her car and noticed how her belly was actually resting on her thighs which were noticeably bigger. She struggled to buckle her seatbelt, but pretended not to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would she go now? Listen to her aunt or go wandering herself?</span></div></div>",

It brought a thrill of excitement to her. A naughty sense of being stuck, of being seen only for her body, a sex symbol rather than a person in her own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd never admit it. But part of her had liked the experience, the sly looks Harvey had cast in her direction when he thought she wasn't looking. Hell, she even enjoyed the helplessness of it. Stuck with a Jessica Rabbit body, that magic couldn't remove. Well, kinda, sorta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became agitated as she thought of it. The mix of power and powerlessness were a curious mix. With her powers, she could re-create that body, perhaps even make it so she couldn't cast any magic for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to her bedroom, she prepared herself. Sitting herself down at the make-up table, she looked intently in the mirror. Closing her eyes, she imagined the perfect body..... The perfect body for attracting men. Chanting the spell under her breath, she stopped, as she felt herself pulled forward.

So eat up, if you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy's dark eyes gleamed and she smirked. \"You're right, I do love being softer, but I don't think I can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Was it something I said? Did I push you too hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Spellman, I just want you to feed me. No forks, no napkins, just feed me with your bare hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, looked it up on the Web. Seems right up our alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you really want me to. Say ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy sat up, placing Sabrina's free hand on her belly as the witch used her other hand to grab a messy chunk of the cake, bringing it closer to Roxy's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\"</span></div></div>",

Roxy chewed frantically, her eyes glazed in pleasure as she swallowed the delicious moist cake and opened her mouth in greedy anticipation of the next. Sabrina kept the cake coming with gusto, occasionally wiping away icing affectionately which had stuck to Roxys lucious lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You missed some baby\" Said Sabrina, presenting one of her dainty fingers which was thick with the creamy sweet icing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy bit her lip, tingles of sexual pleasure resonating around her body as she used her tongue to slowly lick away the delicious frosting. Sabrina was having similar feelings as she felt her gorgeous lover, who had once been so slim but had made herself fat for her pleasure, slowly lick her finger. Roxy then took Sabrinas finger into her mouth, seductively sucking away the remaining icing and Sabrina practically squeaked with pleasure. This was the final straw, Sabrina launched on Roxy engaging her in an open mouthed kiss which Roxy returned. The lust the two felt for each other was intoxicating and as they kissed passionately Sabrina used her free hand to feel for more cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh\" Said Roxy, obediently opening her mouth and allowing another handful of the fattening cake to be stuffed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina felt Roxys gorgeous plump body as she sped up the feeding operation, and she felt goose bumps rise on her soft flesh from her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What's happening to me?\" Libby cried as she watched her belly expand out in front of her.  She grabbed her big belly and jiggled it to make sure it was real.

Her thighs thickened, her breasts grew larger, and even her arms grew fatter to the point that they jiggled wildly when she moved them.  Libby looked at her hands in horror as she saw that even her fingers had become fat.  Libby's face grew fatter as well; her cheeks became rounder and she now had a double chin.

The petite brunette groaned as she forced herself to slug back another mouthful of the cold water. The gallon jug was awkwardly heavy, and she let it clunk back down to the floor, next to the empty one. She hiccuped and examined her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already impressively swollen, jutting out over the waistband of her underwear. She ran a hand delicately over the taut surface, wishing it was bigger. But she didn't think she could drink even one more drop without throwing up. She sighed and lay down on her bed, one hand gently caressing her bloated belly. She knew she'd have to get up and go to the bathroom before she went to sleep, but for now she could enjoy the sensation of the sloshing water in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie Burkhart thought of herself as a normal, all American girl. There was nothing 'weird' or 'strange' about her. Except that occasionally, she fantasied about filling herself up with water until she was about to burst. She knew it was weird, but it had been in the back of her mind for as long as she could remember, an obsession with the idea of just growing and growing. She remembered seeing a movie when she was younger, where a girl around her age was blown up like a blueberry. She had made her parents take her to see it a dozen times, fascinated. From that point on, she had often indulged in daydreams where she was expanding or growing. Sometimes it was just her belly, swollen like she was 9 months pregnant with triplets, sometimes it was her whole body, expanding like a water balloon. Sometimes it was against her will, but usually she was an eager and active participant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never told anybody, not her boyfriend, or even her best girl friend. She knew they would just think she was a freak, a sicko, a pervert. So she kept it to herself, quietly imagining or sometimes, like now, acting it out as best she could, though it could never live up to her imagination. No matter how much she wished it was true, it was impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie didn't know it, but high above her head a shooting star was passing by. As she silently wished, it seemed to glint extra bright before vanishing into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down below, Jackie sighed and made her way to the bathroom. She had school tomorrow, she should probably go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Jackie put her late-night fantasies out of her head, putting them away into a little box so she could get on with her life. She picked out a cute outfit (although all her outfits were cute), and went down for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that she ever ate much, the way she saw it, breakfast was for fat girls. She usually just had a glass of orange juice. She took the carton from the fridge and poured herself a tall glass. As she sipped, she flicked through an old issue of Cosmo that was lying on the kitchen counter. She had just got past the contents page when she noticed her glass was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh?' She  thought to herself. Maybe she didn't fill it as much as she had thought. She grabbed the carton and filled her tumbler again. She returned to the magazine, glossing over the articles and focusing on the pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she added things to her mental shopping list, still drinking and refilling her glass whenever it emptied. Glancing at the clock told her it was time to go, but when she went to put the juice back in the fridge, she realised it was almost empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?\" she actually asked aloud, shaking the carton in disbelief. Had she really finished off the whole thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, and then shrugged. It didn't really matter anyway. She threw the cardboard carton into the bin, and after a last check of her hair and makeup, she set off for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Burkhart? Miss Burkhart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie suddenly recognised her name, and responded without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She said, a slight catch in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few muffled laughs from her classmates, but Mrs. Treacher didn't seem to find it amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asking you what you thought of the themes of deception present throughout Hamlet, but I was clearly wasting my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"Sorry, Mrs Treacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mean old witch.' Jackie thought to herself as the lesson resumed. She had been trying to pay attention, but was distracted by the unpleasant dryness of her mouth. She really needed something to drink, and soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mrs. Treacher?\" She asked, coughing a little, \"May I go to the restroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly teacher sighed, overly dramatically in Jackie's opinion. \"Yes Miss Burkhart, as I can see you have no interest in the remainder of my lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie thanked her and hurried out. She bypassed the bathroom and made straight for the water fountain. Normally she thought they were gross, but this was an emergency. She put her lips as close to the faucet as she could bear and pressed the button. Greedily sucking down the icy cold water, Jackie closed her eyes and enjoyed the sensation of quenching her thirst and filling her belly. She kept drinking until the bell rang, startling her and almost causing her to slop water down her front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing a few errant drops off of her sweater, Jackie's eyes widened as she noticed her stomach had filled up quite a bit. It was maybe half as big as it had been last night, but now she didn't even feel full. She ran a hand over the small bulge, a pleasant shiver running through her. But then the halls started filling up with people, and she had to hurry back to class and grab her books. It was Thursday, which meant next class was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Ugh.' Jackie thought, as she walked into the locker room and was greeted with the ever lingering smell of feet. Her locker was in the corner, thankfully, and as she got changed she took a second to examine her bare belly. It was definitely rounder, and she found her tight gym top didn't quite cover it, even if she pulled it down. While dismayed, she also felt a flush of arousal. She looked around guiltily as she pulled on her shorts, but no one was even looking in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assembled girls migrated from the locker room to the basketball courts, and as they did some warm-up stretches Jackie spotted Donna on the far side of the circle. The junior and senior girls had gym class  together, but her so-called best friend was always more interested in actually taking part than hanging out with Jackie on the sidelines. The coach split them up into teams and the games started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was contented to simply stay as far away from the ball as possible,  while she thought about more interesting topics like clothes or shoes. She found it hard to concentrate however, as gradually she felt the same unpleasant thirst returning. She didn't understand it, as her stomach was still swollen with the water she had just drank, a crescent of skin peeking out from under her shirt. So how could she be thirsty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning cry caused Jackie to look up, just in time for the heavy basketball to smack her right on the nose, sending her tumbling to the ground. She lay in a daze, until Donna's sweaty and concerned face appeared in her field of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie could only groan, tentatively checking her face with her hands, wincing as she prodded her nose. Donna and someone else helped her to her feet, and the gym span around her for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinciotti, take her to the nurse, get her a cold compress for that nose.\" barked the coach, before blowing his whistle and telling the rest of them to resume play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie wobbled off the court with Donna supporting her, and the pair made their way to the nurse's office. It was empty, so Donna helped Jackie up on to the examination table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, can I get you anything?\" Donna asked, glancing around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water!\" Jackie croaked immediately, the pain in her nose have been overtaken by her need for something to drink. There was a water cooler in the corner and Donna quickly filled a paper cup and handed it to Jackie. In her haste, the brunette accidentally crumpled the cup, slopping more water down her front than she got in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" She moaned. Donna raised her eyebrows but said nothing, filling another cup and handing it over. This time Jackie was more careful, but the small amount of water was pitiful compared to her thirst. She needed more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna seemed to realise this, and after giving Jackie a third cup she began to look around for a larger container. The first thing she saw was a large jar of cotton balls. After dumping the contents out on to the desk, she filled it with water from the cooler. Jackie took it eagerly, and as Donna watched, drained the whole thing in about three swallows, her cheeks ballooning with each gulp. \"More!\" She gasped, holding out the beaker for Donna to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis repeated three more times, before finally Jackie seemed to have slaked her thirst. She let out a little belch, and let her hands fall to her stomach. It was now slightly bigger than it had been last night, and her tight top had rolled up to just above her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Jackie, what the hell was that?\"<br>\r\nDonna asked, staring at her friend's bloated middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could answer, the school nurse, a heavyset blonde woman,  bustled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what do we have here?\" She asked, striding quickly up to Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, she got hit in the nose.\" Donna mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse grabbed Jackie's nose and wiggled it from side to side, causing Jackie to squeak in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not broken.\" The nurse announced. She turned to Donna. \"You can go back to class now dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna left reluctantly, still staring at Jackie's belly, causing her to self consciously pull her shirt down over it as best she could. The nurse was oblivious, and turned to the cabinet to retrieve a cold compress. \"Would you like some water dearie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stifled a hiccough. \"No, thank you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After letting her sit for a few more minutes, the nurse sent Jackie away with a sympathetic smile and a pamphlet on support services for teenage mothers. She had been too busy focusing on walking with the extra weight around her middle to grasp the meaning behind this, but it clicked as she walked past a window and caught sight of her reflection. She really did look pregnant, and a good few months along at that. Her belly had the same round tautness to it, bulging out from under her shirt and pushing out over the waistband of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh.\" She breathed, placing a hand on her stomach, gently inserting a finger into her belly button, which had deepened considerably. It was impossible, it was like something out of her wildest dreams. Almost without thinking, she began to slide her hand from her stomach down the front of her shorts. Once again the school bell brought her back to her senses, and she cursed before hurrying back towards the gym, placing a bracing hand on her back as she had seen pregnant women do before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Jackie the locker room had already emptied by the time she got there, and she managed to slip inside unnoticed. Without wasting time, she stripped down to her underwear, bundling up her gym clothes and stuffing them back in her locker. She pulled on her pants, and struggled to zip them up underneath her swollen belly. Her paisley blouse was even worse, and she had to leave the last three buttons undone, leaving her very exposed and emphasising her bloated state. Her sweater helped a little, stretching down over her stomach, but still threatening to ride back up with every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming her locker shut, she decided that there was no way she could go back to class. She couldn't let anyone else see her like this, Donna was bad enough. The locker room's back entrance left her close enough to the street, and conveniently close to a hole in the fence. It was a bit more of a squeeze than usual, constricting her water filled stomach in a way that wasn't quite painful, just uncomfortable. She hurried down the streets as stealthily as she could. It was lunchtime, so thankfully the streets of Point Place were largely deserted. She ducked down behind a car when she saw Kitty Forman across the street, but she was in a hurry and didn't even look Jackie's way. As she stood back up, Jackie licked her lips, her feeling of dry mouth already returning. 'Oh come on!' she thought angrily. 'How can I be thirsty again?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she reached her house and let herself in, the thirst was raging once again. Ignoring the fridge, she made straight for the kitchen sink. Without bothering with a glass, she wrapped her lips around the faucet and turned the taps. She let out a moan as the delicious liquid coursed down her throat, straight into her stomach. Pressed against the edge of the sink, she could actually feel her belly growing with each gulp, expanding like a water balloon. She grew more and more excited, and as her swelling gut pushed down her zipper, she took it as an invitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding her fingers inside herself, she knew she was more aroused than she had ever been before, each touch sending shivers of pleasure through her entire body. As the other hand massaged her turgid stomach, she brought herself to the edge of orgasm. Unable to take anymore, she pulled away from the faucet, collapsing back and letting out a squeal as she finally came. She lay back on the cool tiled floor for a few minutes, unsure whether the gurgling sound was coming from the sink or her own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining her body now, she saw the effects of her indulgence. Her belly had gone past pregnant, now looking more like she had swallowed a small beach ball. She struggled to her feet with an audible sloshing sound and , reaching around her stomach, rinsed off her hands, before turning off the taps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that she remembered something, her eyes widening. After a few seconds pause, she called out tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Are you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply, and Jackie noticed that her mom's car keys were missing from the hook by the door. She let out a sigh of relief, but then panicked again. What was she going to do? Someone was going to notice her massive belly eventually. She had to get rid of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Inside the car, Donna gave Eric an exasperated grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offence Eric, but maybe next time we could go somewhere other than Fatsoburger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked sheepish. \"It's the cheapest place in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna leaned in and kissed him. \"Wow. You sure know how to make a girl feel special Forman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric struggled to recover. \"That's not what I... It's just that I can take you out more if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna laughed and opened the car door. \"You're cute. But seriously, if we keep eating there I'm going to end up looking like Big Rhonda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slid out of the car, Eric snuck a look at her midsection. There had always been a little bit of pudge there, but  it did look rounder, pushing her shirt out a little. And was her butt a little bigger too? Or was he just imagining it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wouldn't admit it, but the price of the food wasn't the real reason he kept taking Donna to Fatsoburger. He had always kind of had a thing for bigger women, not just tall, but thick as well. Donna had an amazing body, but recently he had been unable to stop himself imagining her being just a little bigger. A little rounder. A little jigglier... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if he took her to Fatsoburger, bought her a burger and some fries, maybe a milkshake or two, what was the harm in that? He was just being a good boyfriend, especially when he let her finish off his burger and most of his fries as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had walked around the car and leaned down to his open window for a final goodnight kiss, giving him a nice view of her cleavage at the same time. As her nuzzled her neck she whispered in his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free again tomorrow night. But you better come up with a better idea than Fatsoburger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set off for the short journey back to her house, and as he watched her go Eric still couldn't tell if her backside was any bigger. He decided to step it up a notch. Even if she was sick of Fatsoburger, he was sure he could come up with a suitable replacement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She returned her attention to her outfit, biting her lip as she examined herself in the mirror. Had she put on a little weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jeans still buttoned, maybe with a little more effort than usual, but her stomach seemed to be sticking out a bit. She turned her head, but much like her boyfriend she could decide if her ass was any bigger than normal. She shrugged, pulling on a green sweater over her white blouse. Even if she had, it wasn't much. Not a big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan Eric? I hear they opened a new Fatsoburger in Madison.\" Donna teased as they cruised down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled, but kept silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, they turned off on to a side road, and a few minutes after that, a dirt trail. Donna was getting impatient, but Eric was resolute in his silence. She was just about to ask him again when suddenly, they stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Donna asked, glancing at the dashboard lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked at her with a smile. \"Nothing. We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out of the car and Donna followed suit, as he walked around the back of the car. She gasped as she realised they were on the edge of a large cliff. The sun was just about to set, and far below, Point Place was laid out like a map, and in the distance she could just about make out the Madison skyline. There was a thunk behind her, and she looked to see the trunk of the Cruiser had been cleaned out, and filled with sheets and pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Eric.\" she sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down and snuggled up, and Donna rested her head on Eric's shoulder. \"This is perfect.\" she said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Eric reached an arm to the back seat of the car and retrieved two Saran wrapped brownies. He handed one to Donna, who eagerly unwrapped it. \"Okay,\" she amended, taking a big bite of the 'special' confection, \"now it's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so passed. The last rays of the setting sun were just giving way to night as Donna re-buttoned her blouse. She was just pulling her sweater on over her head when her stomach began to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" She grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" Eric asked, raising his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should have gone to Fatsoburger after all.\" She grinned, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need.\" Eric replied, and reached into the backseat, this time pulling out a small picnic basket. He placed it down between them and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Eric Forman, you really do know how to treat a lady.\" Donna said with a smile, choosing a cupcake from the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric said nothing as she took her first bite, a dab of frosting transferring itself to the end of her nose. Her special brownie had been a bit more 'special' than his, made with a strain that Hyde had told him caused a serious case of the munchies. As he watched, Donna devoured the cupcake and grabbed a second, and a third, alternating bites from each one. He quietly began to unpack the rest of the food. Along with the cupcakes there were some cookies, half a pie, and even a can of whipped cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" Donna groaned, suppressing a burp. \"I think we might have overdone it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded sympathetically. He actually hadn't eaten anything, content to merely sit back and watch Donna stuff her face with all if the available treats. It had been difficult to conceal his excitement when she paused to undo the button of her pants before resuming eating the pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now he found it hard to keep his hands off her, her small belly poking out from under her shirt, her underwear visible beneath her open jeans. Eventually she struggled to her feet and they got back into the car. Donna fell asleep almost instantly, and as he drove them home Eric kept sneaking glances at her bloated midsection, imagining the effects all that food was going to have on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he pulled up in front of her house, she woke up, and groggily she walked around the car to give him a goodnight kiss. He could still taste the chocolate on her lips, and as she walked up to her door, her unbuttoned jeans slid down a little, exposing the tops of her butt cheeks. <br>\r\nEric smiled, and began to plan his next move...</span></div></div>",

It was rarely enough they got to hang out there alone, especially since Hyde had moved into the basement, and they were making the best of it. Gilligan's Island had just ended, and Donna sat up and stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of warm in here.\" She remarked, grabbing the remote and switching the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's some ice cream sandwiches in the freezer.\" Eric replied, casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stood up, and made her way over to the freezer. Eric took this time to appreciate the fruits of his hard work. His girlfriend's butt was definitely a bit larger, each cheek quite clearly defined against the tight denim as she bent over to retrieve the frozen snacks. As she turned back around, he got a good glimpse of her profile, much improved in his opinion by the addition of a noticeable potbelly. She sat down and handed him a sandwich, keeping two for herself he noticed happily, and her stomach bulged out over her lap, straining the button of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey settled back down to watch Happy Days, and Eric reflected on his success. In the days after their sunset picnic, Donna had obviously been aware that she had overdone it, and had politely turned down any offer of food or candy. Eric had quickly decided to change his tactics. It wasn't about getting her to eat a lot all at once, it was about eating a little more than usual, a little more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he brought her a candy bar before school, and at lunch, an extra soda and a bag of chips. When they went to the Hub, he'd convince her to have another order of fries, and maybe go for ice-cream afterwards. If they were hanging out at his house, he'd persuade her to try one or two of his mom's cupcakes or brownies, with some nice, whole milk to wash it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, even sooner than he'd hoped, she didn't need convincing or persuading. She didn't even remark on it when Eric turned up with a box of donuts or some cookies 'to share'. She just started eating. The results were really starting to show, and while Eric could only dream of putting her on the scales or breaking out the measuring tape, his was sure that she had put on a good few pounds. Now it was just a question who would notice first, Donna or someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric!\" His mother's voice echoed down the stairs. \"Is Donna staying for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Donna, who nodded eagerly as she swallowed a mouthful of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-es!\" Eric called back up. As she chewed, he slipped his arm around her waist, subtly feeling the added softness, and imagining what Donna would look like in another two weeks. </span></div></div>",

The stupid things must have shrunk, she thought. With a mighty tug, she finally got them on, though she gave herself a painful wedgie in the process. As she rearranged her underwear, she tugged down her red turtleneck, which kept riding up for some reason. She sat down on her bed, accidentally crushing a half-eaten bag of chips, and slipped on her shoes, which thankfully still fitted fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna! Breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  got up and hurried downstairs. In the kitchen, her dad Bob was already eating. Her mom Midge kissed her on the cheek and gave her a plate stacked high with pancakes. Donna sat down and quickly loaded her plate with scrambled eggs and bacon. After adding a knob of butter to her pancakes, she doused the whole plate with a liberal serving of maple syrup. Donna's knife and fork moved rapidly and she cut and speared, shovelling bite after bite into her mouth, revelling in the mixture of sweet and salty flavours. By the time her mom sat down, she had already made an impressive dent in the food. She slowed down a little, but still finished well before her mother, using the last fragment of pancake to mop up the leftover grease and syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Donna sighed as she let her cutlery clatter on to her plate. \"That was great Mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge smiled, a little surprised at the amount of food her daughter had just packed away. \"Don't mention it sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stood up and let out a small burp. Her bloated stomach now caused her turtleneck to ride up even more, exposing the muffin top that oozed out over the waistband of her pants. \"Excuse me.\" she asked, before going to the fridge and taking out the orange juice. As she took a long draught straight from the carton, Midge shot a look a Bob who nodded gravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you sure were hungry this morning sweetheart.\" He said, not sure how to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pursed her lips, looking quizzical. \"No, not really.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob didn't know how to respond to that, and there was a moment's silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway.\" Donna continued, placing the OJ back in the fridge, \"I'm heading over to Eric's, see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped to kiss both her parents on the cheeks and left through the kitchen door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work, Bob!\" Midge said, standing up and beginning to clear the plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault, it's the Pinciotti metabolism. This happens to everyone in my family around Donna's age.\" Bob protested, gnawing on a bacon rind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to let it happen to Donna.\" Midge said firmly, loading the dishwasher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust next door, Donna was entering the Forman's kitchen. Red was reading the paper at the kitchen table, while Kitty was bustling around the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Mr Forman, Mrs Forman.\" Donna said politely as she pulled the glass door closed behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning dear.\" Kitty replied. Red grunted hello without lowering his paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's eyes widened as she smelt fresh baked goods. \"Are those muffins?\" She asked, pointing to the cooling baking tin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was just turning off the oven and removing her apron. \"Oh yes, I was going to being them in to the hospital, but please take one-\" the words died in her throat as she turned and saw that Donna had already taken two, one of which she had already bitten into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, chocolate chip!\" Donna remarked, taking another bite. \"They're really good Mrs. Forman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, thank you dear.\" Kitty said after a pause, followed by her usual nervous laughter. There were a few seconds of silence, the only sound being Donna chewing, before Kitty spoke again. \"Uh, I think Eric is down in the basement dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Donna was more interested in the muffins, but she nodded, swallowing a large mouthful. \"Thanks Mrs. Forman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty watched her go, her eyes drawn to the tightly straining rear of the young woman's trousers, causing her to let out a quiet \"Oh my.\" She turned Red, but he just turned the page of his newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is Kitty, I don't want to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had finished the first muffin in a matter of seconds, and was most of the way through the second by the time she reached the bottom of the basement steps. Hyde, Fez and Kelso were all there, Hyde reading a magazine in the chair nearest the staircase, while Kelso and Fez were sitting on the couch playing Pong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe murmured a greeting through a mouthful of muffin and wandered behind the back of the couch. \"Looks like an epic game. Who's winning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tie right now, but I'm about to make my move.\" Kelso said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreams white boy!\" Fez responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's attention was distracted by the box of Oreos sitting on the table. She sat down in the one remaining chair and grabbed a handful, popping two into her mouth and chewing furiously. She ate about a dozen before Fez noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, my cookies!\" He yelled, outraged, but was immediately interrupted by Kelso's cry of triumph. As the two started bickering, Donna crunched down the last few cookies. She brushed the crumbs off of her front and stood up again. \"Is Eric around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde was the first to respond. \"He just went out looking for you. Hey, cut it out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis elbow had been jostled by the the scrapping pair, and he dropped his magazine. Looking up to aim a pinch at Kelso, he caught his first look at Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\" His eyes widened behind his ever present sunglasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Donna asked, picking a chocolate chip out of her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde legitimately didn't know what to say. \"Uh... Nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna left through the back door, and Hyde sat their stunned for a moment before turning his attention back to the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scrapping pair separated begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see Donna just now?\" Hyde asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw her eating all my cookies.\" Fez said angrily. \"The red haired witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" Kelso said, rubbing his head where Fez had hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Hyde didn't know what to say. \"Nothing man, forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back to what they had been doing, but Hyde found it difficult to concentrate on the article he was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna wandered around the Forman house and ended up back in the driveway. Eric must have gone to her house, she decided, unconsciously attempting to pull her sweater down over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie walked up to Donna, a look of total surprise in her face, her mouth hanging open in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi Jackie.\" Donna replied. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite brunette didn't reply, except for a quiet \"Oh my gosh.\", which she repeated as she circled around Donna and got a look at her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna simply looked bemused at her friend's strange behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Jackie said finally, tearing her eyes away from Donna's bulging midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna laughed. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie hesitated. No woman liked to hear it, but Donna had done it for her when she had started overeating, and so she wanted to return the favour. \"Well, you've kind of, um, put on a little weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna almost laughed again, until she saw the serious look on Jackie's face. \"Well, maybe a little,\" she admitted defensively, \"But only a few pounds. Its not a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie privately reckoned it was more like fifteen pounds, but tried to be gentle. \"Maybe, but if you're not careful a few pounds can turn into a few more, and then a few more, and then you get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, perhaps subconsciously aware that her friend was right, lashed out angrily. \"You know Jackie, every woman can't be skinny and flat chested like you. Don't be jealous of my figure just because you have a body like a ten year old boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie actually took a step back, surprised by the viciousness of Donna's words, but quickly shot back. \"Well, well, don't blame me when you blow up like a Thanksgiving Day parade float, you big, fat lumberjack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Jackie stalked away, leaving Donna standing there in a huff. What was that girl's problem?<br>\r\nIt must have been jealousy, there was no way she was getting fat. Was there? The thought lingered uneasily in her mind, until she was thankfully distracted by the arrival of Eric in the Vista Cruiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Donna, I was just out getting some donuts\" He said, rolling down the window. The redhead went around and sat in the passenger seat, and Eric handed her the pink box of frosted and creme-filled pastries. As she ate, she told Eric about her fight with Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then she said I was fat, can you believe that?\" Donna said, licking some jelly off of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe she would say that.\" Eric said carefully, handing his girlfriend another donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Donna said incredulously, her voice muffled as she ate. They sat in silence for a minute or two as Donna finished of the last three donuts, before slinging the empty box into the backseat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm starving, can we go get something to eat?\" She said after a moment, reaching up to grab her seatbelt, which she buckled securely over her already bloated potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled as he turned the key in the ignition. \"Sure. Fatsoburger?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We've got to do something Bob!\" Midge said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob sat on the couch, looking uncomfortable. \"Gee, Midge, I don't know if that's such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge shook her head. \"We have to talk to her, especially after what happened last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, the Pinciotti's had been hosting a party. They had gone into the kitchen to get the hors d'oeuvres, only to find Donna slumped over the breakfast table, having eaten enough  cocktail weenies, potato chips and profiteroles for twenty five people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was still reluctant to bring up the issue with Donna, but Midge had had enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you won't talk to her, I'll just have to do it myself.\" she asserted, leaving her husband to his hesitation and striding upstairs, her large breasts jiggling under her sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the bedroom door, at the same time calling out. \"Donna! I need to speak with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second!\" came the reply, Donna's voice muffled by the door and by the sound of it, some food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge waited for a few seconds, but her righteous indignation prevented her from being overly patient. She opened the door and was greeted by the sight of her growing daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last few weeks Donna's expansion had continued, her near constant eating causing the weight to pile on. Her stomach had grown significantly, straddling the line between potbelly and paunch, jutting out over her crotch, though not quite sagging down yet, and supported on either side by generous love handles.<br>\r\nHer breasts had also grown, moving up a full cup size and forcing her to borrow her mother's specially reinforced bras, which enhanced her already impressive assets. <br>\r\nHer lower body hadn't been spared, her butt and hips continuing to flare out, matched by her steadily thickening thighs which were just beginning to rub together. Her bigger ass meant even her largest pair of underpants were very uncomfortable, so she had taken to simply going without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was wearing a tight red t-shirt that only covered her boobs and amount half of her stomach, leaving a large expanse of creamy pink flesh on display. Her fringed leather vest was similarly inadequate, only emphasising her recent weight gain. She had out grown her last pair of bell bottoms a week ago, actually splitting the seams as she bent down to pick up an errant cookie, and for the last few days she had been relying on an old pair of stretched out dungarees. She had just been pulling these on when the  knock had come at the door, and just finished squeezing them up over her buttocks when her mother barged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez mom,\" She wheezed, having swallowed a large chunk of chocolate in surprise, \"What's the emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge paused, partially out of shock at the sight of her daughter, partially out of sympathy. What was the sternest but nicest way she could deal with her out of control eating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Donna, it just that...\" Midge paused again, but was emboldened as Donna took the pause as an opportunity to take another bite of her candy bar. \"I... Well, your father and I... We think that you have... Well, the fact is, you have been, well... and its not good for a girl your age, or any girl, or anyone, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna interrupted the stream of babble. \"Mom? What are you trying to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge took a deep breath, looking her daughter in the eye. \"Sweetie, you've gotten fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna didn't respond for a second, then two seconds, then ten seconds. She didn't say a word, and her only movement was the slow working of her jaw as she chewed. Then suddenly she seemed to come back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable,\" she began, placing her hands on her pudgy hips, \"First Jackie, and now you. You know what mom, your obsession with this outdated standard of beauty is worse than shallow, it's practically anti-feminist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge was surprised by the vehemence of her daughter's response. She didn't think she was being anti-feminist, she tried to be as feminist as possible, though she admitted Donna knew more about that kind of thing. Every other day she taught her about how something she did was playing straight into the hands of the patriarchy. Maybe she was right about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had already continued on. \"Just because I might have put on a few pounds doesn't mean I'm any less of a woman, or any less of a human being.\" (She knew she had gained some weight, she had even stepped on the scales, but had been unable to see the readout with her breasts blocking her view. She figured it was around five pounds, ten tops) \"Just because I'm not a perfect Barbie doll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had more to say, but her speech had already winded her, her slightly chubbier cheeks glowing red with a combination of anger and exertion. Luckily her mom seemed to have got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dear,\" Midge said, \"I didn't realise I was being anti-feminist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded her acceptance of the apology, allowing herself to sink down on to her bed, the springs creaking underneath her. She was pretty spent, but Midge was curious now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should all feminists, um, put on a few pounds?\" She asked, biting her lip in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna wanted to say that all women should to be free to put on however many pounds they wanted, but instead just nodded, focusing her energy on locating her candy bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge smiled, believing she now understood what her daughter was doing. She walked over and kissed her daughter on the cheek, before turning around and leaving the bedroom. As she started downstairs, she wondered how fat she'd have to get to dismantle the whole patriarchy. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that evening, Donna and Eric were making out in the latter's bedroom, taking advantage of the fact that Red and Kitty had gone out for the evening. As they kissed, Eric made a 'hands on' examination of his girlfriend's progress. Donna was softer everywhere, and in many places she had gone beyond softness to full-on plumpness. Her breasts, her belly, her butt, her arms her legs, even her face was rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to her boyfriend's mental checklist, Donna paused to push her long red hair out of her face, before sitting back to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe my mom? She tries to assert herself as a modern woman, but sometimes she just falls back into these old fashioned ideals of gender and superficiality.\" She said, having already told Eric about the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Eric murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, she's trying her best, but seriously. Telling me I'm getting fat just because I had seconds at breakfast?\" she asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shrugged and rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I only had seconds because there was French toast. Mmm, it was so good...\" Donna licked her lips, lost in delicious memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm hmm, mmm hmm.\" Eric nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was limited to such non-verbal responses due to the fact that Donna had been straddling him as they made out, and was currently resting her entire weight on his stomach, making it difficult to breathe, let alone speak. Despite this, it was not a situation he found entirely unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of breakfast had obviously awoken Donna's appetite, and Eric could actually feel the vibration as her stomach growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm starving. Let's go get some food, there's that late night diner out by the freeway.\" she said eagerly. \"I'm really in the mood for some cheese fries. And a tuna melt. And a chocolate milkshake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric frowned, struggling to pull himself up into a sitting position, pinned beneath Donna's thick thighs. Eventually he managed it, and tried to sound casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, actually, I thought we could just hang out here tonight, you know, uh, just chill, or...\" Eric stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked surprised, but rationally could find no reason to object to Eric's suggestion. \"Oh, yeah, cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled weakly. In reality he would have loved nothing better than to take her out and let her eat as much as wanted. Unfortunately, he just couldn't afford it, Donna's new appetite having exhausted the limits of his meagre PriceMart paycheque. Meals, snacks, gas money, it all added up, and he had spent his last few bucks on the extra-large pizza they had for dinner. He would get paid tomorrow, but right now, he was broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both tried to act cool, but the mood had changed a little. Donna awkwardly repositioned herself, folding her legs underneath herself, the bed springs creaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, so, do you have any...?\" She raised her eyebrows suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! Yes.\" Eric replied, hopping up from the bed and going to his dresser. He pulled open the top drawer and removed the layer of clothes, but there was nothing there. He doubled checked, his fingers scrabbling across the bare wood, but his stash was definitely gone. There was only one possible culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie.\" He muttered. His older sister had recently returned from college once again, claiming it was a study week, but all she'd studied so far was her nails, the TV, and various magazines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Donna asked, unsuccessfully adjusting her shirt for the umpteenth time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute.\" Eric told her, before striding out of his bedroom and hammering on the door directly across the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, open up! I know you have my...\" He began, before trying the handle and finding the door was unlocked. He opened it, but the room was empty. However, there was a stick of incense burning on Laurie's bedside table and the window was wide open, a clear sign she had been smoking. He heard a noise from downstairs, and suddenly remembered that the remainder of the 'special' strain had been in that bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurried down to the kitchen, ignoring Donna's inquiries as to what was going on. Pushing the door open just enough to peek inside, he caught sight of Laurie sitting at the kitchen table. Surrounding her was the debris of a large improvised meal, composed of whatever she could find in the fridge. The leftover casserole from last night's dinner, a hefty block of Swiss cheese, even a bowl of cake batter had been completely scraped clean. As he watched, she washed the last of the cheese down with a large swig from a carton of milk, before letting out an impressive belch. She pushed her chair back from the table, revealing her bloated belly, looking like a bowling ball underneath her tight blue t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh.\" Laurie groaned, massaging her stomach pathetically. \"So... full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grinned as he let the door close silently. That would teach her to steal from his stash. He turned and almost yelled out as he bumped into Donna's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" She asked quizzically, a little amused at his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric paused. \"Uh, nothing. You know, on second thoughts, let's go to that diner, I'm getting kind of hungry. Why don't you go around the front and I'll meet you at the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and did as he suggested allowing him to admire the slight waddle in her step as she did so. Once the front door closed, he sprinted back upstairs to Laurie's room and located her purse. He grabbed ten dollars, deliberated for a second and then took another five. Maybe they would drop by the donut shop after the diner.</span></div></div>",

Inside the house however, Jackie was wrestling with a much more difficult problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in her bedroom, wearing just her socks, underpants, and a t-shirt that left most of her midriff exposed. She was examining herself in the mirror, and for once she wasn't happy with what she saw. Her flat stomach, toned legs, cute little butt, pert round breasts... They just didn't seem to be gaining her any attention from the guys anymore. It was like they were obsessed with Donna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beyond Jackie's comprehension. It seemed like the more weight Donna gained, the more they all lusted after her. Eric was the worst offender, obviously, he was practically forcing food down her throat half the time, but Hyde, Fez and Michael were constantly leering at her when she wasn't looking. Okay, so her boobs were getting bigger by the day, along with her butt, and it didn't help that she was practically bursting out of her clothes half the time. Sometimes, even Jackie couldn't help but stare at the redhead's enormous cleavage. But even taking Donna's tits and ass into account, she didn't see how the guys could overlook her considerable belly, thickened thighs and flabby arms. Could it be possible that they all just... liked fat chicks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Eric being the notable exception, none of the guys were really that attracted to larger ladies. What Jackie mistook for lewd obsession was really just curious fascination, watching as the once shapely Donna grew rounder and rounder. Sure they appreciated her expanding assets, but none of them would claim that she was more attractive now than she had been before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie didn't know that of course, and after running her hands over her svelte body one last time, she made her decision. If the guys thought Donna was hot, wait until they saw how fat she was going to get. With that in mind, she knelt down and took a deep sniff of the chocolate cake that had been sitting on her bed as she deliberated. Licking her lips, she grabbed a chunk of cake and shoved it into her mouth, chewing furiously. She swallowed and grabbed another handful, and another, and another. Soon she had devoured the entire cake, save for the myriad crumbs and smears of icing that covered her face and hands. She groaned as her stomach reacted to her sudden bout of gluttony, sending spikes of pain shooting through her bloated belly. Still, it would all be worth it when she was the center of attention once again. she crawled into bed, imagining the food she had just consumed was already turning into fat, widening her rear and swelling her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a cheery honk of the horn, the Pinciotti's car turned out of their driveway and zoomed down the street. Eric stood waving until it was out of sight before quickly turning and hurrying back towards his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just seen off Donna and her mother, who were heading to Madison to go shopping. Donna was in desperate need of new clothes, her expanded figure having burst out of her largest pair of pants that morning as she gorged on a breakfast of bacon and eggs. Eric was sorry to have missed it, but the sight of his girlfriend reduced to wearing her father's sweatpants had been strangely alluring. He had been worried that the situation would cause her to finally realise the extent of her weight gain, but as she kissed him goodbye all she could talk about were all the great restaurants in Madison that she wanted to go to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Donna was settled into the front seat munching on a bag on pork rinds, Midge had pulled him in for a hug, always a pleasant experience due to her enormous sweater melons. But as he gave her a quick squeeze, he couldn't help but notice she seemed to be a little thicker around the middle, and a quick glance down over her shoulder revealed that her ass was bigger too. He immediately had taken a step back to make sure she didn't notice his own sudden expansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was walking as quickly as his tight pants would allow, planning to sneak up to Laurie's room and borrow some of her hand lotion, his head filled with images of Midge and Donna gorging on the finest and most fattening foods that Madison had to offer, popping buttons and bursting seams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so caught up in this fantasy that he almost didn't notice Jackie standing in the Foreman family kitchen. Once he did however, he could hardly believe his eyes. If Donna was now officially fat, and her mom was getting pudgy, Jackie was somewhere in between. She was leaning on the kitchen counter, brazenly working her way through the cupcakes that Kitty had prepared for the church bake sale. Her belly was large and round, poking out from under her t-shirt and actually resting on the kitchen counter. Her slightly hunched posture only accentuated the curve of her ass, which stuck out prominently behind her, her panty line clearly visible through the straining material. Aside from these new additions, her figure appeared to be unchanged, her face and arms betraying no hint of weight gain, her thighs maybe a small but thicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had been pretty hot and bothered before he entered the kitchen, and now he was pretty sure his nose would be bleeding, if most of his blood wasn't occupied elsewhere. A good thirty seconds had passed since he entered the kitchen, and another twenty elapsed before Jackie noticed him, looking over as she sucked frosting off of her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Eric.\" She said, casually rubbing her bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just about managed to stammer out a hello, while unsuccessfully attempting to stop himself from staring at her. He was just so surprised, how had she gotten so big, so fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Eric didn't know was that over the past two weeks Jackie had dedicated herself to getting fat, barely leaving the house and eating at every possible opportunity. She would empty the entire fridge, sleep until she had recovered, and then begin again. If their housekeeper noticed the fridge needed restocking everyday, she didn't complain, probably because she always pocketed an extra twenty dollars every time she went to the grocery store. Nothing was safe from Jackie's newfound dedication to weight gain, not raw cookie dough, not packages of deli meat, not even entire sticks of butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far her gain had been limited to her ass and her belly, but she viewed every pound and every inch as a personal victory. The way she saw it, Donna had a big head-start, and it would take a lot of hard work before Jackie could challenge her as the object of the guys' desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the look on Eric's face, her hard work was paying off. She turned, giving him a better view of her hefty gut. She suppressed a smile at his blatant desire, and decided to have a little fun, artfully arranging her face into a sad pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know Eric, you don't have to say it. I know how fat I've gotten!\" She said, sounding upset, grabbing her belly with both hands and shaking it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No...\" Eric said emotionlessly, somewhat hypnotised by her jiggling flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's true.\" She said dramatically, taking a few steps towards him. \"I just can't stop eating, and eating, and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric suddenly broke away, dodging around her and making a beeline for the kitchen door. \"Um, sorry Jackie, I have to, unh, I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the door swinging behind him, and she could her the muffled thuds as he ran upstairs, followed by the sound of a door closing and the almost imperceptible click of a lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled, returning to the counter and picking up the last remaining cupcake. That was more like it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that same day, after a filling lunch consisting of a dish of lasagne and an entire apple pie that was supposed to be that evening's dinner, Jackie made her way back to the Forman residence. She went straight down the back stairs to the basement, just in case Kitty was looking for whoever ate her cupcakes. Inside, Kelso and Fez were watching TV, an old episode of that dorky Batman show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that Julie Newmar is so hot.\" Kelso said over the cheesy dialogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please.\" Fez replied, gesturing for him to be quiet. \"Everyone knows Eartha Kitt is the superior Catwoman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't noticed she was there, so she took a moment to choose a sexy pose, leaning against the small shelving unit that housed Eric's record collection, sticking her belly out in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" She said breathily, twirling a finger through her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked over their shoulders to where she was standing.  Their eyes widened, and their mouths dropped open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dios mio.\" Fez murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Jackie, what happened to you!?\" Kelso asked, standing up to get a better look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was a little confused. They didn't seem as appreciative as Eric had been. \"Um, well, I just put on a little weight...\" She began, still trying to sound sexy, but Kelso interrupted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say! It looks like you ate a basketball, and then another basketball, except that one was made out of cheese!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was actually worried now. \"But, don't you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meant to ask if they liked it, but trailed off. It was pretty clear from their faces that they were bemused rather than aroused. Suddenly she blushed, attempting to pull her t-shirt down over her rotund gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, screw you Michael Kelso!\" She screamed, turning and rushing back out the door, slamming it behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Kelso said in amazement, sitting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Fez nodded. \"And did you see the size of her ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside in the cool evening air, Jackie was taking deep breaths, trying to calm down. So what if those idiots didn't think she was hot? She thought she was hot. In fact she knew she was hot. She ran her hands over her belly, sending them down across her hips to her buttocks. She never would have guessed it before all this, but the bigger she got, the sexier she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up at Eric's window. If he was the only guy who shared her opinions, then maybe she would just have to see about making him her boyfriend. Donna might be bigger, but she was better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If Eric had known that Jackie was planning to steal him away from Donna, he would have said it was never going to happen, especially based on what was happening right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had gone over to Donna's house just after dinner. These days, it was much easier for him to creep in than it was for Donna to slip out. The last time she had tried to sneak up to Eric's room she had been distracted by the fridge, which was where Red found her twenty minutes later, gnawing on a turkey leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling him about her day in Madison interspersed with a little fooling around, she had agreed to model her new clothes for him. After disappearing into the bathroom with a bunch of shopping bags, she emerged ten minutes later, showing off her new red jacket and bell bottoms. It was strange seeing her in clothes that actually fit, even if they were three times the size of her old ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric lay back on the bed, she had taken off her jacket to reveal her new blouse, and underneath that was a new t-shirt. Now she was down to just her underwear, a lacy black affair separated by the vast expanse of her stomach. He thrilled at the idea of the sales assistant taking her measurements, hands brushing against her body as the tape was pulled tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, were you a good boy while I was away in the big city?\" Donna asked, reaching back to undo her clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second Eric thought about the sight of Jackie and the cupcakes, but quickly nodded, and was rewarded with the click of the clasp. The bra fell away, and Donna took her bountiful breasts in her hands, hefting them up and squeezing them playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you a lucky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Eric wasn't as lucky as Donna thought, because at that very moment there was a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, honey, do you have my bags in there?\" Midge asked, already beginning to turn the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm getting changed!\" Donna said loudly, but her mom just scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Donna, it's nothing I haven't seen before.\" She said, entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Eric had been in motion the second that he heard the knock, and Donna's large frame was in the perfect position to block him from Midge's view as he scrambled under the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another advantage of him coming to her room, as he doubted Donna could fit under his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, Midge didn't appear the least bit phased by her daughter's near nakedness. She herself was wearing just a fluffy white bathrobe, fresh from the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and your father picked up a cheesecake on the way home from work, if you want to have a slice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew that Donna would want more than just one slice, and without missing a beat she grabbed her t-shirt off the floor and pulled it over her head. She hurried out the door, her appetite winning out over leaving her boyfriend trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Donna had gone, Midge began to look through the shopping bags that dotted the room, and Eric held his breath as she moved closer and closer to the bed. Thankfully she must have found what she was looking for, because she picked up a bag and turned back towards the door. He was about to let out a sigh of relief when suddenly her bathrobe dropped to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a second to realise what was going on, but when he did Eric couldn't resist taking a peek. Sliding silently and craning his neck, he moved forward just enough to get a clear view of Midge's naked body. She had her back to him, but he could tell she had definitely gained weight, at least fifteen pounds, most of it settling in her lower half. Her thighs were thick, on the verge of rubbing together, and her hips had widened quite a bit, combining with her enormous tits to give her an almost perfect hourglass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrops of moisture still clung to her creamy skin as she bent down and stepped in to the panties she had just removed from the bag. The white silk slid easily up her legs, covering her plump behind, the high waistband coming up just below her belly burton. She turned slightly, giving Eric just a glimpse of her bombshell breasts, tipped with pointy pink nipples that were almost  identical to Donna's, before they were covered by her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was practically drooling as she finished adjusting the straps, and had to quickly pull his head back out of sight when she turned towards the bed. But she was merely retrieving her bathrobe, and she slid back into it and tied the belt just as the door opened and Donna re-entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight honey.\" Midge said cheerfully, slipping past her daughter with a peck on the cheek. Donna shut the door behind her, and turned back to find Eric standing right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" Donna began, but was interrupted by Eric grabbing her and kissing her forcefully. She still tasted like the cheesecake she had no doubt just demolished, but Eric wasted little time, spinning her around and pushing her down on to the bed, the springs creaking in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and tugged her t-shirt up over her head, revealing her own ample bosom. Eric clambered on top of her and buried his face between them, causing her to let out a moan of   pleasure. For a moment, he imagined that it was Midge's voluptuous form underneath him, her nipples hardening under her touch, her hands at his fly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric strolled through the kitchen and pulled open the fridge. Donna was down in the basement, and she had expressed an urge for chocolate pudding. He was just grabbing a twelve pack when Kitty called his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the living room to find his mother standing next to a suitcase. \"Eric, sweetie, could you bring Laurie's bag up to her room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, did they finally kick her out of college?\" He asked with a wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty smiled, but quickly turned it into a worried frown. Eric laughed and grabbed the bag, which was heavier than he expected. He half carried, half dragged it upstairs, reaching Laurie's room and catching his breath before knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Laurie said, her voice slightly muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pushed the door open and lifted the bag inside. Laurie was lounging in the bed, reading a magazine, not even looking up. He was about to turn around and leave when he noticed something. Something... intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was getting fat! In place of her flat stomach, she had sprouted a rounded beer belly that was straining her t-shirt. She was wearing sweat pants instead of her usual jeans, no doubt to accommodate her broader hips and thickened thighs. Eric stared in amazement, noticing the large bag of potato chips she was currently munching her way through, crumbs collecting in her cleavage, which had also experienced a little growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up over her magazine. \"What do you want, a tip?\" She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric backed out of the room, stumbling over the suitcase, and pulled the door closed. Out in the hall, he spent a few shell-shocked seconds with images of Laurie's expanded figure flashing through his mind, before slapping himself. This was his sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he might have gotten his head straight, certain other parts of his body seemed willing to overlook this issue, and it took a minute or two of thinking about baseball before he was able to head back downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the night Laurie got into his special stash. It must have had more of an effect on her than he had realised. There had definitely been some residual effects...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering this, he made it all the way to the basement and sat down on the couch, two thirds of which was occupied by Donna's ass. His girlfriend looked at him expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Eric? What are you doing?\" She asked, touching his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Nothing!\" Eric yelped, having allowed his mind to drift back to the sight of his sister's crumb-filled cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said there was pudding?\" Donna reminded him, rubbing her belly unconsciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded and jumped back to his feet. As he pounded up the basement stairs, he half-wondered if he should leave a few pudding cups for Laurie...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Down in the basement, Eric was sitting on the couch, trying as hard as possible to focus on the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive feet to his right, Laurie was doing her laundry, and aside from her underwear was wearing nothing but a red sweatshirt and a pair of white cotton socks. Normally the sweater would have reached halfway down to her knees, but the extra poundage around her middle meant it barely covered her butt. Every time she reached up to grab some detergent or bent down to grab some clothes, Eric got a good look at her ass, the fabric of her panties almost completely engulfed between her expanded butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter averting his gaze for the twentieth time, he heard Laurie let out a grunt of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, if this stupid dryer shrinks anymore of my clothes, I'm gonna...\" She growled, thumping the side of the appliance. She was completely in denial about her weight gain, even more so than Donna, which meant she was constantly walking around the house in clothes that barely fit, much to Eric's discomfort. It was all he could do not to stare as she pigged out at every family meal. The previous evening she had burst the buttons on her blouse as she scarfed down a third helping of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie bent down one last time to pick up the laundry basket, and Eric stole one last glance, hating himself as he did so. She stomped her way upstairs and Eric let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and turned off the TV. He was taking Donna out to dinner in a little while, and hopefully that would take his mind off... other things. He sat back down and closed his eyes, debating where to bring Donna. She had recently been favouring the Dairy Queen out by the community college, but Fatso Burger was half the price, and twice as fattening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was coming to a decision, the basement door swung open and Jackie waddled in, clutching a large paper bag emblazoned with the Fatso Burger logo. She was walking awkwardly due to her enormous belly, which was swollen to an almost unbelievable size. Eric watched in amazement as she shuffled over to the couch, before collapsing next to him. The couch would have creaked in protest if Donna hadn't already broken most of the springs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Eric...\" She panted, before letting out a belch. \"I'm so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were glued to her bloated midsection, her t-shirt having ridden up all the way to her bulging breasts. He had never seen anything like it, not even Donna's belly had ever been this round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, please, would you...\" Jackie looked at him, her eyes watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed no more invitation, and tentatively placed his hands on her turgid belly. She immediately let out a moan, which grew lower and louder and he pressed down. He began to massage her, his fingers working quickly and firmly. He played lightly with her cavernous navel, astounded at how far he could get his finger inside. Jackie continued to groan as he worked his way down, following the curve of her belly until he could feel the downy softness of her thatch. He could hardly believe the heat he felt coming off of her, until he felt her own hand on his thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her face, but she still had her head thrown back, alternating between belches and moans. She was creeping her hand further and further up his leg, and it was only when she brushed his crotch that he finally forced himself back,  falling off the couch as he scrambled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at him with disappointment in her eyes, his own expression a mixture of desire and confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Eric?\" She asked coldly. \"I thought you liked big girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't find any words, his usual quick wit having abandoned him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna's my girlfriend, I would never...\" He finally began. \"I would never do to anything to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie had heard enough, and with surprisingly little effort clambered to her feet. Her beach ball of a belly sagged down only slightly, and she rubbed it gently with both hands. Her previous discomfort seemed to have passed, if it had ever existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you ever do want to do anything...\" She told him, putting extra emphasis on the 'anything', \"You know where to find me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered out, her chunky backside wiggling from side to side. When the door finally slammed shut, Eric once more collapsed back, resting his head against the cool cement floor. His entire adolescent life he had fantasised about a harem of plus-sized beauties, and now, impossibly, his dreams seemed to be coming true. Except his fantasies had never made him feel so guilty... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they kissed, Eric played with his girlfriend's flab, squeezing the small roll which had recently formed between her belly and breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he nuzzled her neck, Donna slid her hands down and began to unzip his pants. He shifted slightly to give her better access, and suddenly they were both tumbling on to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It had always been a narrow bed, and as Donna grew bigger it had become more and more difficult to do it comfortably in the small space available. Having sex required a decent amount of balance, which Eric had inadvertently upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a long way down, and Donna's extra padding meant she hardly felt anything, but she still hit the floor with an impressive thump. <br>\r\nEric landed on top of her, and spent a pleasant moment with his face literally buried in Donna's cleavage before she pushed him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna started laughing, but Eric shushed her. Kitty and Red had been in the kitchen when they snuck in, and as he strained his ears he heard the sounds of someone making their way upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Donna whispered, before turning over and attempting to hide under the bed. Eric knew that particularly strategy wasn't going to work, and tried to think of a plan. He was still thinking twenty seconds later when there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric? Dad says keep it down or else.\" Laurie told him through the door, sounding bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay!\" He yelled in response, praying she wouldn't try and come in. Donna had so far only succeeded at fitting her head and shoulders under the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply, and after a few seconds Eric let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich turned out to be a little premature. Donna emerged with a look of disgust on her face, and a stack of magazines in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, what the hell are these?\" She slung the magazines towards him, and they spread out almost neatly in front of where he was kneeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach publication had a title like 'Big and Bouncy' or 'Plumpers', and the covers all featured voluptuous women in various states of undress. <br>\r\nWhile their expressions ranged from sultry to innocent, Donna's was one of pure outrage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, these are just, uh, well...\" Eric stammered, drawing a complete blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you like? Do you think this is sexy?\" Donna asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Eric said quietly, seeing no point in trying to lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna got to her feet. \"So what, were you going to fatten me up until I looked like one of these girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked up at his girlfriend, who was already as big, if not bigger than most of the models in the magazines strewn around her feet. With her tits, belly and especially her magnificent ass, she could have been a centerfold in any one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, I...\" Eric wanted to come clean, but he just didn't know where to start. If Donna truly realised how fat she had gotten under his influence, would she ever forgive him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it!\" She snarled, grabbing her shirt and heading out the door without pausing to put it on. He winced as she stomped down the stairs, and again as he heard the front door slam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Donna was wrestling with a variety of emotions as she walked home. As her bare flesh goose pimpled in the cool night air, she felt her anger being replaced by confusion. She knew she had gained a little weight recently, maybe more than a little. Did Eric have something to do with it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so busy considering this that she rang her doorbell without a second thought. Thankfully Midge was the one who answered the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna? Do you know you're not wearing a shirt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at her mother, who she now noticed had put on a few pounds herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... Am I fat?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Laurie and Eric were sitting opposite each other at the breakfast table, while Kitty finished cleaning the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was staring despondently at his breakfast, causing Kitty to pat him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay sweetie? You hardly touched your waffles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been two days since Eric had last seen Donna, and he was worried. He would have gone over to her house, but he just didn't know what kind of reception he would get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just not very hungry.\" He told her, pushing his plate to the centre of the table. Laurie immediately grabbed it and pulled it towards her, digging in eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric quickly looked away. Laurie's low cut nightshirt and continuing refusal to wear a bra to the breakfast table were distracting enough when she wasn't stuffing herself with food. She had already finished two helpings of waffles, along with half a dozen scrambled eggs and a side of bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the waffles in record time, washing them down with a long draught of orange juice before letting out a satisfied belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked at her daughter with undisguised distaste. \"Um, Laurie honey, you have some syrup on your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked down and dabbed the fleck of syrup from her cleavage, before sucking her finger clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any more bacon?\" She asked sweetly, wiping her hand on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kitty could lie and tell her there wasn't, Hyde slouched into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mail's here.\" He announced, waving a small stack of letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie's expression instantly changed to one of fear, and she gripped the table as Hyde flipped through the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, bill, bill...\" He muttered, before looking up and smiling at Laurie. \"Oh, here's something interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed back her chair, ready to jump to her feet and grab the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A letter for... Forman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie and Eric both looked surprised as Hyde handed him the envelope, before sitting down between them and grabbing a slice of toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric opened the letter as Laurie eyed Hyde suspiciously. Inside was a slip of paper, and what looked like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's eyes widened when he realised what he was looking at. It was a photo of Jackie, completely naked. Her pendulous belly was sagging down in front of her crotch, and she was covering her nipples with her hands, but it was still enough to bring him to full attention. It was a few seconds before he looked up at her face, to see she was staring straight at the camera, one eyebrow raised coquettishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric suddenly remembered where he was and quickly slipped the photo back into the envelope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I have to... go.\" He said, jumping up from the table and walking quickly out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty frowned, but she actually did have to go. She grabbed her bag and <br>\r\nhurried out, leaving Laurie and Hyde alone in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder until she was sure her mother was gone, Laurie returned her attention to Hyde.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No letters for me Hyde?\" She asked, trying to sound casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued buttering his slice of toast, then paused as if something had just occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, there was a rather chunky envelope from the University of Wisconsin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resumed buttering his toast, but Laurie grabbed his wrist. \"Where is it? Give it to me now you little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde didn't react. \"Don't worry Laurie, I'm sure it will turn up. Maybe Kitty will find it. Or Red...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie sighed, knowing she was beaten. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a bite of his toast. \"Just a few favours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie frowned. \"Fine, but just hand stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde grimaced. \"Not those kind of favours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Laurie asked, leaning towards him and pushing her chest forward, though it was her bloated belly that bumped against him first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde was unmoved. \"I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he took his toast and left, telling her he'd catch up with her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was outraged. First Hyde blackmailed her, then he completely rejected her. She'd have to get back at him somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could do anything, she needed to get that letter. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Laurie was trying to think of a plan, Jackie was just finishing her own breakfast. Ten rich, buttery croissants with various jellies and jams, washed down with a gallon of creamy whole milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her belly, imagining it growing even bigger. Last time she stepped on the scale, she had gained ten pounds, and that had been three days ago. Judging by the way her panties were bunching and cutting into her thighs, she had definitely gained a few more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what Eric was making of the photo she had sent him. She had taken a few, from a few different angles, before deciding on the one she thought was the most enticing. She had included a written message, telling him that if he wanted a closer look, her parents would be gone all weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was up to Eric, Jackie thought, confident that he wouldn't be able to resist. She was just scraping the last of the strawberry jam out of the jar with her fingers when the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost dropped the jar in surprise. Her parents had left early that morning, and the housekeeper had the day off. There was only one person she was expecting, but she hadn't thought he'd come over straight away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she licked her fingers clean and got to her feet. After rinsing her sticky hands in the sink, she checked her reflection in the shiny surface of the toaster. Her hair was a little messy, and her pyjama top, the buttons straining around her belly, was spotted with jelly and butter. <br>\r\nShe had been planning to dress up a little, maybe borrow one of her mother's teddies, but if Eric was eager enough to come over at ten o'clock in the morning, she supposed he wouldn't mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang again, and with a satisfied smile Jackie made her way to the front door. She undid the top two buttons of her shirt, showing off her slightly increased cleavage, and opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Hey Donna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause. The two young women hadn't actually spoken to each other since the argument in the Formans' driveway, over a month ago. They had both grown a lot since then, physically if not emotionally. As fat as Jackie had gotten, she was barely even half the size of the rotund redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come in?\" Donna asked, after another few seconds had passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie hesitated, but stood to one side. As Donna lumbered past her, Jackie took the opportunity to get a closer look at her ass, jiggling with each step beneath her tight grey sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Jackie invited her to take a seat, though it was a struggle for her to balance her enormous rear on the narrow chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a drink, or some food?\" Jackie asked, resorting to manners to navigate through  the awkwardness. At the mention of the word 'food', Donna's belly let out a audible rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Thank you.\" She said, cheeks tinged with red <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute passed before Jackie grew impatient enough to break the silence. \"So, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that was all the invitation Donna needed to tell Jackie everything that had happened.<br>\r\nShe told her about finding the magazines, and her suspicions about Eric, and admitted that Jackie had been right all along. She had stepped on the scale yesterday morning and had almost fainted when she saw the dial whiz up past 150, past 200, past 250... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally settled on 263 pounds, Donna still hadn't believed it. It was only when she stripped down in front of the full-length mirror that she finally comprehended the scale of her weight gain. If Eric had something to do with it, if he had secretly tried to fatten her up, then she didn't think she could forgive him. Then again, she could hardly lay all the blame on him, he had never tied her down and force-fed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was somewhat discomfited by these revelations. Over the last few weeks she had come to think of Donna as her rival for Eric's affections, making it easier to scheme against her, but here she was seeking sympathy and advice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think I should do?\" Donna said, shifting slightly in the creaking chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was conflicted. If Donna had truly been as oblivious to her weight gain as she said she was, then maybe she should break up with Eric. But if Jackie told her to do it, was it just so she could have Eric all to herself?<br>\r\nShe needed more time to figure this out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want something to eat? There's pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, as if on cue, Donna's stomach let out a grumble. She shook her head firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I really can't. I'm trying to... well... lose weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was a little impressed by her willpower, but she still needed to distract her. \"Well, you don't mind if I have some, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Donna could answer she turned and pulled open the fridge. She removed the pie, along with a can of whipped cream. She placed it down on the counter and cut a large, before spraying it liberally with cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Donna, who was watching her closely, she picked it up and took a bite, chewing luxuriously and letting out a satisfied murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... apple pie?\" Donna asked, drooling slightly. All she had eaten for breakfast was some toast, and she was currently hungrier than she she had ever imagined possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie suppressed a smile before answering. \"Cherry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Donna was on her feet. \"Maybe just one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie handed her the slice she was holding and watched as she crammed the entire thing into her mouth. Crumbs and flecks of cream covered the lower half of her face, and her eyes took on a glazed look as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie quietly slid the rest of the pie across the counter, and Donna let out a guttural moan and dug in with her bare hands. She practically buried her face in the flaky pastry, scooping up chunks of pie. When she finished, she was left breathing heavily, her hands and face stained dark red with cherry juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was amazed, and watched in silence as Donna slowly realised what she had done. She looked from the remains of the pie to Jackie, her face flushed even redder than the juice that coated her cheeks and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm so sorry, I...\" She began, before giving up and running for the door, her butt bouncing as she ran. Jackie waited until she heard the front door slam, and then let out a low whistle. She scooped up a small fragment of pie that had escaped Donna's attention and popped it into her mouth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Is that everything?\" The clerk asked, as Laurie slapped the money down on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at the four cases of beer and nodded. \"Yeah, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he counted out her change, she felt a pang of hunger and reconsidered.  She hadn't eaten since dinner, and that had been almost two hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, give me a bag of those pork rinds. And some of that beef jerky too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately opened the bag of pork rinds, tipping the salty snacks straight into her mouth. She was halfway through the bag before she realised the clerk had returned to watching his miniature TV, rather than carrying her stuff out to the car for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie didn't get it. Usually guys were eager to help her with the smallest of tasks, from holding doors open to lighting her cigarette. She pondered this as she chomped down another handful of pork rinds, scratching her belly with her free hand. She was even wearing one of her cutest outfits, a white t-shirt with a deep v-neck and and a pair of daisy dukes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Laurie wasn't taking into account of course was the body beneath the outfit. While her expanded breasts enhanced her cleavage considerably, it also meant the shirt barely reached halfway to her belly button. The denim shorts were incredibly tight, cutting into her belly and hips and forming a thick muffin top all the way around, and revealed every dimple of her flabbier ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it became clear that he wasn't going to help her out, Laurie sighed and stuffed her snacks into her pockets, before bending down and picking up the beer. They were heavy, and her tight clothes made it even more difficult, but she managed to navigate her way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thankful that Hyde and Fez were waiting right outside, where they eagerly took the cases off her hands. She panted slightly as they loaded up the Vista Cruiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are we done? You got your favour.\" Laurie said, retrieving her beef jerky and taking a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shook his head. \"Not even close. First things first, you have to drive us back home and hide this beer in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie groaned, but she knew she had no choice, and got back into the car. Hyde sat in the passenger seat, while Fez rode in back with the beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" Fez said happily as they pulled out of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde looked back at him with a grin. \"I know man, our own private chauffeur. Toss me one of those brewskis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez passed him a can and opened one for himself. Laurie licked her lips, dry from the salty snacks she had eaten, glancing sideways as Hyde sipped his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me have some of that.\" She said, taking one hand off the wheel and reaching for the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, it's ours.\" Hyde told her, moving it out of her reach. \"Plus, you're driving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"Come on, what's the worst that could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by the brief whoop of a siren and the thrum of a motorcycle engine,  as blue and red lights filled the rear windshield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cops!\" Hyde yelled. \"Lose the beer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly slid his out of sight down the side of his seat, but Fez panicked, simply throwing his can into the air. It spiralled in the air, most of the liquid landing right on top of Laurie. She shrieked as the cold beer soaked through her top, and the car swerved slightly before she regained control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe siren sounded again and Laurie slowed to a halt, turning around to glare at Fez, who smiled nervously while Hyde threw a blanket over the cases of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned her attention to the situation at hand and quickly checked her make-up in the rear view mirror, before adjusting her shirt slightly to better showcase her rack. <br>\r\nShe looked straight ahead as the crunching footsteps approached the car, and waited until knuckles rapped against the window before rolling it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why I pulled you over ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why no officer, I...\" Laurie launched into her usual routine before she realised she was talking to a woman. She did a double take at the tight ponytail pinned up beneath the wide-brimmed hat, and the unmistakable swell of breasts underneath the pressed black uniform. Her name tag read Murphy, and her sleeve bore a sergeant's stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually a few giggly compliments and a little flash of the goods was all Laurie needed to get out of trouble, but this might be a little more difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you breezed through a stop sign about half a mile back and...\" Sergeant Murphy began, before glancing down over her regulation aviators at the stain on Laurie's top. \"Have you been drinking tonight ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You see, this idiot...\" She turned to point at Fez, but Hyde subtly shook his head, so she turned back. \"I mean, some idiot spilled beer on me as I was leaving... church.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sergeant remained impassive. \"You were swerving a little back there. That plus the stop sign, I'm going to have to write you a ticket. License and registration please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie knew she shouldn't push her luck, but she was in a bad mood. Hyde's manipulation, plus the clerk's indifference to her, and now this was just too much to deal with. \"Oh come on! Don't you have real criminals to chase?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the officer's midsection, which bulged over her belt. It was only a small potbelly, dwarfed by Laurie's own gut, but she seized on it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or some more donuts to eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been a sore spot for Sergeant Murphy,  because she immediately stopped writing out the ticket. After a brief pause, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step out of the car please ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie unbuckled her seatbelt and did as instructed, already regretting her rash insult. Sergeant Murphy explained that she was administering a field sobriety test, and asked her to please walk ten paces along the broken yellow line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie calmed down a little. She wasn't drunk, so it would be easy.<br>\r\nIt might have been, if Sergeant Murphy hadn't skilfully interposed her size 8 boot between her feet and caused her to go stumbling to the ground, landing on her belly on the rough tarmac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Laurie yelled, but before she could protest further Sergeant Murphy was kneeling on the small of her back and slapping handcuffs on her wrists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hoisted upright and informed that she was being arrested on suspicion of drunk-driving. Sergeant Murphy frog-marched her back towards the Vista Cruiser and asked Hyde if he was okay to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, dumbfounded, and slid over into the driver's seat. After they cautiously and slowly drove out of sight, Sergeant Murphy pushed Laurie down on to the ground and told her to sit tight. She would have to radio dispatch for a squad car to come pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time of night, it shouldn't be more than an hour, two tops.\" She told her, her voice for the first time betraying a hint of vindictiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sergeant Murphy returned to her motorbike, Laurie sat sullenly on the ground, damp seeping in through the seat of her pants, her top covered in beer, and her arms wrenched painfully behind her back. She was starting to wonder if this was worse than just letting her parents see that stupid letter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric looked at all the magazines scattered over his bed in confusion. He eyed the photo of Jackie. Of course he wasn't planning on seeing her. Although there was a tiny part of him that wanted to, but no, he couldn't as much as he fantasized about it, he wasn't going to have an actual fat girl harem. That was just ridiculous. He was strictly a one-fat-girl-at-a-time type of guy. He looked at the photo again. He couldn't help but smirk at the bitter irony. Donna, the girl he was supposed to be totally in love with, wasn't into any of his fat fetish fantasies, whereas Jackie, who he was supposed to hate, seemed to actually be into it. Maybe. Kind of. He wasn't sure just what was going on with her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly wondered just what he was supposed to do with all this. Was he wrong for liking it? He'd convinced himself he wasn't, but... part of him wasn't sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind drifted down a surprising path as it reminded him that this wasn't the only problem he and Donna had. God knows their relationship had been pretty volatile in recent years. Sometimes, he felt like he was constantly apologizing for something he'd said that was apparently insensitive. He knew he deserved it mostly, but there were other times he felt she was being unfair to him. Other times, she'd get mad at Eric for things that weren't his fault, and she'd use feminism and sex to win arguments. And although they had supposedly made up, he still smarted over her attitude towards the promise ring. Eric had only given it to her and never made any indication of undermining her future or interests, only asking if they were together in the hypothetical futures she brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his eyes. He really didn't need this. What was he supposed to do? Ditch Donna for Jackie? He and Jackie barely even tolerated each other. Why was she even interested in him, anyway? What had prompted it? Was she messing with him? No, of course not. Even she would never be that cruel. Did she actually like him? What was the deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed in his room all day, trying to distract himself from his current problem. If only Donna shared his interest, this wouldn't be a problem. Then he recognized that he was trying to shift the blame, and he knew he had to accept that this was all on him. He hadn't forced anything on her, but he'd manipulated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe if he apologized to her, that'd be a good start to some kind of solution. Maybe she'd never forgive him, but at least he could try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally went outside - ignoring an irate Red on the phone with the police about Laurie - and slipped around the hedge to Donna's house. The cars weren't in the driveway, so hopefully, he wouldn't have to endure getting past her parents. He knocked on the door and hoped for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it opened, he saw Donna in her sweats and a t-shirt, which were doing a poor job of obscuring just how enormous she was now. Her large belly protruded far in front of her. He had to work hard not to glance down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm here to apologize,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only raised an eyebrow, so he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I like fat girls. Just gonna get that out in the open. When we started dating, it was because I like you for you, and not for what size you are. But lately, when you started gaining weight... well, I admit I did encourage it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glared at him. \"Yeah, I should've gotten the hint when you arranged a picnic that was mostly desserts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that wasn't good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Eric,\" she sighed, \"I admit that you're not completely at fault here. You didn't exactly force anything on me. Everything I ate, I ate of my own volition. But this just isn't what I'm interested in. And you tried to manipulate me to fit your 'ideal' woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric winced. That was all true, definitely. \"I know. And I'm sorry. I one hundred percent own what I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm glad you see what you did was wrong. But it's not enough right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric... I'm sorry. I do love you, but this has put a different light on our relationship. We clearly want different things. God knows we've had problems before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, I guess we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So maybe we need to break up right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I mean, I'm up for staying friends, but we're changing. Developing. Going in different directions. Maybe it's time to... y'know... accept that and move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded sadly. He was heartbroken this was happening, but he had to admit that deep down, he and Donna had been headed this way for a while. \"I... guess we will then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should be apart for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Um, again, I'm sorry about...\" He indicated her fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. \"It's okay. I'll figure something out... Goodbye, Eric,\" she said with a note of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded, trying to keep his composure. Part of him wanted to cry so hard right now, but he didn't want the last image she had of him for a while to be him weeping. He managed a sad smile and turned back towards his yard, hearing the door shut behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered back to the house in a daze. Well, he thought sadly, this was a good life lesson. Never manipulate the people you love for your own selfish ends. The problem wasn't that he liked fat women. The problem was that he'd let that desire become more important than his relationship. He vowed he'd be better in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe re-entered the kitchen to find his family in the midst of a crisis as Hyde and Fez awkwardly tried to explain to Red and Kitty why their daughter was in jail. Looked like a nice distraction from everything else going on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the Burkhart residence, Jackie was enjoying an especially big dinner. Thanks to her missing mother's unlimited credit cards, she could run up as big a tab as she wanted without worry, and teach that bitch a lesson for just walking out on her. She was having an extra-large pizza with everything, breadsticks and a liter of soda to wash it all down. By the time she was finished, she was lying on the floor in a bloated heap, an empty bottle by her head and crumbs everywhere. It was moments like this she missed the cleaning staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands up and down her taught belly with glee. She beamed at how firm it was, so jam-packed full of food that it didn't even jiggle. She smiled to herself. She really knew how to throw a party for one. If this didn't get Eric's attention, nothing would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard the phone ring, snapping her out of her food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning to herself, she wished she was the kind of girl that could just let a phone ring before forcing herself into a sitting position. She heaved herself onto her feet and into the living room, thudding down on the couch and nabbing the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burkhart residence,\" she said, just in case it was another lawyer trying to sue her imprisoned father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, it's me,\" said Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sat up straight. \"Donna? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a sniffle on the other end of the line. \"Eric and I just broke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?! What happened? When? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took a moment to compose herself. \"He... he admitted he's been trying to fatten me up,\" she said shakily. \"He came over to apologize, but... Jackie, I just couldn't forgive him for it. It just... it changed everything about our relationship. This whole time he was with me, he was wishing I was... fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie felt her heart drop. \"... He did? Oh my god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... And I know you probably think it's weird, him liking fat girls, but that's not even the problem! He just... He manipulated me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie swallowed. She could hear the genuine heartbreak in her friend's voice, and it shook her to the core. All thought of 'stealing Eric' vanished from her head out of concern for her friend. \"Oh, Donna, I... I'm sure he didn't want to hurt you,\" she said quickly. \"I know what he did was wrong, but... he'd never intentionally make you feel bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Logically, I know that. I just can't... I'm not the kind of woman he needs. He needs someone who's into that, you know? He needs someone who shares that with him. I mean, if it's that important to him... he shouldn't need to trick someone into being what he wants, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sat in silence for a moment before realizing she was supposed to answer. \"Yeah... So, what happened? Did you have a big fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... he accepted it. I think we're going to try and be friends later, but... I just can't see him for a while. It'll be too hard. I need some time away from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. And hey, when you're ready, we can hang out sometime, okay? Get together, have lunch, drinks and then call him bad names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a brief laugh. \"Yeah, thanks, Jackie... Although, maybe skip lunch. I've been eating too much lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie bit back a comment like \"no such thing as too much\" out of respect, but smiled all the same. \"Whatever you wanna do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a while longer, seeing as how they hadn't really spoke in a long time, before saying goodnight and moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie wandered back into the kitchen, having digested most of her dinner, and set about cleaning up. God, she felt guilty. She couldn't believe what her brain had talked her into. Looking back, how did any of her plan to 'steal Eric' make any sense? Did she even like Eric that way? I mean, okay, so he was sweet, loyal, thoughtful, caring... probably make a good father someday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. Damn. Now she was actually thinking of Eric as something other than that scrawny neighbor boy. She visualized him in her head. He was cute, in a dorky sort of way. Nice smile. A haircut and some weight-lifting, and he'd be kinda sexy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mentally slapped herself. Stop it! This is your best friend's boyfriend! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEx-boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod. What was happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished cleaning the mess and sat at the table, placing her hands atop her belly. She peered down at it curiously. All this, just to get Eric's attention. The attention of a boy who she didn't even really like that way. Or, at least, she wasn't sure if she liked that way. Maybe. Kinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, of all the boy's to suddenly have a crush on, it was Eric friggin' Forman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, she got up from the table to leave, but then she remembered the ice cream in the freezer she had been planning on eating, but the phone call distracted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd only been gaining weight to get Eric's attention. But now... she had to wonder. Did she really want to be fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in a nearby mirror. Looked at the bulging curves. Looked at that belly. That big big belly. How far it protruded. How cute she looked with a double chin. How pinchable her love handles were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even knew what was happening, she was pulling the ice cream out and eating it happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, yes, she <i>did </i>like being fat. If anything good had come out of this, it was that she enjoyed gorging herself into an enormous blob of fat. The jiggles. The belly slaps. The food comas. The struggle to put on pants that were too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not Eric ever took interest in her was immaterial, she decided. She needed to be there for her best friend. In the meantime, she would enjoy being an absolute pig.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few months were weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, Laurie's letter was eventually found, and despite her best attempts, she couldn't sweet talk her way out of trouble, so she was forced to admit that she'd flunked out of college and was coming home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, of course, was seen less frequently around the group. They saw her occasionally, but since the break up, she wasn't that eager to be in the basement anymore. The guys gave her a wide berth. They didn't know for sure why she and Eric broke up - she respected that his fetish was private and didn't blab - but it was clear to everyone that she and Eric weren't the match made in heaven everyone thought they were, so they accepted that it was over. In the meantime, she was trying to lose some weight and get back in shape. Unfortunately, her attempts fell a bit flat as she had now discovered the pleasures of eating. She tried reducing her consumption rate, but it was a long process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Jackie had seemingly given into gluttony herself. The smaller girl was trying to be a good friend and show support in Donna's time of need, but she seemed to be constantly snacking. Be it a bag of chips or ice cream or pork rinds or something equally fattening, she just seemed to be eating all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie, meanwhile, had gained so much weight that she'd been kicked off the cheer squad. She'd been upset at first, but soon, she found that she hadn't had that much enthusiasm for cheerleading anyway. She only did it because she'd been hot and popular. Now she was hot and happy instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, a lot of her popular friends had alienated her after weight gain as she wasn't sexy enough to have around anymore. She had a few friends who still stuck it out with her, but it wasn't a lot, and she found herself all alone most days. At first, she didn't mind. More food for her. But now she was just bored all the time. And lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely saw Eric during this time, as she was avoiding the basement to look after Donna. Her crush, sadly, didn't go away. It didn't blossom into love or anything - barely seeing him put a crimp in that - but she did miss him. His smile. His kindness. His dorky charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, after she'd finished her homework, she went to the Hub for a basket of fries. She was feeling depressed again. Donna was finally over the break up for the most part, getting out into the world. She'd joined the school newspaper and was currently working her way into a new group of friends. So she was all alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she saw a familiar face come through the door. It was Eric. He was all on his own. He ordered some fries and a drink before sitting at a table by himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie watched him nervously. Should she go over? He wasn't doing anything. No homework. No magazine. Just kinda staring off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up. She had things to say to him. Not of the confessing-feelings variety, but still. Things to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood over him. \"Hey, Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked up and found himself with an eyeful of Jackie's bulging belly. She could see him wrestling with the desire in his eyes as they slowly peered up at her chubby face. \"... Hey, Jackie,\" he faltered. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... no, not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sat down in the chair across from him. \"So... I owe you an apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how I acted around you. For sending you that photo. It was stupid. I was just... I don't know. Lonely and jealous of what you and Donna had and I wasn't thinking... and I'm sorry if that made things worse for you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shook his head. \"No, she... never found out about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had a feeling, what with her still being friends with me and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't feel right to tell her,\" he continued. \"Would've only made things worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded in agreement. \"So... I don't know if Donna's ever going to come back to you guys. She's been pretty busy lately. I guess work is better than sex for her. The weirdo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got a small smile out of him. \"Yeah, well... I haven't exactly been just hanging out either. Been kinda losing myself in schoolwork, too. I'm only here because my parents say I've been cooped up in my room and the basement too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the guys? Aren't they all a bunch of single losers who could be helping you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do what they can. We still hang out in the basement. But they're all kinda moving on. Fez started seeing Big Rhonda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie chuckled. \"Oh my god. They're both so painfully shy, they'll be virgins forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Hyde met a girl at a party recently, so they're hanging out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric winced at the mention of her ex. \"He's... kinda keepin' it casual lately... with... most girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie rolled her eyes. \"God, he just can't keep it in his pants, can he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says he needs to share it with the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while before Jackie realized she was staring at Eric's fries. She licked her lips at the sight but felt weird about just taking one. But then, Eric saw her staring at them and nudged them in her direction. She blushed, both from embarrassment and from attraction, and started eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I wish I had one of those Star Trek transporter beams to just beam me a bunch of fries,\" she said between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smirked. \"Well, Bones would argue that it's unethical because how do we know that the fries that get broken down are the same fries that reassemble in the new location?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie laughed, and it was like all the tension between them melted away. Soon, she was eating all of his fries, and they were doing goofy William Shatner impressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, without a doubt, the best day of her life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you've gotta be kidding!\" Eric exclaimed, looking at the chubby brunette incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric Forman, I am totally serious!\" Jackie replied, hands on her considerable hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, there is no way the Fonz would ever survive working with Starsky and Hutch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, the guy can start a jukebox just by hitting it! Why shouldn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been bickering about this and a variety of other topics for a half hour. Not that they minded. They found these pointless arguments to be a lot of fun. They disagreed on so many silly things that the combativeness of it was more amusing than annoying. Or at least it was for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde, Fez and Kelso were all sitting around them in bewilderment. It was weird watching them not only get along, but actually bonding over things like sci-fi and TV shows. Somehow, they'd become best pals without any of them really noticing a change. They could only sit back and watch their strange chemistry unfold before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde didn't really care one way or the other. He found Jackie to be rather annoying, but he was secretly glad his best friend was moping around like he thought he'd be after Donna left. If nothing else, he was glad to see he had someone to talk \"nerd\" with. If that ended up being Jackie, then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso and Fez were less impressed. Jackie was Kelso's ex, and even though he wanted to bang pretty much every other girl in Point Place, he didn't want her moving on from him at all. Even if she wasn't as \"sexy\" as he thought she should be. He sat with his arms crossed, trying to ignore them, but he couldn't quite stop glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez, however, was even less pleased. He'd always been jealous of Kelso having Jackie, and once they were broken up, he thought for sure that she'd come to him at some point. However, he was annoyed that of all the people who she could've moved on to, she seemed to be choosing Eric. Even though he liked Rhonda, he still quietly dreamed that Jackie would still show an interest in him. Seeing her with his friend irritated him to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Jackie, however, were less concerned with what the others were thinking. They were wrapping up their argument and now talking about when \"Happy Days\" stopped being good, and then that segued into shows that were either cancelled too soon or should've been cancelled sooner. Hyde interrupted the flow by suggesting which shows they liked that were secretly being used by the government to hypnotize the American populace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, Jackie checked her watch. \"Okay, I need to get going,\" she said. \"Got homework to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked her to the door. \"Okay, we'll see you tomorrow,\" he said, opening the door for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled. \"But of course. I know I brighten up all of your days,\" she said with that unflappable confidence. She sauntered out the basement door and into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took a moment to admire her large ass before turning back to the basement sofa. He had just thudded down when he noticed that the other three were staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Problem?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's goin' on with you and Jackie?\" Kelso asked, thinking he sounded casual but really sounding pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... honestly don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you not know, you son of a <i>beetch</i>?\" Fez demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric bit back some amusement. \"I mean... I don't know. We're having fun together, we've got stuff in common... I dunno, maybe something's happening, but it's still early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde rolled his eyes behind his shades. \"Well, while I don't particularly like the idea of Jackie becoming a permanent fixture around here again, but hey, whatever floats your boat, Forman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled dryly. \"Thanks, Hyde. I can always depend on you to not care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde smiled in response. \"It's what I'm here for, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez crossed his arms. \"Well, I think it's crappy! You can't just make off with your friend's girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thank you</i>, Fez!\" Kelso agreed. \"You can't just go out with <i>my </i>girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez blinked. \"... Yes... <i>your </i>girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelso, you guys broke up. You're having sex with the entire population of Point Place. What are you so upset about?\" Eric demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... didn't want her moving on to... you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't moved onto me. She's... I don't know. Whatever's happening, we're in no rush. Donna and I have been broken up for a few months now, but she's still Donna's best friend. That's gonna be mega weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not gonna date her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet! It's still early! I like where things are right now. If it develops, it develops. And that's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso looked at him blankly, not really comprehending. \"So... you're not gonna date her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rubbed his eyes tiredly. \"Kelso, Jackie and I will do whatever we want when we feel like doing it, regardless of how you feel, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso's mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally just stamped his foot and stood up. \"Fine!\" he snapped, and he turned and stormed out of the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three stared at the shut door in silence for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now see what you've done!\" Fez snapped at Eric. \"You've stolen Jackie away from... him... and you've upset my big hunky friend! Now good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID GOOD DAY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he slammed his way outside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Hyde were left sitting in the basement in silence once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again, thanks for not caring, Hyde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, man.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna had settled in at the school newspaper and was enjoying her work on it, even if it was mostly just fluff pieces. We all have to start somewhere, she reasoned. It was amazing how much she was getting done lately. So many stories had been completed. She spell-checked everything. The staff loved her and her quirky sense of humor. She was truly in her element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few months, though, she began to notice that the reason why she had plenty of time was because she hadn't really hung out with her friends in a long time. She hadn't set foot in the basement since she and Eric broke up. She saw the guys once in a while, but they weren't really talking. It wasn't so much that they'd taken Eric's side or anything. They just... drifted apart. She'd thrown herself so thoroughly into her schoolwork that she'd simply lost touch with the outside world a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed sadly as she sat back in her chair. She leaned back to stretch her spine, noting with some distaste that her belly still pressed up against the desk. She glared down at it. If ever she felt guilty about leaving Eric, all she had to do was look down at this massive gut she'd yet to lose. He did this to her. Made her fat. All for his perverse fetish fun. She then mentally reminded herself that he had owned up to it and apologized in an impressively mature manner, and maybe she was being too hard on him. Then, she'd remember that they'd had problems other than this, so the break up wasn't completely pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she'd get hungry, forgetting about losing weight just long enough to get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, her appetite was ridiculous lately. Although she'd managed to curb it slightly by no longer participating in the group's circles, she still craved food constantly. It was just such a wonderful thing - to eat until completely full, and then to have a little more just because you could. That big weight in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed heavily, peering down at her belly again, which peeked out from under her flannel shirt. It gave a quiet rumble, making her realize she had missed lunch. Annoyed, she got up and headed for the cafeteria. She got herself some pizza and a few candy bars from the vending machine before looking for a place to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled when she spotted Kelso sitting by himself at a table, skimming over a nudie magazine. She walked up behind him. \"Hey, Kelso!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso jumped and sent the magazine flying, landing on the other side of the table. \"I wasn't reading that! I...!\" He looked up and registered who had arrived. \"Oh... Donna, I thought you were a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try not to be offended,\" she chuckled, sitting down next to him. \"How've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fine,\" he sighed, folding his arms. \"Just, y'know... stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleeping around getting you down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! No! That's awesome! It's just... well... Jackie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... is getting on with her life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... is getting on with her life... with <i>Eric</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's expression stayed exactly the same, but now it was like everything had stopped. She stared at Kelso with empty eyes, as if the lights had gone out. It freaked him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sorry! I was just... wow... so... wait, Eric and <i>Jackie </i>are together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, but I can just tell they're gonna. They're hanging out all the time. They laugh at each other's jokes. They've been watching Star Trek together. They're always hanging out by each others lockers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they... <i>eating </i>together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso blinked. \"Uh... I don't know... Maybe? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason,\" Donna said quickly, but her mind was going into overdrive. Jackie had porked up a <i>lot </i>lately. It seemed the once tiny brunette had inflated considerably in the last few months. Double chin, bigger breasts, burgeoning belly, thunder thighs, fat ass... Could Eric have played a part in any of this? She tried to tell herself he hadn't. He wouldn't. He wasn't a cheater. But why the change, she wondered. Why had Jackie gained so much weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked down and saw her tray was now empty. And her stomach was very full. Full of food and dread. What kind of game was being played here? And who was behind all this fattening activity - Eric or Jackie? Something wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso shifted in his seat. \"Well...,\" he said, realizing how awkward this was now. \"I guess I'll just... get going. See ya around, Big Red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see ya, Kelso,\" she said absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got up and left, she was left to ruminate. She took the empty tray to a trashcan and made her way back to the room she'd been working in. Impulsively, she stopped for a quick candy bar or three from the vending machine, and didn't regret her decision until she was holding them. Dammit, Eric, stop making me fat! she thought. She walked back to the room, tossing the now-empty wrappers in the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she saw a box of doughnuts on the desk. Completely full. Chocolate iced with sprinkles. Her stomach rumbled. Groaning to herself, she tried to ignore them and go back to work, but they smelled so good and oh god, how had she just eaten three of them?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, there was now an empty box and a very full Donna, looking very sheepish. She saw the buttons straining on her shirt and groaned quietly. She needed to get a handle on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least the lack of food in the room meant she could now focus on finishing her article. She sat down at the typewriter and picked up where she left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a few minutes later, a few members of the club entered, talking about some feature they were going to run, and they spotted Donna at her desk. \"Hey, Donna!\" one of them said. \"We're going to order some pizzas for the evening! You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna should've said \"no, I'm going home for dinner\" but instead, she found herself saying, \"Yeah, sausage and pepperoni for me, please!\" She winced as she turned back to her work. If she kept this up, her belly would be so large she couldn't reach the typewriter anymore!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jackie had needed to get out of the house. Her mother was on another vacation in Cancun, so all she had was the maid for company. She had homework to do, so she decided to hang out at the Hub to work on it, as well as to get some nice fattening snacks. She wasn't really gaining right now. But she wasn't about to let all her sexy fat fade away, so she had to maintain. She smiled at the thought of all the guys who had lusted at her during her skinny days now staring in shock at what a blimp she'd become. She loved being the center of attention, no matter what or how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, she didn't know that Fez was approaching the building. He had his girlfriend \"Big\" Rhonda with him. She had her arm linked with his, and she was chatting amiably about something that he was only half-listening to. It bugged him still that Jackie was more interested in Eric than him. Even though he liked Rhonda and had been enjoying his time with her, he still carried a horny torch for the now ex-cheerleader. And as good a guy as he was at heart, Fez was still a pretty shallow dude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew she'd be at the Hub, so he thought maybe walking in there with Rhonda would make her turn her head. Maybe the sight of him with a fat girl would make him look more desirable to her. If she saw he was willing to accept her new largeness, she'd see him as a more viable option as a boyfriend. And really, all he had to do was not act like Eric. That was usually enough of a turn off for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the Hub, Fez declared. \"How about we get lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda was surprised but smiled. \"Oh, okay!\" she said cheerfully. \"I'm kinda hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez pushed open the door for her, and they stepped inside. His eyes scanned the crowd, and sure enough, there was Jackie, working away on her homework with a large basket of fries and a few textbooks and notebook paper. \"Oh, look, there's Jackie!\" he said cheerfully. \"Maybe we can sit with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda shrugged amiably. \"I suppose so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wandered over to where Jackie was working. \"Oh, Jackie! What a surprise!\" Fez said in a painfully staged voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked up and dimly smiled. \"Oh, hey, Fez. Hey, Rhonda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy running into you at the Hub,\" Fez continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged. \"I dunno. We're all here kind of a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you working on?\" Rhonda asked. \"If you're busy, we can sit somewhere else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" Jackie said, putting the pencil down. \"I need a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're here to provide that break,\" Fez announced. He reached into his pocket and pulled out some money. \"Here, Rhonda, why don't you order lunch and get whatever you want? I'll wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda eyed the money in Fez's hand that he hadn't really looked at and grinned widely. \"Sweet! I'll be right back!\" she said, taking it and scurrying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez sat down next to Jackie with a smile. \"Well, how are you doing today, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged. \"Fine, I guess. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could not be better. I am utterly over the moon in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Things going well with Rhonda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. But when you have one of the most beautiful women in Point Place, things can <i>only </i>go well, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked, glancing over at Rhonda in line at the counter. \"... I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what a body,\" Fez continued, laying it on thick. \"She jiggles everywhere. It's so evocative. The way those clothes struggle to contain her glorious body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie raised an eyebrow awkwardly. \"Yeah, that's... well, that's great, Fez. I'm glad you guys are working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, women truly do look more beautiful with a little more meat on them, you know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose... I mean, I look fabulous at <i>any </i>size, so I have nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai, that is true. You have the Jackie Burkhart magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie puffed up a little inside. \"That's true! I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my Rhonda will always come first in my heart,\" he added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his disappointment, she smiled. \"Well, sure, because you love her. And that's what's important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could formulate a reply, he heard footsteps approaching, and there was Rhonda with an enormous tray of food. A large cheeseburger, jumbo fries and an extra large soda for her, and a smaller basket of fries and a small soda for Fez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" she said cheerfully. \"Thanks for buying, Fezzie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez blinked at the amount of food. \"Wow, how'd you get all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was easy, with the twenty you gave me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's hand immediately flew to his wallet while she began to chow down. He realized that instead of handing her a ten, he'd been so focused on Jackie that he'd handed her his only twenty instead. He watched as she eagerly began devouring the enormous burger, metaphorically eating his allowance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie pouted at the meal. \"Man, now I'm hungry, but I gotta finish my homework, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda peered at the textbooks. \"What are you working on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to do a research paper on the French Revolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I did that assignment recently! Maybe I can help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can? Oh, Rhonda, you are my hero! Scoot over here! Show me if I'm doing this right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda quickly scooted close to Jackie's books, still carrying her cheeseburger, and the two fat girls got to work on the assignment, leaving Fez sitting off to the side feeling very much the third wheel. He could only watch, eating his lunch quietly while the two girls talked animatedly about homework and ate their food. Jackie, of course, had her mom's credit card, and so she went back for more food, and they split it between them, eating and working. Fez sat in silence, trying to think of things that would make Jackie jealous, but that was getting harder as they were getting along so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you're so good at this, Rhonda,\" Jackie sighed. \"I swear, I can never get this organized with studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can help you if you ever need it,\" Rhonda assured her. \"Always available when you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! I appreciate that! Fez, you were right! This girl is a treasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, was my Fezzie saying nice things about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that you were the most beautiful woman in Point Place and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda gushed happily while Fez forced a smile. Great. Now Rhonda was even more into him, meaning she would be harder to get rid of should he ever catch Jackie's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls finished their work and put the books away, now chattering happily like old friends. Rhonda gave Jackie some study tips while Jackie gave Rhonda some fashion tips. Soon, they were planning a shopping trip together, and it sounded like Fez might be stuck carrying the bags - if he came at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, however, they ran out of food, and the two girls were patting their bloated stomachs sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" Rhonda gasped. \"I haven't had a meal like that in a long time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ought to have lunch when we go shopping,\" said Jackie. \"This was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's getting late. Fez and I should probably get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez saw an opportunity to finally speak. \"Would you like us to walk you home, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I've got my dad's car. Besides, I need to swing by Eric's and drop off his textbook he let me borrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll see you later, Jackie,\" Rhonda said, giving a grunt as she struggled to her feet. Her stuffed belly protruded far in front of her, making her previously-tight skirt strain at the new load to hold in. She took Fez's hand, and he walked out with her, looking back as Jackie gathered her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to recap, he was out twenty bucks, Rhonda was even crazier about him, and Jackie was going to see Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a good night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Jackie pulled into the Forman driveway, she smiled at the sight of the Vista Cruiser parked in the driveway. Her cute little nerd boy was home. She peered into the kitchen, wherein she saw Kitty already cooking away. Her stomach rumbled at the sight. It looked so good. But her stomach also gurgled. She was so full. She didn't think she could eat anymore. She clutched the text book and made for the basement. She could resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout bothering to knock - she was pretty sure none of them did, anyway - she popped inside and saw Eric watching TV on the couch. He glanced up and saw her. \"Hey!\" he said, immediately smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled back. \"Hi. I am returning your text book.\" She handed it out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great. Hope it helped,\" he said, taking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it did. Thanks. How was your day?\" she asked, sitting with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Hyde's working at the Foto Hut late, so I get the TV to myself. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had lunch with Fez and Rhonda at the Hub. Gosh, they're doing well together. Fez couldn't stop talking about how great she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Does she live up to the hype?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's great! Helped me with my homework and everything! And man, that girl can put away a double cheeseburger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled. \"Well, good. Glad Fez is on the way to losing his v-card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, poor guy's pervy enough as it is. He might just explode from anticipation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed for a few moments before letting their eyes drift back to the TV. They sat in companionable silence before they realized what had happened, not to mention how close they were sitting. Jackie stole a glance in Eric's direction, noting that despite being so skinny and twitchy, he was still good looking and kinda... handsome. She mentally kicked herself and focused on the TV. He was probably still getting over Donna, for all she knew, and she was enjoying their new friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, however, kept stealing glances at the chubby brunette next to him. God, she was gorgeous. Without the extra guilt of being with Donna hanging from around his neck, it was so exhilarating to look at her. The fullness of her pretty face, her cute double chin, her great big round ball of a belly, her chubby little hands resting atop said belly... He forced himself to focus on the TV, though. It was wrong. All kinds of wrong. This was his ex's best friend. One of his best friend's ex-girlfriends. How could he live with himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chanced a look again, and there she was, looking at him. Their eyes locked, and they both froze, not sure what to do. They weren't sure if they were just imagining the desire they saw in each others eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both jumped when the upstairs door suddenly burst open and Mrs Forman came downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, it's dinner time! Oh, Jackie! Did you see you there, sweetie! Will you be joining us for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blanched. She loved Mrs Forman's cooking, but she was still kinda full from her gorge at the Hub. \"Oh... I don't know... I mean, I wouldn't want to impose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nonsense, sweetie! I always make enough for leftovers throughout the week! Red once said I could cook enough to feed a whole platoon! Aha ha ha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked at Eric, but he shrugged amiably. \"I don't mind. Hyde's not here anyway, so you can have his share.\" And then some, he added mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile split across her face. \"Well... okay! I guess I can stay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, super!\" Kitty clapped. \"Come on upstairs! We'll be happy to have you!\" She scurried up the basement steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric glanced at Jackie. \"I think it's tuna fish casserole tonight,\" he said. \"She puts potato chips in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie licked her lips unconsciously. \"Sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And green beans and cornbread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... with butter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric hid a smile. \"Yeah, lots of butter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie bit back a small moan. God, she was full, but that all sounded so good. \"... Better get moving then,\" she said at last, heaving herself off the couch and towards the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chanced a look back at Eric and saw him look away quickly. Was he checking out her ass? Smiling discreetly, she pretended to do a few stretches and bent down to touch her toes, making sure her ass was on full display in her tight XXL jeans. She managed an upside down glance at Eric and saw him full on staring with his mouth slightly agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened up and gave a self-satisfied smile. Oh yeah. He was into her. And why wouldn't he be? She was Jackie freakin' Burkhart, and she was sexy as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a good night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a long laborious walk up the basement steps, but the smells from the kitchen seemed to practically carry Jackie the rest of the way. She practically swooned at the sight of Mrs Forman putting dinner together. God, that woman could cook. There was so much of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach groaned. Both out of dread and desire. It was still full from lunch, but Jackie was hungry enough that she didn't mind. She needed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come right in, Jackie,\" Kitty said cheerfully, guiding her to the dining room table. \"You can have Steven's seat next to Eric. Red? Jackie's joining us for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, the one that can hold a damn flashlight,\" Red said, sending a sarcastic look Eric's way. \"She's always welcome here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mr Forman!\" Jackie squealed, kissing his forehead before sitting down. She noticed Eric roll his eyes before joining her at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, in walked Laurie, looking remarkably grumpy and drab in her plus-size jeans and slightly-too-small top. Her large beer belly jiggled as she joined them at the table, sitting down with a thud across from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh joy, the midget's here,\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Laurie, be nice. She's Eric's friend, and she's joining us for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie gave her a dismissive look and took her plate. As she piled on her food, Jackie couldn't help but marvel how big she was since she'd last seen her. What had happened there? She stole a glance at Eric and realized that he was trying very hard not to look at her. Oh god, this poor boy was so sex-starved he was drawn to his own sister's fatness. She probably should've been grossed out by that, but to her surprise, she felt bad for him. He needed something else to focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd luckily, she was the kind of girl who could pull that off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food came around to her, she took a very generous helping. She talked animatedly - one of her natural gifts - to keep Mr and Mrs Forman focused on her instead of her plate, talking about shopping - something Kitty would be interested in  - and her dad's car - something Red would be interested in. During all this, she added more and more food to her plate, creating an impressive mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at Eric and saw him staring quietly at her meal and saw that it was working. If he could focus on her fatness instead, the night would go much easier for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she liked the attention, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her stomach protested at all the food in front of her, still not done digesting her burgers and fries from the Hub. Still, she soldiered on and ate what she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw a glance at Laurie. She was eating an impressive amount as well, but she was still all sullen and not speaking. Some sort of drama had taken place she was not aware of. Served the bitch right for stealing Michael from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie tried to keep her mind off her fullness by continually chatting with everyone, but after fifteen minutes, it was beginning to feel a little tight in her mid-section. God, she was so full. She glanced down at her belly and saw how the buttons were straining on her shirt. This was a nice top, too. She didn't want to ruin it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was still so much food to finish, and she wanted to keep Eric's attention. She looked at Laurie again and saw her also slowing down, a hand atop her bloated belly. Grimacing, Jackie continued eating. If nothing else, this scrawny neighbor boy <i>would </i>be fantasizing about her tonight, and no one else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another ten minutes before she finished, and she was so stuffed she was worried she might barf, but she did it. Every last scrap of food was eaten off her plate. She set her fork down and daintily dabbed at her mouth with her napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wonderful, Mrs Forman,\" she said, trying to stay bright and cheery even when she was ready to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you, Jackie! I'm glad you enjoyed it! It's just a little something I spent hours on! Aha ha ha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all proceeded to get up from their chairs. Jackie was so full she could barely move and was clearly struggling, but Eric wrapped an arm around hers and gently helped her up. Her head practically erupted with joy as he made physical contact. She wanted to squeeze his arm and walk off into the sunset with him, but that would probably be embarrassing for him in front of his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wasn't in the mood to walk, anyway. Right now, she wanted to pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, meanwhile, was looking similarly bloated as she tried to get up from the chair, but she had no one to help her from the table. She waddled awkwardly, trying to get her engorged gut to stop swinging like a pendulum and waddle back to her room. God, what was happening to her? Why was she letting this happen to herself? She used to dominate all those who dared cross her with charm, good looks and pure evil. Now she was a fat blob leeching off her parents, getting in trouble all the time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If the walk up from the basement had seemed long after one meal, walking back down again was moderately terrifying after <i>two </i>meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie clutched Eric's arm as he gently guided her down into the basement and towards the couch. She needed to lie down for a bit, but she had to do so in a dignified manner. Something ladylike. Just because she'd eaten like a pig didn't mean she couldn't still look amazing. She gently lowered herself onto the couch, lying on her side, placing her head in one hand, the elbow resting on the couch arm, and her other hand resting atop her belly. She looked up at Eric with a sultry look in her eye, and she struggled not to squeal at how cute he looked when he blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed a small smile. She was pulling it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she let out a belch that echoed throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand flew to her mouth in shock, startled she'd let herself do that. She looked at Eric, who was looking surprised, and also like he was trying not to laugh. Realizing she'd lost the moment, she sighed and waved him on. \"Oh, just let it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric descended into helpless giggles and doubled over, slapping his knee as he slumped into the nearby chair. \"I'm... I'm sorry...,\" he laughed. \"It's just... the look on your face...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie tried to look annoyed, but the amount he was laughing made her smile a bit. It <i>was </i>pretty funny. \"Yeah, well, buckle up, buttercup, because I think I feel another one coming on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by all means, go ahead,\" Eric chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie laid herself flat on her back and let a long low belch erupt from her midsection. She propped up her head on the couch arm and patted her stomach. \"Ohhhh, god,\" she moaned. \"I can't believe I finished all that food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither can I. I mean, it was impressive, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it was. After all I ate with Rhonda at the Hub, I'm surprised I didn't just burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's eyes widened. \"You mean... you'd already eaten before you got here? Why didn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged awkwardly. \"I dunno... I guess I just... wanted to stay for dinner? I mean... I...\" Oh god, was this it? Where was this going? \"... I like spending time with you, Eric,\" she settled on. It was true, after all. \"I like... being around you. Laughing with you. Arguing with you. And god knows we do a lot of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled, so she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... I guess I kinda... like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause, and she briefly hoped this was happening the way she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shifted in his seat, looking like he was trying to build up his nerve. \"Well, I... kinda like you, too, Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie gave a sleepy smile. \"I'd go over to you, but I'm so stuffed I can't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Message received,\" he replied, getting up and sitting with her on the couch, putting her feet in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, my tummy hurts,\" she moaned, giving it a gentle rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the look in his eyes - that desire - and quietly began to undo the straining buttons on her top, exposing the pale orb of her fat belly, so taut and round from an all day stuffing. She saw the desire increase and smiled at him, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna help me make the hurt go away, Eric?\" she asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression didn't change, but he managed to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out for his hand and grabbed it, placing it atop her stomach. \"Rub my tummy better, Eric,\" she moaned. \"It's so full and stuffed, and I need someone to rub it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric bit his lip. God, this was a fantasy come to life! Except no. Not a fantasy. Reality. A real life woman. Jackie. Jackie Burkhart was offering him the chance to rub this big fat stomach of hers. He had to proceed carefully. Not like when he manipulated Donna. This had to be done correctly - with her needs in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he gently began rubbing in big circles across the massive surface. God, it was soft and hard at the same time. The flesh so thick but the inside packed so firmly. He listened carefully to the sounds she made - a grunt when he pushed to hard and a contented 'mmmm' when he did it just right. And soon, he was getting 'mmmm-ed' quite a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Is that good?\" he asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, her eyes shut, her head back, her arms splayed all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric continued like that for a long time, just enjoying her belly, her company, the quiet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, it had been half an hour, and he'd done nothing but rub her stomach. Still, the smile never left her face. She looked so content, full of food and enjoying his hands on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slowed, she opened her eyes slightly and looked at him. She saw the look in his eye was very content, but still some desire. One more thing he clearly wanted to do. She was so sleepy, but she still wanted it so bad. She lazily lifted a hand and placed it on his cheek, fighting to keep her smile from getting too big. God, how had this happened? She'd actually fallen for Eric Forman to the point that she was about to invite him to do <i>this</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down and gently kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, he was actually really good, too. No wonder Donna put up with him for so long. He was gentle, curious, sweet, hungry all at once. She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer, until he was lying on top of her, but careful not to put too much pressure on her still stuffed belly. So considerate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of tongue hockey, they came up for air, and he looked her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wanna go out on a date Saturday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna grumbled to herself as she waddled through the clothing store. It was all Eric's fault, probably. Even after being broken up for several months, she was still gaining weight. It wasn't fair. He'd instilled some kind of joy of gluttony within her, and now she was pigging out constantly. Any diet she came up with never seemed to get past the planning stage. She'd tell herself she'd start tomorrow, but then she'd see something sweet or salty or savory that she craved and would put it off until she'd forgotten about it and gained another pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen pounds later, this wasn't getting any better. Her ample figure had ballooned out of her current wardrobe, so she now found herself looking around the plus-size store at the mall. She caught sight of her enormous ass in the mirror and sighed. She didn't want this. She really didn't. How the hell was she supposed to stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it wasn't a total loss. Some of these plus-size outfits were pretty cute. She was just comparing colors when she heard footsteps approaching, and she turned in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, old friend!\" Fez exclaimed. \"You are a sight for soaring eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sore eyes, Fez,\" Donna smiled, giving him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think they make eye drops for that, but not in this department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing in the women's section of a plus-size clothing store?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is strictly above board, I assure you. Rhonda is looking for a new dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changing room. This way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez led Donna towards the changing room in the back. After checking with the employee on duty, they watched as one of the curtains was pulled back, and out stepped a much bigger \"Big\" Rhonda than Donna had last seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda was wearing a floral dress that hugged her curves rather flatteringly. Her big belly was her most prominent feature, with smallish breasts and a flat ass, but the dress drew attention away from those. She gave a small twirl for Fez. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A vision of an angel,\" Fez replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glanced at Fez in bewilderment. Rhonda had clearly gained weight in the last few months. Did he not see that? Or was he like Eric and preferred them heavier? Or was something else up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna!\" said Rhonda. \"Great to see you! Hardly <i>anyone </i>sees <i>you </i>anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shrugged amiably. \"Paper's not gonna write itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loved the article on the condition of the gym bleachers. Someone seriously needs to rebuild those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, preferably with more room for couples to engage in the sex,\" Fez agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna crinkled her nose, but smiled all the same. \"Thanks, Rhonda. How are things with <i>you </i>guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things have been great,\" Rhonda smiled. \"Fez and I are really happy, aren't we, Fezzie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every day is an adventure,\" Fez said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna eyed Fez again but said nothing for now. \"That dress looks great on you, Rhonda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks! I needed to go up a size. Clothes are all cute and fun until you can't breathe in them,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's... very true,\" Donna sighed, eyeing the clothes she was still carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you need this changing room? Just give me a minute to change back! Back in five!\" She ducked back behind the curtain and went back to changing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gently guided Fez further away and whispered at him. Now was the time to say something. \"Everything okay with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine!\" Fez insisted, smiling as big as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me purple nurple you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez quickly covered nipples. \"Okay, okay! Rhonda is sweet and lovely and fun to be with... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't know... I still think about Jackie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \"Oh my <i>god</i>, Fez...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just not fair! She has taken interest in everyone except for young handsome Fez! She had Kelso, then she liked Hyde for a while, and then she went back to Kelso, and now she's making goo-goo eyes at Eric!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna did a double-take. \"Wait, <i>what</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! It's so unfair! I am so much better looking than Eric! I have the moves, the smoky sexy goodness, we can roller-disco together...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric and Jackie are together?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez shrugged, still oblivious to the redhead's emotions. \"I don't think so. But they're all pally now, and poor Fez is left on the corner all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill reeling from an increased possibility her ex and her best friend were potentially heading towards being a couple, Donna managed to regain her senses. \"You've got Rhonda,\" she pointed out. \"And correct me if I'm wrong, but you really like her a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai, I do... And I was doing fine with Rhonda until Jackie started liking Eric... What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, either tell Rhonda the truth and break up with her, or stay with her and pretend everything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez nodded. \"You are absolutely right, Donna. Thank you for your support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard the curtain re-open, and they turned to see Rhonda walking towards them, carrying the dress over her arm, and her plump body forced back into the somewhat-tight jeans and shirt. She beamed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready to go. Fez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall follow you to the ends of the earth and back,\" Fez replied with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and waddled off towards the register with a wave to Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, however, gave Fez a surprised look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez shrugged. \"She <i>is </i>good at cuddling,\" he said before following after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared after them in amazement before shaking her head in disgust and disappearing behind the curtain herself. She slipped out of her constricting jeans and slipped into the much bigger pair. She noted with some pleasure how easily they slid up her meaty thighs. She thoroughly enjoyed not having to grunt and struggle as she buttoned them up around her inflated waist. She particularly enjoyed how the took her enormous ass and gave them a very attractive curved shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling quietly, she ran her hand up and down her ass and thought Rhonda was right - being fat was much easier when your clothes actually fit you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fez dropped Rhonda off at her place and made his way a few blocks down to the Forman house. He wondered what would happen if he let slip to Eric that he had seen Donna today. Maybe he could reignite his interest in the rounded redhead and keep him away from Jackie. Then he'd be able to continue dating Rhonda in peace, knowing that she was still single. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the basement door and entered without knocking, as was customary at the Forman house, and meandered inside. He found Eric going through a few magazines while Hyde sat in his chair watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, friends of Fez!\" he announced brightly. \"You will never believe who I saw at the mall today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's Willy Wonka again, we still don't buy it,\" Hyde replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was probably just a hobo in a purple jacket,\" Eric agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, he's out there somewhere!\" Fez snapped before remembering why he came down here. \"And no! I saw Donna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got their attention. Both guys looked up in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna? Really?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rare sighting of the wild Pinciotti,\" mused Hyde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a workin' girl,\" Fez said. \"Talked a lot about the paper. And boy, has she ballooned up, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blinked. \"I don't know. I didn't see here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am! Rhonda and I saw her at the plus-size clothing store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really able to judge considering Rhonda was probably shopping for plus-size clothes, too, buddy,\" Hyde pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is beside the point! The point is, Donna is doing great and living her best life right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good,\" said Eric, already looking back at his magazines. \"Glad to hear it. I was hoping she would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez deflated slightly. He'd been hoping Eric would badger him for more questions - not maturely accept Donna had moved on. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to find some nice restaurant ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't heard? Forman and Jackie are going on a date,\" Hyde said, his attention already back on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's mouth fell open. \"Wh... what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're going out tomorrow!\" Eric said with an eager smile. \"Just gotta pick out a decent place. You know she's got standards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you can't... I mean... You and Jackie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked at him with raised eyebrows. \"Me and Jackie what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you don't even... You and Jackie aren't in love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well, no, it's just a date to see if we work. All we know is that we like each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't...! I mean, you shouldn't...\" Damn. Every argument he tried to come up with sounded dumber than the rest and never got past the first few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, the door suddenly burst open, and in stormed Kelso. \"All right, Eric! There's no escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all stared at him in befuddlement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Escape from what?\" Eric asked, sounding a wee bit amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escape from me! You thought you could just date Jackie and get away with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right, buddy!\" Fez exclaimed, relieved he had someone else to fight this battle for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelso, you guys broke up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was still my girl first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was!\" Fez agreed emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, you want to get back together with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know! I just don't want <i>you </i>dating her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because what kind of friend would do that?\" asked Fez dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Kelso, you guys have been over for months. Donna and I have been over in less time. How have you not moved on yet? You've been banging every girl in town since then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and that's awesome! But I didn't want <i>Jackie </i>to move on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she shouldn't!\" Fez agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what, you were hoping she'd be miserable without you for the rest of her life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\" Kelso faltered, \"... I mean... not quite like that... I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at him as he stammered. Hyde went back to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso finally thudded down in the lawn chair. \"I guess... I wasn't ready to think of her with someone else. Especially not one of my best friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, cuz what kind of friend does that?\" Fez threw in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric ignored Fez and focused on Kelso. \"Look, man, I'm sorry, but this is what's happening. And right now, it's just one date. For all I know, that's all it's going to be. But it might not be, and I'm hoping it leads to more. I know that's hard for you. God knows it'll be hard when Donna meets another guy. And it'll be hard for Jackie when you finally settle down and meet someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Kelso perk up a little. \"Really? It will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you need to take from all this, sure. She'll be sad seeing the man she once loved move on to someone else, even if <i>she's</i> with someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso thought about this for a while. \"Well... I guess that makes it better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez blinked. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to treat her right, man,\" Eric assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay... Just promise you won't do it with her for a while. At least not after the first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you know Jackie doesn't put out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso laughed. \"Yeah, that's true. She makes you work for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening?\" Fez demanded, realizing that none of them were listening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and just a tip - the first time, she's probably gonna want candles lit. And the wind blowing. And you might wanna get one of those puffy pirates shirts like on those romance book covers. She's super into that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Fez moaned. \"He can't date Jackie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth guys looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Kelso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez blinked. With no one on his side, he realized he was stuck for an answer. \"Because... he doesn't have a nice jacket? Jackie will want him dressed nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric waved him off. \"Oh, I can pull something together. We agreed to keep it casual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso scoffed. \"Lucky you. I mean, I have the natural advantage of looking good in anything, so you're outta luck there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, she accepted going out with Hyde when he was just wearing whatever he was wearing that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I have that rugged handsomeness that makes up for less-than-stellar clothing options,\" Hyde replied, not looking up from the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other three went back to what they were doing, Fez slumped in the background. Nothing seemed to be going right for him.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, Hyde came upstairs from his cot in the basement to look for a midnight snack. They'd had chicken earlier. Maybe there was still some in the fridge. Didn't matter if it was cold. There had to be something. He quietly snuck upstairs and made it to the fridge, pulling it open and being bathed in the light within. He peered around and found a leftover chicken leg that would satisfy him for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just closing the fridge door when he saw headlights pulling into the driveway. Instinctively, he ducked behind the counter, but then, he remembered that he lived here, so he crept back up again. Peering out the sliding backdoor, he saw that the car in question was a cab. He saw the backdoor swing open, and out swung a pair of super meaty thighs, followed by a big round belly, and a cascade of blonde hair. Laurie Forman was back from wherever the hell she'd been. Honestly, sometimes, he simply forgot that she still lived here. She slipped in and out of their lives so often, it was getting difficult to keep track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Laurie finished paying the cab driver - and then briefly attempt to make out with him - before the cab reversed out of the driveway and onto the road, disappearing into the distance. Laurie stood on the back porch for a few seconds before turning to head inside. There was a certain clumsiness to her turn that gave away to Hyde that she'd been out drinking. He knew there were two options here. Either be here and confront her head on, possibly humiliating her, or he could go back to hiding behind the counter and listen in on her drunken stupor, possibly learning something humiliating that he could use later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option had a level of sneakiness that he greatly appreciated, so he resumed hiding behind the counter before she could enter. As silently as possible, he crawled on his hands and knees until he was hidden in the hall behind the fridge. He heard the backdoor quietly squeak open, the staggering footsteps, and then it squeaked shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, it was clear how drunk Laurie was. Peering around the corner, he saw her stagger about the kitchen, slap her purse down on the table, and move around, singing quietly and decidedly off-key. He bit back a smirk. He'd seen her drunk before, but this was something new. After everything that had gone wrong in her lousy life, was the shame finally catching up to her? Not impossible, but highly unlikely. Something must be bothering her. If he listened long enough, maybe he'd hear something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, of course, was deaf and blind to the world around her. She was drunk. Completely pissed. She'd gone to a bar in the hopes of killing a few brain cells. Usually, it wasn't hard to get drinks for free, but tonight, it'd been damn near impossible. Thankfully, there'd been one guy who'd been interested in her that night. Some oily-looking skeevy kind of guy. Laurie had suspected at the time that he was trying to get her drunk enough for some easy sex, and frankly, the guy looked deranged. She wanted to be drunk, though, and he was willing to pay. So she made a deal with the bartender to call her a cab once it looked like the guy was going to take her with him. When the guy ducked into the restroom, the bartender had discreetly had her slipped out to the waiting cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it had taken a long time to get there, and she'd gotten very drunk in the process. So many drinks. So much booze in her belly. She could still hear it slosh inside of her as she waddled awkwardly around the house. She sleepily staggered over to the counter and lifted it up on top of it with a slap. It gurgled with the contact, making her giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whassa'matter, belly?\" she slurred. \"Not get enuff to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde peered around the corner in bemusement. The girl was actually talking to her stomach. She rubbed it soothingly as it sat lazily atop the counter, perfectly round. What had she done to herself that she'd let herself get that fat? What went on at college before she flunked out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon then,\" she continued, lifting her stomach off the counter and walking awkwardly to the fridge. \"Lessee what we got in'ere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde hid himself further away in the darkness, although he briefly wondered if it was worth it. She was clearly too drunk to know what was going on around her. He could probably walk through the room in just his shades, and she wouldn't notice. He chanced peeking all the way around, and there she was, rooting through the fridge. Sounded like she was looking for something. But what? Red's beer? Was she really going to have more to drink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he heard munching and chewing, followed by swallowing and moaning. She was eating. Seeing that she was totally engrossed in whatever was in the fridge, Hyde took a chance and quietly snuck in on his bare feet into the kitchen, tiptoeing around her. She was so oblivious that she didn't hear a sound. Just more munching and gulping and swallowing and burping. It was an endless cycle, and she wasn't about to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally was standing directly behind her. Good god, she wasn't even really looking for anything. She was just eating whatever she could get her hands on. Chicken, peanut butter, jelly, sticks of butter, mac n cheese, ranch dressing, mustard, ketchup... She was chugging a bottle of barbecue sauce, for gawd's sake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut inside Laurie's drunken mind, there was nothing odd about this. She needed more. She craved more. She ate and ate and ate, not caring how many stains were on her shirt or how much of a mess she made. More and more and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, however, she grew tired, slowed for a while, and then finally stopped. She leaned her head against the freezer door in silence before she at last shut the fridge door. Hyde froze, realizing that he was still out in the open. He didn't know what to do, short of diving back behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she turned, and she was face to face with him. Her engorged stomach swung out far in front of her, revealing the buttons on her blouse had popped off at some point. She looked at him with sleepy eyes, and he wondered if she even knew he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey, ugly,\" she mumbled. \"I need t' pee. Which way's th' bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily dumbfounded, Hyde took a moment before he pointed towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie waddled out of the kitchen and upstairs. Once she was out of sight, she let out a loud belch that shook the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde stared after her in a stupor, then at the mess on the floor. Shrugging, he turned and left. Tomorrow morning would be interesting. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric straightened his jacket one more time. He was going to get this right. Not only was he going out with a sexy fat girl, but it was a sexy fat girl who was into being a sexy fat girl. God, this was exciting. He never would've guessed he'd be all excited about taking out Jackie Burkhart of all people, but here he was, trying to look his best for her and make sure she had a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few things he had decided to rule out. No buffets or all-you-can-eat joints. This was a date, not some fetish fantasy he wanted to act out. Also - no talking about it over dinner. They were trying to see if they were compatible as a couple. Because it wasn't just horny desire fueling this date - he was genuinely into her. The last few months of being friends had been fun and easy - much easier than it had ever been with Donna. She actually seemed to enjoy some of his nerdier aspects, watching Star Trek reruns with him, and once she got the hang of it, she was actually pretty good at dubbing old movies and sports shows with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the keys to the Vista Cruiser, said good night to his parents, and walked out the door, all set. He hoped this would go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, he was parked outside the Burkhart residence. Damn, this was a big house. It was hard for him to imagine her all alone in there, what with her absentee parents. Jackie was the sort of person that required people in her life, if only to admire and fawn over her. Maybe that was why she hung out in the basement even after she and Kelso broke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the steps, he took a deep breath and rang the doorbell. He was ready for this. Everything was going to be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened. He took one look at her and forgot to breathe for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was stunning. Hair done up nicely, a lovely form-fitting floral print dress and her handbag around her shoulder. She smiled shyly at him, clearly grinning from excitement. \"Hey!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he replied, still mesmerized. It took a few moments for his brain to come back online. \"Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said, following him down to the car. \"Just had to make sure the housekeeper was all set for the night. When nobody's home, she holds her poker night in the basement. She thinks we think she's scrubbing the floors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled, guiding her towards the car. Mentally remembering all the things she complained about Kelso never doing for her, he reached out and opened the passenger side door. She smiled appreciatively and got herself inside. This car was a little lower than she was used to, so it took a little while to fit her plump body inside. Once she got herself situated, he shut the door and went around to the driver's side. When he got there, he saw that she was having a bit of a tug of war with the seat belt, trying to make it fit around her belly. He was briefly mesmerized before remembering she was probably not enjoying this as much as him, and he reached out and pressed a button on her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Let me adjust that for you,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie felt her seat slide backwards, allowing her to sigh with relief. \"Thanks,\" she gasped, finally comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was pulling out of her driveway and out onto the open road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we going?\" she asked. There was a tiny part of her that was worried he would say Fatso Burger or the Hub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al Fredo's,\" he replied. \"Italian food. Thought you might like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's eyes widened. \"Eric, that's a fancy place! How'd you get a table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned slyly. \"Oh, I have my contacts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contacts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well... My mom removed the owner's kidney stone a year ago, so she got us a table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie laughed. \"Well, remind me to thank her next time I see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Eric had parked the car, and they were both walking up the sidewalk and into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie swooned. The place smelled divine. She beamed at all the pasta. All the marinara. All the fettuccine. All the <i>everything</i>. It was like fat girl heaven! So many carbs to consume!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric guided her to their table and pulled her chair out for her before seating himself. He was really trying. Keep putting in that effort, he told himself. She appreciates that kind of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter brought them their menus, and they peered over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to get?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, there's just so much good stuff on here,\" Jackie murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric braced himself. As much as he'd like to see her pig out, he still didn't have a lot of money other than the forty bucks Red had given him. Man, minimum wage sucked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Jackie said, \"I'll think I'll get the lasagna with garlic bread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric glanced at the price and tried not to look too relieved. \"Oh good. I'll get the Pasta Carbonara myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ordering the cheap stuff, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... well, I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie giggled at how flustered he looked. \"It's okay, Eric. I get it. You're poor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked mock-affronted. \"Am not! Just middle class! Big difference!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it is,\" she smirked playfully. \"I mean, I guess I could pull out my dad's credit card that he doesn't know I have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I insist. I'm paying tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, that's sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, I may need you to pay for gas for the next few weeks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and gave a nod. \"Whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the waiter arrived and took their orders, left glasses of water, and took the menus, leaving them alone once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" Eric said, racking his brain to think of something that didn't involve Donna, Kelso or his fetish. \"Still hanging out with Rhonda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged. \"Sometimes. She's really sweet, and she's been helping with my homework. And we get lunch together sometimes. Oh, and I've been totally updating her wardrobe. How does such a sweet girl <i>survive </i>with only two pairs of shoes and the same basic clothes every day? Poor thing needed some variety, stat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled. \"And so, Jackie Burkhart swooped in and saved the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of <i>course</i>, I did! That should be my mission in life! Taking girls with no taste in fashion and beautifying them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's very kind that you're willing to share your wisdom with the world, Miss Burkhart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged cheerfully. \"Can't keep all this beauty knowledge to myself! Gotta spread it all over, like peanut butter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. Now I want peanut butter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie laughed. God, this was actually really fun. Were her dates with Kelso ever this enjoyable? She couldn't recall any actual attempts at witty banter. He was usually so physical. Get through dinner so they could make out in the car. Not much conversation. But with Eric... He just seemed to know how to make her laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation switched from friends to school to jobs to movies. Eric briefly remembered his self-promise to not discuss his fetish with her and felt momentarily proud of himself. Then, Jackie made a joke about the janitor, and he was steered away from those thoughts again. All he could focus on was this beautiful girl sitting across from him, and something told him that, fat or thin, Jackie Burkhart was the kind of person he might've fallen for no matter what.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"... So did you hear there's talk of a Muppet movie?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie squealed. \"Oooooh, I love Muppets! They're so cute! I love Kermit! He is adorable! I just wish he'd give Miss Piggy a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor guy doesn't know how good he has it, with a woman like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, totally! I bet they'd be totally sweet together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause as they looked across the table at each other, and the subtle parallels became apparent. Eric tried to smother a goofy grin, and Jackie hoped he didn't notice her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the moment was interrupted by their waiter bringing the food. They smiled courteously and thanked him before really looking at their dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Eric's meal was sufficient and looked great, Jackie's portions were enormous. She hadn't quite realized just how big the lasagna serving was going to be. The noodles, the cheese, the marinara... and a few pieces of garlic bread... God, was she drooling? She discreetly wiped her chin just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was already starting in on his food. \"Damn, this is good,\" he said. \"Gonna try yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked in surprise. \"Yeah... just... I dunno... marveling at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled. \"Yeah, it's a work of art. If you don't eat it, they'll just hang it in the Louvre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled and took her fork. It was such a huge plate. She hoped she had enough room. She grabbed a fork and one of the slices of garlic bread, and she dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, it was amazing. So delicious. If you could have an orgasm in your mouth, she would be halfway through her second by now. The food was simply to die for. She did her best to hold back a rapturous groan before digging back in for a second bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sat across from her, silently eating his dinner, only occasionally glancing up at her. When he did, though, he was treated to the delectable sight of Jackie eagerly gobbling up her dinner. Slowly at first, as she was savoring the taste, but faster and faster as she grew to love it. You'd think the poor girl hadn't eaten in weeks from the ferocious way she was inhaling that lasagna. And it was such a huge serving. How was she going to finish it all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so mesmerized by how beautiful her pigging out was that he almost forgot his own food. She was already halfway through her dinner before he remembered and set about finishing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was just lost in the feast. She was shoveling food into her mouth via the fork in one hand, and her free hand was slowly working its way down to her belly, feeling how full it was getting. God, she was so big and round, and this food was making her bigger and rounder... She thought of Eric's hands rubbing it, soothing it, jiggling it, playing with it... Now she was eating even faster. Gotta have more. Gotta get nice and big. Bigger for him. Bigger for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was barely three quarters of the way through her meal before she remembered she was in a public place. She began to slow down, feeling her cheeks redden as she glanced around the restaurant and saw maybe a couple of people looking at her funny. Regaining her composure, she sat up a little straighter and began eating a tad more daintily, sticking her fork very carefully into the food. She ate each piece very deliberately before dabbing at the corners of her mouth with her cloth napkin. She was a lady, dammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced across at Eric, who was sitting there with a restrained smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric Forman, don't you dare laugh at me in a public place,\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Can I laugh at you in the car on the way home?\" he asked, a slight waver in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot him a look. But seeing how hard he was trying not to laugh, she couldn't help but smile a bit, too. \"You're lucky you're cute,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remind myself of that everyday,\" he replied, almost recovered by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a small giggle, and her previous embarrassment melted away. \"How do you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say something almost witty that makes me kind of laugh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pretended to balk. \"Almost witty?? I'll have you know I'm the wittiest one in the group!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because Steven can't be bothered, Michael doesn't have the wherewithal, and Fez is just... I dunno, he seems lost most of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smirked. \"I'm nominating myself to be 'Most Sarcastic' for senior year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, you're a shoo-in. I'll have to see if I still have some sway with the yearbook committee. I've kind of lost touch with all my contacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks, but it's an honor just to be nominated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said you're nominating yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your point is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled fondly at him and shook her head, resuming her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but at last, she finished it all. She scraped up the last bits of sauce and finished off the last of the garlic bread. God, her breath was probably atrocious right now. But that didn't matter. What mattered was that she was stuffed. And not just stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <i>stu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-ffed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back in her chair and patted her bowling ball of a belly. She was so tired after all that hard work. Her stomach stretched so far in front of her, it was like a globe. She rubbed it soothingly, looking up as Eric was just finishing his own, much smaller, meal. He was just wrapping up when he looked up and saw her all bloated, sitting in her chair like a pregnant woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled amiably. \"Did you enjoy it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a weak nod, followed by a small hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was paying the bill, during which she just sat there and rubbed her belly. She wasn't ready to move yet. And when the transaction was finally finished, she still wasn't ready to move. She needed Eric's hand to help her get up. She was certain she heard a few joints in his arm pop as she was heaved to her feet. She waddled awkwardly next to him out of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was soon back in the car with him, but she was too full to even think of trying to buckle herself up. Eric, of course, was only to happy to do it for her. They had to adjust the seat again, but soon, she was safely buckled in, and she still had room to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were on the road, she felt it was safe to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I feel like a beached whale,\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled. \"Well, as beached whales go, you're a very cute one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swatted at him lazily. \"Hush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long ten minute drive back to her place. She kept kind of hoping that he'd put a hand on her belly and give it a soothing rub, but he was focused on driving. She pouted sleepily but accepted that was probably the sane thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, they were back at the Burkhart mansion. She groaned at the thought of having to go up those steps. Thankfully, Eric was ever the gentleman and helped her up them. She squeezed his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. She could hear her stomach gurgle as they walked. God, was this dress always this tight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, they arrived at the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are,\" Eric said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie drowsed sleepily. \"Just five more minutes,\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"Well, I guess I can stay that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down on the rather chilly porch swing. She snuggled up to him, wrapping her arms around him, and he did the same to keep her warm. He tried his best not to get hard just feeling her tightly-packed gut up against his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just sat there on the swing for a long time. They briefly tried gently swinging, but even the slightest motion made Jackie's belly lurch, so they kept still. It was okay, though. She was enjoying just being in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended up being much longer than five minutes. It was more like thirty before they both finally stirred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess... I should go in at some point,\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...,' he agreed uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled away to look into his eyes. He looked back at her questioningly, as if asking what she wanted to do next. She knew damn well what she wanted to do next. She put a hand behind his head and brought him in for a deep long kiss. His hands rose up and cupped her face, pulling her a little closer. They kissed for so long, you'd think they'd need to stop for air, but there was so much longing. So much desire. So much --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke the kiss, resulting in both of them breathing heavily. She put a hand to her chest and tried to calm herself down. He swallowed, surprised by the break in the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't think we should go any farther,\" she gasped. \"I mean... I want to, but... it's still the first date... and it's not like I don't trust you or anything, and I had a great time and everything, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too soon. I understand,\" he said, nodding vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Good... Okay... I think I should go... in... now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got off the swing, and he walked her to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\" she faltered, \"... good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" he replied. Then, he quickly added, \"I'll call you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right, you will,\" she said in that proud tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. He loved that unshakeable confidence. He contemplated kissing her again, but he didn't want to make the longing worse, so he settled for smiling and turning back towards his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched him walk down the steps and into the Vista Cruiser. Once he was back in the driver's seat, she saw him turn and take one last look at her before driving off into the night. She realized she must have the dopiest smile on her face as she turned and entered the house. Damn, that kiss had been hot. She knew she'd be having a very wet dream about him, his lips and his hands on her belly sometime tonight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following Sunday morning, Eric woke up feeling surprisingly good. It wasn't super surprising, given the night he'd had, but damn, he felt like life was good again. Like getting up and moving around was a fun activity for all members of the family. He hadn't felt this good since things had started clicking with Donna. It amazed him that starting a new relationship could be so invigorating. Before, the thought of losing her had petrified him, but he had to admit, he was really glad they had ended things, if only so that he could finally see Jackie Burkhart through new eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in his sock drawer and found the photo Jackie had sent him months ago. He still wasn't one hundred percent certain why she had sent it, but she'd apologized, so he didn't feel a need to dredge it up again. Had she been trying to drive a wedge between him and Donna? Well, if she had, it hadn't really been necessary. They had been heading for that break up at some point anyway. Might as well let it happen when it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the subject of the photo had taken a deeper meaning to him now. He wasn't sure what to make of it. Now that he and Jackie were more or less together, did he keep the photo or throw it away? What was the right move here? He tucked it back under his socks. He'd keep it for now. You never knew. He'd probably discuss it with her and see how she felt about it. No point in hiding these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was a problem for another time. For now, he had things to do. Like breakfast. He needed his 9am cereal. He got dressed and headed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his parents were tidying up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who's finally up, Mr Out-on-a-Date-Last-Night!\" laughed Kitty. \"How was it going out with Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good,\" Eric replied, preparing his food. \"Great restaurant. Good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remembered to tip the waiter, didn't you?\" Red said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, tipped generously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed held out his hand, and Eric sighed as he handed him the change. His dad smiled triumphantly and headed out towards the garage to go to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie came staggering in from her bedroom, wearing her pajamas and a fluffy white bathrobe that was completely open, allowing her belly to swing freely, only half-covered by her t-shirt. \"Morning,\" she groused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tutted. \"Looks like someone else was out having fun last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More fun than <i>you'll</i> ever have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, for heaven's sake,\" Kitty groaned, \"I know you're depressed about failing college and wasting our money, but that doesn't mean you should just mope around all the time. At some point, you're going to have to get a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie let out a moan while Eric feign-gasped. \"Mom, don't use the 'j-word' in front of Laurie! She'll turn to dust like a vampire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, you think your cute little retail job is so impressive?\" she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes more money than getting drunk every night does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure your mop and bucket are the talk of the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I can pay for my own stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough!\" Kitty said sharply. \"Both of you, either apologize and say you love each other, or just get away from each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric made tracks for the back porch while Laurie retreated to her room - with a can of beer and a few blocks of cheese. Kitty shook her head and resumed housework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric hung out shooting hoops for a while. It was his day off, and he was glad for it. He could fully appreciate the joy of the previous night. Of course, as he shot hoops, he found himself constantly looking at the Pinciotti house. He wondered if maybe Donna was home. They had barely spoken since the break up. In the early days, they'd managed a few words or at least an acknowledgement in the hallway, but now, she was constantly in the school paper's office. Sometimes, he'd see headlights out his window as she finally got home. He sometimes wondered if she was seeing anyone, but so far, it sounded like she was simply married to her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFooling around for a bit, Eric continued to let his mind drift until Hyde finally came from upstairs and joined him. It wasn't long before Kelso and Fez wandered into the driveway as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, look who's up and about on this fine Sunday morning,\" remarked Kelso, grinning goofily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled pleasantly back. \"Yep, I'm awake. Nice firm grasp of the obvious there, Kelso.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde caught the ball and held onto it, removing any pretense that some kind of game was going on. \"Okay, Forman. Spill it. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, tell us what you did to her, you son of a <i>bitch</i>,\" Fez said forcefully, still clearly jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blinked. \"Not much to tell. We went out. Had dinner. Fancy place, so she was happy. Rocked on her porch swing for a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make out?\" Kelso asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gentleman never tells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Hyde sneered. \"Since when are any of us gentlemen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point. Yes, we did make out for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's it?\" Kelso asked. \"Because you promised you wouldn't do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise kept. We both agreed to we're going to take it slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better not be <i>too </i>slow,\" Hyde grumbled. \"I remember you and Donna dragging it out for god-knows-how-long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be the first to know, my friend. You shall hear absolutely <i>everything</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, no. Not that interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to pass the ball between each other again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So things are good with you two?\" Kelso asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good so far. Gonna call her a little later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz you want to, or cuz she told you to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good luck with that. Phone calls with Jackie can go on for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I mean, we talk all the time anyway, so who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, imagine being able to not only <i>listen </i>to Jackie for hours, but to manage an <i>actual </i><i>conversation </i>with her for hours...,\" Hyde mused. \"The mind boggles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I admit, there are a several stretches where I just kinda listen, but every once in a while, she says something I have a response to, so you just gotta wait for it to come around,\" Eric explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Kelso said. \"I mean, I was never that good at the listening thing. Especially if the TV's on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I tried that. Bad idea when <i>Gilligan's </i>on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ball thudded right into his chest from Fez's direction as the fourth member of the group finally voiced his opinion. \"Do you love her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stared at him in bemusement. He looked so pouty when he was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm sorry, what?\" Eric finally croaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you love her?\" Fez repeated, looking like he was realizing just how he sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... just... idle curiosity...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric regarded him for a long moment. \"I don't think so... I mean... it's still the beginning. Love's one of those things that takes time, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso nodded. \"Although, word to the wise, if she says it first, say it back anyway. Otherwise, there's a lot of cursing involved...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... want to make sure you're doing right by her,\" Fez said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eyebrow arched from behind Hyde's shades. \"How's Rhonda, Fez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez was clearly thrown by the question. \"Uh, she's... she's great! Talked for hours last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, weren't you with us all night?\" Kelso asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't think we got home until midnight,\" Hyde agreed, \"and your girl Rhonda's an early sleeper, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez stammered. \"Well, I mean... maybe it wasn't last night. Maybe it was that afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blinked. \"You can't remember the last time you talked to your own girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can too! I just... Well, they say a little mystery is good for a relationship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when you're the one mystified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez tried to look confident. \"I was just going to meet her for lunch when we finish here,\" he said, puffing his chest out. \"Going to take her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to?\" Hyde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, a little mystery is good for a relationship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at him, clearly unconvinced. Feeling a little nervous, Fez loosened his collar and checked the watch he wasn't wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look at the time, I must be off! Good day, friends of Fez!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Fez -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'good day'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez turned and hurried out of the driveway and up the road, not daring to look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shook his head. \"What a maroon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, poor guy's got it bad,\" sighed Kelso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if even <i>you </i>can tell, he's <i>really </i>got it bad,\" Eric agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... wait, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tossed the ball back to Hyde. \"All right, I'd better get onto the whole 'calling Jackie' thing. I'll see you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you finish early, you'll be in time for dinner,\" Hyde grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric headed off into the kitchen and checked around to make sure no one was around. God, he wished he had a phone in his room. He picked it off the cradle and dialed the number. After waiting a few seconds, he heard someone pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burkhart residence,\" a lovely voice that made his heart dance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric! Oh my god, I am so glad you called! You will never believe what Stacy Hargrove is wearing today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled warmly and settled in for a good long listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He probably could've handled Jackie falling for someone else is she'd met someone outside the group. Or gone back to Kelso. Or hell, even Hyde would've been understandable - the guy <i>was </i>kinda dreamy. But Eric?! How was it that after all that time arguing or being pissed at each other, they were suddenly all loveydovey and best of friends and enjoying each others company? Fez practically worshiped the ground she walked on, made sure she knew it every day, and she chose <i>Eric</i>? What, indeed, the hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stormed his way up the road until he saw Rhonda's house in the distance. It was only now that he began to realize that it was going to be a tad rude of him to just show up unannounced. It was going to be a pain in the ass to walk all the way down several blocks to his own house to call her, though. But he had to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he spotted a pay phone not too far away, readily available. Checking his pockets, he found a few quarters with his cash, so he scurried over and stepped inside. He deposited the coins, dialed the number and waited, hoping that he could get her and not her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rings, he was greeted with a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhonda, hi! It is Fez!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetie! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering if you were free for lunch today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm! Always free for lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! I shall meet you at your house soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Thanks, Fezzie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up. Great. Now he had to wait a while and see if he could make it look like he'd actually walked several blocks. He did the math in his head and knew it sometimes took fifteen minutes to walk all the way from his house to Rhonda's. This was why he needed friends with cars, which was probably why he shouldn't be so quick to burn bridges with Eric anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered that as a foreigner, just standing around in one spot for fifteen minutes was going to look strange to this super-white neighborhood, so he'd better go for a fifteen minute walk. He figured he could walk seven minutes in one direction, then double back. He started walking in the direction of his host parents' house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, this had gotten complicated quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he arrived back at the house, he was exhausted. He staggered up to Rhonda's front door and knocked. She answered the door, smiling at him behind her enormous glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Fez! Let's get going! I'm starved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, dreamboat,\" Fez panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay? You look tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I... got held up, so I ran the rest of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you didn't have to do that for me,\" she smiled. \"You're just the best boyfriend ever, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled but groaned internally. He was having one of those internal arguments that he preferred to ignore. That part of him that was a good guy was angry that he was treating Rhonda like this. She was a very nice girl who adored him, and here he was still scheming over Jackie and being all petty towards his friend Eric because she preferred him instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He spent all that time trying to romance her away from Kelso, and instead, she prefers Eric Forman.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nice part of himself promptly gave the asshole part of himself a kick in the metaphorical 'nads. <i>Knock it off. This girl is crazy about you, and you were crazy about her until this whole Eric/Jackie thing started. Stop being an idiot and accept that you never had a chance with Jackie, and start noticing this pretty awesome girl.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez gave a discreet sad sigh. His nice guy self was right. He was being a tool. Rhonda was walking beside him, talking animatedly about something, and he wasn't even listening. He was always trying to encourage her to speak up more and get over her shyness. And now she was, and what was he doing? Stewing over Jackie, a girl who saw him as a friend at best and the hired help at worst. He re-focused on what Rhonda was saying, figuring he could catch up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, there was a gap in the conversation, and he spoke. \"So, any preference for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda thought for a moment. \"Hmmmm... kinda feeling like pizza today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can hit the pizzeria up the street. Extra large with pepperoni and sausage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, my favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we'll grab some fries on the way, seeing as how you're so hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled at how her chubby face lit up at the mention of food. Seeing her happy made him feel good, especially when he was the cause of it. He took her hand in his and led her to their destinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour, they were on a picnic table at the park on this lovely spring day, and between them sat an enormous pizza with a big basket of fries and two cokes - one small and one large. Before long, they were chatting away about school, life and candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez had about three slices of pizza and a few handfuls of fries, but Rhonda was naturally a much heavier eater. Over the next hour and a half, she ate the remaining five gigantic slices of pizza and the entire basket of fries, plus a her entire beverage and what was leftover from Fez's. Her legs were spread apart for her overstuffed belly sitting between them, rubbing it under the table. She let out a small hiccup, causing her to blush with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...,\" she moaned, wishing quietly that she could unbutton her skirt in a public place. \"I feel like such a pig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled winningly. \"Well, you are a beautiful pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared, then laughed awkwardly. \"I mean... I... well, I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Fez reached across and put a hand on her belly. \"Rhonda, I think you are one of the most beautiful women on the face of this Earth, and no amount of food you eat is going to tell me otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda stared at him for a long moment before a silly smile split across her face. \"I'd come over there and hug you, but I'm so stuffed I can't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then allow Fez to come and assist you,\" he replied, getting up and going around to hug his fat girlfriend around the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just hugging him back when she let out a small burp from the pressure, directly into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis the music of the angels, my dear.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna sighed to herself as she sat back in class. It was that last class of the day, and she was itching to get back to her much roomier officer desk and rolling chair, as opposed to this cramped little formica desk/chair combo. God, her gut was wedged in tightly. She could barely breathe. Why didn't they make these dumb desks adjustable for plus-size students? Just because she was overweight didn't mean she shouldn't be comfortable, right? How did her fellow fat students deal with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the boredom finally released her as class ended, and she was free to go. She gathered her things into her bag very slowly and deliberately, waiting for her classmates to leave. As soon as the last one filtered out the door, she immediately began the ridiculously-challenging task of getting out of her desk. Her stomach and butt were now so large it was a struggle to jam herself into the desk, and even harder to remove herself. She had discovered how big she had gotten when, one day, she'd tried to stand up and brought the desk up with her. After that humiliation, she wasn't about to try that again in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, like a cork in a wine bottle, she popped herself free. She rubbed her sore belly, knowing she probably had a great big red line going across her flesh. Trying super hard not to pout, she waddled out of the classroom with her bookbag over her shoulder. At least her clothes fit better since she bought bigger ones. If she was going to be fat, she was determined to be as comfortable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed for the writing room to work on the paper like she always did, already mentally working on how she was going to word a paragraph in the first article. When she glanced in the direction of the lockers down an adjoining hall, her eyes fell on Hyde and Kelso talking while Kelso fussed with getting his papers organized and Hyde making no effort to help. God, she hadn't spoken to them in a couple of months. How had that even happened? She'd buried herself in her work that she never spoke to anyone except her parents and the newspaper team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe it was time to do something about that, she thought. Go over and talk to them. Catch up with them. Reconnect. Something. Anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she made the walk down the hall towards them, just as Kelso was finally getting his shit together, and Hyde was checking his watch. \"Hey!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both whirled around and looked at her in surprise. \"Donna?\" Hyde asked, clearly gaping, allowing his zen to slip for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big D?\" Kelso said, staring in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna forced a smile. How much weight had she gained since she last saw them? She was enormous, compared to how she'd looked before. She hoped she wasn't blushing. \"Yeah, it's me...,\" she said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso let out a laugh and embraced her in a hug. \"Damn, Donna, look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man,\" Hyde added, patting her shoulder. \"You never call, never write, never visit... Your mother and I are very worried,\" he added, indicating Kelso as the 'mother'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm sorry,\" Donna sighed. \"It's just... after things ended with Eric, I just... needed to lose myself a bit, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso shrugged. \"Well, you haven't lost that much, by the look of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde gave him a thump on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed. \"I know, I know... I spend so much time behind a desk these days, I'm not getting a lot of physical activity. And I'm constantly eating whatever junk food the rest of the crew brings in. I seriously need to do something about all this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not gonna be much help on that front,\" Hyde shrugged. \"We've got a long day of goofing off ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we were gonna chill on the couch and fall asleep watching TV,\" agreed Kelso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'll be fine,\" Donna said, deciding she wanted to shift the conversation in a different direction. \"So! What's new with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shrugged again. \"Not much. Workin' at the Foto Hut still. Kelso's sleeping with anything that moves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso grinned sleazily. \"Yeah, but only the good-looking things. I mean, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, glad to hear it,\" Donna said, rolling her eyes. Time to get to the meat of it. \"How about Eric? How's he been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not bad, since he hooked up with Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought Donna up short. \"... Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde hoped he didn't wince too obviously. \"Uh... yeah, Forman and Jackie are together now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... How together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, 'talking on the phone, going out and making out' together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they've only been together for a few weeks, but they look like they're doing pretty good,\" Kelso nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at him. \"And... you're okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso shrugged. \"Well, it was a little weird at first, but Eric's a good guy, and he promised not to have sex with her for a while, so that's good... And I guess it's good to have Jackie off the market so I don't end up with her again. Frees me up for more sexual activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, that's a good way to look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was still reeling. \"Yeah... well, it's good you're being so mature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso grinned. \"Yeah, being a senior is totally making me grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is. Well, I gotta go work on the paper. I'll see you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay, we'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kelso trailed off as Donna turned and walked back up the corridor before he finished, watching as she stormed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...,\" Hyde sighed. \"That's the last time we're gonna see her for another two months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stormed off, already trying to forget them. Eric and Jackie?!? Seriously?!? Sure, she'd already heard something, but her ex with her best friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The best friend she hadn't really spoken to in months...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were supposed to hate each other! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But people change.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could they do this so soon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's been months...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she hated this. She made it to the printing press and set to work, angrily typing, trying to focus on her work. She typed so fast, she'd finished six pages before the rest of the team entered, carrying several pizzas in their arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boss!\" one of the girls said. \"We brought dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Donna said, leaning back from her seventh page. \"God, I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others each took a couple slices and got to work, Donna found the pizza she was looking for - sausage, green peppers and pepperoni. She was positively drooling. She half-heartedly helped her team with their articles like she was supposed to, but once they were all off and running, she began frantically chowing down. She knew she shouldn't be freaking out like this. She should be focused on her work. But what the hell? She'd finished her part early. She had time to pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that she wanted to. She just couldn't stand the thought of Eric and Jackie together. Because it meant that Eric had well and truly moved on. That he had found someone else that wasn't her. That he wasn't obsessed with her anymore. That he was scheming to reunite with her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat her scrawny little neighbor boy didn't need her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that tiny little bitch. Yes, she knew Jackie was fat now, and that no doubt was a big part of Eric's attraction to her, but dammit, why did that midget have to swoop and steal Eric like that? Since when did she even care about Eric? He was everything she hated in a man. Specifically, not very manly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so angry and bitter that she didn't realize until she'd taken the last bite that she'd eaten the entire pizza. But she was so ravenous - how could she possibly be full now? She found a regular cheese pizza that was only half gone and started in on that. All four slices. Into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time their meet was done, Donna was stuffed. Her belly was desperate to pop the buttons off her flannel plaid shirt. Just explode off. She peered down and saw how much they were straining around her fatness. Was it seriously time to update her wardrobe already?! How was she ever going afford this? Even her job at the radio station wasn't going to cover this at the rate she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the newspaper said goodbye and closed up for the night, all set to print the paper for tomorrow. Donna volunteered to take care of everything so they could all leave. Once the door was shut, let out a sigh of relief, letting her overstuffed belly expand to its true size, and one of the middle buttons popped clean off. She groaned in embarrassment, which then became a moan of pain. Holy crap, she was full. She leaned back in her swivel chair, rubbing her stomach. So utterly gorged. What a pig she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna peered down at it sadly. What was she going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed there was still a few slices left. With a blank expression, she started eating them, just as ravenously as before. Might as well finish them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was waddling out to her car, another button was gone. They were in her pocket, because she was determined to sew them back on when she got home. Okay, so women shouldn't have to sew, but dammit, she liked this shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got into her car, and she quickly found that her engorged gut was pressing against the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, what had Eric done to her? How could she be such an utter pig? What was happening to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was the Dairy Queen drive thru still open? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three oreo blizzards and a dilly bar later, Donna finally made it home. It was a super struggle to remove her stubbornly-small seat belt, and when she finally got it off, it almost shot across into the windshield, but she caught it in time. Her stomach was so utterly stuffed after such a long day of gorging, she thought it a miracle she'd only lost two buttons. Sighing sadly to herself, Donna got her door open and just barely managed to uncork herself. She awkwardly climbed out of the car and onto the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her house, she cast a glance next door at the Forman house. She quietly wondered whether or not he was home. A dark thought traipsed across her mind, and she wondered if Jackie was there, too. For a moment, she was really angry, but then her tummy gurgled, and all thoughts ceased. All that anger was just fueling her gluttony. Stupid Eric, making her stress eat like this. She caught her profile in her shadow on the wall and grimaced. So round. Enormous belly, enormous ass, enormous boobs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe it wasn't all bad, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifled all thoughts of Eric and food from her mind. She had school work to do. She had to start brainstorming tomorrows paper. She had a few interviews lined up. Things to prepare. Unlike Jackie, she had better things to do than worry about how fat she was getting and how much food she could cram into her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the kitchen door and was stunned by the buffet of food that filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hello?\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the kitchen door swung open, and in walked Midge, who was, since the last time Donna had seen her, <i>very </i>fat indeed. Big belly, big butt, even <i>bigger </i>boobs... At first, she didn't even notice her daughter had come home. She went straight for a meat tray and started nibbling away when she looked up and saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Dawnnah?\" she asked through her full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge swallowed. \"Oh my gosh, sweetie! I feel like I haven't seen you in days!\" she squealed, waddling over and hugging her daughter in a big meaty hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna let out a yelp as her mother's big stomach collided with her own stuffed stomach, hoping she didn't suddenly barf all over the back of her mom's blouse. She managed to hold it in and pulled back. \"Mom, oh my god, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sweetie, but you spend so much time at that school that I feel like I haven't seen you in forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's okay, I just... what's with all the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...? Oh! The food! I'm having a little get together with some of the ladies in town! They're really into this whole eating thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Remember when you said that a woman shouldn't be judged by her weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well... yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I told some of the ladies in my social circles, and they were interested, and then they told some of their friends, and so on and so on, and now, we're all gaining weight together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on in! I'll introduce you! Oh, and help me with some of these trays. Your dumb father won't help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes but agreed as she helped her mother with the trays of admittedly delicious-looking food, bringing them into the living room. Her jaw dropped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWall-to-wall fatties. Women of various sizes filling the room, sitting on the couch, the chairs, the floor, the stairs, anywhere they could fit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared in stunned silence as they all cheered at the sight of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge waved. \"Everyone! This is my daughter, Donna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Donna,\" a few of them muttered as they proceeded to dig into their respective dinners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna watched as they started pigging out on food. Meat, fruit, veggies, breads, grains, pasta, dessert, dessert, and even more dessert...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, it's like a drug den for gluttons,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge nodded cluelessly. \"Isn't it great? Thank you so much for this idea, Donna! We're all so happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, Mom, this wasn't my idea! All I said was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That women shouldn't have to worry about being thin for men! And you were right! We've all been enjoying porking up! All that food out there, and all that weight we're gaining - we're gaining it for women everywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women cheered and whooped in agreement between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna watched in silent wonder. How was this even possible? \"Where's Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, probably down at the bar or something. He hardly ever talks anymore. I don't think he's all that keen on the new and improved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge shook her head, making her jowls jiggle. \"No! In fact, I guarantee you at least half of these women's husbands have left because they gained weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but aren't they upset about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they were a bit... But then I brought out cake for us all to eat, and that helped a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, they're just smothering their feelings with food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Isn't it wonderful? No more wasting tears over men because we're too busy eating cake to bother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed. \"Mom, look, I still agree that women shouldn't be judged by their weight, but deliberately stuffing yourselves to immobility isn't the answer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's way more fun than bothering to worry about what men think of us! Who needs 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down with men!\" a very large older woman bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down with men!!\" the whole group chanted, their mouths full of whatever they were eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Midge cheered. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, sweetheart, mommy needs to get in on those bowls of skittles before Betty eats them all.\" She waddled into the group and laid out on her back and placed her head against a woman's leg. The woman took the hint and used a massive scoop to pour several skittles into Midge's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stood in the doorway, her mouth agape, almost certain she could see her mother's massive stomach swelling from the cascade of candy pouring inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, she struggled through the overstuffed room and up the stairs to the safety of her bedroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jackie did a silly little dance to herself as she slipped on her XXL jeans and a great big fluffy sweater. The weather was cooling off, and she was enjoying being snug as a fat little bug in her new autumn clothes. She was still giddy at the thought of what had taken place in her life. She was dating Eric Forman. A year ago, she'd have thought such a fate would be worse than death, but she'd found the scrawny little nerd boy was actually very sweet and loving, not to mention cute as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, he was super into her fatness. Whenever they made out, his hands were always exploring every blubbery curve. It made her feel sexy in her own skin, something thought she'd always felt before, but not quite like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was kind of hoping he'd step things up a notch. She was super into her fatness and stuffing herself, but he was strangely restrained in that regard. Like, he was holding himself back. He was more concerned right now with just having a good time. She liked that for the most part. It showed he really valued her as a person. But she wanted him to show his appreciation for her weight in other ways. Preferably, sexy ways. Mainly, <i>edible </i>ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one day, she nabbed her father's credit card and went out to the local Piggly Wiggly to see about making a piggly wiggly of herself. She loaded up on everything that looked good and extra fattening to her. Creme-filled doughnuts, chocolate chip cookies, thick peanut butter, whipped cream... She had to really try not to just eat it all right here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held strong, though, and one swipe of the credit card later, she was driving home and ready to implement her plan. She took all the groceries upstairs to her room and got on the phone to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, it's me!\" she said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you'd like to hang out at my place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I like to hang out at my rich girlfriend's enormous mansion? Gosh, what a decision...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Come on over, spaz. I'll be in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up, and she bit her lip excitedly. She wanted to do this right. She needed to change into something attractive, but not to the point it was obvious she was trying to turn him on. She searched her wardrobe, and then she found a button-down shirt that might have fit her a couple sizes ago. Curious, she tried it on. It just barely fit around her globular middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with the effect of the strained fabric, she waited by the window as the Vista Cruiser pulled up in her driveway. He stepped out and took a look around - he was always amazed by her house - and his eyes fell on her window. She smiled and beckoned him to come up. He waved in response and hurried to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie set up the food around the bed. She found the remote for her room's TV for background noise. She knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, when Eric arrived in her room, he was greeted by the sight of Jackie wearing very tight clothes and surrounded by a buffet of sugary goodies. His eyebrow skyrocketed at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eric!\" she said in a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey, Jackie, what's all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just thought you could join me for... lunch, I guess you'd call it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" She pulled out the remote. \"Plus, there's a Twilight Zone marathon right now, so I thought you'd like to watch with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile split across Eric's face. \"Yeah... that sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed and patted an empty spot on the bed next to her. He kicked off his shoes and joined her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders while she turned on the TV, and Rod Serling began telling them another really weird story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started very casually at first. She had a box of chocolate chip cookies, which she very occasionally shared with him. He got maybe five of them, while she ate the remaining twenty-five. It was when she discarded of the empty container that she had started getting his full attention. He was clearly trying very hard not to stare, his eyes nervously twitching between the TV and her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling discreetly, she gave her belly a gentle pat before reaching over and grabbing a box of doughnuts. She didn't even offer him anything this time. She just went to town on all six of them. And god, they were good. Who would've thought being seductive could be so yummy? She chomped through the chocolate-frosted creme-filled heavenly baked goods and had them all gone before the first episode was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just tossing the box onto the floor when she let out a thunderous belch. Her hand flew instinctively to her mouth, but then she saw the look on Eric's face, and she realized, hey, maybe that was hot to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Excuse me...,\" she said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're excused,\" he replied lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled fondly. He was such a dork. She reached into her bedside table and pulled out the jar of peanut butter and a spoon. She was pretty full by now, but she figured he was pretty aroused right now, so she wanted to milk this. \"Unnnngh,\" she moaned in an exaggerated fashion. \"I'm so full... Eric, can you help me with this?\" She held out the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blinked in confusion as he took it, but when she opened the jar of peanut butter and held it out to him, he realized. \"Oh. Uh... sure...,\" he managed awkwardly. She leaned back against her pillow, and he proceeded to spoon the thick substance into her open mouth. She ate it down and took a sip of water before opening her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could scarcely believe this was happening. The TV was pretty much forgotten at this point. He was way too focused on this beautiful girl lying before him, hands atop her fat gut while he fed her peanut butter. He stole a glance at the ingredients and gaped at the calories momentarily. How was she doing it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was, as it happened, doing it very well. She was getting very full now, but she wanted more, and she wanted Eric to give it to her. She wanted him to fatten her up until she couldn't move. She wanted him to care for her. She had always been such a spoiled girl growing up. Given everything she ever wanted. Now, she was going to be a greedy little piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amazed them both that they were soon halfway through the jar. Jackie's tastebuds were crying out at this point, so she held up a hand to stop him. \"Okay... time to switch gears,\" she croaked through her thickly-coated mouth. She took another swig of water before she tried to move, but she was so stuffed, she couldn't. \"Eric... there's a can of whipped cream on the nightstand. Could you get it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's eyes widened in excitement. \"Uh, sure, yeah,\" he said, trying to smother a smile. He had to crawl over her to get to it, but he managed to get his hands on the can in question and brought it over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie let her arms splay out over the bed as he was over her. \"Thank you,\" she said before opening her mouth for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized where this was going and hoped he didn't look too obvious. He placed the nozzle on the tip of her tongue and sprayed a great big dollop for her to gulp down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled teasingly. \"I think you can do better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blinked in confusion before she puckered up. At first, he thought she wanted a kiss, but then he saw her eyes on the nozzle and got the idea. Smiling slightly, he placed the nozzle between her lips and gently pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's eyes rolled up in her head as the stream of cream filled her mouth and was gulped down her throat. God, this was hot. She could feel herself swelling up. Her stomach was steadily filling up, and she could feel those buttons straining against that great orb as it became increasingly engorged. She let out a pleasured moan as the can kept filling her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, for his part, was watching half-aroused, half-amazed. How was this happening? Was he going to wake up in a minute? Where was this going? Were they going to...? Damn, he didn't think to bring a condom. Still, watching her gorge herself for him was still amazing, and he felt he should just be grateful that she was doing this at all, and clearly enjoying it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, there was the sound of the can finally depleting itself. As Eric removed it from her lips, Jackie let out a low moan as she clutched her stomach. Eric stayed over her, staring into her half-open eyes as she took in a few deep breaths. There was a soft <i>plip!</i> and something bounced off his shirt. They both looked to see that one of the buttons had finally burst off of her shirt. They stared at that little bit of belly bulging out of the now-bigger gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Did I do good?\" she asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric leaned down and gave her a gentle kiss. \"You did great,\" he replied. \"But then, you always are, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. \"Damn right. Hic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't have sex, even though both wanted to. He didn't have protection, and she was too stuffed to really get into it. But they had other ways to please each other, and when that was over, a couple more buttons were missing from Jackie's shirt. As the day went by, they lay together on her bed, half-watching the TV and cuddling, his hand rubbing small circles on her overstuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jackie dozed off, she snuggled into him and enjoyed the dreams that were coming her way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric had a lovely day with Jackie. After the marathon ended and she'd slept off her food coma, she'd been hungry again, and they'd ordered a pizza. He had one slice and she had seven. This had been followed up with a rather steamy make out session and lots of belly rubs and cuddling. So he was in good spirits, and in underwear that probably needed changing, when we drove home and walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just reaching into the fridge for some juice when the living room door burst open, and in walked Red and Kitty, looking ready to tear him a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, look here, young lady,\" Kitty started, \"you can't just waltz -- oh, sweetie, it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank god,\" Red sighed, leaning against the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I think this is the happiest you've ever been to see me since I was born,\" Eric deadpanned as he resumed pouring himself a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sweetie. We thought you were Laurie,\" Kitty explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What's she done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's eaten us out of house and home! That's what she's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smirked. \"That's a shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you eat dinner already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jackie and I had pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank god, because there's precious little food left in this house! I had to feed Steven corn flakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, they heard a car pulling up, and they saw a cab on the curb. A few moments later, Laurie came stumbling out, threw some cash at the driver, and she waddled awkwardly up the driveway towards the kitchen door, her massive belly swaying horizontally and vertically simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good lord...,\" Red groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled. \"Well, I'll be in my room, <i>not </i>being a financial drain on the family. Have a lovely evening.\" And with that, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed and Kitty watched despairingly as their daughter stumbled awkwardly through the kitchen door. Her clothes were way too small for her at this point. Her enormous stomach bulged out from under her t-shirt and hang over the waistband of her jeans. Her meaty thighs stopped moving a few seconds after the rest of her, and her extra chin wobbled as she looked back and forth between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was bemused to see them both glaring at her with their arms crossed. She wasn't sure what to say. Hell, she wasn't even sure why they were angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she belched instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRRRRRP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed closed his eyes disparagingly while Kitty just looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased that she momentarily had the advantage of them, Laurie smiled sleepily. \"So... I had a lovely evening. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, what the hell do you think you're doing?\" Kitty demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I had a late lunch, then an early dinner, and then a late dinner, and now I'm home for an early midnight snack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart,\" Red said awkwardly, not really wanting to confront his beloved daughter. \"I know you're feeling down about... not finishing... college...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Failed', Red. Just say it. She failed college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I failed college,\" Laurie agreed. \"I never wanted to go. Well, more accurately, I just wanted to go for the parties and the keggers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed stared at her incredulously. \"Excuse me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, are you drunk?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Y'know, I might be just a little bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, sit down!\" Red snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie sat down rather clumsily in a chair, her hands atop her belly. \"Sitting, daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen to me, young lady! You've been coasting on our money for the past few months. Now, we let it slide because we thought you were going through something, but if all you want to do is eat and sleep, then it's going to be with your own money from now on! You're going to be getting a job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence as Laurie stared at him. Then, oddly, she started laughing uproariously at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed stared at her for a long time, momentarily bemused, before he realized she wasn't taking him seriously. So he activated his most furious glare, hoping it would get the message apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie continued to laugh for a few seconds more, until the glare fully registered. The laughter gave way to silence, which in turn to annoyance. \"Oh, god, you're serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right we are, young lady. If you're going to spend all your time eating, it'll be on <i>your </i>dime. Comprende?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glared at him for a long moment. He wasn't budging this time. And just pouting wasn't going to help her now. \"... Comprendo,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed's glare became a very fake smile. \"Well, good! I'm glad we came to this agreement! I'll be sure to leave the want ads under your bedroom door! And if you don't have a job within a month, you're out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie did her best not to roll her eyes, settling for a contrite nod instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed turned on his heel and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty's neutral expression gave way to a smile. \"Well! Hope you find something good, sweetie!\" she said before scurrying after her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie sat in the kitchen for a long time. God, it had come to this. She'd have to get a stupid lame ass job. Like a regular person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach made a grumbling noise as it worked on digesting her day long feast. The gravy train was truly over. Sighing sadly to herself, she heaved herself up and waddled to the fridge. Not much since she'd pretty much inhaled the entire contents last night. She found a bottle of salad dressing and began to drink it. One last free gorge before she had to... *<i>shudder</i>*... work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning, things were rather calm around the Forman household. At least, as calm as could be, at any rate. Eric and Hyde were enjoying teasing Laurie for having to get a job. She, in turn, sneered at them that she was going to find an adult job, as opposed to Price Mart and the Foto Hut. This, naturally, led to a few jokes about going into porn. Laurie was initially insulted, but then seemed thoughtful, so Red put the brakes on that by handing her the want ads again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty made them all breakfast - small portions for Laurie as punishment for spending their money - and went about the day. As they all one by one departed for work - and Laurie to her bedroom - Kitty went about her day, putting away dishes and general cleaning. As grueling as it could be sometimes, she really did appreciate these moments to herself. She went outside and proceeded to sweep the back porch when she heard raised voices from next door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going out for more <i>food</i>, Midge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>God</i>, you're such an <i>ass</i>, Bob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the door slamming, and then angry footsteps headed the direction of the Forman house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty blanched. Midge was angry and hoping to come to her for someone to yak at about it. She wondered how quickly she could run inside and hide in the living room. Wait until Midge was gone. Pretend she didn't live there anymore. Hail a cab from the front yard and hide in Mexico with endless martinis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely had time to get to the handle of the sliding door when Midge's very heavy footsteps rounded the corner and were coming up the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kitty! Glad I caught you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grimaced internally and slowly turned around with a fake smile on her face. \"Well, hi there, Midge! What's going...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was as far as she got as she took in the sight of Midge waddling up the driveway towards her. Good lord, the woman was enormous! Possibly three times as big as when they'd last seen each other. Kitty wasn't even really sure when that'd been. She watched her grossly overweight neighbor come up to her, her enormous stomach swaying back and forth, her titanic breasts bobbing up and down, her thighs rippling with every furious step...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kitty found herself <i>very </i>interested in what was going on with Midge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Bob's being an <i>ass </i>again!\" Midge snapped. \"He's so rude to me! He doesn't want to have sex or do anything! And all because I'm gaining weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty blinked, then forced a look of shock on her face. \"Oh! Have you gained weight? It's hardly noticeable! So I didn't notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge nodded emphatically. \"Yes, I have! And Bob's sure as hell noticed! He doesn't understand! Women shouldn't have to be skinny and trim to attract men! They should love us for who we are on the inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty nodded distantly. \"Okay... and Bob's not going for that, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! And it's so heartbreaking! I wish he'd get his head out of his dumb stupid ass and appreciate what he has in me! All the girls in my group do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you remember that group of housewives I get together with and get talk about important feminist issues with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty tried not to grimace. \"Oh, them!\" she exclaimed, still feeling relieved her nursing duties prevented her from taking part in such discussions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've been gaining weight together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're sick of men judging us based on our bodies! Why shouldn't I be allowed to stuff myself with junk food whenever I want? Because some <i>man </i>told me not to? And it's all thanks to Donna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! She got me started on this whole thing! It's wonderful! It's a real bonding experience! Y'know, whenever I see her! Every once in a while. When she's not busy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty saw her neighbor's eyes turn a bit sad. \"Are you okay, Midge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah. Just Donna's never home anymore except to have dinner and sleep. Spending all that time at her school newspaper. I mean, I'm proud of her for running it, but I never see her, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty nodded sympathetically. \"It's all part of that painful process of letting them grow up and... leave home,\" she sighed sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge pursed her lips. \"Yeah... gosh, I'm hungry. I want to go back for lunch, but I don't want Bob to think I'm just crawling back to him... And I left the car keys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty braced herself for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, would you mind if I came in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sure... Midge... Why not?\" Kitty forced out. \"Aha ha ha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you! I just need something to tide me over until lunch!\" the bloated blonde squealed as she shuffled past her into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty found herself immediately forgotten on the back porch as Midge waddled to the fridge and blatantly began to raid it. Whatever leftovers there were from breakfast were soon being devoured. Fresh fruit on the counter. The orange juice - good lord, she wasn't even using a glass! She grabbed a container of mixed nuts and poured a large amount of its contents into her mouth. Once she'd gotten them all down, she let out a belch and raided the cupboards for the chips and cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty sighed. They'd finally gotten Laurie to stop eating their food all willy-nilly, and now <i>Midge </i>was eating them out of house and home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if they should give Midge the want ads... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weeks passed, and Laurie found herself unable to land a job. The truth was - and she didn't want to admit to it - that she had no real skills outside of looking all sexy and getting men to do what she wanted when she wanted. She had a few interviews for various positions - from receptionist to other receptionist - but her usual tactic of showing cleavage and flirting with the interviewer didn't work. She'd ballooned so much that her usual brand of sexy wasn't working anymore. She tried to tell herself that every single interviewer must've been gay, but deep down, she knew that wasn't true. Her extreme weight gain was preventing her from using her only true talent. Now she had to have actual skills if she was going to get anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepressed, she looked over the want ads one more time, and to her dismay, the only thing on there that looked even remotely possible was a job running the drive-thru at the local Fatso Burger. She grimaced at the thought, but she went ahead and called them. Might as well give it a shot. It would suck to have to go in there and not be able to buy the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, she arrived at the restaurant and found the manager's office in the back. She gave a tired knock and popped her head inside. \"Excuse me, I'm Laurie Forman. I'm hear for the drive-thru interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager was much younger than she'd expected. Possibly a high school senior. He was scrawny, wore glasses and looked up apprehensively, like he was cripplingly shy. \"Hi, Miss Forman,\" he squeaked. \"Why don't you just have a seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie walked all the way in. She hadn't really bothered to look sexy this time. Just normal jeans, a dress shirt, a little makeup, and her hair curled just enough. She awkwardly placed her considerable rump upon the comparatively small chair, but she was relieved there were no armrests. She sat as straight as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a look of astonishment on his face as he seemed to be noticing just how large she was. At first, she thought it was disgust, but then, she saw how he was looking at her, and she saw him swallow before he started the interview, and that's when she realized - was he into her?! Immediately, her brain sprang back into life and went into overdrive. There was hope for this yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" he said awkwardly. \"My name is Peter. Welcome to Fatso Burger. Do you have any previous experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shook her head, putting on her biggest doe eyes. \"No, I don't. So... you'd have to teach me how to do it.\" She threw in a bashful smile for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. The guy was already putty in her hands. He stumbled on. \"Oh, that's fine,\" he said quickly. \"What's your availability like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm <i>very </i>available,\" she said with a silly giggle, followed by a flirtatious wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy blushed heavily and fumbled through his papers. \"Uh... so, weekends are okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie tried not to wince at the thought of giving up her weekends, but she knew she needed this job to keep living rent-free in her parents' house. Besides, she wasn't really partying it up on weekends anyway. It was now more of a whenever-the-hell-she-felt-like-it kind of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... weekends are fine,\" she said, trying to keep the flirty tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wrote down on the forms. \"That's good... What would you say is your greatest personal strength?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie bit back a smirk. Too easy. \"Oh, I'm a really easy person,\" she said. \"It's one of my best assets.\" She leaned forward just enough that he could see down her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like he was going to drop his pencil. \"Um... any weaknesses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes... I can be a bit of a pushover... and I give in easily... as you can see...,\" she said with a shy smile, giving her belly a light pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush was getting so red, he'd probably be able to guide Santa's sleigh. He was really was into her. \"I see...,\" he squeaked. \"Well... I think I can go ahead and give you the job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie lit up. \"Oh, you really can?\" she gushed. \"Oh my god, thank you! You're my hero!\" she squealed, leaping to her feet and jumping up and down excitedly a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter smiled modestly. \"Oh, it's nothing. I see potential in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I bet you do</i>, she thought wryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her some forms to sign. \"We'll do your orientation and, er, if you don't mind me asking... what size uniform will you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" she smiled. \"The keyword here, Peter, is 'extra-extra-large'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to nod casually, but she could tell from the way he crossed his legs under the desk that he was excited now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the forms were filled out, and she was on her way out. She decided to order a large chocolate shake as she left to celebrate, but he insisted on paying for it to \"welcome her aboard\". She smiled all cheerfully at him, which he tried to play off coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her shake and walked back to the car, pleased with herself. Employment achieved. She'd probably have to make out with that scrawny little loser a few times. Bend over a few times to show him her ass, leave the top buttons on her uniform open, and maybe eat a large cheeseburger with her gut hanging out a few times, and that would probably be enough to tip him over the edge. Keep talking like he was this big damn hero who'd saved her from unemployment to make him think he was all manly and stuff. In her experience, any man would always believe a lie if you told him he was the hero of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her shake and drove home, pleased with herself. Okay, so it was a degrading job in a fast food joint, but it was work. And it was full of delicious burgers and fries. And all those milkshakes to consume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if maybe she should go ahead and get an XXXL uniform to be on the safe side...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna grimaced and wiped the tears of pain from her eyes as she attempted to jog. She was trying to burn some poundage by doing laps on the school track. It had seemed like such a sensible dream on paper. Get out there, just start running. Start sweating these damn pounds off. But she hadn't quite realized how many of these damn pounds she'd gained lately. Her thighs were rubbing together furiously, making her huge fat thighs red and sensitive. Her massive gut was bouncing up and down, jostling her boobs somethin' fierce. The sweat was glistening, accompanied by her exhausted wheezes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely finished two laps before she slumped realized she was going to pass out soon. She waddled awkwardly off the track and collapsed on the bleachers. She rolled onto her back and let her arms fall limply on either side, one clattering against the floor and the other dangling limply. Her belly heaved up and down with every weakened breath. The sun was beating down on her, which was not the best thing for her Wisconsinite body. She was used to at least feeling a chill in the air. Grunting, she sat up a little and looked around. Not a soul in sight. Thank god, because this super-stretchy tracksuit was suffocating her. She reached up and weakly managed to pull the zipper down, allowing what little breeze there was to flow across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her gut expand as she set it free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding her big meaty arms out of the tight sleeves, she let out a sigh of relief and let a small smile overtake her plump lips. She quickly scowled. She was too fat. She was pathetic. How could she be letting this happen to herself? What had Eric done to her? When had she become such a glutton? Why was she hooked on stuffing herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why was she suddenly craving an ice cold coke when water was healthier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was just considering a nap when she heard footsteps that were passing by. And here she was, half-naked, in her bra, her huge gut hanging out for the world to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a word, shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, she slipped her open tracksuit around her shoulders and tried to cover herself. She looked around, trying ascertain the identity of the footsteps, and her heart plummeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jackie. The brunette was waddling up along the pathway towards the track, sipping from a Big Gulp and munching on a chocolate bar. Of all the people she could be looking at, it had to be her former best friend who was now dating the former love of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she potentially in her field of vision, Donna slipped the suit's sleeves back on as she turned and awkwardly ran back down the bleachers and towards the edge. She had to hide. Forget just getting dressed. She had to hide entirely. It was way to weird to see Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning was difficult, but she pulled it off just long enough to get beneath the bleachers. She knew that wasn't enough to guarantee she was invisible to the naked eye. She had to hide deeper within their depths. She climbed under the metal staffs, which was a tough squeeze. She made it through the first few, but on the fourth, she was taken by surprise when she couldn't move forward anymore. She was too big to make it through. She tried and tried, but it was no use. She tried to move back, but to her alarm, she couldn't do that either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, crap, ca-a-a-a-a-ap...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, what are you doing under here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Jogging?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay... well, the track's over there, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. Donna couldn't even turn around to face her in her current predicament. She was wedged like a cork in a bottle. Then, to her horror, she found that she hadn't finished zipping up her tracksuit, which meant her gut was still hanging out, and she couldn't reach around to remedy the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need some help?\" Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No. I don't. I'm fine. I'm just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... stuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie rolled her eyes and eased her way around the beams until she found a wide enough opening to slip through. She came all the way around and let her eyes growing wide at how similarly wide Donna was. Even the dark, there was no mistaking the redhead's enormous belly wedged between the beams, with Donna at such an angle she could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glared at her. \"So are you gonna stare at me all day, or are you going to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shook the shock out of her head. \"Sorry, I was just... Come on. Let's try moving you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she helped Donna get her awkwardly-angled arm out from between the beams so she could more effectively try to pull herself free. She managed to squeeze herself backwards a bit, but she let out a hiss of pain when her belly failed to move, still wedged between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause as they realized there really only one way for her to get her gut free, and it was going to involve Jackie's hands touching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So...,\" Jackie drawled. \"I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just... get on with it,\" Donna said with a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded and reached forward, digging her fingers into the sides of her old friend's stomach. God, it was huge. Bigger than hers. So soft. Like a big meaty pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now it was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging her hands in under the fat, Jackie squeezed the stomach together until it was narrow enough to slide right out of the bulkheads. Once free, Donna reversed quickly away and crammed herself back into the tracksuit. Even in the dark, her face was beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she replied quickly. \"Sorry, but I've gotta go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Donna! Come back!\" Jackie called after her friend's retreating form. \"We haven't spoken in months! We need to --!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to what? Talk about how you're dating my ex?! How you're satisfying him in a way I never could?! How you love his weird fat fetish when I can't?! Because it's too weird, Jackie! This is sick and unhealthy and I hate that he did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's anger flared at that. \"Did what to you? Made you fat? He may have gotten you started, but you look like you're twice as big as when I last saw you! Which was months ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's his stupid fault! His fault I can't stop eating! I hate that I've become this! I'm sorry we can't all get off on it like you, but some of us have to live with the reality of being this big! Of being unhealthy! I can't even jog anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe if you didn't spend all your time behind a desk, hiding from us and the rest of the world because you couldn't move on! At least <i>I</i> get out and do things between gorging myself, unlike <i>you</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Screw you! You don't understand anything! You're just a dumbass sophomore! All you care about is lip gloss and Teen Beat and looking good! I'm going to have a career! <i>I'm</i> going to get out of this stupid town and away from you and your new burnout friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... They're your friends, too. What do you think they would think if they heard you talk about them like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, when did Jackie become the morally superior one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I gotta go,\" she mumbled, turning and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, please don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. She stormed from under the bleachers and into the daylight. Wiping her eyes clear of tears, she waddled off back into the school. She didn't want to look back and risk seeing Jackie crying, because then she'd just run back and hug her, and she couldn't do that. She just couldn't. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She winced as she ran through the closed cafeteria. She hadn't been thinking. The path back to the writer's room was this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, don't panic. It's closed. No food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was angry and sad and emotional as hell... and she just wanted to smother those feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed through the open door into the kitchen. There had to be something. Anything. Didn't matter if it was crappy school food. It just had to be FDA approved. She pulled open a fridge and was greeted by several tupperware containers. Cold mac n cheese. Cold chocolate pudding. Score! She grabbed a plastic spoon from the register and started devouring the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just hurt so much. Knowing that Jackie was really right. She didn't want to feel shame for pursuing her career, but she knew she was only pursuing it as a way to escape from the reality that she and Eric hadn't worked out. And they were supposed to work out! They were the perfect boy-meets-girl story! It wasn't fair! He ends up with the bitchy self-entitled cheerleader? Bullshit! How the hell did that happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she polished off the mac n cheese and moved onto eating the pudding, she reflected that Eric wouldn't have ended up with Jackie if he didn't have real feelings for her. The fact that they both shared his fat fetish didn't mean it was the sole driving force in whatever they had. And god, to think that Kelso was somehow okay with Eric dating his ex. How was it he was somehow being more mature about this than her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudding was done, and her belly was full. But she was still emotional. Needed more. Needed to drown those sorrows. She walked around a little, feeling her stomach sway like a wrecking ball. Then, she saw it. Bottles of coke. Warm, but there was a bottle opener next to them. She set to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started prying off the caps and guzzling them down. How was this happening to her? How was she stuck in this situation? Why was she doing this to herself? Why was she so determined to shove everyone away? She didn't even connect with the other kids on the school paper! She gave her orders, ate most of the free food that <i>they </i>paid for, and that was that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was her dream. She wanted to be in journalism. Interviewing people. Traveling the world. She was going to college. She wanted a future. And she wasn't going to find this in Point Place. Burning bridges was the best thing for it, right? Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down her fifth empty bottle of coke, and then let out a window-rattling belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...,\" she moaned, clutching her belly. \"I can't believe I -URP!- did that... Unnnnnngh - URP!- ....nnnnngh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it. She'd come here to exercise. Get in shape. Burn some calories. All the carbs and sugar and caffeine she'd just consumed. She'd have to work even harder at it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she remembered that she was in a closed cafeteria with minimal school security and figured she'd better escape before one of those incompetent janitors thought to come and find out who belched. Clutching her huge gut like the overstuffed balloon it was, she heaved herself out the door and towards the newspaper room. She didn't think she'd be doing any writing, but she definitely needed a nap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Eric got the phone call from Jackie and she greeted him with a shaky voice, he knew right away that it was going to be bad news. But he took comfort in the fact that, while her crying a bad thing, it wasn't because of him. So he made sure to stock up on her favorite snacks on the way up and hurried to her big fancy house. He had no trouble finding his way in, and when he got there, treats in hand, he was glad he'd picked them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was a sobbing mess on her bed, surrounded by food wrappers from a burger joint and a large empty styrofoam cup. She was in her sweats - a sure sign that she didn't care what she looked like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gently knocked on the open door. \"Jackie...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up from behind her kleenex. \"Oh, Eric!\" she gasped, trying to pull herself together. \"I just... Oh god, I can't believe it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-D-Donna hates my <i>guts</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna?! Wait, back up! What happened exactly?\" he asked, hurrying to join her on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sniffled and blew her nose a little. \"I was walking across the football field to walk a few laps... and Donna was there... and she ran from me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to whimper again, so Eric wordlessly handed her a chocolate-frosted doughnut with sprinkles. She gratefully took it, took a bite, followed by a swig of whole milk, and then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then... she tried to hide under the bleachers... but she's really fat now, so she got stuck... and when I tried to help her... she got all mad at me for dating you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started crying fresh tears, but she was determined to get through this, so she crammed the rest of the doughnut into her mouth to stop herself from continuing to sob. Once she had it chewed and swallowed, she sniffled pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Donna had no right to talk to you like that,\" Eric said firmly. \"I admit I wasn't the best boyfriend to her, but that has nothing to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... I just... When did we stop being friends? I mean... we used to be so close...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric put an arm around her. \"I know you were... But, hey, it's her loss, if she can't handle all the awesomeness of Jackie Burkhart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled ruefully. \"You know all the right words, nerd boy,\" she said, wrapping her arms around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there on the edge of the bed, just holding each other, and soon, Jackie started to feel better. Just being with him helped her tremendously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" she said at last. \"You brought me more than one Krispy Kreme, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laughed and disentangled himself from her so he could open up the bag more effectively. He pulled out the large box, revealing the remaining eleven doughnuts, all sat neatly in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie actually licked her lips in anticipation. \"Ohhhh, Eric, you know just the right kind of therapy a fat girl needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...,\" he replied in his 'sexy' voice, \"... it's even more therapeutic if someone feeds them to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, Mr Forman? So... would it be even more therapeutic if someone fed them to me while straddling me while I rest on my pillow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grinned. \"I suppose it could be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, just asking, would it be help even more if I had that someone pour milk down my mouth to wash it all down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... I think that can be arranged,\" Eric murmured, clearly trying to downplay just how excited he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled, removing all the food wrappers and kleenex surrounding them. \"Come on then, nerd boy,\" she said, already unbuttoning her pants. \"Stuff me like the fat piggy I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grinned and took the box with him as he settled himself across her pelvis. \"Eat up, fatty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took out the first doughnut and held it out to her. She took a 'shy' little bite with big innocent eyes before chomping down hungrily and finishing it down. He grabbed the half-gallon of milk she had and let her take a few sips from it before moving onto the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was in hog heaven. All these doughnuts, and he was feeding her. She wished she had known how sexy being fat could be years ago. To think she had been missing out on this calorific sex show. She loved to be stuffed. It made her feel so sexy. That utter tightness in her tummy, like she had swallowed a bowling ball. That firmness that came with it. How when she gave her stuffed tummy a slap, it sounded so rock hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts briefly drifted back to Donna, who was easily a few sizes bigger than her, but somehow, she hated it. Donna was such a strong independent woman. How the hell could she be so upset over being fat? The bigger girl had looked gorgeous with that gut of hers hanging out. How was she not into that? How could she be so oblivious to how sexy she clearly was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thoughts soon returned to the situation at hand. Eric Forman - skinny, twitchy, sarcastic, nerdy - was stuffing her full of doughnuts, and judging by the growing hill pressing into her, he was clearly enjoying it. God, this was sexy. She wanted him so bad right now. Perhaps how was the time. With twelve doughnuts, a triple-decker cheeseburger, an extra-large fries and a chocolate shake in her stomach, she was so utterly stuffed, she wasn't going to be leaving the bed anytime soon anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, with all the snacks depleted, he was still straddling her, but giving her the gentlest most caring belly rub. She swooned as he proceeded to run his fingers up and down her enormous gut. Digging into the fat. Caressing every curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you...,\" she breathed in a husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric slowed to a halt, looking like he wasn't sure if he'd heard her correctly. \"Jackie, I... I want you, too, but... I don't have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wordlessly reached into her nightstand and pulled out some condoms. He stared at her in amazement. She smiled in response. \"I got these after your last visit,\" she explained. \"Just in case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are the best girlfriend ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh! Now slip one of these on and tell me what a naughty fat piggy I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric ripped off one of the condoms. \"Oh, you really are a fat little piggy, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a gluttonous pig... One day, I'm gonna make you so unbelievably fat, you'll never be able to move again, and all you'll be able to do is just lie back and let me feed you and make you even bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god, Eric...!\" she moaned, clutching her stomach. \"I wanna get so big for you! I wanna be your sexy stuffed fatty all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric finished putting on the condom and leaned in, giving her a long deep kiss. Jackie clutched his face and pulled him closer. This was gonna be fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie's new job was basically just her sitting on her ass all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically, it was against regulations for the drive-thru personnel to sit on-duty, but she grew tired of standing after only ten minutes and whined to her FA boss that her feet hurt, and he'd immediately caved and given her a very tall stool to sit on. It wasn't much, but even she had to admit that getting a recliner back here was probably too ridiculous. The rule was she had to hide it whenever they had an inspection. Except he was already arranging her schedule so she wouldn't be here on those days anyway, so whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been on the job for a couple weeks now, and already, the benefits were rolling in. Free food, for openers. She was supposed to get a discount, but Peter was covering that himself out of his own paycheck. God, the guy was an idiot. He actually thought he stood a chance with her. But she knew how to play him pretty well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, this special treatment hadn't exactly earned her any friends at work, but she was pretty much isolated in the drive thru booth all day. No co-worker contact necessary. On the plus side, she saw that Peter wasn't that hot of a boss with his subordinates anyway. The guy clearly relished what little power he had. Clearly someone who had learned all the wrong lessons after being bullied in high school. This wasn't the \"I'll take a long hard look at myself and figure out how to be a good person in spite of this\" kind of guy. He was more the \"I'll have my revenge by taking my frustrations out on these hapless fast food workers\" kind of guy. Not that Laurie had felt at all bad about playing him, but if she had, this knowledge would've made toying with him easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, really, this was the ideal setup for her. She tucked into her second cheeseburger of the day and took another order. This was easy, too. Just type in what the person wanted and pass it along to the kitchen. Take their money at the window and move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine her surprise when a familiar voice rang through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'll have a triple-decker Fatso combo with extra cheese, extra pickles and no lettuce or tomatoes, two large fries and a large chocolate milkshake, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie blinked. Wasn't that Donna's dumb mom? \"... Ten ninety-two. Please pull around to the first window,\" she answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Laurie pulled back her window to find herself face-to-face with a very fat Midge Pinnciotti. She was so large she seemed to fill up the entire front seat, with her enormous stomach pressed against the wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger woman lowered her enormous sunglasses and peered through the checkout window at her server. \"Laurie?\" she asked, bemused. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stared back. She hadn't seen Midge in so long. What the hell was happening? \"Uh, yeah, it's me. How've you been, Midge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine, sweetheart! It's so good to see you looking so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm... Yeah! So! Whatcha been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y'know. Not much. Just getting some lunch before I meet up with my women's group for Linner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's like brunch is breakfast and lunch, but with lunch and dinner instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're seriously going to eat all this and then go have more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! It's empowering! Eating until you're so stuffed you can't move is the way of the future! All the women in my group are doing it! And we're spreading the word! We're encouraging every woman we meet to have a little extra! More burgers! More pizza! More calories! More carbs! More salt! More sugar! More -- !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>HONK HONK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both peered over their shoulder and saw someone else at the drive-up intercom was waiting impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge slunk back into her seat and sheepishly handed Laurie the money. \"Of course, some aren't as passionate as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded faintly as she inserted the money into the til and gave Midge <i>some </i>of her change. \"Okay, well, I'll probably see you around a lot then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I imagine so! A full belly is a happy belly! And this place keeps my belly full and happy!\" She hefted her enormous gut for emphasis before driving on to pick up her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie watched her drive off in a slight stupor before moving on to take the next annoyed customer's order. It was weird seeing the former fitness queen Midge inflated like a beach ball - <i>three </i>beach balls. And apparently, there was a whole group of women fattening themselves up and spreading the fattening word. She quietly wondered how well it was taking effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to pacify the woman over the intercom, she offered her an upgrade to a large fries for free, which was accepted, in addition to the extra large combo they just ordered. When the woman drove around, Laurie took note that it was another fat woman - not quite Midge's size, but plump - and several old fast food wrappers in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemed Midge's fattening gospel was spreading, all right.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jackie was waddling much more cheerfully through the high school that day. Her first time with Eric had been amazing - for a first time, anyway - and she was beaming as she made her way to her locker. It was such an odd thing to think that Eric Forman of all people could make her feel like that, but after the last few months, it felt even weirder to picture her life without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't seen or heard from Donna since the unpleasantness under the bleachers, and frankly, she was glad. If that was going to be Donna's attitude, she didn't need her in her life anymore. She would be just fine without her. She had other friends, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, one such friend was waddling in her direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie! Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rhonda! Ready for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda snorted playfully. \"Only, like, always!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda had probably gained at least five pounds since the last time they'd hung out. The plump nerd had felt very free to eat whatever she wanted lately. Fez hadn't seemed to mind. And dammit, there was just so much good food to eat, she wanted it all. So every article of clothing she had was elasticated and extra-roomy as her gut charged ahead and grew much rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled. Rhonda's appetite had certainly been on the rise lately. But that was okay. Jackie was still in the process of gaining more weight, and she liked having an almost equally fat friend to have a good gorge with. Shame they had to rely on cafeteria food at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna bet they're going to serve that instant mashed potato powder again?\" Jackie grimaced as they got in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sucks,\" said Rhonda, but she then acquired an impish grin and leaned in close. \"I also have a jumbo-bag of marshmallows in my backpack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's enormous grin threatened to split her face. \"Oh my god, you are my hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda shrugged bashfully. \"Well, y'know. Hungry girls. We gotta eat, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right! Just because they serve crap here, why should <i>we </i>suffer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went through the line and got their lunches. Sadly, their boyfriends didn't share their lunch break with them, so they were on their own. Not that they minded. It was fun having girl time together. Jackie would help Rhonda with fashion, and Rhonda would help Jackie with schoolwork. And there would be much eating between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the two girls were more focused on eating. They only kinda had some of the cafeteria food before they gave in and went to town on the jumbo marshmallows. Not wanting to risk them getting confiscated, they ate with their backs to the supervising teachers and huddled in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie couldn't resist putting her hand on her belly while she ate, enjoying its mighty heft. So much sugar. There were probably twenty-five calories in each piece. And there were probably forty marshmallows in the entire bag. Just thinking about that was enough to make her a little wet downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, between the two of them, Jackie and Rhonda polished off the entire bag with still ten minutes left in their lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...,\" moaned Rhonda. \"I'm stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too,\" Jackie sighed, rubbing her stomach. \"God, what a gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee. You look pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant with a giant marshmallow baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both giggled in a silly way before settling down, hands atop their bellies and matching dopey grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Jackie's eyes peered around the cafeteria curiously. Her eyes flitted around from student to student. One thing she couldn't help but notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot more fat girls than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she wasn't sure how, it seemed like a majority of the female student populace was gaining a bit of weight. Once slender girls were now sporting double chins and fuller faces, while husky girls were now sporting some large potbellies and thunder thighs. Some of them clearly didn't notice how big they were getting, or at least were in denial, as several of their clothes were struggling to hold all their respective fatness inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were a lot more girls eating fattening food. Hell, a former friend from the pep squad who'd once been rail thin was now struggling to keep her cheer sweater over her swelling belly as she tucked into the cafeteria fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me...,\" Jackie said quietly, \"...or all a lot of the girls here getting a little... heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda came out of her sugar coma to take a glance around. \"Yeah... I guess... So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... Just seems... odd. All of a sudden, the girls around here are gaining weight all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now that you mention it, it's kind of strange... Still, I mean, no big deal. What was that whole thing about not having to live up to society's beauty standards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, yeah, totally. It's just... interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat back and observed their fellow fatties milling about, stuffing their face holes in silent fascination. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna sat morosely in the school newspaper's office. She could just barely fit in her editor's swivel chair at this point. She could hear it groan as she tried to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last week, she'd been letting the others have a go at being editor-in-chief of their dinky little school paper. She didn't like relinquishing control like that, but she was still feeling bad about her blow up at Jackie, and frankly, it was only getting worse. The more she replayed the explosion in her head, the more she realized she didn't have much of a reason to be angry. Jackie and Eric were realistically free to do whatever they wanted. So her best friend and her ex were... doing stuff. At least her old friend shared Eric's weird creepy little fetish for fat chicks. He could stuff her full of calories until her heart gave out, for all she cared. If that's what he got off on, then they could do it together until Jackie reached the ripe old age of forty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed sadly. She was letting the anger get through again. That pathetic bitterness that was driving her crazy. She didn't wish that on Jackie. She didn't really hate her or Eric. She was mad at herself. Logically, breaking up with Eric had been the right thing to do. They didn't have that much in common, and what he'd done was not cool. He had clearly been sorry, but it had been a breach of trust. He'd accepted her decision and moved on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also mad at herself for pretty much abandoning her friends. She had always been career-minded, but now she hardly saw her friends or her family. She missed the guys. She missed the basement. She saw them occasionally, but usually as a casual wave from across a crowded hall. She liked most of the other kids on her editing team, but they were... eh. Nothing special. Good solid team, but they didn't seem interested in hanging out with her after printing the paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting slouched in her chair, she grimaced when she saw her big meaty hands were casually resting atop her giant belly. She hated that she did that, but dammit, it was just so comfy. Why did her fat have to be so cozy? She kinda missed going to the gym. Except, not really. It was nice to not worry about that and simply let herself go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't like Jackie. She couldn't get off on it. Being fat wasn't sexy for her. It was just what she was now. She liked to eat, and getting fat was just a side effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit, her writer's block wasn't going away. With a hefty grunt, she unstuck herself from her chair and went for a walk -- or rather, a waddle. She tried to convince herself she wasn't going to go eat more food, but she had a feeling she was. She could really go for a big thick juicy greasy cheeseburger right now. With buckets of curly fries. And an extra-large chocolate shake. With loads of whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed sadly as she walked up to the burger joint not far from the school. She hated that this place had opened so close by. And she <i>really </i>hated that it was pretty affordable for a student to frequent. She ordered her meal and took to an open table, hoping maybe she'd think of a new story while she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe probably would have if she hadn't eaten the whole thing - the whole triple-patty with the works - in less than ten minutes. She must've been hungry. She let out a sad groan as she went to town on the extra-large curly fries. Still nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just slurping down the last of her XXL chocolate shake when something caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many fat girls here today. Like, a lot of them. Of various ages. Some were her own age, but others were older, and they were all swarming this little snack shack place. At first, Donna didn't think much of it, but the more she looked, the more she saw how ill-fitting a lot of their clothes were. Clearly, these were women who were gaining weight faster than they realized, if they had yet to update their wardrobes to something bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna observed the men as well, but none of them seemed any different than usual. Whatever was going on must only be effecting the women. Bloating them up. Making them gain weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly observed as two teenage girls, who were only a little pudgy, began wolfing down enormous burgers and fries, not unlike she herself had been just minutes ago. She watched an older woman order two enormous milkshakes and proceed to alternate drinking from both of them. One girl was practically pouring a huge bag of curly fries into her greedy little mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna watched all this in quiet fascination. Once she was feeling up to it, she began waddling back towards the school. So many questions began running through her mind. What was happening around here? Was there some kind of epidemic? Something she didn't know about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it something she could blame her own weight gain on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it back to the office and jammed her enormous ass back into her chair. She rolled up to the typewriter and started banging away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriter's block -- officially defeated!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna sat at the large wooden table as closely as she could. With her enormous stomach protruding in front of her, it was a bit difficult to sit close enough. She hunched over so her big billowing arms could rest on it, getting her various papers settled, trying to look somewhat professional, even if it was only a school paper she was preparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounding her were the other members of her \"staff\". Five other students, who were all part of the \"investigating team\". They all sat in a somewhat lazy circle around the table. They liked Donna well enough. She was a great leader, and she certainly took a lot of strain off their work, seeing as how she was such a control freak she did most of it herself, but they sometimes thought she was trying to hard. This was a high school newspaper. Sure, some of them were interested in such a profession one day, but the way Donna ran things, you'd think they worked for an actual paper. Constantly chasing down stories. Getting hard-hitting interviews with the staff. Going out and getting answers about the funny smell in B Hall. It was more than a little exhausting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...,\" Donna said, going over her notes. \"I don't know if you guys have noticed, but there's been a weight gain problem at this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her junior journalists, Matt, spoke up. \"Oh, come on, Donna! Don't be so hard on yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said Belle, another one. \"You've got nothing to be ashamed of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, then closed her eyes in frustration. \"No...,\" she groaned. \"I don't mean <i>me </i>. I mean, <i>the population in general</i> is gaining weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her cohorts shrunk back, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent that they would probably all shut up after that, she continued. \"So! I want you guys to put your feelers out there and find out how this is happening. Matt, Chris - I want you guys to interview some people and ask them about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, a photographer, blanched. \"You mean we have to actually walk up to fat people and ask them why they've gained weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't word it <i>quite </i>like that...,\" Donna sighed, before turning her attentions to the other three. \"Belle, Amy - go down to the burger shack near the school and talk to the staff and customers. Business over there has been pretty big lately. Find out why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss,\" Amy said, gathering her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Dave...,\" she finished, looking over her notes. \"... I guess there's nothing left but to interview the school band about their latest fundraiser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" Dave grumbled. \"More stories about the band geeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you're not interviewing a bunch of fatsos,\" replied Chris, but Matt gave him a sharp jab with his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's it,\" Donna sighed. \"Let's get some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, Dave and Chris gathered their things and departed quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Belle stayed back for a few minutes to write down a few interview questions. Donna quietly observed them as she gathered her things. They were two of the only truly slim girls left in town. Amy had long flowing red hair, much like her own, and nice jeans and a plaid shirt, while Belle had curly brown hair and wore a lovely blue dress. She envied them so much right now. They were nice and fit. Everything she had once been and now was not. It wasn't fair. How did they get through the day without constantly eating? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. Eating. Now she was hungry again. This was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her friends had gone, Donna determinedly strode to her car. Not going to eat. Not going to eat. Not going to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe repeated that mantra all the way to the Hub. She parked her car and put on her coat and sunglasses, hoping she wouldn't be recognized. Not that she probably would be, anyway. She'd gained so much weight that most people she'd known for years didn't realize it was her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna walked inside and gazed around, hoping no one she knew was here. She began her stride to the line before the counter, but her eyes opened wide at the sight of the enormous woman in front of her. She couldn't avert her eyes from her enormous backside, like two mighty marshmallows crammed into a pair of jean shorts. The back flab that was hugged by the pink top she wore. The big roll of flab that encapsulated her neck. The way her pillow-like arms rested lazily on either side of her. The way her enormous jugs rose and fell with every belabored breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched in wonder as this gargantuan woman became next in line, and she waddled awkwardly across the tiled floor to the counter and gratefully leaned against it. \"Two large cheeseburgers, no pickles, a basket of fries, and a large cola,\" she huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier nodded and took the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared as she took a step forward, waiting for her turn. How could this woman eat like that? She turned her head around the room and saw that she was not alone. A lot of plump girls surrounded her, much like at the burger shack. Some were still a bit thin but pigging out excessively with massive dinners of fries, burgers and pizzas, and already-fat girls happily gorging themselves stupid with even more of the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat woman in front of her received her order and waddled away. Donna ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a coke, and then went to sit down in a corner where she could observe everything. As she ate her own food, she stared in open amazement as the women of Point Place made huge pigs of themselves. Food was ordered and devoured, and big bellies grew bigger. She watched in amazement as they laughed, talked with their friends, and didn't seem to notice how big they were swelling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fell to the fat woman who'd been in front of her in line. She wasn't with anyone. She had a whole table to herself. She just plowed through it all. The burgers, the fries, the soft drink, everything was crammed into her belly. Her pink top was slowly rising up the sphere of her gut as she crammed it fuller and fuller. By the time half an hour had gone by, she was leaning back in her chair, the food completely consumed, and she was rubbing her stomach in a very self-satisfied way. Donna watched in amazement as she even unbuttoned her shorts and covered her mouth as a belch worked its way up. She sat back in her chair with a silly grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna watched her for a long time. After just sitting there for at least fifteen minutes, the woman got up, re-buttoned her pants and waddled out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily disturbed to realize she'd been pretty much ogling some random fat woman for the last hour, Donna tidied away her mess and left her table. She took one last look at the fattened females all sitting around her, seemingly oblivious to what their monstrous meals were doing to them, and made her way outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to save this town from itself. Somehow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna heaved herself out of her car, pleased that it had only taken four tries this time, and waddled her way up to the house. She was determined that <i>that </i>was the last time she would stuff herself full of greasy salty takeout. It was time for something healthy. Carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, anything that could start counteracting the effects of so many months of burgers and pizzas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the kitchen and made a beeline for the fridge. There had to be something. Anything healthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there wasn't. Much to her shock, there was nothing but junk food and various meats. Hot dogs, pork chops, candy bars, soda, maple syrup, ranch dressing, and just about any other fatty food that required refrigeration that you could think of. Even the freezer was overloaded with ice cream. Hissing in frustration, she turned to the cabinets, but found nothing but sugary cereals, popcorn, chips, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the last of them closed and stormed into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was her mother. Zoned out in front of the TV. Watching some crappy soap opera. A couple empty fast food bags strewn lazily about. Hands atop her enormous belly. Her over-inflated boobs almost blocking her view of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glared at what she perceived to be a wreck of a human being. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge blinked and rolled her eyes in her daughter's direction. \"Oh, hi, sweetie. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Mom, what happened to all the food in the kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is the food gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the <i>healthy </i>food is gone! You know, the vegetables, the fruit, the grains...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean the <i>boring </i>food! Yeah, I guess after we finished what we already I had, I just didn't buy more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you bought a gallon jug of maple syrup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we like it on our pancakes! And it's a good mid-day pick-me-up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?! Mom, this is insane! If this is all you're eating, how are you even still alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge shrugged. \"I dunno. I mean, it's not like I never eat vegetables anymore. I just... prefer cheeseburgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Mom, this is not healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I feel so good! Better than I have in years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about what dad thinks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! That ass? Why should I worry about what a man thinks of me? Besides, he's never here anymore. He's been spending more time at work. I won't let him sleep in the main bedroom anymore. He keeps making snide comments about my weight! Can you believe him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna closed her eyes. Her parents were so unpredictable when it came to whether or not they wanted to stay together. They'd renewed their vows, but it had only taken a few months for them to start bickering again. And now, with her becoming \"less physically attractive\", one of the few foundations of their relationship was crumbling. She didn't want to be a hypocrite and give her mom hell for the same thing as her dad, but dammit, this wasn't supposed to be enjoyable. She didn't want this. She wanted to lose weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what she kept telling herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna? Sweetie, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, I just... Mom, why do you like being fat so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge smiled. \"Because it's so freeing! I can just eat whatever I want whenever I want! And so what if I gain some weight? So what if I have to go up several pant sizes? I still feel beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shuffled. \"Yeah... Wish I felt the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie... You know you're beautiful. Doesn't matter if you're a size 2 or a size 20. You just have to learn to love yourself as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words entered Donna's brain, and deep down, she knew her mother was right, but... she was still stubborn as hell, and she didn't like it when she was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mom,\" she said quietly. \"I'm, uh... going to do homework now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sweetie! I'll see you when dinner's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the fact that dinner was probably going to be delivery (again), Donna waddled her way upstairs and hid herself in her room. She leaned against the door and wrapped her arms around herself. Dammit, why had Eric done this to her? He'd awakened some kind of gluttonous demon that had been slumbering inside her, and now it had assumed control over her. Like, had she always been such a pig deep down? It had just taken his machinations to let that inner-piggy out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flitted to the full-length mirror hanging from her closet door. She stared at her reflection for a long time. She didn't even really recognize herself anymore. Bits of her face were still the same, but she had such puffy cheeks, a prominent double chin, dimples... Okay, so she didn't have an ugly fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed at the rest of her. The big double belly, the lack of gap between her thighs, her thick arms, her enormous boobs... She ran her hands over them, gently jiggling them... It was pretty kickass to have way bigger boobs now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, no, stop, wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her hands fall to her side again and shook her head. She sat down at her desk and got her books out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelf-love was going to be a long road for Donna Pinciotti </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jackie and Rhonda had been sitting in Rhonda's bedroom doing schoolwork together. Jackie was relieved she had found a nerdy friend to help her out. Her grades hadn't exactly been crap before, but now they were much better, thanks to Rhonda's little study tips and tricks that helped a LOT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd holy crap, this girl could eat. It was so nice to have someone who shared that gluttonous desire for more food. Okay, she didn't necessarily share the fetish itself, but she appreciated a good fattening meal now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the schoolwork over, Jackie leaned back on the bed and rubbed her tired eyes. \"Ugh, I'm so glad that's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda giggled. \"Feeling the burn, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think it's in the back of my corneas somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her friend set about tidying the books away, Jackie tried to make sure she had everything required of her crammed into her head.  \"You know what we need to relieve the pressure?\" she asked. \"Food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda raised an amused eyebrow. \"I think that's just gonna add a different kind of pressure,\" she said, playfully flicking the already-tight button on Jackie's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie swatted her away. \"No, really. We're going to get hungry, and hunger eats away at the brain. We can't retain knowledge with empty stomachs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your understanding of neurobiology is severely lacking, but... I could really go for a burger right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Only one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda blushed slightly. \"Well... maybe one <i>really big</i> one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... One the size of a tractor tire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fatties giggled to each other like they were ever-so-naughty and got in Jackie's car. They considered the Hub, but they'd been eating there a lot lately, and the food there just wasn't the level of grease they were looking for. Fatso Burger it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they entered, they weren't surprised to see how many overweight women chowing down. The increased girth among females in Point Place was becoming a more common sight. They stood in line and ordered double cheeseburgers, fries and shakes and waited patiently for their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were waiting, Jackie's eyes flitted past the counter and into the back room. She could see various employees wandering around, going about their business, and if she looked closely, she could see the one working the drive thru intercom. To her surprise, it was a very fat blonde woman. A very fat blonde woman who seemed to be on the verge of bursting out of her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very fat blonde woman she recognized as Laurie Forman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was sitting on her too-tiny stool and chomping down on a burger. Upon closer inspection, she was actually surrounded by a small pile of empty burger wrappers, french fry containers and drink cups. Her free hand was being used to take orders and receive money from customers, but other than that, she was barely moving at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Laurie glanced in the direction of the dining area, and her eyes widened when she saw Jackie. There was a long awkward pause until the blonde motioned to someone Jackie couldn't see that she was going on her break now, followed by her downing the last of her burger and shuffling out of the back towards the door while another employee scrambled to take over from her. A few coworkers glared at her as she shuffled through the door towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie! Hey!\" Laurie said, looking a little flustered. \"Surprised to see you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, you, too,\" Jackie replied, looking the bloated blonde up and down. She couldn't help but eye the buttons on her uniform shirt straining to keep that big fat belly from surging forward. \"Eric mentioned you got a job. Didn't realize it was here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda arrived with their food. \"Oh, hi! Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhonda, this is Eric's older sister, Laurie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh! That Laurie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie sneered in response. \"Yes, that Laurie. Come on. Let's all have a seat. I need a real chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led the two bewildered friends over towards a small table in the corner, away from everyone else. They sat in a small triangle as Jackie and Rhonda unloaded their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some fries?\" Rhonda asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie waved her away. \"Oof. No thanks. I've had enough fries for one day,\" she said, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah, I saw all the empty wrappers around your work station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like you're one to talk. Look at all that food <i>you're </i>putting away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I <i>paid </i>for mine. How much did you pay for <i>yours</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie snorted. \"For your information, the staff eats for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you're on the clock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not if anyone from corporate is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda looked surprised. \"So... you just eat all day while you're at work? How do you get away with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked. \"The boss has a crush on me. Poor guy can barely concentrate when I bend over in front of him in these super-tight slacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" grumbled Jackie. \"So you're just manipulating this poor guy so you can get free food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please. Don't get all high and mighty with me. You know how it is. Food is expensive. And we want lots of it. So we found ourselves some guys who like seeing us blow up like balloons and let the gravy train roll in! And dammit, now I want gravy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie glared at her fiercely. \"Hey. I'm not just with Eric because he likes me fat. I'm with him because we like each other. He's a great guy, and I think we'd be happy together no matter what size I am. So don't drag me down to your level just because you have no heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"You just keep telling yourself that, sweetie,\" she replied. She heaved herself to her feet and waddled awkwardly back towards the employee entrance, making a point of showing off her enormous bubble butt as she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda had sat there awkwardly during the confrontation, absently eating her fries. \"So...,\" she said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie let go of a breath she didn't know she'd been holding. \"I'm sorry, Rhonda. I didn't mean for there to be drama or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Really,\" Rhonda assured her, smiling a bit. \"I think it's sweet how you stood up for you and Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to let some skankoid like Laurie Forman tell me that Eric and I aren't for real. Yes, he has an appreciation for how smoking hot I am, but we don't spend every waking minute doing fatty things. We watch TV, talk about life, listen to music - even if we can't stand each others taste in music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda giggled, but part of her looked distant. \"You don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... that Fez is only with me because I'm fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, Rhonda! I'm sure he isn't! Fez is a nice guy! He's weird and creepy, but less so since he met you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there was a period where he seemed a little off, y'know? Like, he wasn't one hundred percent into the relationship? But lately, I've been eating so much and gaining a lot of weight... and not long after that, he started getting more serious about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie thought about that. \"That's... interesting,\" she faltered. \"But I'm sure there's a simple explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. I want there to be more to our relationship than just me getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...,\" Jackie murmured, before a devilish grin split across her face. \"Although, you have to admit... it's kinda nice, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda blushed. \"I dunno... I mean, my parents are after me to lose weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's <i>their </i>problem. Do <i>you </i>like being fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerdy girl fidgeted in her seat, but a tiny smile was appearing. \"... Maybe...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... it's kinda nice when I've eaten a lot, and my stomach feels nice and tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled excitedly. \"I know! I love that feeling! When I've eaten so much that when I lie back, I can't even see past my stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just feel so cozy afterwards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they continued eating, their previous sour encounter with the bitchy blonde forgotten for now, and they soon finished their meals and were leaning back in their chairs, big bellies pooched outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Rhonda moaned contentedly. \"So full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we are,\" Jackie said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached over and gave her friend's stomach a gentle jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda halfheartedly slapped her hand away. \"Quit it...,\" she moaned with a lazy giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie giggled back and patted her own belly. \"Look at how big they are...,\" she breathed. \"Oh my gosh... It's like the bottom half is all squishy and soft, but up here...\" She rubbed the top of her gut. \"... It's like a bowling ball in my belly! I'm pregnant with a bowling ball burger baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both giggled again. They couldn't help it. It was all just so silly and fun. Rhonda playfully began jiggling her own belly, giving it a few silly slaps. Soon, the two friends were chatting away about being fat and what they should get for dessert.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna was going over the reports and photos that Dave and Matt had brought in. She was mentally assembling the report in her head for the school paper. The most she could gather about this recent town-wide weight gain was that people were simply surrendering to their most basic urges - specifically, the desire for junk food. And it was an epidemic that wasn't showing any signs of slowing down. Fast food joints were booming, and restaurants were seeing an increase in sales, from high-end upscale restaurants to all-you-can-eat buffets to Chinese takeout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all so amazing. What was the source? What was causing all of this? The only pattern was that the obesity seemed to be contained to only women in town. Men were about the same as they were before. Women were fattening up like Thanksgiving turkeys, and it was weird. But why? What was causing all this? Something in the water? Messing with their brains? Someone on TV preaching the pros of gluttony? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, stop. Think rationally. It's what journalists are supposed to do. Think of something reasonable. There had to be something simple at the top of this weird fatty pyramid. No evil genius. No evil plan. Something... simple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished with the reports she'd already gotten from her male colleagues. Now she was just waiting for Amy and Belle to come back with their findings. She'd sent them out to investigate the fast food joint near the school, plus any other restaurants they could think of, to interview people. She hadn't really seen them in the two weeks since. And they were running late. She needed their info before she could start printing the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard slow footsteps coming up the hallway. She shook her head. Probably not the girls. They were always brisk walkers. You could always tell when they were coming. She went back to her writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the footsteps stopped right before her door. Upon hearing it open, she looked up. Her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Amy and Belle, all right, but not quite as she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, they were carrying a couple not-quite-empty bags of fast food. Belle was munching lazily on a double cheeseburger, and Amy was slurping up the last of a milkshake. They were wearing their regular clothes, but they didn't seem to fit quite right. They were bulging around their midsections. The buttons on Amy's shirt were visibly tighter than usual, and Belle's tight dress made her look like she was smuggling an inner-tube around her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey, Donna,\" Amy said between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at them in silent shock. \"Wha...? What ha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You guys are... I mean... I don't want to be rude, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle finally seemed to cotton on. \"Oh, this,\" she said, holding up the fast food bag. \"Yeah, we... went undercover, I guess you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" agreed Amy. \"We had to look inconspicuous, so we had to be paying customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Donna asked. \"Why did you need to be undercover? You work for the school newspaper! Everyone knows that! You were just supposed to ask questions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did! We have a report and everything!\" said Belle as she sat down and took more food out of the bag. \"It's just... I don't know... the more we talked to people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy finished. \"The more we realized they had a point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A point? About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we as women shouldn't be spending all our time trying to stay thin just to please men! I mean, what's the point of that? I hate eating salad and granola all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And exercising is kind of a drag,\" agreed Belle. \"I mean, I'm getting all sweaty and gross just so some loser who's only into my body will like me? I'll just find some guy who likes fat chicks and enjoy my food, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, look at Eric Forman,\" said Amy. \"He's totally into Jackie, and she's enormous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned at the mention of her ex and put her face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy winced. \"Oh, sorry. I forgot. You've been broken up for so long now, I didn't even think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shook her head before looking up at them again. \"That... is not the point,\" she said, determined not to lose it. \"You guys were supposed to get info on why women around here were gaining weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we did!\" Belle exclaimed, pulling out a folder from her backpack. \"All of our notes, compiled right here for you to use at your discretion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid the folder across to Donna, and she took it in her hands and skimmed through the neatly-written notes. Some interesting quotes in here. Some very nice work. The girls had certainly been thorough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up at them as they had returned their focus to the food they were consuming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery thorough, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, this is my fault,\" she sighed, setting the folder down sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked up. \"What is?\" asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent you into the lion's den. Look at what the assignment did to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle looked perplexed. \"What do you mean? If anything, I feel liberated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too!\" agreed Amy, before glancing down at her forming potbelly. \"I mean, not so much around the middle, but nothing a nice pair of stretch pants can't fix. They're all the rage around here these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna grimaced. This was so wrong. Was she being an idiot? How could she be the only one who saw how wrong this was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to take us shopping sometime, Donna!\" Belle said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's head came up. \"... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can show us what to buy! I mean, we're not about to stop eating, so we need to be ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've never been in a plus-size clothing store before!\" said Amy, her excited smile emphasizing her small double chin. \"It might be fun to go together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir delighted expressions were so bemusing that Donna managed a half-smile. \"... Yeah... Maybe we will...,\" she said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, she was sad to admit, Jackie would've been better suited to picking out clothes for these girls. She always had the best fashion sense. But Donna couldn't go to her old friend now. Not after what she'd said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking those thoughts out of her head, Donna gathered up all the papers. \"Okay, I'm gonna get started and try to have this ready by tomorrow morning. You two get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" said Amy, already getting up. \"Come on,\" she said to Belle. \"If we're quick, we can hit the burger place before the crowd gets there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, great plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had the perfect view of the two young investigative journalists scurrying away, their growing backsides swaying back and forth as they walked out the door and back into the hallway, leaving behind the empty food containers and wrappers. Shaking her head, she left the mess for now and scooted over to the typewriter to get started. She already had a pretty good idea of how she wanted to word this article.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fez was hurrying down the hallway, hoping he could meet up with Rhonda in time. They had agreed to meet after school, and he assumed it meant he was going to enjoy a fair amount of making out, followed by a trip to Fatso Burger, or maybe the Hub, or maybe somewhere else. He knew food was usually the way to his Big Rhonda's heart. He was almost skipping as he made his way down the hall and to the front of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, he saw her standing outside on the sidewalk. That beautiful head of strawberry blonde hair, checking her watch and leaning against a tree. Beaming, he scurried outside and up alongside her. \"Rhonda, my lovely!\" he said, immediately kissing her on the cheek. \"Are you ready for a fun-and-Fez-filled day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda smiled awkwardly in a way that any level-headed guy would've noticed was an \"everything-is-not-okay\" smile. But this was Fez we were talking about, so he didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fezzie...,\" she said slowly. \"We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez shrugged cluelessly. \"Okay, sure! What shall we talk about? I hear there continue to be distress in the Middle East...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda closed her eyes. She knew she had to be patient. \"No, I mean, about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, then this is about where we should go for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, about our relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh! I think I see where this is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good. I was really worried -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are finally going to have sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a moment I have long been preparing for. I can not guarantee that it will go well. In fact, there may be crying involved. Ninety-five percent of which will come from me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! God no, Fez, we're not going to... do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's face fell. \"Oh... Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... Fez, I have to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... and then we have sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We... ugh... sex is not on the table right now. We're going to have this talk, and once I have the information I need from you, we go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. But I am not a wealth of information, I feel I should inform you. I only recently learned that Grant is in Grant's Tomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda sighed. He was so endearing, she almost hated putting the relationship on the line like this. But she needed to know for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez... do you only like me because I'm fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's eyebrows skyrocketed in genuine surprise. \"No, of course not!\" he exclaimed. \"I like you because you are Rhonda! The 'big' part has nothing to do with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! You are my favorite person go for long walks in the park, even if they only last ten minutes, and we spend another hour on a nearby bench...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda blushed bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez continued. \"And I love watching cop movies and 'I Love Lucy' with you, and the way you laugh, the way you move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to be overwhelmed by the heaps of praise, Rhonda cleared her throat to silence him. \"Yeah, but... I dunno... it doesn't feel like you were into the relationship for a while. Like, you were kinda distant towards me, and then... when I started really getting fat... that's when you started to show interest in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez seemed to have been brought up short by that. For a few seconds, his mouth opened and shut as he struggled to find something to say, and Rhonda felt the dread getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he seemed to find something to say. \"Well... you are partially right...,\" he said slowly. \"For a while, there was a period where I wasn't sure about us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You weren't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it had nothing to do about your appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Absolutely not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... what was it? What changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez swallowed. It wasn't going to be easy, but she deserved the truth. \"Well... for a long time, before we met, I always had a thing for Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You... did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was always frustrated that she was with an idiot like Kelso. A beautiful idiot, I concede, but I always believed I was better for her. But when they broke up, I tried going out with her, and she turned me down, saying we should be friends. I thought I was okay again, and then I met you, and I was very happy. But then... she started going out with Eric, and I felt so upset... I mean... Eric is my friend, but I thought I was such a better choice than him... I was... a little bitter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda listened to all this. This wasn't at all what she was expecting, but... it still wasn't great to hear. The idea that her boyfriend had still been hung up on another girl for a time when they were together wasn't the best ego boost. \"So... you like Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Fez said quickly. \"No, no, no! I did like Jackie, but... the longer we were together, the more I realized how lucky I was to have you! You're the best thing that ever happened to me, Rhonda! And that includes the time I discovered blue M&amp;Ms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda smiled slightly, but it still wasn't enough. \"Fez... I just don't know... I mean... this is all so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez felt his stomach plummet. \"So... what does this mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... Like, I want to be understanding... And I want to believe that you really like me... But if you're still hung up on Jackie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not! Rhonda, I admit, I had my head up my ass for a while, but I still like you more than Jackie! I mean, Jackie was a first crush. You're a <i>woman</i>! I could see a future with you I didn't think was possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda smiled sadly but was still uncertain. \"I... I don't know Fez... I mean, I want to believe you, but... I'm having all these doubts now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez swallowed. \"Do you... want to break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet. I need to think about all this. I need to... I need to think. By myself. For a while. So... I dunno. I want to put this on hold for a while, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the tears forming in his eyes, although bless his heart, he was trying to keep it together. \"I see... Well, that is... that is fine,\" he managed to force out. \"I... I accept that is... what you want... Fez will give you space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda reached out a hand to him. \"Fez, I'm sorry, but I need this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez sniffled. \"Yes, I respect that. You... take all the time you need.... Now... if you'll excuse me... I will go find Kelso and cry on his big manly shoulder. Good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Fez -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'good day'!\" he wailed, almost sobbing, before turning and walking quickly away before he finally broke down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda slumped against the tree. That hadn't gone at all like she'd thought it would. She believed that he liked her for more than just her body, which she'd been worried about. But now, this new information. It would be one thing if it had been a long dead crush, but it had been going on for a long part of their relationship. She had no idea how to process that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Now she could feel tears welling up in her eyes as well. Had she just lost Fez forever? Would she be able to forgive this? And if she did, would <i>he </i>forgive <i>her </i>for sending him away like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering, she turned for the parking lot to find her car.</span></div></div>",

Then, she didn't show up for school a couple days. Rhonda was one of those nerds who loved school. She was immediately filled with an overwhelming sense of dread as she took her daddy's Lincoln and drove over to her friend's place. Probably broke a view traffic laws, but dammit, her friend needed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parked the car as legally as she could and scurried up the walk to the front door, jamming her finger into the doorbell, and then lightly bouncing up and down as she waited for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door finally opened, and Rhonda's tall slim bespectacled mother answered, looking bewildered. \"Oh, Jackie! Thank goodness! I'm so glad you're here! Maybe you can help my Rhonda with her... boy problems... before things get any worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse than what?\" Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda's mom shook her mom sadly and guided her towards her daughter's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's mouth fell open at what lay inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda was surrounded by empty burger containers, candy wrappers, pizza boxes and ice cream cartons. There were a few discarded forks and spoons everywhere. At the moment, Rhonda herself was atop her bed, lying back against a giant pile of pillows, and a entire chocolate creme pie atop her already swollen gut. Her face was covered in food stains, crumbs and cream. She looked exhausted. Her eyes were all red and puffy from crying, and there were plenty of tissues littering the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked at her miserable friend in shock, looking over to her mother. \"... I'll see what I can do,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Rhonda's mother turned and left the girls to their own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda didn't seem to have noticed Jackie. She was too busy spooning the pie bit by bit into her mouth. She was in her pajamas, but the buttons on the front were wide open, so her enormous stomach was exposed in its globular glory. After a few seconds, though, she glanced up and saw her friend staring at her with a mixture of shock and concern, and she froze with the spoon right at her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhonda, what's wrong? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda lowered the spoon back into the pie. \"I... talked to Fez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Did it... not go well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... he said he'd like me no matter what size I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then he said...,\" Rhonda sniffled, \"... that he'd had a crush on you for years...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked. \"Oh that. Yeah, he did for a while, but nothing came of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said... He said he was jealous when you started dating Eric...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay, I guess he would be, but why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He and I were dating when you and Eric started dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh... Oh god... Oh Rhonda, I... I don't know what to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda shook her head sadly. \"It's okay. It's not your fault. And he said he got over it, and he wanted to be with me... But it's just... It's like, the beginning of our relationship is different now! I thought he only had eyes for me, but... he was still hung up on you! And that changes our history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's heart broke for her friend. \"Rhonda, I'm so sorry. And you're right. It does make things different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says he still wants to be with me... and I believe him. And I want him. But... it's... I'm not ready. Not right now. I just... I don't know what to do with myself! I mean, what am I? A consolation prize? He couldn't get you, so he settled for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie patted Rhonda's knee. \"Well... Rhonda, I don't know. You're in a very tricky situation. But I want you to know that regardless of what Fez feels for either of us, I don't want it to effect our friendship. You were there for me in a very difficult time when Donna ditched us, and I don't want to lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda smiled through her tears. \"Awwwww... Jackie, I don't want to lose you either! You're the coolest friend I've ever had!\" She sniffled. \"I'd give you a hug, but I'm covered in crumbs. Plus... I don't think I can move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie giggled, observing the mess. \"Yeah... was gonna say... You really went to town on all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. When I'm sad, I eat.\" She smiled a little more. \"Well, when I'm happy, I eat. Also when I'm mad. Or nervous. Or excited. Or... gosh, no wonder I'm so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed. Despite the shitty situation, they had each other. They sat in companionable silence for a while until the good mood began to waver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" Rhonda sighed. \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie pondered for a moment. \"Well... it's a tricky situation you find yourself in... and I don't have all the answers... but... I do know <i>one </i>thing you should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should share some of that pie with me, because that is way too big for you to eat in one sitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda stared, and then she laughed. She pulled a clean fork out of her drawer and handed it to her friend, and they proceeded to happily devour the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour, they both were lying back on the bed, squeezed tightly together, with Jackie giving Rhonda's extremely overstuffed tummy a much-needed belly rub. There were still things to figure out, but hey, at least finishing the pie was a good place to start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finding Fez had been a slight challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, the guys hadn't really seen him. He'd been hanging around the basement all depressed and morose until he started playing really depressing music, and Red finally told him to go home until he got his act together. Eric, Hyde and Kelso had tried to hang out with him after that, but he was such an incredible bummer now that they lost the will to continue doing so. They figured he probably went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, and probably more important, they didn't know where his home was. They'd never been to his host parents' house, so they had no address to go by. It had taken a bit of research, but eventually, they tracked the house down, thanks in no small part to the school directory and Kelso hitting on the secretary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys had offered to help Fez, but she made it clear that this was something between the two of them, so they backed off. She knew exactly what she needed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, his host parents let her in. They were super-religious, which was extremely annoying. They wanted to make sure they weren't about to have \"filthy un-Christian sex\" in the house, so the door had to stay open. Still, she would not let that deter her. She stepped into Fez's room and saw him all miserable and depressed in a freakin' race car bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...,\" she murmured, looking around the room with all the awesome toys. \"Fez, this place is like Toys R Us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez pulled the blanket over his head. \"What do you want?\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To talk to you. I've seen Rhonda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez peeked out from under the blanket. \"Is she okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. She's miserable without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie crossed her arms. \"Fez, you understand what the problem is, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez nodded sadly. \"I do. I have let my selfishness break my poor Rhonda's heart. And now we are over. Never to cuddle again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie crinkled her nose. \"Okay, listen, Fez, you guys are not over. She didn't break up with you. She just needs some space. But I promise she's just as upset as you. But you need to understand. You made her feel like she was a consolation prize. That she was second best. No woman should ever have to feel that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...,\" Fez sighed. \"I feel horrible. But I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then... it's a good thing I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez looked up at her in bemusement. \"... Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez, if you want Rhonda back, you need to show her that she's the best girl ever. That she is the most beautiful creature on the planet, and that you need her in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled. \"Food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food, Fez. Lots and lots of food. All her favorites. You know her favorites, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez didn't even blink. \"Extra-large pizza with sausage and green peppers, cookies-n-creme ice cream, hot dogs with relish, movie popcorn with extra thick butter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, just make a list of her absolute favorites. Then, you're taking her on a date. Wear an actual suit, take her to a nice location, and for god's sake, don't be creepy. You're going to woo this girl back into your life. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Rhonda said she wanted space? What if she says no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. I'll get her ready. Just gotta have patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And money,\" Fez pointed out. \"I mean, Jackie, I have dreamed of doing this for a girl for years, but reality always reminds me that I am a dirt poor high school senior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I steal my dad's credit cards all the time. Finance is no problem.\" She smiled. \"Let's get your girl back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled uncertainly, starting to look more like his old self. \"You really think this will work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez, trust me. The way to a girl's heart is through her belly.\"</span></div></div>",

She knew her friend missed Fez and wanted him back, but it was a matter of convincing her that it was a good idea. She didn't really trust her instincts right now, seeing as how she was still upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it wasn't difficult to find her. If she wasn't in the library, she'd be in the cafeteria. She walked in and spotted her at a lonesome table and a huge pile of food on her tray. Good lord, if she was trying to stress eat the school food, she must be pretty desperate to make the sad go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached tentatively. \"Hey, Rhonda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda peered up from behind her mountain of carbs. \"Oh, hey, Jackie,\" she said awkwardly. \"I was just... I mean, I'm fine! Just... y'know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hungry. It's like... Fez not being here has left a huge gap in my life, and I'm trying to fill it with food. But I keep digesting the food, and I just... keep filling it up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie gave a small smile. \"Rhonda, that's okay. Nothing wrong with that. But you might wanna cool it a bit, because I talked to Fez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wanted to straighten things out. He really misses you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda looked cautious. \"... He does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He was just lying in his race car bed, wrapped in blankets and all depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His race car bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story. The point is, he is miserable without you, and while he's willing to wait until you're ready, he really wants you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda's chubby face seemed ready to either smile or cry. \"Oh, poor Fezzie... I shouldn't enjoy hearing this, should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged. \"Up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda absently ate another fish stick, but Jackie considered it progress that she had slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Eric walked up to their table, carrying something. \"Hey, ladies,\" he said, kissing Jackie on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, baby. What's that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric held up the something. It looked like a large booklet. \"School newspaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... That's what the school paper looks like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never read it?\" asked Rhonda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged. \"I have enough reading to do between school and Nancy Drew.\" She looked back at Eric. \"Since when do you read the school paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually don't, especially since Donna and I broke up, but apparently, there's an article in here generating some buzz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric put the paper out in the middle of the table for the girls to see. They stared at the headline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OBESITY EPIDEMIC INFLATES WOMEN OF POINT PLACE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh, god,\" muttered Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna?\" asked Rhonda worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna,\" Eric confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was still reading. \"<i>The female population of Point Place, Wisconsin, is going through what can only be described as a 'fat revolution'. People are overeating at a much faster rate, with little to no shame or discretion. Women in particular are being effected by this epidemic, with many displaying a very blas\u00e9 attitude towards their increasing girth, while others have seemingly embraced it. Health experts are worried what this weight explosion could mean in long-term.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stared at the paper in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Not exactly unbiased, is she?\" Eric muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, this is ridiculous!\" Jackie complained. \"So the women around here are gaining weight! So she feels the need to shame everyone with an article just to make us feel bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the plan, it doesn't look like it's working,\" Rhonda remarked, casting a glance around the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Jackie followed her gaze to their fellow patrons. Several girls were looking considerably more bloated than usual. Some were straight up stuffing their faces with food, either from the cafeteria or from home. They could also see a few also thumbing through the school paper, and they definitely did not look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Donna's going to be getting Editor of the Year anytime soon,\" Eric remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can she do this? She used to be all Mrs. Empowerment! Now she can't stand that women are eating what they want instead of trying to please males? Isn't that basically what feminism is? Wanting to empower women to make their own decisions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda shrugged. \"Maybe... she's just feeling self-conscious and doesn't know how to deal with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, boo hoo!\" Jackie griped. \"She wants to lose weight? She should lose weight! She shouldn't make the rest of us feel like crap just to make herself feel better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric put a hand on her shoulder. \"Do you feel like crap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie scoffed. \"Hell no! But I'm pissed at her for trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled. \"Well, how about this?\" he said, taking the paper and tossing it aside. \"We just ignore it. She wants to throw a childish tantrum and make everyone feel like crap? We don't give her the satisfaction of giving her hell for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie pouted. \"But I enjoy giving hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but let's just let it go for now. Donna's lashing out, so let's just leave her to it. Okay? Besides, judging by the looks on some of our fellow students' faces tells me that we won't have to do anything if we wait long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right,\" grinned Rhonda. \"So many fat girls getting angry up in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked around again, and she saw several students of varying weights were gathering around anyone who had a paper, and they were getting increasingly agitated with what they were reading. Some looked like they were going to cry, but others were getting furious. Mutters of \"who does she think she is\" and \"she's one to talk\" and \"what a bitch\" were reverberating throughout the cinder block room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled to herself. \"Oooooh, Donna Pinciotti, you have dug yourself a nice big grave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, look on the bright side,\" Eric chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. And you're right, Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored him. \"We shouldn't bother with what Donna is up to. We have more important issues to deal with. Like reuniting Fez with Rhonda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda shifted awkwardly. \"I want him back,\" she said quietly. \"But I don't really know what to do. How do I just walk to him and tell him I want him back? I don't want him to think the fight didn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said Jackie. \"I'm already working on it. If you're free Saturday afternoon, I think we can arrange something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled as he watched his girlfriend set to work meddling in peoples' lives, and also smiled as he realized his ex was going to be in trouble soon.</span></div></div>",

She had sent that fat-shaming article out with the hopes that it would wake up the women of Point Place to what was happening to them. That women would realize that they needed to eat healthier and exercise and maybe not let this happen to them anymore. That she would be the town hero or something thanks to her awesome kickass journalism skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that didn't happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More hate mail, boss,\" Matt sighed as he tossed her a few slips of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna didn't bother lifting her head from the desk. \"Let me guess. More of the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. I try not to read other people's mail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter to Donna. She'd had plenty of angry letters from her fellows students. Many of them calling her out for trying to shame them for their weight and eating habits, and for sticking her nose where it didn't belong. For expressing her \"fatphobia\" through a false concern for their health. Oh sure, there'd been some letters of support, but they only came from the incredibly shallow, who thought fat people were \"gross\" or \"ugly\", and that didn't make her feel any better. If nothing else, it just made her feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt... have I made a horrible mistake?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shrugged. \"Maybe. But hey, that's journalism. You're not always going to please everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just... felt so right at the time. I don't know what I did wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you'll figure something out soon. We just gotta come up with a completely different article in time for next week.\" He grabbed his backpack before adding, \"And maybe a printed apology.\" He left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned and rubbed her eyes. This was hell. She'd managed to turn half the school's population against her in one fell swoop. She was so stressed she hadn't really eaten lately, which she wanted to be proud of, but she was absolutely starving and hated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted when she heard two heavy sets of heavyset footsteps heading her way. She knew it would Amy and Belle right away, so she didn't bother looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer two reporters had continued to pork up since she'd last seen them, having gone from their once slender forms to a pair of rather lovely fatties. Amy's stomach had developed a nice fold in the middle, and Belle's butt was taking the lead in her growing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood over her for a few seconds, but Donna still didn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle finally cleared her throat. \"Donna...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Donna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to resign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got her attention. Donna's head jolted straight up. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, if this is the kind of paper you're going to be running, shaming people who did nothing more than gain some weight, then we don't want to be a part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Amy. \"It just hurts that you said those things about fat people. Especially since we've gained weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, do you think we're 'shameless gluttons'? We'd never have helped with this story if we'd known this was the direction you were going to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally took the quotes we got out of context!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's dumbfounded expression hadn't changed the entire time they'd been talking, but now she was starting to realize she needed to form some kind of response. \"You guys can't just resign! You're two of my best investigators!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Belle sadly, \"but we have to think about our journalistic integrity. We want to be serious journalists someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Amy, \"not jerks being mean to people for being themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't being a jerk! This is a big problem in Point Place! Women are getting fatter, and it needs to be investigated!\" Donna cried, leaping to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it any of your business they're gaining weight?\" Belle demanded. \"People aren't living up to your standards, so you attack everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or are you feeling insecure about your own weight, and you're taking it out on everyone else?\" Amy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna froze. \"I... I didn't... I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, we're sorry if you're uncomfortable with your weight, which is a shame because you really are beautiful, but that's no excuse to just attack people for their own choices. As long as they're not harming anyone else, what right do we have to interfere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was still stunned by the accusation and didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Donna?\" asked Belle. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a tense pause, Donna slumped back into her chair, a blank expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I accept your resignations,\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Belle didn't know how to respond, so after another silence, they just nodded, gathered their things and waddled out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat in a stupor, not sure what to do now. She'd just lost two of her staff. Hell, she'd just alienated herself from the entire school. How had this happened? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd... were they right? Did she only publish that article out of her own hatred of her own body? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. How had she become this? How had she gone from being a self-empowered independent woman to a self-hating appearance-obsessed vindictive bitch? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was all alone, Donna stood up and took a few moments to look down at her enormous body. She had to be at least 300 hundred pounds by now. She ran her hands up and down her extra-large thighs and jiggled her huge double belly. How had she eaten herself so huge? She shook her head sadly. In her heart, she knew there wasn't anything wrong with her being this size. And she knew she was wrong to have gotten on everyone's cases in such a public way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed heavily and gathered her things. She wasn't sure what to do right now, so she might as well go home. She threw away the hate mail and made the long waddle to her car. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna pulled her car into the driveway and cut the engine. She sadly hauled herself out of the car and waddled her way to the back door. Right away, she could hear lots of talking coming from inside, and she saw a few unfamiliar cars parked along the street. Groaning with dread, she opened the door and poked her head inside. She found the kitchen to be simply brimming with food. Fried chicken, buffalo wings, mashed potatoes, green beans, peach cobbler, steamed veggies, deviled eggs, finger sandwiches... they all lined the counters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...,\" Donna groaned. What was her lunatic mother doing now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the overweight devil, Midge came waddling into the kitchen. \"Sweetie, you're home!\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna regarded her mother. The older woman must've been close to 350 pounds by now. Her clothing was one hundred percent workout garb, just barely able to hold in her enormously flabby body. It didn't stop her belly from peeking out, and her ass from half-mooning the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just another get together with the ladies. It was my turn to host this week. So I had a bunch of pre-cooked food brought over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Mom, that's insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, dear! I used your dad's credit card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean... How many of you are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness me, I'm not sure,\" Midge mused, never having been good at math. \"There was just barely enough room in the living room for everyone. Here, give me a hand to wheel some of this outside to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge grabbed the cartload of fried chicken, while Donna sighed heavily and decided to at least bring the veggies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they emerged, her heart almost stopped. The room was full of overweight women of every size, all talking animatedly while simultaneously gorging themselves on several plates of food. There were several plates going around, and a few empty trays and carts in the room that had been clearly been loaded previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, girls!\" Midge exclaimed cheerfully. \"Take some and pass it around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women grunted as a group before passing around the next trays of food, not even bothering to say thank you as they tucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge took the empty trays and wheeled them back into the kitchen. Donna hurried after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what the hell is going on? It looks like there's twice as many women here than the first time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because there are,\" Midge replied, tidying things away. \"We've had a lot of new women join up recently!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they're all here to gain weight to spite their husbands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not all of them are married! Some of them are single and just tired of constantly trying to look 'sexy' for men! And even some of the ones who <i>are </i>married aren't doing it out of spite! Their husbands have accepted them for who they are! I wish more men were like that -- accepting of a woman's size so long as they love them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna saw the wistfulness in her mom's eyes. \"I take it Dad's not... accepting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge smiled sadly. \"Not really, no. It's been a real eye opener. But then again, we always had problems before all this. Maybe renewing our vows was just out of fear of losing each other... but maybe... that's what needs to happen after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make Donna feel any better to hear that, but she had to admit, if her parents were just going to fight all the time, maybe a divorce was just what was needed. Feeling overwhelmingly sad, for both her family and her mother's feelings, Donna went over and gave her mother a hug. Midge was taken off-guard, but she was delighted by the gesture and returned, for once understanding the deeper meaning behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed like that for a long time, but Donna slowly withdrew and looked her mother in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge smiled and wheeled over the tray of mashed potatoes. \"Come on, sweetie. Let's have dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reentered the living room, finding that, despite the many people porking on them, there was still some fried chicken left. They got the mashed potatoes into rotation, and Donna took what was left of the chicken and started eating it. Wherever Midge had ordered this stuff from, it was really good. Just the right blend of spices to keep it interesting without setting her mouth on fire. She ate maybe five pieces before the vat of mashed potatoes made it around to her. She spooned up the very last of it, pleased to find there was still plenty left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she plowed through the food, she saw that the dishes were getting increasingly fuller as they came round to her. Clearly, all the women who had gotten here first were getting full, having finished several trays before she had even gotten there. She found herself being passed several servings of the most delicious food she'd ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat small voice that told her to lose weight was silent for the moment, and she was happy for it. She was too depressed to worry about calories right now. She'd made an ass of herself at school. Alienated a lot of people. Now her parents were probably going to split up - for real, this time. She didn't want to think about life. She just wanted food. To eat. To Eat. To EAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what she did, for a long time. Just cram her fat gut full of food. Load up. Carb up. Fatten up. Never mind about the future. Never mind about her career. Never mind about moving from this spot. Just eat until she couldn't anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night wore on, and soon, one by one, the group of overfed women came to their senses and began to depart, one by one, until they were all gone. Midge tidied away the carts and trays, ready for the catering company to collect them in the morning. She loaded them into the kitchen and collapsed on the sofa, feeling very stuffed after yet another successful eating party. Her enormous stomach gurgled from the food she'd consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw a glance at the corner of the room. Clearly, she'd not done as much eating as her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was passed out, with an empty tray in her lap that had contained something clearly very good, given how she'd licked every last bit of food off of it. Her jeans were unzipped, and her huge double belly was on full naked display, her two pudgy hands atop it, her sausage-like fingers interlocked. Her breathing was very labored, sprinkled with the odd belch and hiccup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge smiled. She was too comfy on the couch to get up and send her to bed or even a blanket, but she was glad to see her daughter let loose for once. Maybe this was something they could do together after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna woke up with the taste of so many different flavors in her mouth. She smacked her tongue against the roof of her mouth and grimaced at the horrid flavors. She swallowed them down and grimaced at herself before realizing where she was. She was in the corner between the staircase and the wall of her living room. She peered downwards. Good lord, her stomach was out and completely bare. Feeling suitably embarrassed, she pulled down her XXXL shirt in an attempt to cover it but found that it only really covered the top half at this point. She'd have to suck in a little to cover it entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy crap on a cracker, what did I DO last night??</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the memories returned to her bit by bit, she groaned internally. She'd only gone and made the biggest pig of herself ever, that's what. She could barely move. She stretched all the kinks out of her body before she gently rocked herself back and forth, until she finally got herself up onto her feet. She looked around, but was surprised to see how little debris there was. She walked into the kitchen, trying in absolute vain to button up her pants, and found Midge working at a mighty-fine looking breakfast of pancakes and waffles. Loaded with butter and syrup, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Donna!\" she said cheerfully. \"Waffle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. \"Uh, mom, what happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all... kind of a blur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, you joined my friends in our weekly dinner buffet, and after about a dozen trays of the most delicious food on the planet, you... kinda passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna dreaded the next question. \"Did I... unbutton my pants before or after everyone left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, I don't remember exactly. Definitely before a few people went home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, don't worry! It wasn't a big deal! Happens at these parties all the time! God knows I've had to unbutton my pants time and time again during these parties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shifted awkwardly before deciding to sit down at the table. \"So... how'd you get this place so clean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the catering company took away most of the mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wait... Does that mean they saw me passed out with my fat gut on full display??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They didn't comment on it if they did! It's probably par the course for them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna buried her face in her hands and hissed mournfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing that her daughter was unhappy, Midge quietly fixed a plate of waffles and passed them over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna lifted her head and stared at the plate resentfully. \"You seriously think waffles are going to make this better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge also nudged over the maple syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay, maybe a little better,\" Donna sighed as she took the bottle and poured a very generous helping all over the waffles. Once satisfied, she dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are things at school?\" Midge ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sucky,\" Donna sighed. \"I... published a very dumb article in the school paper that offended a lot of people, and now almost the entire school hates me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie,\" Midge said kindly. \"Still, you don't have to worry about that for long. You graduate in a couple months. Then you probably won't have to see them ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a small town like Point Place? I probably will be seeing them at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge thought for a few seconds. She'd been cooking an idea in her head for a while now - it always took her a while - and she decided it was time to present it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if... you didn't live in Point Place anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. \"Well, I'd been thinking about college, definitely. Of course, most of them would probably going to the University of Wisconsin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you didn't live in Wisconsin anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what are you getting at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge took a deep breath before continuing. \"I'm thinking about moving to California.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"California? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, we know things between your father and I aren't going to improve. I'm going to talk to him a bit, but... I feel like this is right. I'd like to wait until after you graduate and you've made your decision. But I'd really like it if you came with me. If you really want a fresh start, this is a good opportunity for one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at her mother in mid-chew, and suddenly, all those emotions started flowing through her again. Her mother was really considering this? The logical part of her told her that it was for the best if her parents split up, but... she just couldn't deal with all this right now. Not when she'd only been awake for seven minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge saw the pain on her daughter's face. \"You don't have to decide right this second!\" she continued quickly. \"Just... think it over. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... okay... Can you pass the butter, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge obliged, and Donna proceeded to slather the entire stick of butter on her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate in silence for the rest of the morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a Saturday afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda paced back and forth worriedly. She was wearing a very nice dress - sapphire blue with patterned sequins - and had her hair done up. Jackie had tried to get her to wear contacts, but she'd refused. Fez liked her glasses. And they made her eyes all boogery. She paced nervously around her house. Her parents were mercifully leaving her alone. All they knew was that she was going on a nice date. Mainly because that's all Rhonda knew, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's dad's Lincoln pulled up to the house. With a quick goodbye to her parents, Rhonda scurried down the walk and into the passenger seat. The whole car lurched as she settled herself, and they were half-certain the bumper had briefly touched the pavement from the new load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there go the shocks,\" Jackie sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm just... really nervous, y'know? You haven't told me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we've already established that you and Fez want to get back together and that you're willing to forgive him. But you need a romantic kickstart to get your relationship going again. So don't worry - I've got Fez all set up at your romantic rendezvous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda smiled bashfully. \"Oh... Jackie, you didn't have to do all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I wanted to. You've been a great friend for me since Donna ditched, and you've been a big help with school. I'm gonna miss you when you graduate and head to college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not going to go far. Besides, I'll still need you for fashion advice. And we should still have our lunches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally agree. In fact, lately, I've been thinking we should expand to brunch as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda giggled. \"You mean, we should expand <i>at </i>brunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, girl!\" Jackie whooped, holding up a hand for a high five, which was gladly given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a ten minute drive to the location, but when they got there, Jackie didn't get out of the car. She simply gestured to Rhonda's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure about this?\" Rhonda asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. I told him exactly what to do. That being said, if he says anything stupid, I had nothing to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda heaved herself out of the car, and Jackie winced as she felt it tilt back in her direction. She drove off into the distance, leaving her fat nerdy friend standing on the curb outside a small forest surrounding a lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhonda...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, she whirled around to find Fez dressed in a nice suit, complete with a necktie. \"Fez?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am here for our date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good...,\" Rhonda said cautiously. She was fighting very hard to smother a smile threatening to take over her whole face. \"How've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am fine. You, though, have only gotten more beautiful in our time apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile won out. \"Awww, Fezzie... I've gained five pounds since you lost saw me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I can't wait to see them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda snickered. <i>Don't blame Jackie</i>, she reminded herself. \"So... what <i>is </i>this date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled and gestured behind him towards a small hill through the trees. \"This way, m'lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda walked past him, walking gingerly down the hill - very glad she'd ignored Jackie's orders to wear heels - and made it to a grassy ledge over the lake. Her mouth fell open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a picnic. But not just any picnic. She could see a pizza box, some plates and three large coolers, one of which was already open and full of glass bottles of Coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fez! This is so sweet!\" she squealed, hurrying over to the large picnic blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so glad you think so, my dove. It was a lot of work, and that was just dealing with Jackie. She originally wanted us to do this at night, but I pointed out that would require a few candles, and that would only attract insects. Apparently, I am not a very romantic man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda smiled fondly. \"Wanting to keep your girlfriend pest-free is <i>very </i>romantic, Fez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled and gestured for her to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had their bottoms parked on the blanket, he passed her a coke and the pizza box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fezzie, my favorite!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were soon proceeding with the meal. Although Rhonda tried to be generous and share some, Fez really only got couple of slices while she devoured the remaining six. They ate in relative silence, listening to the waves crashing and enjoying the warmth of May. It was so rare to have a warm day in Wisconsin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the pizza was gone, and Rhonda was leaning back, wiping her fingers with a napkin so she could rub her stomach without staining her dress. \"This is a very nice spot, Fez,\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Jackie helped me scout it out. We wanted an ant-free zone for this picnic. We would test out different spots by leaving food out for hours and making sure no insects swarmed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... Rhonda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie said that you missed me while we were apart. Was that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was. Did you really miss me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And do you really have a race car bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Rhonda - I am sorry I made you feel like you were a consolation prize. You are no consolation. And you are so much more than a mere 'prize'. You are a woman. The woman of my dreams. A woman who shares my passion for candy and making out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda smiled. \"And you're my Fezzie. The man who treats me like a queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always, my sweet. And ooh! Speaking of sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez reached into another cooler and this time pulled out a pint of cookies n cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda's face lit up as she took it and the spoon. \"Oh my god, kick ass! My other favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's plenty more where that came from, your majesty. Tonight, you are a queen. This is all to show you that you will <i>never </i>be second best in my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda peered into the cooler and saw several more frozen goodies awaited her inside. Her mouth was practically drooling over them all. \"Oh man... If my gut rips out of this dress, Jackie <i>and </i>my parents are all gonna kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They shall have to go through me first. Now eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, she took a spoon and snuggled up under his chin, already going to town on her ice cream. They stayed like that for hours, watching the water and enjoying each other's company. And every time she finished something, Fez would just reach into one of the coolers and hand her something else. And there was a lot. Ice cream sandwiches, popsicles, cookies, whipped cream... so much sweetness in her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when there was nothing left to hand her, she was too stuffed to sit up anymore. Thankfully, he'd brought a pillow for her to lie down on. She leaned back, patting her painfully full stomach. Fez reached over and gently gave her a belly rub. It was nice, but Rhonda was feeling a bit randy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Fez...,\" she moaned. \"Do it... like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and pulled the dress up and over her huge belly. Fez's eyes widened slightly, but he was clearly excited by the possibility. He got up and straddled her, providing further proof that he was excited. He put his hands on her rock hard belly and rubbed gently up and down its entirety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda let out a moan of delight as she let him feel every inch of her enormous stomach. Hands behind her head, she enjoyed the feeling of him on top of her, his hands roaming up and down her distended gut... and tentatively to other places as well, making her moan in unexpected pleasure. And then he started nibbling her earlobe, sending her senses all a-tizzy. She instinctively grabbed him and started making out with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... Fez...,\" she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, you're beautiful,\" he replied breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unnngh... you're driving me crazy... I'm so stuffed and bloated... I need you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am yours for the taking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriven by her out of control hormones, Rhonda started sliding her panties down, then forcibly grabbed Fez's zipper with a determination she didn't think herself capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt truly was an excellent date.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna found herself wandering the halls quite a bit during school. Between cramming for finals and continuing work on the school paper, she was kept very busy. She'd managed to find a couple replacements for Amy and Belle, but they weren't really serious journalism students like her. She'd had to accept them anyway, as they were the only ones willing to take the jobs. She'd inadvertently given the school paper a bad name with her \"fat shaming\", so the others were working overtime to do get their good name back. She was relieved the others on the paper had stood by her, but she'd decided to step down as editor-in-chief and let the others go back to their way of reporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help her spirits much that the subscription rate had increased once the previous format was reinstated. But that's high school for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week before finals, Donna did a mental recap of life at school. She was now an outcast. Before, she'd simply been in a self-imposed exile, working all the time and reducing socializing. Now, there were very few willing to make eye contact with her, let alone talk to her. She knew on some level she deserved it, but this was getting out of hand. California was looking more appealing all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, by chance, she spotted Hyde sitting outside the school, skipping class once again. Not seeing anyone with him, Donna decided to take a chance. She slipped outside and approached him at the bench he was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hyde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde glanced up, then did a brief double take. He hadn't seen Donna in months. Probably back when she had weighed only 200 pounds. Now, at least 100 pounds later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. How've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde cleared his throat to reassert his \"zen\". \"Oh, I'm okay... You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I read the article in the paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and everyone else, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better, I think that was the highest-selling issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat down next to Hyde, trying to ignore how much of the bench she was taking up and how far he had to scoot over to make room for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Donna, I'm not gonna tell you what to say or do, but... what the hell prompted that article? I mean, I'm not into the fat chicks, personally, but that seemed a tad aggressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a lot of things,\" Donna replied. \"I like to think part of me was reacting with genuine concern to what's happening around here... but another part of me is thinking... maybe I haven't learned how to be comfortable in my own body. I mean, I'm supposed to be this modern forward-thinking self-assured feminist, but... I got all insecure about my weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde nodded. \"So you let that bleed into the article.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... and now I'm this big social pariah. I can't believe I let my own insecurities control me. I mean, who am I to judge people based on their eating habits? They're not hurting anyone else. If someone went out of their way to criticize my lifestyle, I'd be mad as hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your game plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shrugged. \"At the moment? Just make it to graduation without being tarred and feathered. How about you? What're your plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna stick it out at the Foto Hut with Leo for a while longer. It's a good job. But we'll see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you're staying the course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick with what works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about the rest of the gang? How're things with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kelso's still banging away. We figure he's eventually get someone pregnant. Things should start getting interesting after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine they will. How's Fez? He still with Rhonda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. They had a rough patch a while back, but they're fine now. Fez came galloping into the basement a few nights singing his 'I did it' dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god. Kinda glad I missed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I won't nauseate you with the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled, but her smile soon faded as she remembered one other unpleasant fact. \"And... Eric and Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde bit his lip briefly, but he soldiered on. \"Still together. He's going to stay in town for a year, keep working at Price Mart, and wait for Jackie to finish high school. Then they're talking about heading up to Madison for college next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded distantly. \"Wow... good for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... they're surprisingly strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't really what Donna wanted to hear, but at the same time, she felt happy for Eric. He'd found someone who shared his kink, and it ended up being Jackie. They'd found each other. That didn't mean it didn't sting. He was her first love, and she would always love him, in a way. Maybe one day, when all this drama was behind them, they would be fine, but for now, she was still miserable at the very thought of him with anyone else, especially her former best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde noticed how quiet his old friend had gone. \"You okay, Big D?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, I was just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, dillhole. My parents are talking about separating again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay. I mean... they haven't been getting a long for a while now. It'll be good for them. It's just... my mom wants to move to California, and she invited me to go with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde blinked. \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you tell her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'd think about it. I wasn't sure at first, but... well, there's not a lot for me here. Everyone in Point Place has more or less cast me out. I'm only bringing the school paper bad publicity. I've more or less severed ties with everyone. Plus... it's kind of hard living next door to Eric these days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde nodded sympathetically. \"Yeah, I get that... So you're gonna go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked as she realized how this was lining up. \"... Yeah, I think I am. I mean, there are plenty of good colleges in California. And I'm sure I can pursue my journalism career there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde smiled. \"Well, best of luck to you. But do yourself a favor, Big D -- don't just plan a career. Plan a life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled back. \"Thanks for the heartfelt concern, Hyde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, get bent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gave her friend a hug before getting up - much to the apparent relief of the bench - and waddled back towards the school. She caught sight of her reflection in a nearby window and quietly marveled over how big she was. She hadn't bothered to weigh herself in months, but she was certain she was well and truly over 300. Maybe over 315.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You know</i>, she thought to herself, <i>it's not that bad a look...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were at least twelve empty burger wrappers surrounding her. Twenty-one french fry containers. A couple empty cups - one for sodas and one for milkshakes. A few empty mustard and ketchup packets. Lots of empty mayo packets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled to herself as she tucked into her thirteenth cheeseburger of the day. It was amazing how much she could consume in an eight hour shift. Plus, at two dollars and eighty cents an hour, she was doing pretty good for herself. She considering asking Peter for a raise. He was totally convinced he had a chance with her. All the free food, drinks and constant uniform upgrades were obvious signs. She had him wrapped around her increasingly-fat finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of fat, holy crap, was Laurie fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been pushing to find out just how much she could get away with consuming every day. It amazed her how much she could get away with. She constantly went home overstuffed with fattening greasy delicious Fatso food. She would go home with a very full belly and then enjoy whatever her mom made for dinner on top of it all. She went to bed and promptly passed out into the best food coma ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she'd spend her days off just patrolling the town and bars, finding sexy guys who were super into fat chicks. Holy crap, they were amazing. She didn't know how she'd been missing out on these people. If she'd known she could still find awesome sex while grossly overweight, she'd have let herself go years ago. She was finally able to embrace her inner sloth <i>and </i>her inner glutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, of course, was still completely convinced that she was in love with him and was going to make out with him at some point, so he kept letting her get away with stuff. While most of her coworkers hated her for it, a lot of them hated Peter more. Peter was such a prick most of the time, they kind of liked seeing him get strung along, not to mention endanger his job just for the chance of a make out session with this fatso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was <i>so-o-o-o-o-o-o</i> fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie's belly was now entirely in her lap. Her boobs rendered her original uniform shirt a sports bra. Her ass now needed two stools. She wasn't sure how much she weighed, but she assumed it was somewhere around 350 at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fixed herself one last milkshake for the day and heaved herself off the stools to punch out for the night. Her replacement, a petite girl named Angela, had to wait for her to squeeze her way out of the drive thru station. Her overstuffed stomach was pressed against the wall as she heaved herself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela just leaned against the far wall with an annoyed look on her face. \"Had enough free food for the day, Laurie?\" she drawled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie responded with a dismissive sneer. \"Scooch over, tiny,\" she replied. \"Eat a few cheeseburgers and cast a shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped herself free and waddled past. Angela rolled her eyes and headed for her station. \"Keep this up and you won't be able to fit back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes and headed to the back room to punch out. But Angela's words stuck with her. She had a point. She had spent the last few months merrily getting fatter and lazier, and there was only so much room back there. As she punched out and headed for the restroom to clean up, she had to admit, she was getting too big. She pondered to herself - how could she fix this? She considered asking Peter for a promotion, like a desk job, but that would involve way too much responsibility, and she wasn't in the mood for that. She needed something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she reveled in the free food, she realized she wasn't going to be able to make this work forever. She needed something long term. Something with lots of eating and no thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned a few times like a runway model, admiring her reflection as she chugged her shake down. She slapped her belly a few times. She was so stuffed after such a long day of pigging out on the clock. Smiling to herself, she waddled out into the open, and then made a point of slowing down past Peter's office. He glanced up, like he always did, and she made sure to smile and wink at him, and he dropped his pen on his desk. For a moment, she thought he was going to chase after her, but she was somehow faster than him and walked off. She enjoyed listening to him crash on the floor as she scurried out the door into the summer air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride home was uneventful, but she was determined to think of something to fix her problem. She enjoyed the free food, but Fatso Burger was not going to work forever. She couldn't stay in the drive-thru station all the time, not when she was getting too big to fit back there, but it was the best place for a daylong gorge. What else could have that freedom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it started to form in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many fat-loving guys around. Maybe one of them would be interested in fattening her up for life. Someone who would be willing to let her sit on her ass all day, bring her food, let her watch TV and have constant fat sex with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excited smile split across her face. There had to be some kind loser out there who would be up for that, right? She absently cradled her belly in her hands. She'd be sure to make sure to wear some of her old clothes next time she went out. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna wandered the mall in silence. She tried listening to the distant music on the P/A system, but she was still in a daze. She was seriously thinking about moving away from her life. Moving to California with only her mother. She was more or less on board with the idea of her parents finally splitting up, but this a pretty big bridge to cross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was now hated by all her classmates, so most of the colleges in the area were out of the question. There were just too many people who knew her and her article. A move would ensure that she didn't have to worry about anyone knowing her. A fresh start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wandered around the plus-size clothing store, looking for some new jeans and some new t-shirts for the upcoming summer weather. She had graduation to think about as well. Maybe focus on those finals so she could get into a good school, huh? But as she wandered, she began to realize how crowded this place was. When did it become so popular? Then, she began to notice just how large some of these women were. Several plump, fat and/or enormous women were going through the various articles of clothing. Comparing prices, comparing sizes, comparing colors... Donna watched all of this in stupefied silence for a few moments before a couple of extra-fat asses bumped into her. Wincing, she got moving again, lest she screw up the overweight flow going on in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna managed to find a couple shirts and a pair of jeans she liked before getting in line. She stood awkwardly in the small store, watching the lady fatties bob back and forth between each other like a bunch of bell buoys in a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited, she felt eyes on her, and she turned to see the fat girl standing behind her gazing at her intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you Donna Pinciotti?\" the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned. Did this girl go to her school? Had she read the article? \"...Yes,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your mom Midge Pinciotti?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Donna was confused. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom goes to her dinner parties! She loves them! They're great friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief began to flood Donna's brain. \"Oh!\" she said with a shaky laugh. \"Yeah, okay! Great! That's... that's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, my mom used to be such a stickler about my weight, but after she met your mom, she's loosened the reigns a <i>lot</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn older woman who was easily twice Donna's size turned to look at them. \"I'm sorry, girls, did you mention Midge Pinciotti?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled awkwardly. \"Yeah, she's my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetheart! You're Donna! She's mentioned you! I host those dinner parties sometimes, and oh my gosh, they are just fantastic! I hardly ever go home hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman with a potbelly joined in. \"Oh, I've heard of Midge Pinciotti!\" she exclaimed. \"My friend Debra knows her! She got me started on this new 'high fat' diet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's brow furrowed. \"High fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you know what? She was so right! We shouldn't have to worry about our weight just to please men!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" said another young fat woman. \"We should be eating whatever we want whenever we want, and if we happen to gain some weight in the process, that's no one else's business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna found herself next in line at the cash register, so she had to disengage from the conversation for a couple minutes, but when she turned back, she found that several of the women were talking very animatedly about her mother. Some of them knew her, others knew <i>of </i>her, many knew <i>people </i>who knew her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped backwards out of the store wide conversation, she began to put the pieces together. Her mother. She was the cause of the weight gain epidemic. She'd started some kind of weird ripple effect that was spreading across Point Place and getting into the heads of all the women in town. The whole mindset that it shouldn't matter what a man thinks of a woman's weight -- it had all come from her mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something occurred to her. Her mother had only had that idea because of Donna herself putting that idea in her empty bimbo brain in the first place. None of this would be happening if she hadn't had that one sit down with her mother months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, this was all Eric's fault. That skinny twitchy little nerd had been trying to fatten her up. If he hadn't done that, she wouldn't have felt the need to justify her weight, thus setting off the domino effect, thus fattening the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna clutched her shopping bag as she tried to rub her temples and get a grip on herself. She tried to relax a little. This wasn't entirely Eric's fault. After all, Donna had never at any point stopped herself from eating. In fact, she'd been gaining like crazy since Eric <i>left</i>. Couldn't really blame every single extra pound on <i>him</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't her fault Midge listened to her advice. Midge could've just blown it off. Not her fault she decided to listen to - and completely misinterpret - her daughter's poorly thought out words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd these women - it wasn't her mom's fault they gained so much weight. They had choices. They could've gone about their lives and eaten celery the rest of their lives. But no, they wanted to pig out. In the end, they were all masters of their lives. No one made them do anything. They had all decided to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at her body. All 300 pounds of it. She had decided to become this. She had let her inner-love of food take control. It wasn't exactly a turn on, but dammit, she had decided that food was more important than her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, several of the women came waddling out of the store with their purchases, talking animatedly about how much they enjoyed eating and the pros and cons of their new sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl she'd been talking to at the beginning of the insanity came over. \"Hey, we're all gonna hit up the food court! You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. Was this happening? \"Uh... sure!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna could only imagine what this plus-sized brigade was going to look like to the various food court employees on duty tonight. She stood back and watched as they swarmed, dividing themselves up to the various little restaurants. She wandered around, looking to the hamburger joints, the pizza places, the taco stations, the ice cream parlors... Hell, even the cookie store was full of people looking to start dinner with some dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cascade of orders coming from each direction --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a double stacked with cheese, extra pickles, extra large fries -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -- extra pepperoni, extra sausage, ooh, and an order of breadsticks -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -- and don't skimp on the cinnamon bites! Those are the best ever -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -- an extra-large cola... You guys still do free refills, right? -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -- and sprinkle it with oreos and peanut butter sauce, and y'know what? Gimme TWO -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -- is this really all you have? Oh, I suppose I'll make do with just twenty, but they better have candy in them -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna watched them all in amazement. Those poor servers and cashiers were working quickly to keep up with the sudden onslaught taking place before them. All these women, all making pigs of themselves, spending hard-earned money on whatever junk food they felt like eating in that moment. How were they doing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut watching them all made her feel positively ravenous. She got in line at the nearest pizza place and ordered two slices of pepperoni. She took the tray with her food and cut across to the nearest hamburger joint, getting a number two with extra cheese and mustard. Then, she carried it all over to the ice cream parlor, getting a huge chocolate chip cookie dough sundae, coated in butterscotch. She got an extra large Dr Pepper from the drinks fountain and waddled her way over towards a lone table with a two chairs. She took one, brought around to the other, and sat down on both simultaneously. Enjoying having her entire butt stabilized, she set to work on her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, she looked out amongst all the fatties in the food court. Damn, these women could eat. Between talking animatedly about food, they were also cramming fistfuls of whatever they could into their faces. Burgers, fries, pizza, hot dogs, tacos, nachos, cookies, cakes, ice cream... Their faces were stained with anything and everything. Girls who hadn't been anticipating a group gorge were unbuttoning their jeans, giving their bellies room to grow. Some had worn elasticated waistbands, and even they needed to loosen them up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne woman had gotten at least three milkshakes from the burger joint, and she was clearly frustrated with how slow just sipping through a straw was taking. She popped off the plastic lid, removed the straw, tilted her head back and just chugged all three of the damn things. She rubbed her swelling stomach while her fellow eaters encouraged her. Some even went to get shakes themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, a young girl - probably the skinniest of the bunch, looking to be around 220 pounds - was almost literally inhaling an entire foot long meatball sub. She didn't stop for anything. Just munch that thing down until the entire foot was in her gut. When she was done, she leaned back and licked her fingers contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna worked her way through her own food. The burger was cooked to perfection. The fries were nicely salted. The pizza was gooey and greasy. And it all mixed nicely with the enormous ice cream sundae. It was such an enormous repast that it took her at least half an hour to eat it all. Especially all that ice cream. Even when she was just down to the melted parts, she took a page from her fellow eaters and just held the bowl up to her lips, chugging it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodness knows how much time passed after that, but at some point, Donna registered that it had become very quiet. She lolled her head over and saw all the women who had descended on the food court had by now descended into a collective food court. Pants were open, some shirts were either unbuttoned or rolled up, and greasy stained hands were rubbing enormously overstuffed stomachs. Some were still sipping on sodas, licking up ice cream or peering around for more food, but overall, everyone was looking very full and <i>very </i>happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was steadily coming out of her own stuffed-stupor as well. She peered down and saw that her own stomach was crammed tight. Her once-roomy jeans were unbuttoned. When had she done that? She looked at all the empty food containers before her. Had she had that many before? Did she go back for more? It certainly felt like it. She leaned back in her two chairs and marveled at what she had accomplished. How did she fit all of this inside her gut?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hefted it in her meaty hands. Her massive, massive gut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flitted around. All these massive, massive guts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long time before anyone felt like moving. But alas, some had families to go home to, some had things to do, lives to return to, etc. Donna found herself joining them in the incredibly difficult task of hefting themselves to their feet. She took in as deep a breath as she was capable of - not the easiest thing when she was this full - and re-buttoned them. She had just gotten herself situated when she saw a member of the cleaning crew standing nearby, waiting for her to finish. She blushed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... I imagine you don't see nights like tonight all that often,\" she said with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, no,\" he replied. \"But thanks for all the extra business.\" He set to work clearing the trash away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna heaved herself away. Might as well get back to her car and re-adjust the seat <i>again</i>. She planned on waiting for most of the crowd to waddle away rather than mingle with them, but to her surprise, many of them approached her. They thanked her and said to thank her mom for opening their eyes to the wonderful world of food. They said their lives were far richer and far more satisfying knowing they no longer had to worry about diets and being thin. They were free from a lifetime of \"dietary tyranny\", as one lady called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna didn't really know what to think. If Eric hadn't tried to fatten her up last year, this probably wouldn't have happened. But, she reminded herself, they had all made their choices. It wasn't up to her. She simply smiled and thanked them, and then watched as they all waddled very slowly out of the mall towards the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the healthiest of revolutions, she pondered as she brought up the rear, but hey, it was a start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ride home was super awkward for the overstuffed girl. She would really have to get a longer seat belt if this kept up. She couldn't breathe for the entire trip. But she made it in the end, and when that seat belt unclicked, it was the most glorious feeling in the world. Her stomach surged forward and filled the rest of the space between her and the steering wheel. She let her head loll back and gave herself a brief belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Donna got the door open and heaved herself out of the car. She briefly thought this would be easier with a boyfriend who could give her a hand, but she thought to herself, why should she be reliant on a man to get her out? If she was going to be fat, she would be totally self-sufficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, after nearly three minutes of hauling herself out of the car,  she thought maybe having someone to help her wouldn't be so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna froze at the familiar voice. No, no, no, she wasn't ready for this moment. She did not want to see him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there he was. Garbage bag in hand over his parents' garbage can. His eyes were wide and his face slack as he took her visage in. Holy crap, he still looked as cute as he had the last time she had seen him - when they broke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Eric,\" she said, trying to keep her emotions even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric seemed to weigh his options for a moment before he decided on a course of action. \"I... haven't seen you in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well... been busy, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Hyde said he saw you not long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna winced. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said... your parents were splitting up again. I'm... really sorry, Donna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh yeah, that's... it's no big deal. I mean, it is, but... it's for the best. They're just arguing all the time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he said your mom was thinking of moving to California.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stayed silent. Did he know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and... he said you were thinking of going with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, he knew. Her eyes fell to the pavement, not wanting to see his face. He might look hurt. Or worse, she might look indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Donna, you're really thinking of moving? I mean... I know you always wanted to get out of Point Place, but this is... going a little far, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... But Eric... there's nothing here for me anymore. I've been so focused on my career that I more or less exiled myself from my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your friends are in that basement right now, Donna! You could come and see them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I can't. Not after what's happened. Not after what I did to Jackie. The things I said to her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly think if you just talked to her, she'd forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I just can't... Not after what I did... That article I wrote...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I meant to ask about that... Why did you write that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took a deep breath and steeled herself. \"Because... I didn't like how big I was. I hated what I had become. I just... couldn't get comfortable in my body. But I felt so bad afterwards... and not just because of all the hate mail I've gotten these last few days... I started really looking deep inside myself, and I realized I was projecting my own self-loathing onto others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric winced. \"Donna, I'm sorry. It's my fault you gained weight in the first place. You wouldn't have gone through all this if I hadn't manipulated you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna waved him off. \"It's okay, Eric. Really. The truth is, I realize now I was living my life the way society wanted me to. Trying to be thin and 'conventionally attractive'. But now, I swear, food is amazing. I mean, I don't know if it turns me on like it does for others, but... I like it. I feel more natural like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Eric was genuinely surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I feel free to embrace my inner-glutton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled. \"Well, that's great, Donna. I'm glad this has worked out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled sheepishly. \"Yeah... I'm sorry I didn't realize this while we were still together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean... You have to admit, we had problems before any of this started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, I know. You're right,\" she sighed, trying not to sound like she had just been slapped. She knew they had talked about this during the actual breakup, but this reiteration that he had accepted it and moved on didn't make her feel any better. \"Um... I'm gonna go inside. I need to study for finals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. Hope I see you around sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and walked back to her house. She heard the sound of the trash bag being put in the can, and when she went to glance back, she saw that he had already disappeared around the hedge that divided their yards. Didn't even stay to watch her go. She felt a small piece of herself crumple and die. He was really done with her. Probably heading back to Jackie right now. Just knowing that her first love had truly moved on was not good for her ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how, but somehow, despite making an utter pig of herself at the mall, she wanted to pig out more. Just enough to drown whatever emotions she was feeling right now. Damn that twitchy little nerd boy for breaking her heart like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute she was inside, she set her purchases down and made a direct line for the fridge. She pulled it open, scanned its various contents, and found herself face to face with an enormous bottle of ranch dressing. Suddenly craving it more than ever in her life, she snatched it, wrenched open the top and put it to her lips. She threw her head back and started chugging it down frantically, clutching her belly as she did so. Get it all down. Let the flavor wipe your memory. Forget all about Eric Forman. Drown the heartbreak that she'd lost him. Drown all that logic that he was right that they were wrong for each other. Smother every last bit of sadness with this thick rich delicious dressing. Let every calorie sedate that sadness she felt inside herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she ran out of dressing. The empty bottle hung over her head as she peered inside and saw just how empty it really was. And this was a jumbo-sized bottle. The only way to eat salad. And she'd just consumed it entirely. On top of everything she'd had at the mall. It was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her enormous stomach, she dragged herself over to the living room and gently lowered herself onto the couch. She rolled up her shirt and gave her double belly a rub. She felt ill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost track of how long she was there, but it must've been a while, because the door opened, and in waddled Midge, wearing a very stretchy out fit that was covered in food stains. She came waddling through the door looking dazed. As she closed it, she looked over and saw her daughter lying back on the couch, clutching her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Everything okay, sweetie?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned. \"Mom... I ate too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, sweetie, you poor thing!\" Midge cooed, coming over and patting her daughter's tummy. \"How does that feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, feels good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRRRRRP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked up at Midge in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Midge looked a little embarrassed. \"Sorry, I just came from a massive dinner party, and now I'm feeling a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Massive?\" Donna finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge blushed. \"Yeah... just a tad. But goodness, sweetie - feels packed full in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I went to town, all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in silence for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she looked up at her mother, and she realized something important.</span></div></div>",

Maybe we can get another family of housewives together and get them into food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I like that idea! We can spread the word from coast-to-coast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. \"Mom, we're in the midwest. Not exactly a coast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Maybe we can move to Florida in a few years once we're done liberating the women of Cali.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a laugh. \"Maybe we can, Mom... Oof. It kinda hurts to laugh when I'm this full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I know,\" Midge sighed, settling herself down on the floor by the couch. \"You should've seen the spread at Barb's house. I swear, I may have gained another five pounds just sitting there. It took three of them to get me back to my car. All that juicy, succulent meat, coated in the best barbecue sauce... and mashed potatoes - I swear, there was a pound of butter on them... and just plate after plate of stuffing and turkey and cornbread... I haven't had good cornbread in so long! I swear, it was all so -- !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!

She grabbed a pillow and quickly covered her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge was still talking and talking and talking... until she found herself reaching down between her legs, and she realized what was happening. \"Uh... excuse me a second, sweetheart. Mommy needs to get a... thing from her closet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...,\" Donna muttered pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few tries to roll herself back onto her feet, but soon, the almost-perfectly globular woman was up and waddling up those well-worn stairs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pretended she was going to bed for her own sanity.</span></div></div>",

Aha ha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth her parents pulled her into a big hug - which was tricky, given how large she was by this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more excitement, they departed for the living room, and she went outside to sit on the porch for a while. As she lowered her enormous self into the sturdiest chair she could find, she couldn't help but notice Eric and Jackie standing nearby, giving her a blank look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what do you two losers want?\" she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to know what's really going on,\" Eric replied. \"Because there's no way in hell you got a promotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when I last saw you there, you flat out admitted that you were just in it for the free food,\" added Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie gave a chubby smirk. \"Just can't believe that I did that good a job, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued their blank looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. Even I don't believe that,\" she chuckled. \"So no, I'm not getting a promotion. I'm quitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes me believe the apartment story is quite true, either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's kinda true.\" Laurie acquired a devilish grin. \"I met someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a week ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like solid grounds for a relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be disgusting.

And I'm all in favor of being fatter and better. So, he's going to give me a room at his apartment in Chicago, and I'm going to live there as his good little piggy. He comes in and brings me food, gives me sex, and then he leaves me the hell alone. I have full access to everything in his place, access to whatever food I want <i>whenever </i>I want. I get to sit on my ever-widening ass and pork out, then get porked, and not do a damn thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir expressions must've been comical, because Laurie started giggling at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like this isn't your dream I'm living out, you two dorks.

Her parents were still never home, and the maid was a private sort who kept to herself, so they had plenty of privacy to do whatever they wanted. One thing he liked doing, however, was making food for her. Since he had found himself in a relationship with a girl who had a hearty appetite, he thought it pertinent to learn how to perform the task himself. He doubted he'd ever make enough money for servants anyway. Best to develop the skills required for the foods she desired (hey, that rhymes!) and be able to fill her tummy all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie had been doing pretty good for herself as she rounded out her junior year. She'd been steadily climbing in size, although she had slowed lately. Around the time she reached 300 pounds, she decided to get in some exercise just to keep herself relatively healthy. Obviously, this was not a healthy lifestyle in any sense of the word, but she still wanted to stay alive. Therefore, she went for long walks, did some light exercise and made sure to include plenty of fruits and veggies in her diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't mean she wasn't gorging herself frequently, of course. Hell, just the other day, she'd eaten a dozen doughnuts in one sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric finished cooking the meal on the big fancy Burkhart oven. He had decided to keep it simple tonight, so he had made a very simple spaghetti and meatballs. His mom had taught him how to do it, so the food was almost guaranteed to be amazing. It was an enormous pot, filled to the brim, and it was all set. He grabbed a pair of tongs and started piling it high. He knew she was hungry. Once it was fully loaded, it was towering very high, with at least five meatballs on it. Making a much more sensible-sized bowl for himself, he put them both on a tray along with their drinks and carried them over to the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Jackie sitting with her chubby fat face smiling at him. She was so lovely. She'd done her hair up and everything. He smiled in return and set the food down before her. She giggled when she saw the difference between the two bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, you can tell who's the big eater around here,\" she chuckled. \"You could stand to gain a few, too, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shrugged cheerfully. \"I could never deprive you,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So thoughtful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Jackie took her two forks and began the sumptuous task of literally shoveling the food into her gaping maw. She gobbled everything down, slurping up the noodles and chomping through the meatballs. Any pauses were simply for air and water. She kept at it, simply enjoying the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric worked away at his dinner. He kept enjoying watching her pig out from the corner of his eye. It was just so sexy, watching her stuff her face like that. He continued eating in silence. After all, she talked so much, he had learned to appreciate these rare silences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through dinner, she slowed down and took a breather. She was almost done. All the meatballs were gone. Still a good amount of spaghetti and sauce left. She held her stomach with one hand and slowly ate with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm?\" he asked, his mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Do you ever dream of me being totally dependent on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed down his food. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what Laurie said... about how her being totally dependent on some guy and getting fat for him were our dream... I mean, I was just wondering... What do you think about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked at her curiously. \"Well, I mean... what do <i>you </i>think? You're the one who'd be lying around all day, getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged bashfully. \"I mean, it's a nice thought, I suppose, but... I dunno. Part of me doesn't want to get that fat, y'know? I'd like to still be able to move around. Or at least waddle,\" she grinned. \"I just wanted to know what you thought of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric responded by scooching his chair over so he could put a hand on her knee. \"Jackie, all I want is for you to be happy. I honestly feel like we've gotten to the point where you could inflate to immobility or shrink down to your old skinny cheerleader self, and I don't think I wouldn't love you any less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled a small smile. \"You mean that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hundred percent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Because I think I'm at a pretty good size right now. Not in the mood to be rolled around Violet Beauregard style, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. It'd ruin your outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! See, you get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laughed before picking up her fork. \"Of course... just because we don't want a completely codependent relationship... doesn't mean I still can't do this...\" He scooped up some spaghetti and held it out her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, open wide, and he fed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to feed her the rest of her dinner, and then the rest of <i>his </i>dinner, and then, she was too full to go all the way up to her bedroom. Fortunately, he had a condom in his pocket, and she had the key to lock the dining room doors, so they made use of the dining room table instead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Graduation came and went without much fanfare. Donna was just relieved she was able to accept her diploma without getting booed off the stage. Her enormous graduation gown was like a tent on her enormous body, making her look like a hot air balloon. She waddled off the stage, beaming with pride to have finally completed high school. She also took a degree of pride in the fact that so many of these girls graduating were now enormous as well. Some were simply chunky, but there were some who had grown so fat that they needed a little help stepping onto and off of the stage. With all these black gowns, they were like a steady stream of bowling balls accepting rolls of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, she'd spent the next couple of weeks lying low, choosing to send out applications to various colleges in California. She'd found brochures for some interesting ones, many of which had exemplary journalism programs. She was accepted to a few of them, and she made appointments to tour them in the coming weeks. She couldn't wait to get her career started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seriously debated whether or not she should say goodbye to her friends, but in the end, she decided against it. Things had been said. Things she didn't think she should be forgiven for. At least, not right now. Maybe the next time she visited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she was thankful for was her parents managing to part on good terms. Bob and Midge accepted that they simply weren't meant to be, and it was time to move on. Bob even gave them the nice car to take on the road trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge, for her part, was very excited. They were going to stay at her parents' house in Malibu for a while before she found a good job close to Donna's school. Her folks had already sent her the details for some decent jobs - mostly desk jobs that didn't require much thinking, which suited Midge perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also looking forward to spreading the \"gluttony gospel\", as she liked to call it. She was determined to teach the skinny ladies of California how to enjoy food and not worry about what others thought of them. If it all worked out, she was planning to write a screenplay about it. The world needed to know it was okay to be obese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the big day came. Donna hugged her dad goodbye before loading the rest of their suitcases into the car. She got into the passenger side seat, and the whole car listed to the right. Midge soon got into the driver's side seat, and the car evened out again. Her mom had to readjust her seat as her enormous gut was pressed against the steering wheel. Even when reclined all the way back, she was still slightly pressed against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Midge groaned. \"I'm going to get a burn on my stomach from all the turning. I just know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all comes from eating too much,\" Donna lightly teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all comes from not making these cars big enough!\" Midge responded, missing the literary reference. \"We'll have to get a bigger car once we're in California.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, we need to save money, remember? We already have a lot to save for, between me going to school and how much we eat in a given day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know, sweetie...\" Then, her face lit up. \"Hey! You wanna stop off for burgers on the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \"Fine. But remember, we're on a schedule. We can't always be stopping for fast food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure. Absolutely.\" She paused. \"What if we just stopped once an hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could get ice cream, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge smiled, and she backed the car out of the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took one last look at her house, and then one last glance at the Forman house. She could see the entrance to the basement from here. She thought about asking her mom to stop so she could hurry downstairs to see her friends, but she once again decided against it. That part of her life was over. She needed to focus on her career. Put as many miles between herself and Eric as possible. It was the only true way she could move on. Drown her feelings in work and food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots and lots of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they pulled out onto the main road, Donna surreptitiously cradled her big belly in her hands. She glanced around the neighborhood and smiled at the sight of so many fat women out for walks. Some were alone, some were with husbands or boyfriends, some were walking dogs, but all were eating something. From a mere candy bar to a huge foot long sub, she felt proud of the knowledge that Point Place would never be the same place again.</span></div></div>",

Eric eventually got a degree in teaching. He started out as a math teacher at the high school before proposing a class dedicated to pop culture and its historical significance. He dedicated an entire section of his curriculum to Star Wars. He and Jackie would eventually get married after they'd both graduated college. They had a son a few years later, whom they named Luke, much to Red's annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie became a television producer at the local news station, quickly stifling any attempts at sexism and \"sizeism\" with her no-nonsense bossy attitude, quickly earning the respect of her colleagues - or fear, in some cases. While she continued to enjoy constant eating - there were always doughnuts and cookies at work - she decided it was time to stop gaining and leveled out at 315 pounds. Not that she wasn't eager to occasionally stuff herself. It was always a turn on that she and Eric enjoyed thoroughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde eventually found out his father wasn't his real father, and his real father turned out to be William Barnett, an African American business man who went on to hire him to run one of his record stores, Grooves. He eventually sold the chain, but he gave Hyde ownership of the store, allowing him to change the name to \"The Circle\". He went on to meet a nice girl, and although they never married, they lived together in a small apartment in Chicago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso's penchant for random sex led to him impregnating a plump librarian named Brooke at a concert. Although it took some going, she eventually accepted him into the baby's life, and they had a beautiful little girl named Betsy. He later joined the police, and they later moved to Chicago as well, becoming friends to Hyde and his girlfriend, who went on to become their girl's godparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez and Rhonda stayed together, eventually marrying a few years after Eric and Jackie. Fez became the owner of a candy shop in Madison, and he was always bringing home free samples for his lovely wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda became interested in computers and went on to become a programmer, working for big tech companies as computers became a hotter commodity. The plump nerd only grew larger as the money poured in, and she was soon a whopping 350 pounds. Her massive belly sometimes made it difficult to reach the keyboard! They eventually had two kids, Rico and Lucy, and they settled down into a nice suburban life, full of candy and love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, of course, accomplished absolutely nothing in life, instead preferring to leach off her rich fat-admiring lover in his nice apartment, with her own private room that came with a balcony. She rarely used it, preferring to stay inside and watch TV while relentlessly pigging out on whatever he brought her. Years of this went by, and she still didn't care to know his name. Her parents naturally found out that she lied to them, but by this point, they had decided that they were done with her. If she wanted to mooch off some guy for the rest of her life, they would let her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe probably should've felt a little sad about that, but Laurie was in hog heaven and didn't care at this point. Her life revolved around food and sex, and soon, she was well over 500 pounds. She so huge she could barely move without assistance. Even when she was leaning back on her increasingly-low couch, her enormous belly would graze the floor. She slept with a ventilator and rarely dressed, preferring to let her fat fly free. They never heard from her again, and frankly, none of them cared. Especially Laurie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn California, Donna was thrilled by the fresh start and started her journalism major at the University of California. She went on to work for TV studio that always had her on the move. She was traveling the world, always investigating stories and following leads. It was hectic, dangerous and sometimes downright terrifying. But it was thrilling. She learned so much from the locals, including at least three new languages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, the main thing she took away from these places was the excellent varieties of food. She was constantly sampling everything, and sometimes, she was even given free meals. She always cleaned her plate. Manners, after all. And of course, Donna gained even more weight. Eventually, she was at least 400 pounds, and she often found herself having to pay for an extra seat on the planes. In time, though, she grew weary of travel and settled down in LA, now helping young journalists prepare for their own travels at a local college. She became a firm favorite with her students, and the desk job really suited her now enormous frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still saw Midge frequently enough, but her mother had moved on to spreading the word of empowerment. She quickly found that the incredibly superficial people of California were a tad more difficult to convince than those in Wisconsin, but after months of hard work and always socializing, Midge managed to create herself a following. The skinniest women she had ever seen began to come to her parties, and soon, they were gaining weight. Over the many years of these campaigns, Midge's magic worked its way through out all of LA, and then up and down the coast, radiating outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidge was soon seen as an obese guru, and although her screenplay idea never panned out - there was just no changing Hollywood - she did manage to write a book about her exploits that became a huge hit, allowing her to retire comfortably. Midge would spend the remaining years of her life being an utter pig, always eating whatever she could get her hands on, no matter what it was. She ballooned to a mighty 470 pounds, with a belly so large that she spent most of her time on the sofa. She used that time to start writing another book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna often contemplated eventually returning to her friends. She would return to Point Place a few times a year to visit her dad. He'd met someone else - a plump intelligent woman named Joanne - so he wasn't exactly lonely anymore, but she visited them, and they visited her. She never visited the Formans though. Eventually, Red and Kitty decided to sell the house and move to Florida. When Donna saw a different car in the driveway, she felt a little heartbroken that she would never set foot in the basement again. But this had been her decision. She'd decided to leave her friends in favor of her career. She had to accept that. She never got in touch with them again, and she spent a lot of time convincing herself that it was the right decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Hyde's advice to heart, though. In time, she did learn to balance her work life with her regular life. She made friends in California. Friends that she saw all the time. She found love and lost it again many times. She soon got used to it. But then, she met a nice guy who was into fat chicks, but also into letting her have her own space and not try to tie her down. When she became a college professor, they got married, deciding not to have kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, after an enormous dinner that left her lying in bed with a belly so bloated she could barely see over it, she glanced over at the mirror on the wall, and she saw how enormous she was. A great big ball of a woman. So fat she only ever moved to go to the car and get to her desk. She stared at those big blubbery arms, that flabby triple chin, the two enormous rolls that made her belly, and her thunderous thighs. How had she ever doubted how beautiful she was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she listened to her husband coming up the stairs, knowing he was bound to love finding her lying her in her underwear with a stuffed belly, she vowed she would never forget how sexy she was again.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts were starting to mimic her mothers massive mammaries, her stomach had grown into a true gut, and her hips and butt had expanded greatly. Luckily, Eric noted, Donna wasn't developing any stretch marks and was still as pale as ever. Eric began to grope and grab Donna's fat vigorously. Eric, lost in his lust, wasn't aware that his grabbing was beginning to wake up Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chmm?\u201d Donna groaned barely audible as she opened her eyes, her thighs spreading on the mattress as she sat up \u201cEric, why are you grabbing my stomach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew he couldn't actually tell the truth, that he was groping all of her fat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric pulled into a local diner named the Farmer's Shop, while Donna munched on a few creme filled donuts. the Farmer's Shop was a real old-school diner. Everything on the menu was filled with butter and grease, which is exactly why Eric brought Donna here. Donna and Eric sat on stools directly in front of the stove, Eric noticed Donna's plump ass spilled of the edges of the small stool. A kindly old woman arrived quickly to take their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll just have two scrambled egg's and some grits please.\" Eric said politely to the waitress \"What do you want Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly sure what to get, there are so many options.\" Donna said, furrowing her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, realizing an opportunity when it presented itself, smoothly said, \"Why don't you get a little bit of everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, with her pot belly rumbling, decided that this was an excellent idea and began to make her order. \"I'll have one ham and cheese omelet, some hash brown, four pancakes, orange juice, french toast,  and ... some ... wheat toast to be healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old waitress quickly wrote down Donna's massive order, it warmed her old heart to see a young woman who wasn't afraid to eat. As a reward, the waitress instructed the cook to go heavy on the grease and butter. The food arrived quickly, due to the fact that the dinner was empty, and Donna quickly dug into her food. Eric was in awe of Donna's appetite, and couldn't help but stare. Donna ate her food like a starved dog, she drenched her pancakes in syrup and them wolfed them down. Her powder sugar coated french toast barely lasted ten minutes before it disappeared into Donna's stomach. The omelet and hash browns were mixed together and them inhaled. Grease and syrup had dribbled down Donna's double chin, and rolled into her cleavage. Donna's flabby arms were moving so fast that beads of sweat formed on her forehead. The dry wheat toast was slathered with butter, until the front side was completely white. Donna then washed down her entire meal with a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric finished his humble meal of egg and grits a couple minutes after Donna had finished her binge session. Eric had never been more aroused in all of his year of living, and had silently thanked god for making a woman like Donna. Donna was covered in sugar and butter, and needed assistance getting out the door. The kindly old waitress encouraged the couple to come back anytime, and Eric made a mental note to return in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Donna groaned in the car ride home \"I think i may have had to much to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense Donna\" Eric quickly said, wanting to end this line of thought immediately \"You didnt eat to much, its just that food from places like the Farmers Shop can be a little hard to digest. You just need to lay down and rest a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your probably right\" Donna said, wincing in pain \"I think i just need to lay down and get something light to settle my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a fountain shop and a pharmacy around the corner, I'll stop there and get some medicine and something sweet to drink. Would you like that?\" Eric soothingly said, trying to hid his excitement at the thought of Donna eating more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds nice... can we get some donuts while where at it?\" Donna sleepily mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Eric said while grinning, \"Yes we can definitely do that.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been about four days since Donna's massive binge at the Farmer's Shop, and the event had cause serious changes to Donna. While she had always had a large appetite, her gluttony had reached new heights recently. Donna was now constantly stuffing her face, and it was rare to see her without a snack in her hand. It was even rarer to see her doing anything that could be considered exercise. Ever since her gigantic butter and grease filled stuffing, Donna had become lethargic. Donna rarely ever moved, and if she did bother to get off her ass it was to get more food. Needless to say, the constant eating and utter lack of movement had drastic effects on her figure. Donna's body had absorbed every calorie that passed Donna's plump lips and turned it into fat. Donna's chest had surged forward and was now larger than her mothers. Her stomach was now no longer a pot belly, and was now a gut that hung over her crotch. The biggest change was behind her, her ass had absorbed the brunt of the gain and now spilled over chairs. Donna was now easily pushing 250 to 260 pounds on her tall frame. Eric had enjoyed seeing Donna become a true glutton, and was happy the Donna had become incredibly lazy. But he wanted more, and decided to introduce a stimulant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there gorgeous\" Eric said with a wide smile \"How's your day going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Eric, I didn't see you there.\" The truth was that Eric had been sitting on the couch next to Donna for the past twenty minutes, but she had been to busy eating to notice. \"I'm doing alright, but I running low on cupcakes and candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a real shame\" Eric said, who was genuinely sad that Donna's latest binge was coming to a close. \"But i think i got something that will cheer you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Donna said skeptically \"If your about to show me your penis i'm going to punch you till you cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not my penis this time i promise\" Eric said quickly \"I just got some really special Mary Jane that i thought you might like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually does sound nice, I could use a smoke.\" Donna said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric passed a pre-rolled blunt to Donna, and handed her a lighter. Eric watched excitedly as Donna took a long drag from the blunt. Because this was a special strain of weed that caused an extreme amount of hunger. Eric had previously used this, but his supply of the potent drug was used up by his bimbo sister. It took him a while before he could buy more, but now he had enough to last three months if he was careful. It took ten minutes before the munchies hit Donna hard. This wasn't your run-of-the-mill hunger, this was a level of hunger that was previously exclusive to the starving. Donna doubled over in pain, and started to sweat. Donna, desperate to stop the hunger, ran faster than she had in months into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna typically ate out of pleasure or stress, but now she was eating to satisfy a seemingly empty stomach.  Donna piled her plates high. Slices of leftover pizza, bowls of ice-cream and pudding, and cookies just everywhere. Donna decided to wash that all down with a few glasses of soda. Donna could feel her pants getting uncomfortably tight, but she continued. More pizza, more soda, more..just more. Donna made no attempts to reason with herself to stop eating, to save whatever was left of her figure. More food. Fudge. More fudge. Donna grabbed a jug of butter milk, normally only used for cooking, and began to chug the whole carton. More cream. More fat. Donna desperately trying to give her underwear some more room by taking one hand and slightly stretching her underwear elastic. She just couldn't compete with her urges. Eric was watching Donna closely, and a smile spread across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, want me to go get some burgers and fries?\" Eric said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, get five burgers and two bags of fries. Oh, and bring back some milkshakes.\" Donna said through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric got into his raggedy car, and began to drive to the nearest burger joint. Eric couldn't wait to see what would happen tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had just purchase a months worth for Donna last week and went to roll a joint to bring to his 320 pound lazy girlfriend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric opened the old lunchbox he hid his weed in and saw instead a note that read \"Hey little bro, took your weed! Laurie\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't believe it. His sister had stolen his weed before, but not a months worth.  He sat on the edge of his bed when it hit him that Laurie had no idea the potency of the weed and that it would not end well for her.  A smile crept upon his face as the weight she'd put on would be perfect revenge for stealing his stash.  That smile quickly dissolved as he knew he'd have to explain to his 320 pound angry stoner girlfriend why she wouldn't get her usual joint with breakfast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ignored the roll of flesh that formed as she bent over, the strain in the seat of her pants also bringing up alarm seeing as they were the supposed to be loose fitting.  The past month had gone in a flash and she felt like she was unaware of all that happened around her.  Each day was a blur as she woke up and smoked a bowl using Eric's weed, and the rest of her days had passed without her even being aware of what was going on.  Even now as she walked through the door of her home she had no idea she did so with an added 20 pounds to her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey lil bro,\" she said as she walked through the door, expecting a shouting match for stealing his weed.  Instead the tired looking Eric only stared at her with wide eyes and a smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, kicked you out of school i see?\" Eric commented, his eyes scanning Laurie's body as if taking notes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha,\" Laurie said, setting her suitcase down and plopping down on the couch, subconsciously pulling her shirt down as it rode up her softening midsection.  Just as she sat down there was a call from the kitchen, \"ERIC, GET IN HERE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed and stood up, looking weary and drawn out.  The past month had not gone well for him with Donna,  her need for the \"special\" weed had not dulled even in a month and instead she turned her craving to food, trying to find a substitute.  Needless to say she failed on all levels and it had taken it's toll on her waistline.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked into the kitchen where Donna was sitting at the table, a buffet of food nearly gone in front of her and all 350 pounds of her was taking up the whole side of the table.  Each slight movement sent a jiggle through her body and the chair creaked below her large ass that hung over the sides of the chair.  Despite the bossiness and constant eating and laziness Eric couldn't help but love seeing Donna's growth, he just wished she'd pay less attention to food and more attention to his adolescent sexual desires.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was amazed at how big she had gotten over the past five months since he added weed to her diet. Her appetite had massively increased, and she had obtained an addiction to pure greasy food, like burgers and pizza and fries. Donna was going almost everyday consuming huge amounts of greasy meals, having about 25 large burgers a day. Donna had also gained a sweet tooth. Whenever she wasn\u2019t found binging on greasy meals, she was busy binging on cakes and chocolatey desserts. The weed had also had some other effects on her, constantly making her out of breath which lead to her becoming even more super lazy. She now barely ever moved and sometimes fell asleep in Eric\u2019s basement, and it wasn\u2019t like kitty or red could do anything about it. No one could move her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had also become kind of a slob. The constant weed, as well as the weight gain and the extreme laziness, had made Donna kind of disgusting. She had begun constantly sweating leaving huge patches under her pits and between her rolls, and she had become very gassy. Out of all the things Eric loves about Donna\u2019s gain, the gas wasn\u2019t one, it was loud, it stunk and it lingered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of pure binging on crap Donna began a long struggle of getting up. \u201cEric help me out here I need to go to the bathroom\u201d Donna said panting. Eric did his best to help her of her bed and eventually got her up. Donna waddle to the bathroom and squeezed her way through the doorframe. About 5 minutes later Eric heard a huge scream. He quickly ran into the bathroom to see Donna staring at herself in the mirror whilst stood on a scale. <br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u201d Eric whispered. <br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit Eric. You lied. I\u2019m fucking huge\u201d Donna said angry at Eric and upset with herself. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Donna you look gorgeous.\u201d He said frantically trying to fix the situation. <br>\r\n\u201cEric It says weigh 548 pounds\u201d Donna said frustrated. \u201cYou look fine\u201d Eric said trying to calm her down. \u201cFINE!FINE! I\u2019m fucking obese\u201d Donna yelled at Eric. \u201cThis is all your fault, ever since I started dating you, I\u2019ve felt myself getting bigger. I just hadn\u2019t clocked on to how big until now.\u201d Donna shouted. \u201cHey, my fault, you seemed pretty happy to me when you where stuffing your face.\u201d Eric retaliated but then immediately regretted it when he saw her reaction. \u201cGET OUT NOWWW.\u201d Donna screamed furious. \u201cOh. Come on Donna relax. Why don\u2019t you get dressed and I\u2019ll take you somewhere to eat and we can talk about this.\u201d Eric said slightly scared as he tried to diffuse the situation. \u201cGet something to eat. Don\u2019t you see that\u2019s the problem\u201d Donna yelled. \u201cGet out, now. I never want to see you again. We\u2019re done!\u201d Donna yelled throwing Eric out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing Eric out Donna returned to her room and sat on her bed. There was a huge creek as her arse presses against the mattress. Donna looked at her self in the mirror across from her and got angry at how big she had let herself get, she turned to her side and saw all the food that she had still not finished. Her stomach began to rumble as she picked up a pizza and started to scoff it down. She began shovelling food down her mouth in stress and anger at her current situation. \u201cAfter this I need to get thin again, I can\u2019t stay like this disgusting pig.\u201d Donna thought mid bite of her food. \u201cI mean how hard can loosing weight be?\u201d Donna pondered as she picked up a burger and began eating it. </span></div></div>",

Donna knew she shouldn't, but she was hungy. Certain that someone would notice she was gone and come looking for he, she decided to take a bite. It was the most delicious burger she had ever tasted. She quickly ate the rest and begged Laurie for more. Unbeknownst to Donna; the burger, along with the other junk food Laurie made her eat, was packed with weight gain formulas and appetite stimulants. Donna couldn't stop if she wanted to. Laurie stuffed Donna's face with cheeseburgers, pizzas, fries, etc. until it was all gone. Donna quickly fell asleep after this. Laurie the began to rub her hostage's swollen, red belly. She began to fantasize about how big Donna was going to get.

Truth be told Donna was less than excited at the prospect of her grandmothers impending visit, and this fact showed in her attitude. To say that Granny Pinciotti was a rather odd individual was a dramatic understatement, as she had proved on numerous occasions just how unpredictably eccentric she could be. Donna could never tell whether there was something seriously wrong with her grandmother\u2019s mind or if her strange persona was all deliberate, but either way it didn\u2019t matter as the outcome was the same. To make matters worse Donnas erstwhile separated parents had recently rekindled their love for one another, and they were using Granny Pinciotti\u2019s visit as an excuse to have a romantic getaway together. This left Donna and her grandmother all alone for an unspecified amount of time, a fact which was playing on her mind as she combed her beautiful lustrous red hair in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonna!\u201d Yelled Bob, breaking Donna out of her dark mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d Donna yelled back, before sulkily heading downstairs to where her parents were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look so lovely honey\u201d Said Midge in her usual high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have to stay here with grandma?\u201d Demanded Donna, \u201cCan\u2019t I just go with you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t be able to use all of my best moves if you came honey\u201d Said Bob, suggestively nudging Midge and causing her to giggle like a school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna cringed at the sound and gritted her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine\u201d Said Midge, noticing the tension in her daughters jaw but Donna wasn\u2019t convinced that she would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared gloomily at the front door for a few moments before suddenly the door bell rang and her mood sank even lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere she is!\u201d Said Bob happily as he pulled the door open revealing Granny Pinciotti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a very small and frail looking old woman, with a big bee hive of blue hair on her head and beginnings of a small white beard growing on her chin. Her eyes were small and beady, but behind them Donna had always seen a keen and malicious intelligence that her parents seemed to overlook. Donna tried to fake a smile, but her heart wasn\u2019t in it so it was basically a strange grimace which her grandmother seemed to regard with a grim nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was your flight?\u201d Squeaked Midge as Bob helped her with her bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know\u201d Granny responded in a raspy voice, which was the result of a life of heavy smoking, \u201cLong\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief response seemed to add an awkward atmosphere, and it was very obvious that Bob and Midge wanted to leave as they were shifting uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 We\u2019d better be off anyway\u201d Said Bob, the words tumbling clumsily from his mouth, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long drive ahead of us\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay with Donna won\u2019t you?\u201d Asked Midge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u201d Replied Granny, in a tone that was quite gentle for her, \u201cWe\u2019ll have lots of fun I\u2019m sure\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot Donna a look and once again Donna saw something behind those eyes which made her feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then\u201d Said Bob, appeased by the response, \u201cSee you, have fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two linked arms and walked quickly from the house, closing the door behind them and leaving Donna with Granny Pinciotti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She wished her grandmother would drop this obsession she seemed to have with her weight. Donna loved her figure very much and she wasn\u2019t about to give it up just because her grandmother thought she was too skinny, she got enough shit from Jackie as it was let alone if she started to put on weight. Donna slumped down on the sofa and switched on the TV, happy to be free from her grandmothers company for the time being. After a short while of being hypnotized by the garbage on television, Donna smelt a wonderful aroma drifting into the room from the kitchen. Her mouth watered and her hunger announced itself by a loud rumbling coming from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 At least she\u2019s a good cook\u201d Donna said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a further half an hour, in which time Donna had almost dozed off on the sofa, Granny called her name which indicated that food was ready to be served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing\u201d Donna called back sleepily, as she slowly rose from the sofa with her stomach grumbling in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the kitchen her grandmother smiled sweetly at her, though Donna noticed that she gave her figure a good look up and down again. Donna sat down at the kitchen table, ignoring her grandmother\u2019s gaze. Granny Pinciotti then approached the table, holding what appeared to be a large smoking pie of some description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tuck in deary\u201d Said Granny with a smile as she placed the pie in the middle of the table, with a plate in front of Donna, \u201cEat as much as you can, you\u2019re a growing girl after all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed at the last comment and grabbed a knife, cutting herself a decent slice which she then transferred to the plate. As she ate she hadn\u2019t noticed that the expression on her grandmother\u2019s face had changed, and a large smile was slowly spreading over her face as she watched her grand daughter eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her cheeks had had a generous amount of blusher applied and this combined with extra eye liner and lipstick made her look almost doll like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look so precious\u201d Said a familiar voice and Donna looked up and scanned the room for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Pinciotti was sat watching her, with a rather vacant yet happy expression her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Demanded Donna, sounding extremely panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing to fret about\u201d Replied Granny simply, but Donna obviously didn\u2019t agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I manacled to a chair wearing these ridiculous baby clothes then?!!\u201d Said Donna hotly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour bound to the chair to prevent you falling and getting a boo boo\u201d Said Granny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna raised an eyebrow, \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d She said suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I dressed you because I felt these clothes were much nicer than your old ones\u201d Said Granny, either ignoring or not registering Donnas question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnas mouth hung agape at this last statement, \u201cYou undressed me?!\u201d She yelled, \u201cYou saw me naked?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Pinciotti smiled at her, apparently not even acknowledging her granddaughters heated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve dressed you deary\u201d She said sweetly, \u201cNow\u2026 it\u2019s lunchtime for you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry\u201d Donna said immediately, but Granny wagged her finger at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019re a growing girl, you need to eat\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you stop it with that!\u201d Yelled Donna, \u201cI don\u2019t want to put on weight!

Now open wide\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna opened her mouth, though rather to offer a heated response rather than to obey her grandmother. Unfortunately for Donna however it served the same purpose, and before she could voice her anger a large spoonful of a thick porridge like mixture was forced in. Donna swallowed the mixture, her face flushed pink with indignation as Granny passed the spoon and large jar of the mixture to Jackie who took it gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just feed her if you would deary\" Said Granny Pinciotti, putting on a thick pair of glasses \"Lets see if she's fattened up a little from her last feeding\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"With pleasure!\" Said Jackie with obvious enthusiasm and proceeded to cram another spoonful of the thick fattening mixture into Donnas unwilling mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -Mrrff!- are the worst friend ever!\" Said Donna angrily through mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw your just cranky cuz your hungry little Donnakins\" Said Jackie, holding Donna by the chin as she crammed spoonful after spoonful into her mouth \"Eat up you little glutton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Granny Pinciotti probed her granddaughters mid section, humming to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, perhaps a little softer\" She said thoughtfully \"But still far too skinny... We have a lot of work to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded in agreement and gleefully continued feeding Donna the fattening mixture.

The day progressed in much the same way as yesterday had, with poor Donna having meal after fattening meal forced past her lips into her growing belly. After each huge meal Donna was allowed a brief period in which she succumbed to her food coma and had a nap, allowing the food she had been forced to consume to digest and the many many calories it contained to transfer themselves around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay sweetie?\" Asked Granny Pinciotti after stuffing in the last spoonful of pudding into Donnas exhausted mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...

Truth be told for as long as she could remember, Jackie had been keeping a rather dirty secret. The whole reason she had become a part of the feeding and humiliation of her own friend was because this entire scenario was her greatest sexual fantasy. At first she had been happy to observe and take part in feeding Donna, but now she longed to be on the receiving end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I...

She struck poses, the sight of her ridiculous appearance only turning her on more as Granny Pinciotti tied a bib around her neck (which read \"I'm a big girl\") and put a large pacifier in get mouth, which Jackie sucked on happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then deary\" Said Granny Pinciotti \"Let's get you fed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie happily skipped along after her, and allowed herself too be strapped into a high chair next too Donna (who was still sleeping from her days feeding). Granny Pinciotti removed  Jackie's pacifier and brought over a large pot which had been sat on the cooker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide dear\" Said Granny sweetly and Jackie immediately obeyed, her eyes bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Pinciotti proceeded to spoon feed the gleeful Jackie, <br>\r\nwho was clearly over the moon with being given this opportunity to live out her greatest fantasy. She moaned happily as she slowly ate her way through the large pot of the fattening mixture, loving the feel of her belly slowy bloating outwards against the silky fabric of her outfit. Of course due to Jackie's incredibly slender frame it wasn't long before she felt the food wall approaching as she struggled to keep up with the feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Urrp!!...\" Jackie groaned as spoonful after large spoonful was forced into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how full she was feeling Jackie was pleased that Granny Pinciotti showed no sign of slowing down the feeding, because although her body was begging for a reprieve from the constant stuffing her mind was desperate to continue. It was a real struggle but the feeling of growing fullness only turned Jackie on more which inspired her to keep eating. Finally, after what seemed like a real long time Jackie swallowed the last mouthful and slouched back into her high chair moaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl\" Crooned Granny Pinciotti, stroking Jackies pig tailed head \"Soon you'll be nice and fat like my dear granddaughter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Granny...\" Jackie responded in a barely audible whisper \"I'll get big and fat for you -Hic!-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Jackie had fallen sound asleep, her chin resting on her chest as her bloated belly gurgled unhappily. Granny Pinciotti watched over the two slumbering girls happily, imagining how big and fat they would soon be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jackie began snoring softly, Donna stirred and slowly opened her eyes. She looked around in bleary confusion for a few moments until she noticed Jackie next to her. She smirked to herself, happy that her former tormentor was now apparently sharing the same fate as her and had been forced to wear the same humiliating outfit. Of course before she could revel too much in this small victory her main tormentor loomed over her once more, a wooden spoon in one hand and a large pot in the other. Donna sighed sadly to herself before she opened her mouth and the spoon was pushed in, the sweet porridge like mixture soon making its way down her throat into her belly. Granny Pinciotti smiled to herself at the lack of fight from her granddaughter, and she happily stuffed spoonful after spoonful of the incredibly fattening mixture into her mouth. Donna noted that her stupid outfit was beginning to feel a little uncomfortable, as it pinched slightly in certain areas indicating (to her mournful realization) that she was starting to outgrow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right baby\" Crooned Granny Pinciotti \"Fatten yourself up for Granny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned as more of the thick fattening mixture was forced into her growing belly and just then Jackie stirred from her slumber. Donna glanced at Jackie from the corner of  eye as another spoonful was forced into her mouth, thankful that she would soon be sharing the same fate as her. Jackie watched on as Donna was fed like a baby, a look of haughty jealousy on her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be fattened up to Granny!\" She announced \"I'm too skinny and must be fed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was astonished at what she had just heard Jackie say, and she turned to look at her in complete amazement. Granny Pinciotti grabbed Donnas face, squeezing her cheeks so her mouth opened unintentionally as she turned her back to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Donna my little piglett\" She said, semi scaudingly as she pushed another heaping spoon of the weight gain mixture into her mouth \"You focus on eating and getting fatter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked sullen as spoonful after spoonful was forced past her lips, and she felt the familiar feeling of fullness begin to grow. Granny used her other hand to grab another large wooden spoon, which she then loaded up with the mixture and pushed into Jackies awaiting mouth. Jackie clearly felt very differently about what was happening than Donna did, as she looked like she was in heaven while Donna looked completely dejected and miserable. The pot was slowly emptied into the girls bellies and, after a short while, it was empty and the girls sat panting in their chairs, their bellies full once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are my favourite little piggies feeling?\" Crooned Granny Pinciotti affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Very full granny\" Replied the two stuffed girls groggily (Jackie showing more enthusiasm than Donna)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what i like to hear\" Said Granny Pinciotti serenely \"Now once that's gone down my dearies, we'll start you're next feeding\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Pinciotti squeezed the girls cheeks affectionately, Jackie smiled back at her while Donna looked rather sulky. When Granny Pinciotti had left Donna turned groggily to her former friend who stared back at her lethargically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with you?!\" She said in exasperation \"First off you completely betray me, joining that complete maniac in fattening me up against my will. Then you join me in getting fattened up, and what's more you enjoy it! Have you completely lost upper mind?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Replied Jackie simply \"And don't talk about your grandma like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glared back, her fatigue giving way to a bubbling anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk about her however I want\" Donna snarled \"What kind of grandma forcefully restrains and force feeds her granddaughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best grandma in the world\" Said Jackie, a far away look in her eyes \"This is my dream Donna, and you aren't going to ruin it for me! You are going to be my little fat playmate, and together we are going to be fattened up past obesity and if you've got a problem with that then that's just too bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was truley speechless at what she had just heard and merely sat staring at Jackie, her mouth slightly agape. It was hard to imagine something more out of character for super superficial and shallow Jackie to admit to than enjoying having her perfect body being taken from her in such a humiliating fashion, but that seemed to be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Donna stole an occasional nervous glance at Granny Pinciotti between staring fixedly at her feet, trying to get an idea of how the information was being received and saw that her grandmas face was unnervingly still. Donna wondered how much worse things were going to get for her as she examined the new small layer of pudge which had accumulated around her once completely slim midsection. When Jackie had finished an unpleasant silence followed, and Donna gulped when she looked up and saw a dark look in her grandmas eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that will never do\" Said Granny Pinciotti slowly \"I am very disappointed in you Donna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me to\" Jackie chimed in and Donna shot her a poisonous look \"I think she needs to be taught a lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I agree dear...\" Said Granny Pinciotti darkly \"I wholeheartedly agree...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft!\" Said Donna suddenly, obviously reaching the point where she knew things couldn't get any worse \"What exactly are you going to do me that you haven't done already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Donna\" Said Jackie, her condescending tone already grating \"Put yourself in my, dainty little baby shoes... You've been fantasizing about this scenario for most of your life, waiting for your chance to be fattened up alongside your pretty little, red headed play mate... That's you by the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I got that\" Said Donna rolling her eyes \"What's your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My point is\" Said Jackie, her voice deliberately steady \"My dear Donnakins... If you think you've experienced the extent of what's in store for you, you really are naive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gulped at this statement, finally coming to terms with just how serious her former friend was. Under the unwavering gaze of Jackie Donna folded her arms defiantly, refusing to give her any satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then\" She said, regretting the words as they left her mouth \"Do your worst\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Granny Pinciotti exchanged rather unpleasant glances at this before turning back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think somebody is a little cranky\" Said Granny Pinciotti \"Maybe you need a little walk around the neighbourhood\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Said Donna, seemingly confused before the meaning dawned on her \"Looking like this? No... No! I am not going out like this! What if somebody sees me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh keep up Donna baby\" Crooned Jackie condescendingly \"That's the whole point! But don't worry, ill be right there with you... Lets feed her again until she's too full to complain anymore, then we can show off whata big girl she has become to everybody\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea dear\" Replied Granny \"Open wide Donna deary\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo-mrrrfff?!-\" Exclaimed Donna desperately but was cut off by a mouthful of the sickly porridge mixture she'd been fed the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was really struggling against the feeding this time as she knew what would happen afterward, so Jackie also joined in just as she had when she had first arrived. Together the sadistic pair stuffed poor Donna silly, and it wasn't long until Donna stopped fighting completely as the familiar feeling of fullness began to take hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's stopped resisting Granny\" Said Jackie, as she stuffed a heaping spoonful if the fattening mixture into Donnas weary mouth \"And I'm feeling a little... Left out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh where are my manners\" Said Granny Pinciotti \"Please take a seat deary, lets fatten you up some more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Said Jackie in excitement as she rearranged her frilly skirt and sat down in her high chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Pinciotti now fed both girls, using a hand for each. Donna was visibly slumped in her chair, the obvious bulge of her full belly accentuated by the taut material of her baby doll outfit which was clearly beginning to struggle to contain it. Jackie looked over her friends/ play mates growing body, noticing how full her breasts were and how prominent her belly was becoming with obvious jealousy. Though she got a lot of pleasure from seeing Donna being forcefully fattened up and humiliated (she felt a warm pleasure grow in her loins at the sight), she was becoming impatient by her own gain as she wanted to become to fat for her own ridiculous outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ulp! Urrrp! That's it Granny\" She said blissfully, as she ate as quickly as she could to speed up her own feeding \"Feed me! Fatten me up! I want to get so big and fat for you! Mrrrff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep eating like this you will my little piglet\" Said Granny Pinciotti with a warm smile as she stuffed another heaping spoon of the fattening mixture into both girls mouths \"You'll be even fatter than plump little Donna over here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna mumbled a response through her weary groans as another spoonful was forced into her exhausted mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very thorough feeding it was time for poor Donnas punishment. The poor girl was so full that she could barely stand up under her own power, so Granny Pinciotti strapped her into a adult sized pram so she could be wheeled around with ease. Jackie was also incredibly full but as there was only one pram (Granny Pinciotti hadn't anticipated Jackie's dark desires) she was attached to some reigns. She didn't mind too much however as, although her full belly made it hard to walk it afforded her the chance to interact with whomever she came across on her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, its time for our walk!\" Said Granny Pinciotti brightly \"Time to show the whole town what big girls you've become!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yayy! -hicccc!-\" Exclaimed Jackie, with surprising energy despite how full she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. Oh God... Urrrrpp!!\" Mumbled Donna miserably, her eyes almost fully closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens during the walk?</span></div></div>",

Donna groaned as she was wheeled over bumps in the pavement, her stomach emitting similar miserable noises as it pressed uncomfortably against her stupid outfit. The strange procession drew many a confused glance from passersby, which was only facilitated by Jackie who seemed to be taking delight in her own humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello sir -hiccc!-\" She said to man she knew was familiar with her family \"Don't you love what Granny has done to me? Aren't I a big girl? And only getting bigger? Urrp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie pulled her baby doll outfit tighter over her taut belly, giving the man a better look at its bloated form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Um... Yeah sure\" Stammered the man, completely taken aback by the girl before him who he knew to be a superficial spoilt brat \"You certainly are a... Ahem... Big girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis response seemed to delight Jackie, who bit her lip sexually as she curtsied for the man. The man looked extremely uncomfortable and bewildered, taking the moment to shuffle off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good dear\" Said Granny \"I think he really liked your new look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both insane\" Mumbled Donna \"Completely, certifiably, insane\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw I don't think Donnas getting into the spirit Granny\" Said Jackie, giving a cute pout which really suited her new look \"She's such a little sour puss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear\" Said Granny Pinciotti, shaking her head sadly \"I'm really getting tired of your attitude young lady... Maybe we need to show you off to some of you're friends, maybe then you'll begin to get into the spirit of things and stop being such a little grouch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked horrified at this, her weary continence giving way to one of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nn... No\" She stammered as she was pushed along in her adult sized baby stroller \"Please no Granny... Ill do anything... Anything but that! Would you like to feed me somemore? Lets fatten me up! I can be a big flabby playmate for Jackie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft\" Exclaimed Jackie derisively \"That's going to happen anyway so you can stop begging... I think our friends would love to see what big girls we've become... In fact, Granny, could you please feed us both some more? I want us to have big bloated bellies for our friends to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course dear\" Said Granny, pulling two huge baby bottles from her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were already far past stuffed already, but Jackie was determined to push herself and Donna to the limit, to ensure they both gained weight as quickly as possible. Jackie accepted the large bottle with gusto, greedily suckling at the bottles teat despite her bloated bellys less enthusiastic grumblings. Donna was much less willing however, so Granny forced it into her mouth and held her nose, giving her no option but to suck down the fattening mixture in the bottle. Donnas outfit was really feeling tight at this point, and it was quite obvious that it was several sizes too small for her. Jackie noticed this, seeing how her friends outfit bunched up tightly over her protruding belly, and became jealous so she began greedily slurping down the fattening mixture in her oversized babies bottle, desperate to get as fat as Donna. As this was happening a friend of Donnas father happened to walk past. He had to double take due to how strange the scene was and recognised his friends daughter sat in a babies stroller in her baby doll outfit being forced to drink a large babies bottle by an old lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna is that you?\" He said finally, in complete disbelief \"What... Why are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrp! She's my chubby playmate!\" Jackie announced after finishing her own large bottle \"But I'm chubby to! Don't you think?! Please tell me how fat I'm getting!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie presented the very confused man with a side on view of her belly, clearly desperate for him to tell her she was fat. The gorgeous, peculiarly dressed brunette actually wasnt particularly fat (Though she had gained an astonishing amount of weight in such a short amount of time, as she now weighed 133 lbs), but the amount she had consumed had awarded her with an impressively immense bloated belly which was packed tightly against the fabric of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. Um... Yeah sure, you're fat\" Stammered the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc... Thanks...\" Jackie purred, get hand idly stroking her groin where amazing feelings were building \"Donna is undeniably the star of the show at the moment though... I mean look at this frickin belly! She used to be really slim, but jeez she had let herself go hasn't she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked completely miserable as she continued to suckle on her baby bottle of fattening milk and Jackie grabbed her protruding belly, lifting it up (which caused a seam to pop on her tight dress) before letting it drop with a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... She is also quite fat...\" Said the man, frowning as he saw the extra weight on his friends daughter whom he had always known to be slim \"Donna... Why are so chunky... And dressed like a baby... And being fed in the street by this old lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna finally swallowed the last of the bottled weight gain milk and slumped back into her stroller as the teat was removed from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhraaap\" She exclaimed, too weary to stifle it \"What she said... Hiccc... I'm her chubby playmate and only getting fatter... Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother seam on her outfit now popped, leaving a small tear along the side of her left love handle. Donna now weighed an impressive 158 lbs, and she could feel every unwanted pound of it on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think your father would appreciate your... Um... New look\" Said the man warningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's going to have to learn to live with it I'm afraid\" Said Granny Pinciotti gravely \"As this will be her permanent new look\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc.. Um... Permanent?\" Asked Donna with a fearful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yayy!\" Exclaimed Jackie clapping her hands together happily \"You'll be my big fat playmate forever!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Okay then\" Said the man, clearly having had enough of this bizarre meeting \"Good luck with that Donna... I'm sure you'll make a very good fat baby playmate out whatever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared after her fathers friend miserably, desperate to escape her fate but knowing she was powerless to do so as she was wheeled away in her stroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do they see next?</span></div></div>",

There was not a head on the road that were turned to watch the bizarre procession, with even people hanging out of the windows of their home to observe. Jackie slurped away greedily perfectly aware of how much attention she was drawing to her own humiliation, but this only spurred her on. Suddenly a recognizable voice called over from over the street, the tone shrill and amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Said Laurie Forman in amused disbelief \"Is that...? It can't be! Jackie and Donna! Oh my God, just look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, who was barely awake due to the almost constant food coma she'd been in for the past day, looked on in exhausted misery as Laurie crossed the road toward her. If she had the strength she might of blushed out of extreme embarrassment at being seen by her boyfriends bitchy older sister in her ridiculous outfit and predicament. Jackie too looked surprised to see Laurie, whom she (or Donna either as a matter of fact) had never liked, but her expression was not of misery but of mild delight. The feeling of seeing somebody she knew (no less somebody so connected to her group of friends) gave a sudden spark of complex emotions inside her, as now with mixed fear, excitement and arousal she knew there was no going back. Her new life and kink would be public knowledge by the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well girls\" Said Laurie as she approached them, an unpleasant look of delight on her face \"Just what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could you like feed me... And tell me what a fat loser I am...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is like a turn on for you isn't it?\" Asked Laurie looking amused \"Dirty little bitch... But hey, who am i to complain? Tormenting losers is somewhat of a hobby and a turn on for me to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the walk back to Donnas home Laurie berated Jackie with insults and harsh comments. Meanwhile Granny handed her food to stuff into Jackies mouth, while she herself kept up Donnas force feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right you fat loser slut, let me stuff your face \" Said Laurie as she stuffed donut after donut into Jackies greedy mouth \"You're such a freak, you know that right? I mean, look at yourself! Kelso will leave you for sure after he hears about this... Which he will as soon as I tell him... Just think about that fatass, being shunned by your boyfriend and all your friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... Mummfff!!\" Exclaimed Jackie suddenly before another donut was forced into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you didn't\" Said Laurie with amusement \"Did you just orgasm? You did didn't you? Oh my god you're such a weirdo loser haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrp... I sure did...\" Replied Jackie wearily, the orgasm she'd felt taken her by surprise yet she yearned for more \"Its lucky I'm wearing this -hiccc- silly diaper tehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shook her head at the sight of the completely humiliated and ever expanding beauty, before turning her gaze on her brothers girlfriend. She snorted with laughter at the sight of her, her eyes half closed at slumped in her stroller in her ridiculous baby doll outfit, her bloated belly rising and falling noticeably with each labored breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Granny?\" Said Laurie sweetly \"Could we swap playmates? I'd love to spend some time with Donnakins hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear\" Replied Granny happily \"My pretty little granddaughter is being a little fussy, but please feed her some more! She's wasting away the poor thing, needs some meat on her bones!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh I agree\" Said Laurie evilly, lowering her face down to Donnas who stared back in mute, weary, horror \"Lets get some meat on those bones my precious little dumpling\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna whimpered as Laurie grabbed a large spoon from Granny and loaded it high with the fattening baby food she had been fed the past few days. Meanwhile Jackie began to caress her body and moan at the sight of her friends miserable predicament, just as she felt the nipple of her babies bottle being stuffed past her lips and she began suckling away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the bizarre ensemble arrived back at the Pinciotti household, Donna was stuffed to the brim and beyond. The buttons leading up the back of her silky, babydoll dress, were noticeably straining as her girth pressed tightly against the front of the garment, and stress lines ran between the button holes and all over the rest of the dress. Laurie was clearly hoping to stuff the poor girl until she burst free of her silky prison, but her wish was left annoyingly ungranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you fat pig\" Said Laurie impatiently as she continued to spoon fed Donna, pushing spoonful after heaping spoonful of the calorific baby food past her weary lips \"You've got to pop at least one button, geez! I mean look how tightly your packed into that stupid outfit fatass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc- Please Laurie-urrrp! Murrrrf!!\" Donna begged wearily, before another helping was stuffed unceremoniously into her mouth \"Please... No moreufffff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie paid no attention and merely continued to pile as much food until her mouth as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dear, here we are\" Announced Granny, as a very turned on Jackie suckled away at her large baby bottle, desperate to get as fat as possible \"Won't you come in and join our fun day?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Laurie, looking from Donnas bloated, defeated form to Jackie who was currently pleasuring herself as she sucked on babys bottle \"I guess i could stick around a little while hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's wonderful\" Said Granny jovially \"Please follow us and let the play date begin\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie wheeled Donnas stroller after Granny and Jackie into the Pinciotti home. Laurie turned to close and lock the door behind her, but as she did she suddenly felt somebody grip her from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the!!!??\" She cried, but it was too late as Granny Pinciotti pulled a rag over her mouth, which after a few breaths caused the gorgeous blonde to fall limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh shhh\" Said Granny \"You have a nap deary... When you wake up our play date can begin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie groaned lethargically as her heavy eyelids opened and her foggy mind returned to her. She couldn't understand what she was seeing at first, as she looked over herself and found her clothing was not if her usual style and she seemed to be restrained. When she looked around however and noticed the miserable form of Donna and the clearly sexually aroused Jackie the gravity of the situation slowly dawned on her. In horror she examined herself again and found that she was wearing the same ridiculous baby doll outfit as the others, only hers was yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" She whimpered as she vaguely pulled against her restraints which bound her to her chair \"No... Noo!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back deary\" Said Gramny Pinciotti, beaming down at her \"you've been an awful lazybones, but I'm glad to see your back with us and ready to join in on the fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?!\" Exclaimed Laurie \"Dressing me like a dork baby and tying me to a chair is fun?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed to be having fun when the same thing was happening to me\" Said Donna coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well...\" Said Laurie, shrugging \"I came here to have fun at your expense, I didn't sign up for this! Untie me you crazy old freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear\" Said Granny, shaking her head \"Such a bad mouth for such a pretty girl..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys\" Said Laurie ignoring Granny and pleading with the other baby doll captives \"You've gotta help me.. For old times sake, I mean we're friends right? You gotta get me out of here! I don't belong here! And I promise when I leave I'll try really hard to not tell anybody about thushhhmmmrfff?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh dear\" Said Granny Pinciotti soothingly, cutting off the loud mouth blondes pathetic pleas with the business end of a funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's the end of your public speaking career\" Said Donna sarcastically \"And you were doing so well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Donna be nice\" Said Granny warningly \"This poor girl is wasting away... Let's get some meat on those bones shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay!!!\" Cried Jackie, excited at the thought if another chubby playmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was wide eyed in horror as Granny Pinciotti attached her feeding tube to a large barrel, which in turn began pumping a thick creaming liquid into her mouth and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to hell\" Said Donna upon catching Lauries fearful gaze \"Bitchmrrrggfshh?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said play nicely dear\" Said Granny, her calm tone not matching the fact that shed just rammed a large spoonful of fattening baby food into her granddaughters mouth \"I... Will... Not... Have... Bad... Manners... In... This... House!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach word was followed by a new heaped spoon of the calorific mush, which poor Donna had no choice but to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do hope you'll learn your lesson dear\" Said Granny, still in the same calm tone \"But just to be sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rammed a funnel into Donnas mouth now, and dumped a huge tub of baby food, honey, and a number of other fattening ingredients down it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gluglugluuuggluuggg\" Donna exclaimed, wide eyed at the speed she was expected to swallow the mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jackie was giggling as she watched her playmates being stuffed silly, and slinked her hand into her diaper to pleasure herself to the sight of it. Granny could see what Jackie was doing, but continued to dump the fattening concoction down her granddaughters throat regardless. The only sounds in the room were that of frenzied gulping from the two unlucky feedees and sharp exhalations of breath and aroused moans from Jackie. Donna and Laurie met eyes once more, and shared the same look of misery as their bellies bloated slowly outward from the fattening mush which was being forced into them. Donna could feel that her baby doll dress was definitely getting too small now, as it pinched and cut into her flesh in several places, and their were growing stress lines over her bulging breasts and belly. Granny continued to feed poor Donna so that Jackie was able to finish and after ten minutes of none stop stuffing Donna just wanted to cum already. Finally, with a loud build up and a penultimate shrill wail Jackie climaxed and shot her load into her diaper. To Donnas relief she was finally allowed to rest at this point (Laurie was not so lucky though) and she sat sprawled in her chair breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dirty girl\" Said Granny to Jackie, though sounding more amused than angry \"Have you no shame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am\" Replied Jackie, trying to act timid but unable to stop the corners of her mouth twitching into a smile \"I'm a disgusting dirty girl who should be punished\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny nodded in agreement, but looked the gorgeous olive skinned beauty up and down with distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be punished... severely\" She said, sounding much sterner than usual \"But first, your fat too skinny my dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny advanced on Jackie, who pretended to cower from her in her chair, though her sordid excitement was palpable. Granny pushed a funnel past Jackies lips, who was not nearly as reluctant to accept it as Laurie had been, and attached the hose to another barrel. Soon the same creamy thick liquid was pumping down the hose and into Jackies mouth who gulped it down greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got some way to go to catch with Donnakins here\" Said Granny \"Speaking which, let's get you weighed deary while these little piggies fill their bellies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny undid Donnas restraints and helped her too her feet, while Donna merely groaned feebly. Once on the scales Granny's face lit up when she saw her granddaughters new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"168\" She said happily \"Oh that's just wonderful dear... Your looking healthier already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Healthier... Urrrp\" Said Donna weakly yet scornfully as she grabbed at her own belly bulge and shook it to make a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion actually popped a few seams on her now skin tight baby doll dress, something which Granny noticed and seemed to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your going to a new outfit soon at this rate deary\" Said Granny \"Your beginning to look a teeny bit like a sausage bursting from its skin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? And who's fault is that?\" Demanded Donna grumpily \"Cant I just wear normal clothes? I feel like such a dork on this stupid thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waste not want to my dear\" Said Granny simply \"There's still some life left in that lovely dress, but once you've completely outgrown it I promise you'll get an even nicer outfit to show your friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna folded her arms and rolled her eyes, feeling her \"lovely dress\" pinching at flesh under her armpits as she did. Judging by how Granny had avoided the question, Donna knew that her humiliating ordeal was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pout dear\" Said Granny, seeing her granddaughters usual sullen expression \"Let's go and check on your playmates shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed and followed Granny back to Jackie and Laurie, hoping to get a little satisfaction from seeing Laurie getting what she deserved. The two gorgeous girls were exactly as they'd left them, both of them still being forcefully stuffed silly. Donna smirked at how miserable Laurie looked, her stomach becoming noticeably bloated beneath her ridiculous baby doll outfit as more and more fattening mush was pumped into it. To Donnas disgust however, Jackie looked like she were having the time of her life. Despite having had a very public orgasm only minutes before she looked as though she was on the cusp of another as she greedily slurped at her feeding tube and moaned and squealed in pleasure. Granny sat in a rocking chair and watched the two beauties gorge, clearly happy at the sight, and Donna felt relieved at the break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Slowly the old sadist dozed off and Donna seized the chance to escape.  She got slowly from her chair, being very careful not both not wake her Granny and also not get Jackie so attention as she knew her former friend would snitch on her. Luckily Jackie was far too absorbed with the sexual pleasure she was experiencing from her humiliating feeding, however Lauries weary eyes opened and saw her.<br>\r\n\u201cMff! Mfffshh!\u201d Came her muffled cries for help, her eyes pleading with her former foe.<br>\r\n\u201cSo long bitch\u201d Said Donna with a sneer.<br>\r\nShe then left as Laurie continued to plead desperately while feebly fighting at her restraints. Donna moved as stealthily as her new chunky frame and skin tight baby doll outfit would allow, but it didn\u2019t help that with every sudden movement another seam on her dress popped open. She reached the front door, but unsurprisingly found it looked with no key to be found. Donna surmised that it was likely every window and door would also be locked, but she knew from experience that the backdoor had a much weaker lock than the rest. She knew this because she had been able to pick it when sneaking of over to Erics late at night, so she crept to the kitchen to try her luck. Using two  hair pins, Donna poked and twisted at the lock mechanism, her heart beating in her chest as she listened for any sounds that her evil Granny may have awoken.  After what felt like an age the lock clicked and Donna was able to open the door and finally escape the house. She couldn\u2019t believe that her ordeal was over, and she didn\u2019t even care who saw her in her rapidly disintegrating baby doll outfit, as she half ran and half waddled to the Foremans house next door for help. She opened the Foremans backdoor and found Kitty sat at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi... Donna?! Is that you?!\u201d Said Kitty in complete shock at her sons girlfriend.<br>\r\nThe once so slender and perfect gorgeous redhead of the past was gone, replaced by a much tubbier girl dressed in an ill fitting ridiculous outfit.<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Foreman! Please help me!\u201d Wailed Donna, choking on her words as she welled up.<br>\r\nThe poor girl began to sob, as the strong emotions of relief at having escaped and shell shock from her ordeal hit her at once.<br>\r\n\u201cDonna dear! What on earth is going on?!\u201d Asked Kitty, clearly still dumbfounded at the sight of Donna.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my Granny! She\u2019s gone crazy!\u201d Sobbed Donna \u201cShe forcefully imprisoned me over the past few days and did... This to me!\u201d<br>\r\nDonna grabbed at her own belly, jiggling the fat which had accumulated there to emphasise her point.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so fat and gross!\u201d She whimpered \u201cEric won\u2019t want me anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh you poor thing\u201d Said Kitty soothingly \u201cHere have a seat, I\u2019ll get you a drink and you can tell me all about it\u201d<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Donna drank it all in one go as Kitty sat across the table from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me all about it honey\u201d Said Kitty consolingly \u201cWhat did your mean old Granny do to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna wiped the tears from her eyes and relaxed as she recounted the entire story, finishing with Lauries capture and enslavement. She didn\u2019t notice but she had begun to slur her words towards the end, and her mind was becoming foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, she\u2019s got Laurie and Jackie to?\u201d Said Kitty, not sounding particularly concerned \u201cHow awful\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm.. Mishh Forman?\u201d Slurred Donna, blinking as her mind glazed over \u201cUmm.. I fink der wash shomethin in the... Erm... Milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes your quite right my dear\u201d Said Kitty \u201cI slipped you a little something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ok\u201d Replied Donna stupidly, her foggy thoughts preventing her from acting with the concern she should have felt \u201cBut... um... why dohh? \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, because I\u2019m in on it sweetie\u201d Said Kitty smiling happily \u201cMe and your parents in fact! We asked your dear old Granny to do this to you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was beginning to slump down to the table and had to use her arms to stop herself. She looked at Kitty with glazed yet inquisitive eyes but could only burble a Slurred mess of intangible speech at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we had to find a way to keep you away from Eric didn\u2019t we dear?\u201d Said Kitty \u201cYour a distraction for him and well,  it was about time somebody put an end to it! Of course Jackie and Laurie are an added bonus. Perhaps a life time of force feeding and servitude will keep you girls out of trouble!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnas thoughts were swirling in her head as she heard the door open and turned to see Granny standing there, looking far more menacing than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with you young lady\u201d Said Granny Pinciotti sternly \u201cI thought you\u2019d learnt how to behave properly... But it seems I\u2019ll have to teach you a lesson you won\u2019t soon forget!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, somebody\u2019s in trouble\u201d Said Kitty, with her trademark laugh \u201cBefore you go Ms. Pinciotti, could I... you know... have a go with Donna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course my dear\u201d Replied Granny, immediately knowing what she meant \u201cHere\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny held her Granddaughters head straight by her chin (which seemed a little fuller than it had been) and attached a funnel into her mouth with a leather strap around her head. Kitty clapped her hand together like an excited child before darting over to the fridge and opening to reveal several gallon bottles of chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do this!\u201d She gushed as she grabbed a bottle a brought it over to Donna \u201cLet\u2019s see if I can get her to finally bust out if that silly little outfit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared up at Kitty who beamed down at her, clearly not understanding what was happening until Kitty tilted the gallon of milk to the top of the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrr? Glugluglugluglugg!!\u201d Mumbled Donna, her eyes suddenly flying wide open as she was forced to drink the chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole bottle was poured down the funnel with no pause,  meaning poor Donna had no choice glug the whole thing down very quickly. Upon swallowing the last of it Donna let out a feeble burp up the funnel, and we small rip was heard from her garments as her girth grew and pushed it\u2019s limits. Despite the fact that the poor red headed beauty had had to drink a gallon of milk in a minute flat, Kitty seemed to be enjoying herself and wasn\u2019t nearly done. After a 2nd gallon of milk a 3rd soon followed, at which point Donna was nearly unconscious from the stuffing and substantial tips were visible beginning at her armpits and travelling all the way down past her bloated gut which spilled onto her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhrr hicc\u201d Came Donnas Mumbled voice through the funnel \u201cPlersss Mrs ferrman... Plersss sterrpgluglugluglugg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was enjoying herself far too much to pay attention to her sons girlfriends pathetic pleas, opting instead to dump jug number 4 down her throat. Donnas eyes lolled in her head as she felt her stomach bloat out yet further, adding more rips in the insanely tight fabric of her silly dress. When she\u2019d somehow finished the last of it her huge distended belly was tight as a drum and had completely torn the dress apart revealing her pale flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! Hahaha!\u201d Cheered Kitty, laughing her trademark laugh at succeeding in force feeding the poor girl until she burst from her clothes like an overstuffed sausage from its skin \u201cOh dear Ms. Pinciotti, I think Donnas outgrown her outfit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear Donnakins\u201d Crooned Granny \u201cSuch a greedy baby you are, let\u2019s get you home... Your little playmates will be missing you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a wheelbarrow from outside and with Granny\u2019s help Donna was eased into it as she was clearly far too stuffed (and drugged) to walk by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long snookums\u201d Crooned Kitty, squeezing her cheek \u201cI can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s time for Eric to see you! Just imagine what he\u2019ll say! Hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlurrp\u201d Was the only response Donna could give, as her large pale pot belly gurgled miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Donna was wheeled back home somewhere in her foggy mind she imagined seeing her beloved again after weeks of this treatment. She imagined herself as a completely immobile blob of fat dressed as a baby, and imagined Erics face upon seeing her. A lone tear rolled down her cheek as she imagined Eric laughing at her before breaking her heart. <br>\r\n......<br>\r\nBack inside the Pinciotti household, Laurie and Jackie were just as she\u2019d left them; bound to chairs and being pumped full of fattening baby food. Despite Laurie clearly being uncomfortably stuffed to the brim and lethargic she still managed a cruel sneer and smirk at the sight of Donna being wheeled in. The gorgeous redhead looked completely defeated as she lay groaning in the wheelbarrow, the remains of her silly outfit barely covering her at all. Granny wheeled her over to a pile of plush, comfortable pillows and dumped her out onto them. This had the added benefit of completely bursting whatever seams were left connecting her outfit to her, leaving her to lie panting in her bra, stockings and diaper. Seeing that Donna was far too exhausted to move, Granny turned her attention to the other two teenage babies who were still being fed the fattening mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay girls\u201d Said Granny brightly \u201cAs you\u2019ve both been good as gold, unlike Donna here, I\u2019ve decided one of you will be getting a nice treat! Whoever has packed on the most weight today will win Donnakins for the rest of the day! You can do whatever you wish with her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Laurie perked up at this offer, as she thought that a day of humiliating and degrading her brothers pretty girlfriend would at least take her mind off her own miserable predicament for awhile. Jackie of course was hoping she\u2019d be chosen, as her loins tingled at the thought of all the sordid fun she could have with her former friend... Though being bound and fed all day was also a good way to go.<br>\r\nWho is chosen? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

God damn it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk tsk\u201d Said Granny wagging her finger \u201cLanguage dear... it is unbecoming of a young lady\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta be God damn kiddin me!\u201d Growled Laurie as she stepped down from the scale \u201cYou crazy old bit-murrrfhh!\u201d<br>\r\nLauries venomous words were cut off by the business end of a large babies bottle, which Granny tilted forcing her to glug down its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Jackie dear, its your turn\u201d said Granny as Laurie was forced to gulp down the fattening mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked quite anxious as she daintily approached the scale, as she wanted to gain as much weight as possible. She felt a flutter of dark pleasure when she saw the number on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c140\u201d She said \u201cOh my...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny smiled at the expression on Jackies face, clearly turned on by her own weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done dear, Donna is all yours!\u201d Said Granny jovially, before adding \u201cDo you need a moment deary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhnnn... Yes... Thank you Granny...\u201d Said Jackie as she bit her lip and her cheeks pickened \u201cI just... Ooo... Ahem... Cant help myself...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know dear I know\u201d Said Granny, more understandably than was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny watched on happily as the depraved teenage baby snaked her hand into her diaper and began playing with herself. Laurie rolled her eyes in disgust as the sight as she continued to suckle on her bottle and Jackie strummed her way to another giddy orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew...\u201d Said Jackie after her shrill climax \u201cThis diaper pays for itself\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm glad your getting used to your pretty little outfit\u201d Said Granny sounding appeased \u201cNow... Have fun with my Granddaughter\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie grinned sadistically as she turned to Donna, who had regained her composure just enough to look back at her former friend fearfully. Jackie seductively walked over to her new playmate and lay down on the plushy pillows next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Donnakins\u201d She said darkly, and Donna gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile those two get acquainted I think its time to learn you some manners young lady!\u201d Said Granny just as Laurie had gulped down the last of the bottles calorific contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiccurrpp!!\u201d Exclaimed Laurie miserably once the teat of the bottle was removed from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDisgusting manners!\u201d Said Granny, in a rather scary tone \u201cCome with me you fat pig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie gave a comical yelp as Granny grabbed her roughly by the ear, like a naughty child being reprimanded, and led her back to her high chair which she was shoved back into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to give that potty mouth of yours a workout my dear\u201d Said Granny, fully the disciplinarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo no wai-murrrfff!\u201d Stammered Laurie but was cut off by a huge spoonful of fattening baby food being shoved into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Laurie endured her most intense feeding thus far, Jackie was lying down next to her new chubby playmate Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Laurie watched on from her own miserable vantage point, she too being fed ruthlessly, as she watched the naked red head feed her gorgeous playmate. She rolled her weary eyes when she saw Donna put her hand into Jackie's diaper, who in turn began to squeal and moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn mrrrfff!! Munch munch! Ullp!! Freaks...\" She somehow managed to say, which only caused Granny to feed her twice as hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the ever growing red head found herself lost in the situation, continuing to tease and feed her beautiful playmate. She didn't know why but she found a lot of enjoyment tormenting her playmate. It was probably the feeling of power she felt, after being completely dominated since being held captive by her Granny it was a refreshing feeling, but there was also a sexual side to it that she was finding hard to ignore. This only got more intense as she explored her former friends body, feeling for extra softness which excited her more than she wanted to admit to herself. Jackie gasps and squeals of sexual delight grew in volume and pitch as the chunky naked red head lead her to an ear splitting climax. Jackie was in complete heaven, despite having orgasmed a few times already that day, she found herself insatiable and didn't want Donna to stop teasing her. She could feel the seams of her ever tightening, silly outfit creaking against her bloated dome like belly, and despite how uncomfortably full she was she eagerly swallowed whatever she was fed. The pairs kinky sexual explorations continued throughout the afternoon, only becoming more intense and sordid as they went. Laurie awoke after passing out numerous times, seemingly each time treated to an orgasm from one or both of them, just as her own feeding began anew. She looked away from the fornicating freaks in disgust, only to see something that disgusted her more... the dome of flesh that had replaced her once perfectly flat tummy. She could see that after her last feeding a few seams had popped on her stupid outfit alongside it, and she dreaded to think how much weight she'd been forced to gain already. By the 3rd time she once again  woke to the sound of a shrill, shared orgasmed from the 2 ever growing playmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. hiccblerrrpp!! Ughh... will you two give it rest for fuck sake\" Said Laurie, managing a scathing tone despite her exhaustion and groaning belly \"You've been screwing each other for God damn hoursmurrrfff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk, such bad language\" Said Granny, on hand for the fiery blondes next feeding \"You do appear to be enjoying your self though my sweet Donnakins... are you beginning to learn your place at long last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the days following her father's heart attack, Laurie had found herself doing some serious soul-searching. The very idea would've made her brother's friends laugh - since when did she have a soul to search? It surprised her sometimes, too, but given the circumstances, it was no surprise. She was scared. She'd basically given her dad a heart attack. Because she married Fez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez had been about to be deported because his visa would expire once he graduated high school and the exchange program ended. She hadn't really taken an interest in the situation until the camping trip and they had sex in the van. It hadn't been bad. Better than a lot of the losers she'd done it with, but not talented either. He'd confided in her that he'd only lost his virginity only a month ago to a coworker at the DMV, so he had inexperience as an excuse, but it hadn't really been all that interesting. Still, they'd wound up talking through the night, and so she offered the idea of a quickie marriage in town. He'd been dubious at first, but then they had sex a second time, and it seemed more appealing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd genuinely been trying to help him. And the shock gave Red a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, an entire week had gone by, and she was still miserable. She had stayed at home in her old room. Thankfully, Fez had given her space. For being an absolute perv, he was still a decent guy. She hid herself from the others for most of that time, only coming down for dinner. Red was doing well. He just had to stay for observation. If anyone was angry at her, it faded very quickly. Eric had a few snide comments about how she'd almost killed their dad, but she didn't have the energy to respond to them, so he must've figured she was feeling guilty and let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely ate during that week, so one night, when everyone had gone to sleep, she scrounged together whatever money she had hidden around the house - and some Eric had hidden around the house - and went out. She was starving, but she wasn't really up for leftovers. She strolled around Point Place - which was pretty lowkey as far as crime was concerned - and approached the nearest Fatso Burger. It was still an hour before they closed, so she went in and ordered a double bacon cheeseburger with fries and a large milkshake. She flashed her bra at the cashier, ensuring her usual discount, and took everything to an outside table and ate away, enjoying the summer air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, she thought about what was happening around her. Eric and Donna were going away to college soon, Hyde and Kelso were still fighting over Jackie, and she was married to Fez. Good god, she was pathetic. The thought just made her cram more food into her mouth. The grease tasted so good right now. The minutes passed, and soon, she had finished everything. She took a few last sips of milkshake, getting as much as she could. She needed to get as much as she could so as to fill the gaping hole in her soul right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her trash away and returning the tray, she still felt empty and depressed, so she went to a twenty-four-hour grocery store with the money she had left and got a pint of cookie dough ice cream. Another slip of the bra ensured she got it half off, and she made her way home, getting a spoon out of the drawer and taking it back to her room. She sighed tiredly as she practically inhaled the thing before lying down to get some sleep. She patted her stomach, appreciative of the fullness settling inside it.</span></div></div>",

She stopped a bit short in the doorway at the massive piles of breakfast food that lined the table and counter. And there was still more going on, with Kitty frying bacon and scrambling more eggs, with a stack of pancakes piling up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty turned and saw her. \"Oh, Laurie, good. Just in time for breakfast! I'm just finishing up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stared at the frenzy. She looked past her mother and saw Hyde, Kelso, Jackie and Fez were working on their own sections of breakfast. She had to admit it all looked rather good. Wordlessly, she got a plate and allowed Kitty to pile it all on. Five pancakes, a pile of scrambled eggs, a handful of bacon and a cinnamon roll for luck. She got a glass of orange juice and joined the others at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been cooking nonstop for the last hour,\" Hyde filled her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No complaints here,\" Fez chirped. \"Your mother cooks edible heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie had to agree. The food was delicious. With her still feeling down about everything, food was a great comfort right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kitty finished cooking, she announced she was going on ahead to the hospital to check on Red. \"Steven, tell Eric when you see him that he'll need to take the Vista Cruiser down and pick him up while I'm still working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Hyde replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left, Laurie finished her eggs and started in on the pancakes. Kelso got up and went to the fridge, getting out some raw eggs. She rolled her eyes at the sight of him. He was wearing a jogging suit with a sweatband. He was going to impress Jackie by drinking eggs raw like in one of those dumb \"Rocky\" movies. She couldn't help but laugh when he downed them in one gulp, only to be reminded by Jackie that he was allergic to eggs. He would have to go to the hospital now. When Eric came over, he agreed to take him along with Hyde, leaving her alone with Fez and Jackie and the remainder of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" she said with a tiny smirk. \"You're seriously trying to choose between those clowns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie scowled. \"I'll have you know I've already decided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me it's not egg boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's Steven. I don't know what it is about him, but... I don't know...\" She turned away, a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged and started in on the bacon. \"Well, good luck. Whichever loser you end up with is a lucky guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked surprised, but smiled all the same. \"You know, for a lying skank who stole Michael away from me, you're okay.\" She put her plate int he sink and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was just with Fez. He sat down next to her. \"Can I get anything for you, my darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"Fez, come on. Just because we're married doesn't mean you have to do stuff for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have saved me! You helped me to stay in the country! I would do anything for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked at her empty plate. How'd she eaten all of that so fast. \"... Can you get me some more pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear.\" Fez eagerly grabbed her plate and put the remaining pancakes on it, which was twice as many as she'd had before. She looked at the stack worriedly, but she took one look at Fez's cheerful face and felt another surge of guilt. This guy was so grateful for the pathetic shotgun wedding it made her feel bad for everything again. She felt the emptiness again and proceeded to scarf them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what shall we do with our day, my wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie groaned internally. \"Fez, look, my dad's coming home from the hospital...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father-in-law. I cannot wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez, he's still pissed off at you for marrying me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? He should be grateful. We all know your reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't help. Laurie felt another wave of emptiness in her soul, and assumed it was her stomach. She ate another pancake. \"Whatever. You need to be away from here. Otherwise he might kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez now looked afraid. \"Do you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez, he was in the war. He know how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped and made to stand, \"Are you sure you'll be fine here by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate another pancake. \"I think I'll survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I shall go on the lamb. Call me when it's safe to come back.\" He leaned over and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek and left through the sliding door before she could properly react. She was momentarily stunned by the kiss, but any warmth she got from it once again turned into shame. This poor guy was all set to make this a proper marriage, and she was... well, she was Laurie Forman. The ultimate skank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unbuttoned her jeans and gorged herself. She had to distract herself from the guilt. She finished the pancakes, then went up to the counter and ate all the remaining bacon and eggs, then a few cinnamon rolls, and then gulped down from pitcher of orange juice until she just couldn't anymore. She sat down on one of the stools at the counter leaned back, feeling the lump that was her stomach under her tank top, which was now feeling a little tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhh....,\" she groaned. \"That was... tooooo much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that was enough for one day, she heaved herself down and made it back to her room. She laid down and pulled the blanket back over her head, listening to her stomach gurgle.</span></div></div>",

Swallowing down her worry, she got up and straightened herself up. Hopefully, she wasn't going to give him another heart attack on the spot just from wrinkled clothes. Taking a deep breath, she went downstairs and into the living room just as her family entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed froze when he saw her. She gave him a weak smile and waved nervously. \"Hi, Daddy...,\" she ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her for a long moment before smiling that fatherly smile and holding his arms out to her. \"Come on down, kitten. Everything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, she came downstairs and hugged him. \"Oh, I'm so glad you're okay. I'm so sorry about... you know, almost killing you and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not your fault, kitten. It's that damn foreigner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked up at him. \"... What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait until I get my hands on him. I can't believe he would take advantage of you like that. The way he just came in here and tricked you, the sneaky little -- .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, hold on, time out,\" Laurie said, quickly disentangling herself from him. \"That's not what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed's brow furrowed in confusion. \"Well, how else could it happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie noticed Eric roll his eyes disparagingly but ignored him for now. \"It was my idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Your idea? It was your idea to marry that filthy little -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Knock it off! That's my green card husband you're talking about! Look, during the camping trip, we got to talking, we... had some fun together...\" Again, ignoring the expression on Eric's face, which was nausea this time. \"... and the more he talked about it, the more I felt bad for him, and I had nothing else to do, so I thought - hey, this'll be my good deed for the next ten years.\" She finished with a lame shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed looked like he was going to burst a blood vessel. \"How could you do something so stupid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry it almost killed you! But Fez needed help, and Donna and Jackie weren't about to do it, and I felt sorry for him! It was out of pity, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still looked pissed, so Kitty came over to try to calm him down. \"Okay, Red, let's take it easy. We just need to get you upstairs and lie you down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can she just waltz in here and act like this is okay?\" Red demanded. \"How the hell am I supposed to be okay being married to that dirty little - !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, come on,\" Eric interrupted. \"Look, yes, Laurie and Fez being married is weird and sudden, and okay, so it almost killed you, but you know what? She could definitely do a lot worse. It could've been Kelso. Besides, it's not like they're going to <i>stay </i>married. They just need to clear it with the government so Fez can get his new visa and they'll get divorced. Right, Laurie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded quickly, for once relieved her little brother had been conceived. \"Exactly! It's temporary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed looked between them for a few moments before deciding to calm down. \"Okay... Fine... I'll let it go. But you'd better keep him out of this house, understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blinked. \"Er... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Red,\" Kitty said, aiming him for the stairs. \"Let's get you to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed grumbled a little more as he allowed himself to be guided. \"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscussions then turned to how Kitty was going to have to work extra hours at the hospital until Red was either well enough to go back to work or find another job. She tried to get Eric to do a few chores, but he reminded her he was moving out soon to Madison with Donna. This prompted a brief argument between them about Eric supposedly abandoning the family, but Red took his turn to be the sane one and faked another heart attack to distract them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their parents were upstairs, Laurie made to go past Eric to head to the kitchen, but he caught her arm. \"Hey, thanks for clearing things up with Fez. I know you don't actually like him, but... well, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked. \"Oh, don't worry about it. Last thing I need right now is for dad to make me a widow at age twenty-four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled gratefully before leaving. It was so rare they had friendly moments like that, they decided to just leave it at that. Relieved the confrontation was over, Laurie headed into the kitchen. She was hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the fridge, she found more of Kitty's meals that had been cooked during her stressful period, so she proceeded to unload a pan of meatloaf and poured some mustard on it. Deciding not to bother with cutting off a piece, she stuck a fork in and just ate off of it. There was just something so satisfying about sitting back and enjoying some food. It was something she had denied herself for so long. She enjoyed herself, just eating away at the chunk of meat for a good thirty minutes until it was finally gone. Stifling a burp, she put the dish in the sink and headed for her room. She patted her stomach, enjoying the fullness she so rarely allowed herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanging out around the house basically comprised of her being bored and watching TV in the living room. With Red not allowed to do anything strenuous, Kitty was constantly rushing around doing chores. There were meals to cook, dishes to wash, laundry to do, and even a lawn to mow. So while Laurie vegetated on the couch for a couple of days, her mother was going round and round in a frenzied state, usually with a laundry basket in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little depressing to watch, so Laurie tried moving to other locations in the house, but she couldn't quite find a place where her mother didn't do any work. She was constantly cleaning as well, so the bedrooms were out. The kitchen was a constant source of cooking, so that didn't help. Even the basement wasn't safe, as it was home to the washer and dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's where she found her mother passed out one night, asleep amongst a pile of dirty clothes and an overturned hamper. She gently reached over and tapped her mom's foot, waking her up. \"Fabric softener!\" she yelped as she jolted awake, sending socks everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Laurie, sorry. Must've dropped off.\" She checked her watch. \"Oh, god, I'm late for work. Night's can be our busiest time. Lots of people stroke out after a big salty dinner.\" She got up and started to dust herself off. \"Laurie, sweetie, I know you don't like to work or even, you know, be remotely helpful but... could you please...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, fine. I'll do the laundry. Get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you!\" she said, briefly kissing her on the cheek and running up the stairs. \"There's food in the... Oh, who am I kidding. There's no food.\" And she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie sighed and got to work on the laundry. She separated everything by color and fabric before starting the washer and putting in the detergent and baking soda and pouring everything in. Satisfied that everything was in motion, she plopped down on the couch, grabbing a discarded bag of chips that really hit the spot right about now. She enjoyed a round of \"I Love Lucy\" before the door opened and Eric and Donna came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what're you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie gestured at the washing machine. \"Waiting for the laundry to finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Where's mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At work. Night shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's working again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with dad cooped up in the house, she's pulling extra hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked really conflicted in that moment. \"She shouldn't have to do that. She's got enough work around here as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something I don't know. She's been cleaning, cooking... By the way, there's no food, so we should probably order take out. Pizza or Chinese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rubbed his face tiredly. \"I can't believe this... Our own mother is slaving away like this, and I'm about to go away to college and abandon them like this. I can't just leave them with no extra help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked affronted. \"Uh, hello? Totally spending time doing laundry over here!\" she reminded him, pointing at the busy washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great, so you do one load of laundry, and everyone's supposed to be impressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do <i>all </i>the laundry! I kind of have to if I want my good jeans ready by tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you're going to do all the laundry while your mom does everything else?\" Donna asked. \"Do you even know how a vacuum works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how to do dishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how to do work?\" Eric added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up to glare at him more effectively. \"I know how to do all those things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you do all those things? Do all the housework so Mom isn't constantly rushing around all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie realized she'd gotten trapped. She'd built herself up, and now she wasn't sure how to get out of it. \"Well... I... could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, I guess...,\" she pouted, thudding back down on the couch again in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna patted her patronizingly on the shoulder. \"Well, it's either this or get an actual job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie groaned. \"Oh, just go to college,\" she grumbled. \"Anything to get rid of you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled and patted her on the head. \"Thanks, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's either college or hell. Make up your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna swatted him on the arm and they went upstairs. \"We'll order a pizza,\" she assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie waved them off and waited for the laundry to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the shower curtain slid open and Fez stepped out, much to her surprise. \"How long were you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a face. \"Were you waiting on Eric and Donna to start making out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez nodded guiltily. \"Yeah, well... I was going to leave, but then I started watching Lucy with you and I got transfixed. She is a black-and-white comedy goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie couldn't help but smirk. \"Yeah, she's pretty cool.\" She heard a ding come from the far wall and realized the laundry was done. She sighed in annoyance before getting up and opening it up to switch the load over to the dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez watched her from the arm of the couch. \"I think it's really nice of you to help Miss Kitty. That poor woman needs a break. When I came down here, I heard her muttering about an evil washing machine trying to devour her while she slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged, quietly pleased that <i>someone </i>was noting her hard work. \"Yeah, well... Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. If I want clean clothes, I'm going to have to do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so selfless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" She was so glad someone saw things from her point of view. \"Anyway, they're ordering pizza up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I heard. Don't worry. I have M&amp;M's to tide us over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished loading the dryer, feeling the first signs of perspiration on her forehead. \"Oh that sounds like heaven right now. I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out the bag. \"My candy is your candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez shrugged. \"We are married, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but smile at the sentiment. Okay, so she could've chosen worse guys to get hitched to. Free candy was always a plus. She sat down with him on the sofa and took his offering of multi-colored candies, and that's where they stayed until a thirty minutes later when the pizza came.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the days wore on, things around the house began to quiet down a little. Laurie accepted the fact that she was going to have to help out around the house a lot more, especially with Eric going away to college. Although Hyde wasn't really chipping in much housework, he was willing to sign over his paycheck from working at the restaurant every other week to help pay the bills, and Fez felt he ought to repay the Formans for not killing him by helping out where and when he could, like mowing the lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of chores insured that Kitty had more time for other things, including cooking Red his \"heart friendly\" dinner. There had been a minor dispute over Red's diet, so Kitty had decided to go on it with him. Potato chips, heavy creams, cheese, salty foods were all out. Of course, she didn't handle the lack of alcohol very well. Still, no one was complaining. The kids were more than happy to take care of the unhealthy foods. And seeing as how she was working around the house all the time, Laurie found herself snacking more than any of them. At one point, she found herself absently sipping away at a small carton of whipping cream. She was momentarily disgusted before realizing it was actually pretty good and finishing the rest of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne little detail was troubling her, however. Kitty only made dinner for Red during the day before putting it in the oven for reheating later. The kids were left to fend for themselves. Laurie, however, was a terrible cook. She tried a couple of times to make dinner, but it never went over well. So, whatever grocery money she had went towards eating out. She typically went alone, while the others would hang out together. She still hadn't quite gotten on good terms with everyone yet. Besides, they were all wrapped up in the drama of Eric and Donna moving to Madison in a week. Plus, Kelso was trying to help Jackie and Hyde get back together, and Fez was sort of cheerleading that effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Fez would go out with her a couple of times, insisting it was what husbands and wives do, and he felt it would be good to keep up appearances around town. Laurie had to admit it wasn't so bad. They'd go to the pizza place or Fatso Burger or the Hub and enjoy hanging out. He actually wasn't bad company. He was always ready with a compliment about how hot he found her, and sure, he was a perv, but something about how upfront about it he was spoke to her constant horniness. She wasn't sure whether or not it was because he was appealing or if she was just having a dry spell, but either way, she felt closer to him. Still, she wasn't ready to go all out and give an actual relationship a shot. Something didn't feel right about that. At least right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, she was enjoying a nice round of cheesy french fries with a double bacon cheeseburger and a chocolate shake on her own. She had to admit, it really hit the spot. After all her chores and dealing with crap around the house, she was enjoying some \"me time\". She enjoyed her corner booth and ate to her heart's content. She hadn't enjoyed such greasy bliss in years. All that pressure to stay hot for horny guys had gotten to her, and now she was ready for some real food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the effects were beginning to catch up with her. She felt her favorite jeans getting tighter, and she couldn't deny it could just be her lousy laundry skills making them shrink. There was something wrong here. She dared a peek down at her midsection and noticed how different it looked. Gone was the toned washboard stomach that guys drank liquor off of in college. Now her stomach was a wall of flab. It peeked out over the waistband of her pants. It jiggled when she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the meal and ducked into the empty ladies room to lift her shirt up. It was a gut, all right. She was growing a gut. A solid week of junk food was taking its toll on her. She could only sigh pathetically. \"This is what married life does to a woman,\" she said sadly, not sure what to do. She slapped it disparagingly, and that dislodged a great big bubble of gas that translated into a belch that echoed around the room. She went beet red, and then she realized she was hungry again. Feeling sad about the whole situation, she decided to cheer herself up with a second milkshake. She ordered it and made her way home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The final week went by, and soon, it was time for Eric and Donna to make tracks for college. Their final day coincided with Eric's 18th birthday, and the day started with a hungover Eric found on the kitchen table wearing a dress. Once that had been cleared off, Laurie looked around the kitchen and couldn't help but notice one curious thing that was rather strange in the Forman household. Today was a birthday, and there was no sign of anything party-related. Normally, when one of them had a birthday, they could expect Kitty to throw some overly-extravagant shindig. There was nothing. Not even a cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her recent fluctuation in weight, she probably should've been more appreciative of this, but she couldn't help but be a bit disappointed by the lake of baked goods. She saw her mom making a regular breakfast and chatting with Red. \"Sooooo...,\" she drawled as she strolled over. \"What're we doing for little brother's eighteenth birthday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked up in surprise. \"Oh my god, I didn't make his birthday breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You never forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, between work and resuming intercourse with your father, I just didn't think -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie immediately put her fingers in her ears. \"Ohmygawd, why?\" she moaned. \"Nobody wants to hear about either of you... doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Red said distastefully. \"Kitty, I just had a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the doctor gave us the go ahead. It's safe now. Tonight's my only night off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, imagine having to schedule sex,\" Laurie sighed. Then she noticed the peculiar looks her parents were sending her, so she quickly changed the subject. \"So, anyway, Eric's birthday...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty nodded and quickly pulled out a fifty dollar bill. \"Here. Take this to the supermarket later today. Pick up a cake and have them right 'Happy Birthday, Eric' on it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged. \"Sure.\" She was pretty sure a cake didn't cost all of fifty bucks, so she'd find something to do with the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Donna spent most of their time with the gang in the basement, celebrating his birthday and the fact that they were going away to college, filled with goodbyes and reminiscences, so she took it as a chance to sneak away and get the cake before Eric realized that Kitty had forgotten his birthday. She went to the nearest Piggly Wiggly and went to the bakery. Finding a decent vanilla cake that was big enough for the whole gang, she put in the request and gave them Eric's name. While she was there, she also picked up a carton of ice cream with chocolate syrup. Hopefully, everyone would approve of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took everything through the checkout lane, and as per usual, unbuttoned her top a little to flash some cleavage to the horny teenage boy at the register, ensuring her his employee discount, enabling her to grab a couple of Snickers bars from the candy stand. She took everything to the car, drove home and sighed with relief to have it all over with. Checking the coast was clear, she grabbed everything and headed into the kitchen where Kitty was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, you got a big one,\" she said. \"The kids will love that! Oh, and ice cream too! Good thinking! Where's my change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes and passed the remaining money that technically should've been more, but whatever, a few extra treats for herself weren't that big of a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty promptly got out a couple of candles in the shapes of a 1 and an 8 and got some matches out - which was pointless because all the kids had their own lighters - and motioned for Laurie to get the door to the basement so she could go down and surprise everyone. She listened to the cheers of delight at having cake from downstairs and couldn't help but be a bit envious. Those losers were going to eat cake without leaving any for her. She noticed the ice cream and contemplated taking that just for herself when Kitty came bounding back upstairs and snatched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, help me out and bring down some plates, forks, spoons... Maybe the ice cream scooper as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched her frenzied mother disappear back into the basement. Rolling her eyes, she grabbed six plates, six forks and the ice cream scooper in her hands and made her way down into the basement where Kitty was already lighting the candles. She sang the 'Happy Birthday' song by herself as the others agreed it was a dumb song, and Eric blew out the candles, prompting his mother to clap happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here comes Laurie with plates and ice cream. Please use the utensils. I'll leave you kids to it.\" And with that, she hurried back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, kids,\" Laurie deadpanned, setting everything down next to the cake. \"Have at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks, sis,\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave, but Fez grabbed her hand. \"Come on, my wife - stay and have cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked startled, and she could see the apprehension in everyone else's eyes. \"I don't know think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. It's cake! The love of cake crosses all social chasms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a point,\" Kelso said, already cutting himself a corner piece. \"If all nations had access to cake, I bet there'd be no war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure there would, man,\" Hyde retorted, scooping himself some ice cream. \"There'd be an international incident over whether chocolate or vanilla frosting is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is a dumb argument anyway,\" Donna said as she proceeded to cut herself a slice. \"Seeing as the best frosting ever is butterscotch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric made a face. \"Butterscotch? Why do I want to live with you again?\" he asked playfully. She responded by kissing him, and when she pulled back, \"Oh, now I remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the mood turning cheery again, Fez went to cut two slices - one for him and one for Laurie - and he joined her on the deep freeze in the corner. \"Here you are, my lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie couldn't help but smile a bit. \"Thanks,\" she said, taking a fork and taking a bite. She'd chosen well. This cake was bitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscussions continued from cake to music to Star Wars to conspiracy theories to feminism to whatever Kelso had glued himself to recently. The hours wore on, and after a while, the cake was pretty much forgotten about as everyone began to grow sad about Eric and Donna leaving. All their stuff was packed in the Vista Cruiser, waiting to be transported to their new home in Madison. Everyone was getting a bit tipsy, save for the couple themselves as they were driving, so they indulged in one last Circle together. Even Laurie got to sit in and have a few smokes before it was inevitably time for them to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went up to the car, knowing that this was it. Laurie decided to say her goodbyes first so they could all have their own later. She knew Eric was closer to them than to her, so she felt it was only right to get out of their way. She patted them both on the shoulder and smiled, somewhat tipsy. \"Well, little brother. Good luck... And don't make the same mistakes I made in college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like flunking out?\" Eric quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't do that. Not good. Trust me.\" She indulged in hugging him for a moment, and after he got over the surprise, he hugged back. \"See you at Thanksgiving,\" she muttered before turning and walking back towards the basement. Before she opened the door, she looked back at the group of friends as they hugged and got emotional, and then saw Red and Kitty walk outside and join in the goodbyes. Sighing wistfully, she stumbled down to the basement again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remnants of the party were all there. The cake was half finished, as was the ice cream. And then Laurie got the biggest case of the munchies ever. It all looked so good, and she was starving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly gathered up a fork, the cake and the ice cream and smuggled it all up the stairs until she was safely in her room. With a crazed look in her eye, Laurie began to chow down. Half a large birthday cake and half a tub of half-melted ice cream - it was no mean feat. She felt so ravenous - that damn circle! But she didn't care right now. She just started shoveling everything down. Gorging and slurping and enjoying every last bite - she barely stopped to taste any of it. She just had to inhale all of it. Her stomach stretched and seemed to balloon right in front of her, and by the time she was done, she must've looked almost three months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hiccup, she gathered the empty containers together before noticing her jeans were straining. Knowing what to do, she changed into some flannel pajamas and headed outside. Goodbyes were just wrapping up as she put the trash on the counter to be taken away later. She saw everyone waving goodbye to Eric and Donna as the Vista Cruiser pulled out. Relieved for the distraction, she waddled awkwardly back to her bedroom and laid back in bed. She patted her stomach, which seemed to be finally satisfied. With another hiccup, she took a deep breath and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

After fez left Laurie went to the kitchen, it looked like kitty had been stress cooking a gain probably because today was reds check up to see if he could go back to work. The table was stacked with tons of bakon and eggs as well as three tall  stacks of pancakes smothered in butter. Laurie stomach growled loudly, she then heard her mom shout \"we are going to the doctors  we will be back soon\" after that Laurie just dived into all the food and with an hour of pure stuffing she finished every thing and led on the the couch stuffed beyond belief, she then walked up stairs and had a nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours Laurie woke up very bloated and went down stairs. She then saw her mom and dad \" oh Laurie your farther can go back to work now so I don't have to work double shifts\" said kitty \" yes\" Laurie shouted \" i don't have to do choirs anymore \" wait i didn't say tha...\" kitty was cut of \" thanks mom now I'm going out and I borrowed some money so see you later\" Laurie said quickly so her mom couldn't make her do work. She heads out the door and went out to a party try and get with someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile at the party she still hadn't managed to get with anyone \" I don't get it, it's normally easy for me to get with someone what's happening?\" Laurie complained to one of her friends \" well Laurie you are looking a little chubby have you put on weight\" her friend said kind of happy because she had always been jealous of Laurie's looked. \"What\" Laurie screamed offended. After an argument with a friend Laurie soon left the party to go home. As she was driving home she drove past fatso burger \"well I am kind of hungry\" she thought as she pulled in. When she walked to the counter to order she noticed a for hire sign \" ha who would ever want to work here\" she said smugly as she began to order \" ill have two double bacon and cheese super burgers extra large both with extra large order of fries and and 2 chocolate milkshakes large\" she said to the Man and after a couple of minutes he gave her her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie sat down in her booth and began eating her food however half way through she started to think about what her friend said \"I'm not chubby\" she thought if any one is chubby she is \" but when she started thinking this she got stressed and angry and after finishing she got up and thought \" I'm not chubby I can eat what I want and not gain a single pound she is the fat one\" after that instead of going home she went to the counter and ordered double her previous order. Laurie never got stressed about anything or upset unless it was about her looks and body and right now she was definitely stressed. Once her food arrived she sat down and began to eat. Laurie was starting to stress eat. </span></div></div>",

Since she no longer had to do choirs and she had fallen out with her friends she spent the whole two weeks lounging around and eating either her moms food, junk food or takeout fatso burger. She now had a round chubby belly, a big wobble bum and and a definite double chin. She was not fat but definitely pudgy about 174lbs and by her lifestyle she didn't look like she was stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie me and your farther think you are getting lazy so you need to get a job\" kitty says \"a job your joking I'm not getting a job\" Laurie answer back. \"Well we already got you one at fatso burger they were highering and seen as though you like there food so much we figured it would be perfect plus it's the only job your qualified for so\" kitty says \"ha I'm not working at that fat house not a chance\" Laurie says arrogantly \"<br>\r\nWell you either work there or sleep on the street\" red screams scaring Laurie to death \"but daddy\" Laurie whines \"don't but Dady me you are 24 so you are getting a job\" he stresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi welcome to fatso burger you must be our new employee.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, everyone was getting into a new routine. Red had been hoping that, with Eric moved out at long last, that everyone would finally stop hanging out at his house. No such luck. Since Hyde still lived in the basement, he became the one that everyone came to visit. Jackie, of course, because they were dating, but Kelso and Fez kept coming over as well, much to Red's annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't mind, though. In fact, she found it greatly fulfilling that her house had become the \"hang out\" house on the block. It helped keep her mind off Eric. That, combined with her extra shifts at the hospital, helped keep her relatively sane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, meanwhile, was sticking to her end of the bargain. For better or for worse, she was doing as many chores around the house as she could. Hyde helped occasionally, too, like mowing the lawn, but most of the time, he just hung out in the basement with his loser friends. She was stuck with dishes, laundry, cleaning and cooking. Just further proof that there was no god. Someone as hot as her shouldn't have to put up with this crap. She wished Red would hire a maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, cooking wasn't the worst thing in the world. Kitty gave her a weekly allowance for grocery shopping, and she gave her a list of all the things Red wasn't allowed to eat while he was recovering from his heart attack. However, her mother was so frazzled from working so much that she rarely, if ever, asked for change. Laurie was quick to take advantage of this. At first, she just used it to buy beer, but lately, she found herself gravitating towards snacks as well. Mostly of the sugary or salty variety - chips, crackers, soda, doughnuts, ding-dongs, twinkies, and various other processed confectioneries worked their way into her daily diet. She hid boxes of them in her room so her dad wouldn't be tempted, and she'd snack on them between chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days wore on, she ended up just wearing sweats or pajama pants all day. She rarely had time to go out and get her usual fill of sex, so she didn't try as hard to look sexy every day. Her hair was a bit frizzier, her clothes were baggy, and she only put on the minimum amount of makeup. She wasn't an animal, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it didn't help when Jackie came over all perky and peppy to see the gang, and she would wear the latest fashion and how good it looked on her. Laurie tended to make herself scarce on those occasions. She felt like she wasn't the prettiest girl in the room anymore whenever she was around. God, why couldn't the guys make friends with some fat girls? That'd really cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glanced at herself in the mirror one morning. She had a definitely potbelly in development. Probably from all the pot. Munchies were a common factor. Too many times, she'd woken up to find she'd finished off her snacks in the night during a circle-induced feeding frenzy. She usually had enough cash to get more, but it was still a pain in the ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, she'd finally finished all the chores required of her. Red was in the garage during some repair work and Kitty was at work, so she had the night to herself. She slumped back on the couch and watched some old \"I Love Lucy\" reruns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door from the kitchen swung open, and in walked Fez, looking a bit frazzled. Laurie was tempted to not give him the time of day, but the look of shock on his face was hard to ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I even want to know?\" she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pregnant...,\" Fez said in a flat voice, still looking very distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie scoffed. \"I highly doubt you have the power to perform that deed,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez came out of his trance thanks to the burn and glared at her. \"No, not me. Kelso! He got Brooke pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... That'd be more shocking if I had half a clue who Brooke was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was valedictorian at our high school a couple years ago. They had sex in a restroom. Badda-boom-badda-bing. Pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shook her head. \"Sounds like an amateur to me. An old pro like me knows how to avoid the ol' 'knock-knock-knock' on the uterus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez let a pervy grin slide across his face. \"I bet you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes, but a small smirk played across her lips as he clearly thought he was being sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her annoyance, he decided to sit down on the couch next to her and put his feet on the coffee table she'd cleaned earlier. \"I tell ya... Eric and Donna are off at college, Jackie and Hyde are back together, Kelso knocked a girl up, and you and I are married. We've all grown up so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're married so you can stay in the country. As soon as you get citizenship, we're divorced. Comprende?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's smile wilted. \"Comprendo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now then, be a good husband and fetch me a beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but can we not say 'fetch'? Sounds vaguely like I'm being compared to a dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez got up and left. Then, true to his word, he returned with a beer. She took it without saying thank you, cracking it open and taking a swig. She quietly waited for him to leave, but he sat down next to her again, causing her to silently throw her head back in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, Lucy!\" he said eagerly. \"I love this show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? They got it in your country?\" she asked, only vaguely interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I watched it a lot when I first came to America. It was one of the shows I learned English from. That and the Price is Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains a few things,\" Laurie nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, America is a wonderful country. Where else can you win a free car for knowing the capitol of Rhode Island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked a bit. He was funnier when he wasn't trying to be funny. She had to admit, of all the guys in the group she could've married, he was a pretty good one. He wasn't a thinker like Hyde, but he wasn't clueless like Kelso. Plus, he wasn't her brother like Eric, which was an infinite plus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want anymore snacks, my lovely wife?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrows rose in surprise. \"Sure. Surprise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away!\" He rose off the couch and headed back to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie couldn't help the small smile on her lips. Not a smirk, but an actual smile. He <i>was</i> pretty sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she shook those thoughts out of her head. Ew. No. This was Fez. Bad thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reentered with an armful of snack cakes and chips. \"Any of these?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile came back. </span></div></div>",

While she worked on dishes, cleaning and laundry, Fez kept bringing her food. Sometimes, it'd just be snack cakes and chips that were already in the house, but other times, he'd go for takeout, bringing her burgers, fries, chinese, pizza and soda. She'd be sitting on the couch, waiting for the laundry to finish, and he'd walk through the door with bags of greasy goodness for her. She was in hog's heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it all started to catch up with her. She wore sweats most of the time, so it wasn't noticeable at first, but one day, when she decided to put on a pair of jeans, she found they wouldn't button up. The button couldn't reach the hole. She struggled quite a bit to make it work, but it just wouldn't connect. She rolled around on the bed, grunting and squealing as she tried to make the stubborn clasp hold, but it was no good. These jeans just would not close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the middle of all this racket that her husband entered with another round of goodies. \"I could hear you from outside, Laurie,\" he announced. \"Have you started without me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glared at him. \"I always start without you,\" she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez looked momentarily hurt, but then he shrugged. \"I guess that's fair. God knows I've started without you plenty of times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie finally stopped struggling and flopped on her bed, utterly spent. She peered up at Fez, only to have her vision mostly blocked by the growing mound that was her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez, am I getting fat?\" she asked fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not, my lovely,\" he said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not just saying that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz I feel like you kind of are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez considered. \"Well, I <i>have</i> been told that the correct answer to that question is always 'no', so I always make a point to say it when asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded understandingly. \"Yeah, but... if you weren't just saying the 'correct' answer and were in fact saying what you thought... am I getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez winced. \"Well... I mean, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez, you've got nothing to lose. It's not like I can withhold sex from you, seeing as how we're not sleeping together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sadly true... Okay, I'll tell you the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I think the dryer shrunk most of your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just haven't noticed because you've been wearing your wide variety of stylish sexy sweats these last few weeks. Perhaps you are not doing well with laundry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think? But... Dad and Hyde's clothes go through my laundry, too, and they haven't complained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe... maybe women's clothes are more sensitive than men's...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow. \"Right...,\" she drawled. \"Are you lying to me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Fez!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my lovely, but I can't bring myself to say a bad word against you! You shouldn't feel bad about yourself! I mean, at least, not anymore... You are doing a good thing by taking care of your family so Eric can go to college. You are helping people who love you, and you should feel proud of yourself. You even became betrothed to me, even though I mean nothing to you, just to keep me in the country. So I don't want you to feel bad because you may or may not have gained weight recently. Which you <i>haven't</i>, by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stared at him with a wide-eyed expression. She felt... moved. This idiot was a total loser, nothing to offer, but he had such a way with words. For the briefest of moments, she felt her withered almost-dead heart flutter. It wasn't much, but it was something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her round orb of a belly, placing a hand on it thoughtfully. She couldn't help but take a degree of pride in it. It was a symbol of her sacrifice. Of the first truly selfless thing she'd done in her whole worthless life. She looked at it with a newfound sense of appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she looked up at Fez, who was looking at her with that increasingly-attractive sense of husbandly duty and concern, and she saw the mountain of greasy takeout and a box of doughnuts beckoning to her, reminding her of how hungry she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're right, Fez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am? About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These pants shrunk in the wash. No big deal. Come on. I'll change into some sweats, and then we can have dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, yay! Wear the black ones! They compliment the curve of your sensual hips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I <i>know </i>they do,\" she said with a wink, and she disappeared into the closet.</span></div></div>",

I want him out of my house and out of my family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" Laurie snapped, looking him dead in the eye. \"Look, I'm sorry if me helping Fez isn't 'American' enough for you! But I did it, and here we are! And enough with the racist nicknames! His name is... really hard to pronounce, but he goes by 'Fez'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and Tarzan was white, dammit!\" Fez added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde, who'd been pretty quiet up until now, decided that it was time for him to say something. After all, if Laurie of all people could stand up for Fez, so could he. \"Look, Red, I get that this is getting your star-spangled banner in a bunch, but you have to consider the consequences of <i>not</i> going along with this unholy union.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as what?\" Red demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not just Fez that gets in trouble if they find out the marriage is a sham. If they find out she contributed to an illegal living in America, Laurie could go to jail, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. In fact, we <i>all </i>might go to jail just for harboring him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room looked at each other as the weight of the burnout's words weighed heavily on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay...,\" Red sighed at last. \"If it protects the family, what do I need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Red,\" Kitty said awkwardly. \"It might be nice if you just let me do all the talking. Saying nice things about Fez has never been your strong suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. So I'll probably just smile and nod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't strain yourself, sweetie. Just settle for nodding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the kitchen to start making plans, leaving Laurie standing with her \"husband\" and \"brother\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hyde,\" Fez said gratefully. \"I look forward to being a fake Forman like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, little buddy,\" Hyde replied, clapping on the shoulder - the closest he could ever bring himself to a hug. \"I always embrace an opportunity to screw with the government. The fact that it helps someone is just a coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we just have to create the facade that this is a normal healthy loving marriage,\" Laurie sighed, leaning against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we get to share a bed?\" Fez asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"I think my dad might kill you. Eric's room is just gathering dust, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be if your mom wasn't constantly cleaning it,\" Hyde smirked. \"She keeps dusting and vacuuming on the off chance he comes home and turns five again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Miss Kitty. I should do something nice for her,\" Fez mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mowing the lawn seems like a good place to start,\" Laurie replied. \"Just don't run over her garden again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. And when I return, I think I'll make lunch for you, my wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" she said, patting him on his head. \"Run along. And don't let the mean old lawnmower scare you this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai, that was one time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and strode out towards the garage, leaving Laurie to start making herself some breakfast. Thankfully, in the past few weeks, she'd gotten rather good at making her own waffles and pancakes. Rather than waste time trying to decide on which one to make, she decided to split the difference and make both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde was pouring himself some corn flakes, absently reaching for the milk when she poured it into the pancake mix she was preparing. He glared from behind his shades, but she wordlessly returned it a moment later. As he poured it on his cereal, he quietly observed her at work behind the counter. She didn't have the look of someone horribly depressed. Well, she did, given the sweats, the messy hair, lack of makeup and muffin top, but she still seemed happy enough. Usually, her happiness was laced with a smug superiority. But this was different. She seemed less smug and more... relaxed. It wasn't something he was used to. Normally, if they weren't ignoring each other, they were bombarding each other with insults. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to deal with the silence anymore, he cleared his throat and took a chance on speaking. \"So... settled into marital bliss pretty well, have you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him with a hint of the usual derision she usually reserved for him and his friends. \"Yep. Knowing Jackie, you'll probably be dragged kicking and screaming down the aisle sometime in the next few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde smirked. They hadn't lost their insults. Thank god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well... just glad to see you're actually doing right by your husband. Which means, roughly, you're trying to keep him from being deported. I'm sure you're still entertaining all the guys in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow. \"Meh... not really up for it right now. I mean, I could, I suppose, but there's so much laundry and cleaning and cooking I have to do now to help out... I dunno...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde took his shades off in surprise. \"The legendary Laurie Forman has lost interest in sex?\" he asked, putting a hand to his chest in fake shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pft! As if! I just... I don't know... When Dad had his heart attack, and because of something I did... It just kind of... put everything in perspective, y'know? Like... maybe there's more to life than partying, boozing and... sexing, I think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking responsibility and being useful...,\" Hyde mused, tapping his shades against the table. \"Can't argue with that. Unless they expect me to do it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked. \"Well, you've toasted so many brain cells, you probably can't even sort the mail anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd take a stand and prove you wrong if I gave a rat's ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie cooked diligently through their conversation - waffles on the left, pancakes on the right - and was pleased to find they were about done. She got down a large plate and started to pile them up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's lunch, I give you points for laziness,\" Hyde remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, this is breakfast. Someone's got to cook it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you're sharing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glared sternly. \"Make your own, deadbeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that, just for you? Man, you're <i>really </i>not interested in sex with random strangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'll have you know I could still get any guy I wanted! I'm just... taking a sabbatical!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you're - dare I say it - settling down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bite your tongue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you seem to be fitting into the 'housewife' status pretty comfortably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just helping out. I have other things I want to do, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I... didn't think you'd ask me that so soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde smirked again. \"Look, I'm not gonna tell you what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right, you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...because I think you're doing the right thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... oh... huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're helping your parents, you're helping Fez... Who would've thought big bad Laurie Forman would have heart after all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, go to hell!\" she snapped, stuffing a forkful of waffles / pancakes in her mouth to smother a smile from forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde chuckled and got up. \"Okay, gotta go. Jackie wants a ride to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May god have mercy on your lack of soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like you're one to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the keys to the Camino and walked out via the patio door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie continued to stuff her face, devouring the large stack of food in front of her. Within ten minutes, it was all gone, butter, syrup and all. She leaned back in her chair and enjoyed the resulting fullness in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peered down. Her gut. Her great big gut. It bulged with the enormity of her gorge. She patted it soothingly. Kinda nice, actually. To actually enjoy fattening food was kinda nice. To just kind of kick back and let herself go was also kinda nice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another two days before the government agent came a-knockin' at their door. He had the look of your typical federal agent - icky, boring and kind of reptilian. He strode through the door with the stereotypical dark suit and briefcase, as if that was all they had to wear in the FBI. Laurie couldn't help but frown at the suit. Didn't they know that by trying to look inconspicuous, they were only making themselves look more inconspicuous? Everything about him screamed \"FBI\" and \"official government doofus\" and \"not gettin' any\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was the man who would ultimately decide Fez's fate, whether they approved of his dress code or not. They welcomed him in, made him comfortable on the couch, and smiled politely as he droned on about nothing. He said he wanted to interview everyone separately. They were all silently thankful that Hyde was at work right now, so he wouldn't be expected to give a statement or anything. While they knew he'd probably want to help Fez, that wouldn't be enough to stop him from insulting the government, probably landing him in worse trouble than Fez was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they all were interviewed. Her and Fez first, and her parents second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir interview went somewhat fine. Fez seemed a little too eager to brag about how he bagged her quicker than you can say \"corn on the cob\" for some reason. The guy had been a virgin for so long that he simply felt the need to boast about his \"experience\" whenever he could, even if it meant deportation. Still, his tone assured her that the agent guy probably wouldn't suspect him of lying. Sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they kept up the little backstory that they'd cooked up. Hyde had advised them that the best way to lie was to sprinkle it with bits of truth. So, they kept it simple. Fez was a friend of her brother's, and they'd known each other for a while before things got serious - true. They had sex for the first time during a camping trip - true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the most truth they could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd managed to weasel their way around the truth with the semi-plausible storyline that they'd dated for two years, and Fez had proposed earlier that year, with the intention that they'd get married in winter or something, but when his visa unexpectedly expired, they decided to move the date up to keep him in the country and to \"protect our love\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent had nodded, but he also raised an eyebrow. Laurie suspected he was suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they were later hustled out of the living room to the kitchen, and her parents were called in to replace them. They let out a breath they hadn't known they'd been holding and relaxed against the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiiiii,\" Fez moaned. \"So many questions, so few lies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Laurie huffed. \"I swear, the tension is driving me crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm... if only there was some way to relieve the tension in a... conjoined manner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared unimpressed as he waggled his eyebrows suggestively. It was so pathetic it was almost cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no,\" she said. \"We're not having sex while we're being questioned by the government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? They're trying to find out if we really love each other! What better way than by finally consummating this puppy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't want to. At least, not right this second, okay? I just... I just don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez tilted his head quizzically. \"Why not? Usually, you're an 'any-port-in-a-storm' type of girl.\" She gave him a look. \"No offense,\" he added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie slumped over to the fridge. \"I don't know... This whole situation has been to stressful for sex. I just... I dunno... I mean, I still feel urges, but now I feel guilty for having them. Like, how can I think about sex when my dad almost died and I might get sent to jail for marrying you?\" She pulled out some leftover fried chicken from last night and starting eating again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez gently put a hand on her shoulder. \"I am sorry, my lovely. I am letting my loins be my brains. An act that has gotten me in more trouble than I can count. I should be more receptive to your needs. You are going through a lot right now, and I must respect that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled gratefully. \"Thanks, Fez. I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled back. \"Even with a mouthful of KFC, you are still the vision of an angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now she was getting that weird fluttery feeling she got when he complimented her. She had to admit, it was a step up from \"nice boobs\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the interviews ended, and although there was a brief moment of uncertainty where it looked like Red was finally going to say exactly what he thought of their union, he ultimately agreed to keep up the ruse and described them as a couple that was \"very much in love\", something that was clearly not easy for him. Thankfully, he got through it without another heart attack, and it seemed to be enough for the agent. It would take some time, but Fez would be able to become a citizen in the coming weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he said goodbye and left, Laurie hugged Red and thanked him for his help. He smiled grudgingly before shoving Fez away before he could hug him as well. Kitty was so happy that no one was going to jail that she announced she'd be making a big dinner for everyone, which perked Laurie right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they waited for dinner, Laurie popped upstairs and saw Fez was moving his things out of Eric's room. \"Where are you going?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going back to live with my host parents,\" he explained. \"I am grateful to your family for putting up with me these last few days, but I mustn't burden you all much longer. Otherwise, Red will kill me while I sleep. Or I will kill him when he's awake with another heart attack. Might be best if we just avoid each other for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie couldn't help but pout a little bit. \"Oh... okay, that makes sense, I guess... But you'll still visit all the time, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" he smiled. \"Hyde still lives in the basement. As long as I'm down there, I should be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyde... right...,\" she murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course,\" he continued, \"should you ever want to engage in marital bliss at any point in the future, you only have to call.\" He waggled his eyebrows again. Okay, dammit, that shouldn't be cute. But it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let a small smile spread across her lips. \"I might take you up on that sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily, dinner time rolled around not long after, and they went downstairs to join everyone at the table. As per usual, Kitty had gone overboard with cooking, as she often did when she was either happy or depressed. Chicken, ham, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, peas, string beans, steamed carrots, devilled eggs... Simply too much to count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was there, of course. As soon as they knew Mrs. Forman was cooking, they all sat around in eager anticipation. Hyde with Jackie, of course, but Kelso had joined in as well, seeing as how he was feeling depressed about Brooke not wanting him to be a part of their child's life. Fez felt that, for his own sake, he'd better not sit next to Laurie as long as Red was watching. She was a little sad about that, but she also didn't want him to die, so she didn't make a fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner went pleasantly and somewhat uneventfully. Since the drama concerning the government was resolved, talk turned to Kelso's impending fatherhood and his sadness that Brooke had turned him away. Of course, everyone had an opinion on that. Kitty told him he should persist while Red told him to back off. Jackie told him to buy her something expensive while Hyde said to give her space for now. Fez suggested \"doing it\", of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie threw in every once in a while, but right now, she was starving. The relief of not getting in trouble with the government was such a relief, and now she was ravenous. It was like she just couldn't have enough. As the conversation continued around her, she took advantage of the distraction to sneak extra portions onto her plate. She piled it high, poured extra gravy and butter on pretty much everything and tucked in. She ate with a desire that she normally reserved for intercourse. It felt so good to finally be eating what she wanted when she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner went on for an hour, with the discussion going from Kelso's problem to the latest letter from Eric and Donna to Hyde's job at the restaurant to Red's next doctor appointment. Soon, however, everyone was tired and full, so one by one, they all got up to go and clean up. Hyde, Jackie, Kelso and Fez all politely thanked Mrs. Forman for dinner, which made her so happy she let out her trademark laugh before shooing them all away. Red slouched off to his chair to watch some TV while the gang made their to the basement and Kitty started doing dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie opted to go up to her room for a bit. God, she was stuffed. She must've eaten three quarters of all that food herself. Her sweats had allowed her to let loose her appetite in a way regular pants just wouldn't cut. She could feel the beginning of a waddle happening between her thighs as they began to brush together. When she got to her room, she slipped off her top and looked herself up and down. What a belly she had going on. Look at the way it bulged out like a balloon. She gave it a slap and let out a whimper - gawd, that had hurt! She was so painfully overstuffed that moving was extremely difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning to herself, she laid out flat on her back on her bed. She was exhausted. What a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she had to admit, it had been a good day. They'd gotten through everything, survived, and had a good night together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a good meal together, she reminded herself, rubbing her belly soothingly. She hoped there would be more such meals in the future. She didn't know why, but somehow, stuffing her belly into a globe was extremely pleasurable. Full of bliss and food, she fell into a lovely food coma.</span></div></div>",

So now he was hanging around the house all the time. He'd been lonely enough without Donna, so now he had that whole house to himself. Kitty, of course, was always eager to help him out, but Red, of course, was constantly annoyed by his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got really bad when she came down into the basement to hang out one day, only to find Bob already there, hanging out with Jackie and Kelso, watching the tube. She rolled her eyes in dismay as she slumped down into the empty garden chair. It was technically Fez's chair, but what the hell - they were married, weren't they? She sat her slightly heavier-than-usual ass on it and took out a nail file, doing a little work while she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bob,\" she said in her usual disinterested way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kiddo,\" he replied pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sat in silence for a long time, none of them really sure what to say or do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kelso took a chance and tried talking. \"Bob...? What're you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob shrugged. \"I just thought I'd try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... A little uncomfortable. I thought it'd be better than sitting home alone.\" He shook his head. \"It's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he finally got up and left, allowing everyone to slump with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GAWD, the guy is hopeless,\" Jackie sighed. \"It's like he doesn't know what to do with himself after a break up. Why can't he just go to the mall and max out his dad's credit cards like everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd he and Joanne break up, anyway?\" Laurie asked. \"I thought they were solid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" Kelso replied, lying out on the couch. \"Don't think he's all that sure himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, once when I was sad, when Michael was cheating on me I got flowers from a secret admirer, and it cheered me right up.<br>\r\nI mean, sure I sent them to myself. But it's the thought that counts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sent them? You let me go on about how I sent them to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I was enjoying watching you squirm,\" Jackie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I like that!\" Laurie said approvingly. \"You go, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls laughed together, making Kelso pout. \"Dammit, it's bad enough Fez is trying to take the waiter job at the hotel from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez is what?\" Laurie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyde put him onto that waiter job I've been trying to get. I mean, I've got a baby on the way! I need to prove to Brooke that I'm responsible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, my husband is trying to get a job so he's not some deadbeat loser. I mean, it's only a matter of time before his host parents find out he's not in high school anymore. Having a job will help him when they throw him out. Plus, it'll help him get his green card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pft! You guys are gonna divorce anyway! What's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glared at him. \"Look, I put a lot of work into helping him stay in the country. I'm not going to let it get screwed up just cuz you knocked some poor girl up, okay? Besides, it'd be nice if he helped my family out. Dad can't work, so every little bit helps. Once the booze runs out, they might try to drink <i>us</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't have to stay married for that,\" Jackie pointed out. \"I mean, his green card's on the way. It should be safe to start dumping his ass by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie fidgeted. \"I'll get around to it... Just, y'know... better safe than sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie narrowed her eyes suspiciously at her, like she knew something was up, but she didn't say anything for the time being. The midget was showing restraint for a change, Laurie thought. Damn, this maturity thing was spreading like wildfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while some were willing to let Laurie's decisions go, Red was less than pleased. He'd done his part now that the INS agent had been and gone. Now it was just a matter of getting them divorced. He'd sent Laurie to the courthouse with fifty dollars to get the proceedings started, but she'd ended up spending it on a compact mirror, some makeup and a big lunch from Fatso Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez and Laurie weren't exactly causing much trouble around the house. Since she'd lost the will to whore herself out all the time, and he'd moved back out again, you'd hardly guess they were married. Although, every time he showed up at the house, she'd make a point of greeting him and asking how he was, and sometimes, she'd hang out in the basement with him and the gang. Since she'd been a big help earlier, they had to admit they were warming up to her. And she'd usually see him off when he was leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was in two minds about it. In a way, he felt like he should be glad that she seemed to be finally settling down, but did it have to be with one of Eric's idiot friends? There wasn't anything about Fez he disliked in particular - other than him being foreign - but he didn't like the way they'd gotten married on the spur of the moment. A green card marriage was just so... blech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, one day, he'd had enough, and he decided he was going to take them down to the courthouse and get them a divorce whether they liked it or not. They both looked very hangdog about it, but he'd made his decision. However, when they opened the door to leave, they found a box on the welcome mat. It was a wedding present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty admitted she'd told people about it. \"Well, I had to tell a few people because I never thought I'd be able to say 'Laurie got married' without adding 'and the baby came early'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Red was insistent that they return the gift, Kitty, Laurie and Fez still enthusiastically unwrapped it when they realized it was a new microwave, something Kitty had been wanting for a long time. So they spent the night playing with the microwave, making everything from popcorn to a baked potato - and of course, Laurie ate everything that came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Red was still trying to get them to have their divorce, and he wasn't happy when he saw the microwave had been used. But then, yet another gift came, and this time it was a power saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's from Billy Schneider down at the hardware store,\" Laurie explained. \"He's had a crush on me since I went ladder shopping in that miniskirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez got very serious. \"Okay, just to make it clear. If you're buying me a gift I want candy. For my birthday, Christmas, daylight savings-- candy. Candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Fez, candy!\" Laurie replied. \"But remember, as your wife, I'm entitled to fifty percent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Now then - you can keep the saw, Red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed had been admiring the power saw the entire time it had been in his hand, and he looked startled. \"... No, that would be wrong...,\" he said, clearly torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\" Kitty said slyly. \"It would be wrong if they were divorced... But if they stayed married, sending the gifts back would be rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a good point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised a playful eyebrow. \"I thought you wanted us to get divorced, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what, honey. We'll wait a month. If a riding mower hasn't shown up by then, we'll talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie discreetly hid a small smile and patted him on the shoulder, motioning for Fez to follow her to the basement. It was time for \"I Love Lucy\" anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you get the job at the restaurant?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did indeed! It seems people feel very comfortable asking a foreigner to fetch things for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, well, it's something to put on a resume. And maybe we can buy Daddy a riding mower and pretend it was sent in the mail or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey plopped down on the couch side by side, enjoying the black and white reruns together. They must've been there for a while, because as the day wore on, they slumped together on the couch, getting incredibly close to each other, which should've felt weird, but Laurie found it quite nice to just lean up against him and let her mind go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just toying with the idea of leaning over and kissing him when the door burst open, making them jump. It was Kelso, looking particularly insane with glee, while Hyde and Jackie came in behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy's going to give me another chance!\" he yelled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie and Fez sat up straight in surprise. \"Wait, what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, one of the waitresses quit because he wouldn't stop hitting on her, so there's an opening now! This is my second chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, happy day!\" Fez cried, leaping to his feet. \"I felt so horrible about showing you up in front of everyone in such a humiliating manner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I say let bygones be bygones,\" Hyde said, patting his two friends on the shoulders. \"The important thing is that we get to watch Kelso fail all over again, which is something we can all celebrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Kelso said cheerily before realizing what he'd said. \"Wait a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Kelso. Now that we are no longer competing, I will show you how to become a great waiter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will endeavor to be as unhelpful as humanly possible,\" Hyde agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks, guys,\" Kelso said, genuinely touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we'll go upstairs and see if Miss Kitty has some trays and plates we can practice with,\" Fez said, motioning towards the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde and Kelso went on ahead upstairs, but Fez took a moment to readdress Laurie, who still looked a little bewildered by all of this happening so fast. \"Pardon me, my lovely, but I have a friend in need. I shall return. Possibly with many injuries. And hopefully, a pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled. \"You're good. Take your time,\" she said, waving him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to her surprise, Fez leaned down and kissed her on the cheek before hurrying after the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone, she couldn't help the goofy grin on her face. But then she remembered that Jackie was seated in the lawn chair, eyeing her carefully.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie shifted awkwardly under Jackie's suspicious gaze. She was feeling really uncomfortable, which shouldn't be possible in her designer sweat pants. She curled her legs up onto the couch indian-style, trying to avoid eye contact, but the brunette midget was very good at judgemental stares. All those years on the pep squad had given her that gift. Good god, what was going through that girl's tiny-yet-single-tracked mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" Jackie drawled, tapping the arm of the lawn chair with her perfectly-manicured index finger. \"What's the deal with you and -- ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look!\" Laurie said, suddenly pulling a magazine out of the cushions. \"Teen Beat magazine! Wanna find out what Scott Baio's favorite color is?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stared at the magazine in amazement. \"Oh, wow! I haven't read that issue yet!\" she cried, snatching it out of the older girl's hand. \"How'd you even get this?! Even someone as girly as Eric wouldn't be subscribed to it?! I can't believe...!\" Alas, she trailed off and saw the fake smile plastered all over Laurie's face. \"Ugh...,\" she grunted, putting it back on the table between them. \"I can't believe I almost fell for that, you brilliant bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie squirmed and tried her best to shrink down into the couch out of sight, but she couldn't bend that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Jackie said, leaning in close. \"All I want to know is what's going on with you and Fez. No weaseling out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's going on! It's just... you know, green card marriage! Nothing more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, are you kidding me?!\" Jackie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Nothing more'? Could you be anymore transparent? Any time you say it's 'nothing more', it's <i>always </i>'something more'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie squirmed again. \"Look, it's none of your business, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm a gossip! It's always my business! And I deserve to know if Fez is involved with a woman who's just going to rip his heart out and stomp on it for some guy in a butcher shop with nice arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women stared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?!\" Laurie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie took a breath to calm herself. \"Look... Fez is one of my best friends. Okay, he's not that good-looking and he's a complete loser, but he's still a nice guy. And I don't like the idea of him getting together with you. Because, no offense, you're a whore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Laurie snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'no offense'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I've had a lot going on right now. Dad's heart attack, Eric leaving for college, the government investigating me... And you know what? Fez has been very supportive through all of this. He does things for me, brings me things, watches TV with me... He even shares his candy with me, and I have it on good authority that he never does that with anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'm in love with the guy, but I like him a lot. And I know I don't have the best track record with respecting peoples' feelings, but I'm working on that. And for all I know, Fez doesn't even like me that way. He might just be being polite and hoping it gets him laid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, waitwaitwait,\" Jackie interjected, holding up a hand. \"You haven't had sex with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the once, during the camping trip... which, as it happens, was the last time I had sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's eyes widened. \"Laurie, that was all the way back in May! It's been five months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I just... I can't bring myself to do it anymore! There was this guy, Carlos, who I almost went out with, but I just kept thinking of my dad in a hospital bed and I couldn't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was almost certain that Jackie was looking vaguely sympathetic. It was always hard to tell with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" she continued, \"that's all that's going on with me and Fez. Yes, I like him. Yes, I have feelings for him. No, I'm not using him. No, I'm not going to deliberately break his heart. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded slowly. \"Okay...,\" she said with a somewhat accepting tone. \"But just remember. I kicked your ass once. I can kick it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded in response. \"Noted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright smile split across Jackie's face and she bounced like the cheerleader she was. \"Good! Glad we got that settled! Now, lemme at that Teen Beat!\" She snatched up the magazine and started flipping through it. \"Although, to hell with Scott Baio,\" she added, not looking up. \"Something about him just makes me cringe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged and peered over at the nearby deep freeze. She needed a sugar fix, pronto. She headed over and dug around past the meat until she found the goodies - popsicles, pushups... oooh, ice cream sandwiches, too! How'd she not known about those? She pulled the box out and carried it back over to the sofa. She began ripping one open and took a bite, moaning softly at the soft chocolate cookie with vanilla goodness in between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she realized that she was being stared at again. Jackie was looking up from the magazine with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Want one?\" she asked, holding the box up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Think I'm good,\" the other girl replied, looking back at the magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged, finished the first sandwich, and then started in on the second one. It was weird that Jackie wasn't making snide comments on her weight, seeing as how mocking fat people was one of those things she delighted in. Either the cheerleader really was growing up, or she wasn't paying that much attention. It could really be either one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the second one and looked down into the box. There were still eight left. She smiled. It was going to be a good day after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie bounced awkwardly as she tried to force her festive pants over her thick thighs. She let out a pathetic whimper as she clenched her butt so they'd slip on better. They were a lovely dark red that she felt really fit the holiday season and would be ideal for the high school dance she was being dragged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not really dragged to. She'd volunteered to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not really volunteered. More like \"begged\" to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was either this or join her parents at the mall dressed as an elf, and frankly, going back to high school for one night sounded way more appealing. The only reason any of them were going back to high school was because Jackie had just been kicked off the cheerleading squad, and she was so livid that she had to go back all proud and junk with her high school graduate boyfriend. Of course, Hyde basically forced Kelso and Fez to go with him. Fez had invited Laurie to come, and as soon as her mom announced they were going to be little helpers, she immediately said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could get these damn red pants to button up. She took a deep breath, sucked in her considerable gut, and felt sweet relief as the button went through the hole. She let out the breath and took a moment to stare at how much bigger her stomach bulged when it was crammed into pants that were a size too small. She'd had to go up three sizes lately, but Fez had been more than happy to pay for some new clothes with his new paycheck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily, since he'd gotten a job and was making an honest living, Red had eased up slightly about their marriage. He still wasn't happy with it, but he'd still allowed Fez to come over for Thanksgiving dinner with the rest of the family. He still had to sit at the kids table with Hyde, Kelso and Jackie, and she had to sit with the adults - not to mention a visiting Eric and Donna - but it was progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts floated back to Thanksgiving. She'd really made a pig of herself during that. So much turkey, stuffing, corn, potatoes... She was pretty sure she ate an entire pumpkin pie by herself! If only she had the money to eat that much every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only so she could enjoy having Fez give her a belly rub on her bed, as he had that evening. It had been so sexy - they'd just laid back in silence, both of them half-asleep from turkey, and he'd just gently rubbed her stomach until she fell asleep. And when she woke up the next morning, he was still there, conked out, with his hand still on her tummy. If there hadn't been a fear of Red finding them, she would've stayed like that forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped a sweater on - a green one with a red and white pattern, and she took a moment to appreciate the way it hugged her curves. Her boobs were way bigger with all this weight, making her belly just a little less noticeable. She may be content with her growing girth, but that didn't mean she wanted a whole bunch of high school bozos mocking her. Especially when Jackie's pep squad were going to be the center of attention all night. Those girls were merciless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance wasn't too bad for a high school dance. Fez was concerned about the football team attacking him like they always did. Kelso was trying to have a good time, but he was still thinking about Brooke. Hyde wasn't really interested in anything except spiking the punch, but Jackie needed him nearby to be arm candy. Steven Hyde wasn't quite what Laurie would call \"arm candy\" but whatever. She was more interested in the snack table. So many desserts, so little time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she'd been out of high school a bit longer than these losers, so no one recognized her. She spent most of the evening on her own by the snacks, silently enjoying the feeling of these tight pants getting tighter around her middle. Of course, every once in a while, one of the gang would come up and bother her about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this dance bites,\" Kelso groaned. \"I can't stop thinking about Brooke. I mean, both you and me know that every girl in here wants me, but I don't care about any on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"Oh my god, Kelso,\" she grunted as she swallowed down another cookie. \"Look, if you want to be with Brooke, go talk to her. You gave her some space. You've given her time to think. Just go hang the hell out with her, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso looked emboldened by her words. \"Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna! Brooke's having my baby - our baby - and I want to be a part of its life! Maybe she'll never fall in love with me, but at least she'll like me enough to let me be a dad! Thanks, Laurie! Since you got fat, you're all wise and stuff, like Buddha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie blinked, then shrugged. \"I don't know about wise, but... I'm a lot happier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso patted her on the shoulder and took off, full of determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie wasn't sure if she hadn't just been talking out of her ass right now, but what the hell? It got rid of him, and now she could enjoy more cookies. She actually felt a little aroused by the thought of eating so much, she would have to unbutton her pants in front of these loser teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scanned the crowd, trying to find Fez, but there was no sign of him. She briefly had a dreadful thought that he might have hooked up with someone. There were probably some girls who thought he'd be cool just because he'd graduated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, those hopes were mercifully put to rest when he suddenly came running through the room. Unfortunately, there was a team of linebackers behind him, all trying to grab him so they could beat the tar out of him for god knows what reason. She went over to where Hyde and Jackie were sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell are those guys chasing Fez?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shrugged. \"I guess they didn't like his singing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded. \"Yeah, Steven told him everyone would think he was cool if he sang a song onstage. He barely got through three words before they chased him off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stared at them. \"And you just let them chase him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, he'll probably be at half-mast anytime now,\" Hyde said. \"We'll get him after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glared at him before storming off in the direction of the brutes chasing her husband. She found them down by the lockers not far from the gym, and she saw them all set to grab him and jam him inside of one. He was kicking and squirming, trying to get free, but these guys had fists the size of dumpsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she snapped, making them all jump. \"Get your big dumb hands off my husband!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stared at her for a long moment. Then at Fez. Then at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of them found his voice. \"Why don't you back off, you fat bitch!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laurie could think of a plan, Fez's knee suddenly came up and connected with his captor's crotch, causing him to double over in pain. The distraction loosened his grip on Fez's lapels, and he landed a good punch in the second startled musclebound mook's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he only had enough time for those two, as the third one grabbed him by the neck and put him in a headlock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Laurie noticed a discarded textbook lying on the floor - and it was a thick one, too - picked it up and whacked the guy over the head with it. He had to grab his head in due to the shock before Fez grabbed his leg and flipped the guy over onto his back. Then, he grabbed Laurie's hand and dragged her away, causing her to drop the textbook on the guy's head, rendering him temporarily disoriented long enough for them to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey burst outside into the cold air, looking for Hyde's El Camino. As they stood in the freezing parking lot, they took a minute to get their breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...,\" Fez panted. \"I can't believe... I did that... It truly is a Christmas miracle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were amazing!\" Laurie practically squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no one calls my wife a fat bitch,\" he replied proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him in the eye, giving him her most sexy look. \"Oh, but Fez...,\" she said in a husky voice. \"I <i>am </i>a fat bitch.\" She pressed him against the Camino and put her lips to his, kissing the bejeezus out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, he was surprised, but then, he started to return it, wrapping his arms around her, and enjoying it as she ran her nails through his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she became acutely aware of something in her downstairs department, and she looked up at him, clearly impressed. \"Whoa...,\" she said breathily. \"Even in a Wisconsin snowfall... How'd you manage that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby,\" Fez replied in his own deep voice. \"You inspire me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself go just a little crazy inside as she started making out with him again. They probably would've just had sex in the snow if Hyde and Jackie hadn't just come up behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hey, none of that in my Camino!\" Hyde snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ew, guys!\" Jackie added. \"Get your <i>own </i>sex vehicle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez and Laurie glared at them but reluctantly came apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't help but notice a couple of jocks all writhing in pain on the floor,\" Hyde continued. \"You two wouldn't know anything about that, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez put an arm around Laurie. \"I was protecting my wife's honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was protecting my husband's junk,\" Laurie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever you did, you did a good job,\" said Jackie. \"It's fair to say at least one of them has been reshuffled in the choir, if you get my meaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Fez said with a smile. \"Now let's get out of here before they regain strength and remember they can still kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Fez,\" Jackie said, patting his arm. \"I'm not rejoining the pep squad. Safe to say none of you have to come here again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Christmas miracles just keep coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was quiet, save for the Christmas music Jackie insisted on listening to. Laurie was snuggled up in Fez's arms in the back. She'd given up a dessert gorge for him. She must truly be in love.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, it finally became 1979 - seriously, it felt like it had been 1978 for a few years now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the new year came Fez and Laurie finally deciding that they were in a relationship. No more tiptoeing around it - they were a couple. It was the first time since high school that Laurie had been in a one-on-one relationship. And god knows she and Fez were spending plenty of time one-on-one. More specifically, one-on-top-of-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was thrilled to see her daughter was well and truly settling down. Red was annoyed that Fez wouldn't be disentangling himself from his family tree anytime soon, but he had to admit that Laurie was happier than he'd seen her in a long time. In fact, it was the longest she'd been home in a long time. So even though Fez still irritated him, he was willing to accept this if he truly made her happy. As long as he didn't actually have to live there, he was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as they continued into the new year, Fez was constantly at the Forman residence, so it was almost as if he was living there anyway. Laurie was almost certain she hadn't left her room in weeks. Fez always brought her whatever she needed, and that included food. When he came home from work, he'd have whatever she'd been craving that day - cheeseburgers, pizza, tacos, nachos, chinese, and once, he simply brought home three pints of her favorite ice cream, and they'd watch TV on her little portable together. Then, when she simply couldn't hold another mouthful, the fun would begin. There was something about being stuffed to the brim that made her hornier than ever. Perhaps a big part of it was that Fez was attracted to her no matter the size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez had never given any signs of being a chubby chaser or anything. In fact, the more she spent time with him, he was becoming more of a \"Laurie chaser\". That just made him even more appealing to her - the fact that he just wanted her for her. It was something she'd never truly experienced before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he still clearly enjoyed her body. There were times he'd hold her taught belly while they were making out, jiggle her growing love handles, give the fat of her thighs a good squeeze. It drove her wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was their routine for most of January. He'd go to work, stay late, then come home with food and sex. It was a veritable paradise for Laurie. She had never known a satisfaction quite like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she eventually grew bored just lying around all day and finally got up. She had spent most of this month in her underwear, so she was a tad startled when her sweats were a tad... tight. She looked at herself in the mirror. Her belly was so big she looked almost seven months pregnant. She took a brief moment to admire it before slipping on an old sweater that definitely didn't fit anymore. She half-heartedly brushed her hair before deciding that was good enough and walking out into the daylight. She found Hyde at the table eating lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Morning,\" she said, heading straight for the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like, 'afternoon',\" he replied. \"It's 1:00. And in case you didn't notice, almost February.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed it got dark and light outside a few times...\" Laurie got out some turkey and cheese and proceeded to make a sandwich. Actually, make that two sandwiches. She was starving. \"So where's Fez?\" she asked. \"Thought today was his day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's outside, mowing the lawn,\" Hyde replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. I swear, every time he does that, Dad's desire to kill him diminishes slightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering the guy is basically living here rent-free, I'd say every little bit helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! Fez doesn't live here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. He lives in your room. Don't think no one's noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Did we disturb you?\" she asked teasingly. \"All the way down in the basement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde grimaced. \"No, it's more like a sixth sense type deal. I know when acts of evil are being committed in this house, and I'm not the one committing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry, but Fez and I are dating now. We like being together. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the honeymoon phase,\" Hyde replied knowingly. \"It's all exciting and new. Jackie and I went through that. Now we're happily bored with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Laurie sneered. \"You light up behind those aviators every time she comes over. You're just so 'zen', you think you can't show it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde sneered in return. \"Whatever,\" he replied, departing back to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked and proceeded to eat her sandwiches. She glanced down at the plate and saw that she'd somehow ended up with three. Whoops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down by herself, listening to the lawnmower outside. She was loving this. Imagine if she didn't have to get up at all. If she could just live in her room, stay in bed and have her gorgeous husband bring her food all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fantasized about the countless meals he'd bring her - something new every night, loaded with grease and sugar and calories. She imagined that pot belly of hers swelling like a balloon, getting larger and larger with each passing day. She imagined years passing until, after a steady diet of fattening food, she was five hundred pounds. No, bigger than that. Eight hundred. So big that the bed eventually collapsed under her weight. She'd be trapped, pinned by her own fat. Her stomach so big and round that she couldn't reach her enormous flabby arms around them. Her boobs so big and swollen that they drooped over both sides. Her ass so large she couldn't sit on an ordinary chair anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be completely immobile. To be completely dependent on her Fez. Her Fez, who'd have to climb up over her fat to kiss her. Who'd spend evenings giving her baths, rubbing her soapy body, every last inch of it, maybe getting a teeny bit creative with a loofah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie let out a soft moan, running her free hand down under the waistband of her sweats and cradling her belly, and polishing off those sandwiches with a longing she'd never felt before. She began to feel around for her next one, only to open her eyes and find she'd already finished them. She let out a sad little moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...,\" she wailed through a mouthful of bread. \"More... I wan' more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up from the chair - still with one hand down her pants - and hurried to the fridge. She found a carton of juice that looked like it needed finishing. She grabbed it and hurried to her room. She shut the door behind her, unscrewed the top, laid back on her bed and chugged for dear life. Oh good god, it filled her up quickly, and she just couldn't stop. She felt around within her pants, realizing how wet she was getting just thinking about being so fat, so big, so helpless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came up for air. Dammit, she couldn't wait for Fez. She'd have to fly solo for this one. She drank and drank until she felt like she'd be sick, setting the empty container on the floor and lying on her back, playing with her belly with one hand while playing with herself with the other. She bit her lip as she listened to the contents of her stomach slosh around inside her like a waterbed. Gurgling churning making her tummy like a mound of jelly, she was driving herself insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd like to say it lasted for twenty minutes, but really, it was more like four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was over, she laid there, her pants halfway off, lying in a puddle and a dazed look on her face. She sleepily looked up and saw her monster of a belly towering over her, still swollen from her liquid lunch. She heard it gurgle again, and she let out a loud belch. She patted her stomach, grinned at the reflection in the makeup mirror, and then proceeded to clean up the mess.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days passed. Laurie still enjoyed lazing around in bed. Fez came by periodically, bringing her food, drinks and sex. She laid there, pondering over whether or not there was a way to combine the three, when she heard movement outside. Curious, she got up. It was probably time for a shower anyway. She'd been slacking on that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her door and was surprised to find a stack of neatly-folded laundry at her feet. She picked it up and inspected. Where did this come from? She brought it all inside and started putting it away, but now she was starting to shake the cobwebs from her brain. When was the last time she'd done laundry? It was a bit difficult to place a date, but it seemed like the last time was around two weeks ago. Afterwards, she'd just been kind of cycling through her clothes without giving it much thought. But now that she saw them in a neat stack, all nice and clean, she had to wonder - who was doing the laundry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole point of her staying home was to help out her parents after Red's heart attack. Obviously, she'd slacked off quite a bit, if she couldn't even remember the last time she'd done any actual chores around here. So what was the deal? Perhaps she'd better venture outside and find out. She got dressed as quickly as possible - which, with her clothes being fresh from the dryer, combined with her new girth, was no mean feat - and made her way out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, she saw Kitty walking around the kitchen, tidying up a bit. She didn't look like she was doing anything strenuous. She didn't look stressed or anything. \"Hey, mom,\" she said. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked up and smiled. \"Oh, Laurie! There you are! I've been meaning to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sweetie, I think it's just wonderful that you and Fez are making a go of an actual relationship instead of the godless sinful green card marriage it originally was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but...,\" Kitty awkwardly continued, \"I do think maybe you're working that poor boy too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, he's a very kind young man, and he's been very helpful, but I think he's about to collapse from sheer exhaustion! I mean, he's here everyday, doing all your chores!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as he gets home from work, he's doing laundry, helping with dinner, doing yard work... I mean, we're very grateful to him, but I think it'd be nice if you helped him once in a while. I mean, I don't see why you have him running around like a chicken without a head trying to do everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stared. \"Mom, I haven't told Fez to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I actually completely spaced on doing chores... I guess I was... enjoying his company so much... I just completely forgot. I had no idea he was doing my chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty frowned. \"Oh dear... Well, he's outside shoveling the walk right now if you want to, you know... nip that in the bud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded and hurried outside into the cold. She grabbed a jacket and scarf and made her way down the thankfully salted driveway to the sidewalk where Fez had his snow shovel, and was working hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez?\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up in surprise. \"Good afternoon, my lovely!\" he said happily. He leaned in to kiss her, and although she returned it, she saw the dark circles under his bloodshot eyes and realized how tired he must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been flying on gossamer wings since I fell for you, my darling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. There was cute, and then there was corny. \"When's the last time you slept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez closed one eye as he did the math in his head. \"I estimate about... five hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hours? That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hours is plenty! Means I have more time to do all the household tasks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Fez, you also have a high-stress job at the hotel to worry about. Look, I'll finish shoveling the walk. You ought to go inside and take a nap before you have to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I must insist!\" Fez said firmly. \"I am your husband, and it is my duty to ensure you live in wedded bliss by you never having to lift a finger! And if that means staying up and working until my back hurts and I hallucinate Bea Arthur dressed as Willy Wonka, then so be it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stared at him. \"Fez, that's insane! You're going to destroy your brain if you don't take a break! I mean, I'm all for lying around in bed all day, but not at the expense of your health!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is my duty! Otherwise, I am of no use to you, and you will have to leave me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You... Is that why you're doing all this? You think I'll leave you if you don't wait on me hand and foot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez shuffled awkwardly, and he was beginning to look increasingly tired as his enthusiasm melted away. \"Well... I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how sad he looked made Laurie go over and give him a hug. \"Oh, Fezzie,\" she sighed. \"You don't have to do any of that to keep me around. I'm with you because I like you. I like the way you make me feel. How special you make me feel. I appreciate all of this, but for god's sake, your head's gonna explode from all this work. And then <i>I'll </i>have to clean up the mess, which kinda defeats the purpose of doing everything for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got a small chuckle, so she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about it? Wanna go inside and take a nap? Leave some of the household chores to your doting, caring and, dare I say it, drop dead gorgeous wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Fez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<i>zzzzzzzzzzz</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, she hefted Fez around until he was draped over her shoulder, and she dragged him back into the house - hoping that nobody thought she had just murdered him or something. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her nice little \"honeymoon\" over, Laurie forced herself to go back to doing her chores so Fez could have a break. Back to laundry, dishes, grocery shopping, and basically, anything else around the house. Thankfully, Red was feeling better, and the doctor told him he could still do little things, so it wasn't quite the slog it had been back in the fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing Red had time for was \"educating\" Fez on American culture so he could take his citizenship test. Laurie was a smidgen worried what that would entail, especially due to all the shouting going on in the garage over the proper pronunciation of \"America\" - \"There is no damn 'D' in 'America'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little stressed when they got to the office, with him trying to remember all the presidents' names, all the capitol cities and that the Vietnam War had been, as Red called it, a \"tie\". However, once he got the desk, he was relieved to find that there was no test to take - he just had to sign his name, and he'd be an official American citizen. Laurie tried to get a glance at his name, but his cursive was a little overdone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was stamped, that was it. He had his green card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now an official Yankee Doodle Dandy!\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie pulled him into a big hug. \"Fezzie, I am so proud of you!\" she squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am proud of me, too, my darling! And I didn't even have to remember Mr. Red's dissertation on 'filthy commies'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! We gotta go out and celebrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we should!\" Fez agreed. \"Come on - let this brand spanking new American take you out to dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh, I like the sound of this already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, no expense spared. I'll give you the finest meal a waiter can buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yeah,\" she said, frowning slightly. But then she smiled again. \"Well, maybe there's a place that's cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You continue to be the woman of my dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that evening, after looking around at all the restaurants in town, they hit the jackpot. There was an all-you-can-eat place on the edge of town. Only ten dollars per person. Laurie stared at the enormous place - it was mostly chinese food, but there was plenty of everything else as well - chicken strips, chicken legs, corn, peas, salad, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...,\" she breathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" agreed Fez as he got them a table. \"All for ten dollars apiece. What a country!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie grinned. \"Thank god I wore a dress,\" she said, licking her lips unconsciously. \"Don't have to worry about unbuttoning any pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she already grabbed a plate and was setting off through the buffet, going from tray to tray, piling up all her favorite foods. She took a long time, gathering as much as she could onto that one plate, which increasingly didn't feel big enough, despite being the size of a hubcap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of essentially hunting and gathering, she joined Fez at their table. Forgetting table manners for a moment, she started eating with her fingers for a while, moaning happily as the flavors cascaded across her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez was naturally unfazed. \"Everything to your liking, my lovely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph!\" Laurie grunted before chewing and swallowing. \"This is the best. And so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big cheesy grin split across Fez's face as he resumed eating his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked a bit as they ate, talking about family, the latest drama in the gang (Kelso was upset at being the Police Academy \"stooge\" while Hyde and Jackie were just... whatever the hell they were), and quizzing on if there were any events coming up that would make a decent date night. Of course, Laurie's number one concern was finishing dinner. She ate with great eagerness, thankfully unencumbered by restrictive clothing. Her dress had plenty of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, however, she finished it all. Although she felt a fullness, she wouldn't have said she was full yet, so she excused herself and walked back to the buffet line with another plate. She reloaded it with all the same foods as before, but now she added extra food simply for the sake curiosity. She took seven minutes to finish, but she soon had it loaded up, and, with another drink from the dispenser, staggered back over to her husband, where they resumed their conversation like she had never left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis became their evening. They would talk and talk about whatever came into their heads, from their childhoods, favorite kid shows to what was the weirdest insect they had ever seen. Somehow, there was always plenty to talk about. The only time they weren't speaking was when Laurie was getting up for another plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amazed her almost. After the second plate, she was feeling full, but she didn't quite feel <i>full</i>. So she went, refilled the plate, came back and had even more food. After the third plate, she was feeling <i>full</i>, but she wasn't really feeling <i>fu-u-u-u-u-u-ull</i>. So she got up for more. By now, however, it had definitely become a waddle. Her stomach was jutting out in front of her like she was nine months pregnant. Pregnant with a food baby. It was so taught and round, you'd think she'd swallowed a bowling ball. She gathered one last plate and carried it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eating was getting slower now, but she didn't mind. She was having a wonderful evening. She ate while Fez talked about something weird that had happened at work with Hyde. She absently consumed while she enjoyed the sound of his voice. In fact, they were talking for so long that she didn't notice when she was out of food. She leaned back in her chair and listened to Fez talk, hands atop her belly, rubbing it up and down. She kind of wished she could reach under her dress and give it a proper rub, but she didn't want to get banned from this wonderful place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were both sitting in content silence, sipping their drinks and enjoying the increasing quiet of the restaurant. It was late now, but it was okay because Fez the next day free, so he didn't have to worry about work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my lovely,\" he said, checking his watch. \"What would you like to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie came out of her food coma at his words and looked around. She looked down at her distended belly and pondered for a moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie rubbed her stomach contentedly for a few seconds, taking in the sights of the emptying restaurant. There wasn't a lot left to enjoy in the main dining section, but there was one section in particular that she realized she'd overlooked: the dessert section. She saw slices of cake, pie, jello, cookies, not to mention several flavors of ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her gut in her hands. Oof - she was already so full. And yet, she could just about taste all of that sugary delectable goodness from their table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind made up, she grabbed her plate. \"Come on,\" she said breezily. \"Let's get some dessert before we head home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez let out a breath. \"Oof, I don't know. I've already eaten enough to - ooooooh, jello! Yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Laurie managed to get up from her chair. Her stomach stuck out so far in front it swung like a pendulum, back and forth, before it finally settled and allowed her to move forward. Enjoying the sensation of her bare thighs rubbing against each other, she grabbed another plate and waddled over to the desserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next seven minutes, Laurie began piling on everything that looked good to her. Some cakes that looked appetizing, some pie that looked delectable, some cookies that looked tasty, and some jello that looked scrumptious. It was the ice cream where she really showed what a pig she was deep down. Eight different flavors to choose from, and she chose about four scoops from each of them, piling them high atop the other desserts she'd gathered. Her mouth was practically overflowing as she carried her enormous feast over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, she grabbed her spoon and tucked in. Ohhhhhhhh, it was all so good! All the different ice creams blended together in her mouth - chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cookie dough, cookies n creme, sherbert, peach and rocky road - and gave her a high one of Hyde's Circles could never achieve. She shoveled it all into her mouth, swallowing it into her already tightly-packed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked through all this, Fez was clearly talking about something. She had listened attentively over dinner, but this was dessert - and she was having trouble focusing over the cascade of sweetness drowning her taste buds. She was half-tempted to just throw the utensils away and just stick her whole face in the food. She began to imagine she was eating a whole pile of dessert out of a trough - like the pig that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. Now she was getting horny. Great. She hoped she wouldn't stain her dress. At least, not until they were in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she had to finish all of this. She'd gotten through the ice cream's outer layer and was now focused on all the now-soaked delectables underneath. She shoved everything she could into her mouth, but she was becoming increasingly aware of how tight her dress was getting. She hadn't dared look at her stomach yet, but she imagined it was bulging something fierce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a solid fifteen minutes to chow her desserts down, but she did. She didn't leave anything behind, save a few crumbs. She even slurped up the melted ice cream. She set her plate down and leaned back, letting out a sensual groan as she did so. She felt was more than full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not just stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt <i>stu-u-u-u-u-u-u-uffed</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally dared to peer down at her midsection. It stretched out so far now - like one of those globes owned by a Bond villain that you could open up, and it'd have booze inside. She rubbed it gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled serenely at the sight. \"Are you ready to depart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie could only nod, letting out a small whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez came around the table and eased his overstuffed wife to her feet. She put an arm around his shoulders and leaned on him, practically being dragged outside and back to the car. She was in too much pain to move much, so Fez helped her with her seatbelt. She thought there was no way it could possibly reach all the way around such a massive gut, but it didn't take long for her to hear the usual click. She felt oddly disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive home was quiet. Laurie had to recline the seat back to sit comfortably. She continued to rub her stomach, feeling out jam-packed it was. She was so utterly and completely stuffed she could barely breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was making her so hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally made it home, and she was relieved to find there was no one home at the moment. Both Red's and Hyde's cars were gone, indicating that everyone was probably out right now. Thank god. She was about to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes to get her inside, but that only made it worse. This was like her immobility dream. Okay, she wasn't so huge she was trapped, but she still had to rely on Fez for movement. He gently helped her get on the bed and got her shoes and socks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you require anything else, my darling?\" he asked, leaning in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...,\" Laurie whispered, wrapping her fingers around his shirt collar. \"... You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew what was happening, she was kissing the living daylights out of him once again. He was clearly surprised, and after a moment, they parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Because movement seems to be a problem for you right now, and I tend to be a bit... movey... when we make love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm damn sure,\" Laurie said in a husky voice. \"I'm so stuffed it's making me crazy. I want you so bad right now, Fezzie. Now get me out of this dress, get those pants off and fuck me like the fat naughty <i>pig </i>that I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's eyes widened, and then an excited grin came across his face as he began to undo his pants. Even when she was blinded by hormones, Laurie couldn't help but swoon over how cute he was when he was excited about sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe insisted on skipping their usual foreplay. She was so aroused, she didn't think she could make it that far. Fortunately, Fez was very good at 'standing to attention' when the need 'arose'. It was amazing. He had gotten better at sex the more often they did - he'd only had sex with one other girl before her - but this was incredible. Having sex while also stuffed like a turkey on Thanksgiving was the most wonderful thing. She arched her back, which only made her belly stick out even more. She rubbed it, listening to the gurgling inside as her massive meal was sloshed around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally came, it was such a relief. She slumped against the bed and gasped for air. \"Holy crap, Fez...,\" she panted. \"Oh my god...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laid there in bed, his arms wrapped around her. She couldn't roll over - still too stuffed for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his hands went down to her enormous belly and began to rub it, and holy moses, that felt good, she thought. His soft gentle hands rubbing circles on her gut. Her enormous big fat gut. Her enormous big fat stuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread across her lips. This was bliss. Utter bliss. Lying in bed, in her man's arms, with a belly stuffed to the point that it seemed to tower over her, and his hands on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only regret was that it had taken this long to get here.</span></div></div>",

She blinked at the sunlight coming through her window and wrapped her quilt around herself against the cold February weather. She rolled over in bed and found not only was Fez not there, but there was a piece of paper in his place. She snatched it up and read that a phone call had come for him that morning. Apparently, one of the morning waiters had contracted food poisoning and couldn't come in for work, so they'd asked to him to come in. He apologized for leaving without saying goodbye, but was too moved by the sight of her so peaceful in her sleep that he didn't have the heart to wake. He would be home by two o'clock, and they'd have the day together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled. While disappointed he hadn't been here, she did appreciate the note and that it would only be a few hours before he was home, giving her time to do chores and have some time to herself. Hopefully, she thought eagerly, that would include a huge breakfast. She rolled over again to get out of bed, but her stomach let out a gurgling sound that indicated that she hadn't quite digested all of her previous night's gorge. She wasn't as full as she'd been, but she was starving either. She ran her hands over her belly and gave it a jiggle. She lifted her top and found there were some lovely new stretchmarks forming along the front and sides. Her smile grew wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she wasn't exactly starving, Laurie was still eager to partake in some breakfast. She got up, changed into something more presentable and made her way down to the kitchen. She found it empty, with Red working on the car in the garage while Kitty was clearly at work. Pleased to have the run of the kitchen, she set to work on her decided meal - a big stack of waffles. She started mixing it together and got out the waffle maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she cooked, she quietly thought about what it would be like to have an apartment with Fez. Just the two of them in their own little love / sex den. She could get a job somewhere, split the rent with him and enjoy the privacy of living alone. Maybe once her dad was fit for work again, she could get on that. Find something where she could sit on her growing ass all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself, she soon finished making her waffles. She found that she had made at least six. That would hold her over til lunch. She quickly began to pour syrup over them, followed by slathering them in a lot of butter, and she sat at the table to eat. She cut into them and had a few bits. Damn, she made good waffles. Maybe she'd make more later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just working through them all when the screen door slid open, and in walked Jackie, who stopped short when she saw Laurie. \"Oh. Hey,\" she said, almost like she'd walked in on something inappropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Laurie said through a mouthful of waffles. \"Looking for Hyde? Probably still downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably,\" Jackie replied, still staring at her as if she was some kind of freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie continued to eat for a few seconds before she realized that Jackie hadn't moved. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked awkward for a moment before taking a tentative step forward. \"Laurie, what's happened to you lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie blinked before swallowing her latest mouthful. \"... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'huh'? Look at yourself! You're blowing up like a balloon! You're eating like a pig! You used to be one of the most attractive women in Point Place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie winked playfully. \"You're not so bad yourself, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie harrumphed and continued. \"And now, you look like just about any other woman in Point Place! What are you doing to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie grinned in amusement. \"Well, I'm retiring from whoring around town, settling down with my lovely husband, helping my family in their time of need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stuffing your fat gut full of sugar and carbs,\" Jackie added disdainfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged. \"Not gonna deny it. I'm enjoying good food where and when I want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And look what it's doing to you! You're a round fat tub of lard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stared at her for a long moment, and Jackie briefly wondered if maybe she'd actually offended her. This thought was laid to rest when the other girl smiled at her with a look previously reserved for every guy she found worthy of intercourse and, lately, reserved for Fez. It made Jackie a teeny bit uncomfortable. Laurie leaned back in her seat and began to rub her huge belly, which somehow looked even bigger than it had when Jackie had chanced a hidden glance at it yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Jackie? Don't think women should have a little heft on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's mouth fell open, and for once, it seemed she'd been rendered speechless. Laurie took advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is bad?\" she asked, indicating her half-finished waffles. \"You should've seen me last night. An all-you-can-eat buffet. I took plate after plate of food back to my table. And I ate it. All of it. Every last bit of it. Getting heavier with each and every trip. Big fat me waddling to and from the buffet lines. My stomach stretching so far in front of me. Everyone must've thought I was pregnant. Just the amount I shoveled down my gaping maw into my enormous stomach. It's a miracle I still fit through the front door when I finished. Fez practically had to roll me to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, still clutching her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that that deterred us from some of the hottest sex I have <i>ever </i>had last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's eyes widened, and her jaw continued to hang open in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie stood up and slowly approached Jackie. \"That's right. Last night, while I was so stuffed I couldn't even think, my husband took me, and he <i>had </i>me. Had me like the fat pig I am. And it was so hot. So sexy. Just that wild crazy sex. Too bad you weren't home. Would've given you and Hyde some ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in until she was whispering in Jackie's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, you and Hyde could never be as hot as we were. Not like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed her round belly against Jackie's flat stomach, causing the younger girl to shiver a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie pulled back and looked her in the eye. \"Anything else to say?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shook her head, clearly rattled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie acquired a bright smile. \"Good! Glad we had this talk! Hyde's downstairs!\" And she happily bounced back to her chair and resumed eating her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie let out a breath she didn't know she'd been holding and scampered off towards the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked and finished up her meal. She'd get started on laundry soon, so she'd definitely enjoy visiting the happy couple downstairs later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie looked herself up and down in the mirror. She had worked hard to find a nice dress that would suit the occasion. After all, it was her first Valentine's Day on an actual date in years, and this was the first time she'd actually cared about the guy she was with. She wanted tonight to be something special. It'd taken some time to find a dress that fit her. She'd ballooned considerably in the past week. Her gut was still protruding from the nonstop binging she'd indulged in of late. The red dress she'd found hugged every delectable pound, showing every roll, and it accentuated her breasts nicely. Her bare arms were nice and thick, and her blatant double chin was jiggling every time she turned her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a word - HOT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her belly a good hard jiggle for luck, she went to the closet and pulled out a coat to wear. It was February in Wisconsin, after all. It wouldn't be spring until sometime in June, probably. She still looked nicely plump with it covering her up. She smirked contentedly before leaving her room to meet her husband in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, she found Fez chatting with Hyde, Jackie and Kelso as they were getting ready to start their respective romantic evenings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and then, Steven's taking me to see <i>Same Time Next Year</i> at the theater,\" Jackie was saying eagerly, looking positively dolled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso frowned. \"Wait... isn't that the one with Hawkeye from M*A*S*H*?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a love story, Michael. Very romantic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about a guy and a girl who are married to other people and meet once a year to have sex,\" Hyde clarified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more to it than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So at no point does Radar come out to announce choppers are arriving?\" Kelso asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up, Michael. Go take Brooke on whatever sad excuse for a date you're going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso squeaked indignantly. \"Hey! We're going to a nice restaurant! And no, there are no crayons on the tablecloth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Fez said, impressed. \"My big handsome buddy's growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, <i>Fez</i>. I'm glad <i>somebody's</i> noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked as she entered the room. \"Hello, children,\" she said passively. \"Everyone got plans tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all turned to see her. Fez, naturally, lit up, while Kelso and Hyde nodded in her direction. Jackie saw her, started to blush and looked away. Laurie held back a grin. Good to know she'd made an impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed over to Fez and gave him a kiss. \"Ready to go, babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready whenever you are, dream boat,\" Fez replied with a sleazy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe matched his sleaze and linked arms with him. \"Nighty-night,\" she said, winking broadly at the others. \"Don't do anything I wouldn't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde raised an eyebrow. \"That doesn't really narrow the field much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I <i>know</i>,\" she replied, sending another sleazy grin his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the bemused look behind his shades, she walked after Fez for the car. He held the door open for her, making her switch from sleaze to blushing schoolgirl. She didn't know how, but somehow, he always made her feel special. She slid herself into the passenger seat and stretched the seat belt around herself. It was still a snug fit, and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were on the road. They chatted about Fez's job, Laurie's chores, amusing anecdotes concerning their friends, and the future. Laurie was still considering finding a job so they could get their own place, so they were going to peruse the want ads to see what they could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, they were going to have a romantic evening. Fez had been saving some money just for this occasion. The restaurant wasn't exactly the fanciest in town. Hell, it wasn't even the fanciest on the block. It was very simple. But it wasn't fast food, which was what Laurie wanted to hear. As much as she loved greasy takeout, she wanted something a bit more savory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was how they discovered a Point Place steakhouse having a two-for-one sale on Valentine's Day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled into the parking lot, and right away, Laurie could smell the delicious smell of meat. Her tummy gurgled with hunger as they got up and walked inside. It was a tad crowded, being Valentines Day and whatnot, but it wasn't a long wait for a table. Once there, it only took a minute for Laurie to know what she wanted - the biggest steak they had with fries, chicken strips and salad on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enjoyed their evening together, chatting through the night, talking about what movies they wanted to see. Fez really wanted to see the Muppet Movie, and she was happy enough oblige as long as they had plenty of candy and popcorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steak was enormous. It took up the whole plate, and it smelled amazing. Her sides took up a lot of room on their respective plates, too. She licked her lips eagerly. Fez really did know how to treat a fat girl right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate in silence, as had become the norm for them. Fez had learned that Laurie was a decent conversationalist until food arrived, at which point, she much preferred to use her mouth for eating. So apart from a few sentence sprinkled here and there to keep things interesting, Fez only spoke when spoken to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie enjoyed the immense steak immensely. Hell, she enjoyed everything. She only wished the place wasn't so pricey so she could eat here every day. So much succulent meat for her growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, her belly was definitely stretching out her dress a bit. Good, she thought. Make it fit better. Because based on the way Fez kept glancing at her, she had a feeling that this was going to be one of his favorite outfits she wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, the way he made her feel. It was like being a teenager again. All giddy and optimistic, like they were going to be together. To think he'd been worried that she'd ever leave him just because he couldn't one hundred percent dedicate his life to her. There were times she honestly didn't feel good enough for him, if only for how devoted and loving he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at him, eating his smaller steak. He'd taken a small so she could have the largest one available. God, she loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made her stop mid-chew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved him. She had actually fallen for Fez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd suspected it for a while now, but now it was really impacting on her. When she'd first met him, she remembered him being the weird little foreign boy her loser brother had befriended. Hell, she remembered the first time they saw each other. He'd exclaimed, \"Who is that goddess?\" At the time, she'd barely registered it. Now, she felt bad for blatantly ignoring him. Granted, she didn't regret not getting with him sooner. She wasn't sure any relationship would've been possible had events not transpired the way they had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished their meal, paid the bill, and he once again had to help his bloated wife to the car. She laid back in the seat and rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm so full,\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along, my darling,\" Fez said cheerfully. \"Let's get you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. This dress has become way too tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, I like where this is heading!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled in the darkness as they pulled out onto the road. She leaned her head over and stared at him. The man she loved. Man, this had been a crazy year. It had started with her normal whoring around the US, and now she was in love with Fez. Still, it made sense. She was the easiest girl alive, and he was the horniest guy. It was like an X-rated fairytale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home, they sat in the car for a few moments. Mainly because they saw Red and Kitty were home, and they didn't want the current romantic spell they were under to be broken. So they just leaned against the seats and stared into each others eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with no prompting whatsoever, Laurie said, \"I love you, Fez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause as the words impacted on his brain, and his mouth fell slack. She briefly wondered if she had timed this utterly wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, much to her immense relief, a big smile split across his face, and he said, \"I love you, too, Laurie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile doubled in size, and she leaned in to kiss him. He pulled her closer, and then, much to her delight, he put his other hand on her full belly. She let out a moan of pleasure as he rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the screen door slamming shut snapped them out of it, and they looked up to see an irate-looking Red and an embarrassed Kitty looking out at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez cleared his throat and quickly put his hands at ten-and-two. \"Yes, well,\" he said, looking straight ahead. \"Perhaps we'd... better go in now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie did her best to fight back a large amused grin, silently nodding in agreement.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Laurie and Fez's relationship settled into something genuine and loving, it soon became clear that if she was going to be with him, she'd have to get used to hanging around the gang all the time. For the most part, this was fine. Although they still sniped at each other, she and Hyde had more or less dialed down from mutual hatred to a grudging respect for each other due to having to help out while Red recovered. Kelso was usually okay with her, having gotten over their affair some time ago, and being consumed with preparing to both become a father and a cop, he was less concerned with restarting anything. Jackie, of course, was clearly still a bit rattled after their kitchen encounter a few weeks ago, but she hadn't said anything to the others, so everything must be fine. Just to mess with her further, Laurie deliberately didn't make eye contact with her for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one thing Laurie found herself doing more often was hanging out with them during one of their more frequent activities - smoking \"killer shit\" in the basement in a circle. Hyde always had some somewhere, and he was always willing to share. Laurie was no stranger to it - she'd been in a few circles before - but this time, she was more of a friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was typically on the couch next to Fez, while Jackie was on Hyde's lap, and Kelso on the lawn chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm the only one here without a girl,\" Kelso pouted. \"I mean, come on. I'm the best looking one here! What's this say about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you're a sad loser who's alienated every woman in Point Place by only wanting them for sex?\" Hyde suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a fair description to me,\" Laurie agreed, munching on some chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not fair! Things are still going well with Brooke! I should be able to bring her here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't bring a pregnant woman to a circle, dummy!\" Jackie objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, just because she's pregnant? That's so prejudiced, Jackie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because the baby's gonna come out all weird if she breathes too much of the smoke, moron,\" Laurie snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and nothing's worse than an ugly baby,\" Fez nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso sulked. \"Fine, but once she has that baby, she's down here all the time, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever,\" Hyde sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie raised an eyebrow in Laurie's direction. \"Might want to give her a chance to lose all that baby weight first,\" she said snidely. \"Munchie's will make her look pregnant forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie narrowed her eyes at Jackie, knowing exactly where the little midget was going with this. Fez, however, spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know...,\" he said casually. \"If it really is love, it doesn't matter what size she is. I mean, Kelso, you still find her sexy even though she's growing in the middle, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso blinked in confusion at the weird direction this had taken. \"Well... sure, I guess. I mean... she's pregnant, so she can't help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you would still be into her if she were fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know... I mean... now that I know her and stuff, I guess... maybe? How fat are we talking here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about as fat as me?\" Laurie asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso started laughing. \"Well, I mean... sure, I guess. I mean, yeah, you've blimped up, Laurie, but you still got that... I dunno... <i>thing </i>about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled, patting Laurie's knee. \"Damn right, she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie gave them both her usual ditzy smile. \"Aww, thanks, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie frowned in their direction. She'd been kinda hoping to embarrass or annoy Laurie, not build her up even more. Feeling her lip go all pouty, she nudged her boyfriend. \"Steven, would you still love me if I was fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shrugged. \"That's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, don't go all zen on me! Give me an answer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde rolled his eyes behind his shades. \"Fine. Jackie - I would still love you no matter what size you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso, Fez and Laurie all put their hands to their chests. \"Awwwwwwwwww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get bent!\" Hyde snapped. \"This is inappropriate circle talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right,\" Fez agreed. \"Let us leave this on the back-burner and talk about something more important. Like the Muppets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, of course, with the effects of the smoke taking full effect, they launched into a heated debate over just what the hell Gonzo was supposed to be, how the Pigs in Space actually breathed and if Jim Henson was using the Electric Mayhem's music to send out government-mandated hypnotic messages. Of course, it then turned to whether or not Kermit and Miss Piggy could ever have a real relationship as a frog and a pig, and then that switched to weather or not Miss Piggy counted as \"plus-sized\" and if that should be a factor, but they all soon forgot what they were talking about when Helter Skelter came on the record player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was over, they were all feeling really mellow and shuffling off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, however, began to feel particularly ravenous. Her appetite had certainly increased in recent months, but this was insane. This was an overriding need to just eat, eat, EAT! She scurried up the stairs to the kitchen and began going through the fridge, looking for anything that looked remotely good - or even just edible. She began to just eat bologna straight from the package. She didn't care about taste right now. She just wanted FOOD! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, though, the bologna was gone, and she had to find something else. She opened a jar of pickles and ate a few of those, but then the ham looked good, and then some juice, and then a few apples... Now she was getting bored with cold food. She started opening the cupboards. There were saltines up there, which she grabbed and proceeded to consume. In the midst of this, she also saw a jar of peanut butter. Oh, jackpot! She opened it, got out a knife and started spreading the peanut butter on the crackers, making them much more delicious, but then also much more difficult to chew and swallow. So she got out the carton of milk and took a few chugs just to get them all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another ten minutes before she'd finished the crackers and was now just spooning peanut butter into her mouth, chasing each one with another chug of milk. The effects of the circle were beginning to calm down, and she was feeling a bit better. But by the time she was almost completely back to normal, she found the jar and carton empty, and she was covered in crumbs and stains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she let out a belch that was so powerful that she jolted backwards from the force. She looked around the kitchen in a daze. \"Phew!\" she cried. She patted her stomach, pleased to see how taut it was. She was going to have to smoke a few more joints with the gang. She liked the effect it had on her waistline. She checked out her silhouette against the wall and admired the bulge of her belly. She gave it a few pats before giving it a hearty slap, enjoying the sound and the sensation it caused. Content that she was full, she set about throwing away the trash and heading into the living room to rest for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, however... </span></div></div>",

She was sitting there, arms crossed, glaring at the TV, feet on the coffee table and looking like a sullen teenager - which she technically was, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're still here,\" she said. \"Thought you went home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jackie grumbled. \"I'm mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. About...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should know! You were there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... For...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sighed theatrically. \"You heard what Steven said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the Muppets uniting against the government?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! He said, 'I would still love you no matter what size you were.' Can you believe him?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie blinked. \"Yeah, what an asshole. Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has the nerve to just sit there behind his shades and just lie to me like that! I know he didn't mean it! Not really! I mean, where does he get off, acting like getting fat is no big deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie crossed her arms and arched an eyebrow. \"Do you want to consider your next words very carefully before I have to re-educate the tar out of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked up at the bulbous blonde and realized. \"Oh... no, I mean... well, I just... How can Steven be okay with me getting fat? I know everyone thinks it's easy being this gorgeous, but it actually takes a lot of work! You know how much food I have to not eat to stay this thin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready feeling tired just listening to the younger girl, Laurie felt compelled to sit back in her dad's chair and pretend she was listening. \"I can't imagine,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! No one can! You know how often I've looked at a pizza and thought I'd love to have more than just my usual half a slice? To go to Fatso Burger and order something other than Diet Rite? To ask them to put something else other than the meat and the veggies on the burger? I would love all of that, but I don't, because I'm not so selfish as to ruin my body and deprive everyone of my perfection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was getting a headache now. She rubbed her temples and thought about how to do something about this. Then, as she considered Jackie's words, she began to get an evil idea, and a sinister grin spread across her face before she managed to reign it in and fake looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have an option here,\" she said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call Hyde's bluff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you know how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's brow furrowed as she tried to figure out where this was going, and then her eyes widened in blatant shock when she figured it out. \"What?! You're saying... I should get fat?! No, I can't! I...! Well, I just can't! I have to stay physically fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for? You quit the cheer squad. You're graduating in a few months anyway. Just kick back and let yourself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but I can't! What if I...? What if I lose Steven?! What if he thinks I'm ugly and doesn't want me anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Laurie scoffed. \"Behind those shades and goofy hair, he loves the crap out of you. Not because you're thin, but because you're Jackie, and no amount of fat is going to change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked. She'd genuinely never considered that before. She was quiet for a little while, trying to figure out what to do. \"... I... You really think he'll still want to be with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I'll bet you anything that he will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I... don't know what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged and went for the phone. \"Well, I'm going to order a large pizza, covered in <i>meat</i>, and <i>cheese</i>, and <i>peppers</i>. I might even get bread sticks - loaded with carbs. You're welcome to join me if you want.\" She was really too full right now for a large pizza, but she figured if she played her cards right, she could trick Jackie into eating most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stared at her for a long moment, and then, in an instant she was on her feet with a steely look in her eye. \"Let's do it,\" she said forcefully. \"Let's fat me up. I'm not leaving until I have to be rolled out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow. \"Okay, this isn't a cartoon,\" she said. \"I mean, it's taken me almost a whole year to get <i>this </i>fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well then, I'm not leaving until I feel slightly bloated and maybe a bit sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Laurie ordered the pizza, with Jackie excitedly pacing back and forth while she made the order. She couldn't help but smirk. She had absolutely no idea what would happen if Jackie got fat - Hyde would probably stay with her, but who knows? She just enjoyed the opportunity to mess with the younger girl a bit. Nothing serious - just plump her up. Maybe make her see that gaining weight was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she happened to gain some weight in the process... Well, she'd just have to live with that. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days went by, and Laurie decided it was time to start Jackie off on the right foot. They picked a day where they were both free, and with kisses goodbye to their respective guys, got into Jackie's lincoln and drove off into town - although Laurie had commandeered the steering wheel on the off-chance Jackie wimped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, she could already tell by looking at her, was a danger of happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Laurie said, breezily. \"We'll start by Waffle House for breakfast. Then run by the frozen yogurt place. Then I'm thinking Fatso Burger for lunch. Maybe some light snacking throughout the day. And then we'll see how we're feeling when dinner rolls around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...,\" Jackie nodded with a considerable deal of uncertainty. She kept tapping her fingers on her leg and peering out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had followed Laurie's instructions to wear something loose. If you were going to acquire mass, you need room to expand. Of course, she didn't really have anything roomy, so she was wearing something that rather hugged her thin-yet-curvy figure. She glanced down at her slim middle and worried. What was going to happen today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie saw the look of apprehension in her eyes. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yeah, I'm fine. Totally down with this. I'm... totally up for getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh... Look, just relax, okay? It's just for one day. It's like we're trying it on for size. We'll see how a day of unbridled gluttony suits you, and if it doesn't, it doesn't. No worries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have to do this,\" she said, trying to convince herself along with Laurie. \"I need to know if Steven really loves me for me, and not just because I'm smoking hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Well, time to put your money where your mouth is! Here we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie gulped as they pulled into the Waffle House parking lot. Theoretically, they could've walked there, but Laurie said they weren't looking to burn calories. They went inside, and right away, they could smell the aroma of breakfast food. It smelled divine. Laurie beamed at the scent, but Jackie was terrified. She followed the other woman over to a booth. She took note of how the blubbery blonde had to take a deep breath to fit behind the table. She peered down a the considerable gap between herself and the table. How long before she had trouble fitting behind tables?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Laurie said, going over the menu. \"Follow my lead, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay...?\" Jackie said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waitress asked for their order, Laurie immediately rattled off, \"I'll have an egg and cheese omelette, two eggs over easy, a double waffle, a side of bacon and a glass of orange juice. Jackie, how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blanched as she realized where this was going. Just the thought of all those calories made her dizzy. \"Er... Same for me,\" she stammered, handing the waitress her menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress smiled politely and took the menus away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" Laurie cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what am I doing?\" Jackie moaned, putting her head in hands. \"I must be crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what's crazy?\" Laurie asked in a low voice. \"Forcing yourself to be thin just because you think it's the only way to be acceptable to men. That's what I thought. That's how I lived. And what did I get? Practically addicted to emotionless empty meaningless sex. Now, I'm not saying I regret most of my decisions. They led me to where I am now. But I really wish I could've discovered this joy earlier. This joy of deciding that, yes, I'm fat, and yes, I enjoy it, and no, it's nobody else's business. If Fez hadn't accepted me, I would've divorced him the minute he had his green card. If Hyde can't accept it, you kick his ass to the curb. We do not need to be validated by others, okay? You have to focus on what you want, and I think what you want is to eat some damn real food. True?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stared at her in shock. She had never seen Laurie so righteous before. She thought for a moment about what she was saying and realized. \"I really do... Sometimes, I look at the others, eating real food... Like, eating cheeseburgers and pizza, and I'm sitting there thinking, 'God, I wish I could enjoy that greasy savory food like they could'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie gave a wicked smile. \"I had a feeling. That's what we're doing. And yes, it's crazy. But who says crazy has to be a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, their plates were set down before them, and they saw the huge mountain of food upon them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie licked her lips and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sat for a moment, considering the aroma. It was heaven in her pert little nostrils. Good lord, she was actually salivating just looking at them. Tentatively, she grabbed her fork and took a small bite of her omelette. \"... Oh my god, it's good...,\" she practically whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl,\" Laurie approved through a mouth full of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, Jackie took increasingly bigger bites. She worked her way through every bit of her breakfast, enjoying the rich flavor and the cholesterol that came with them. They ate in silence - Laurie not wanting to distract her from her work. They just ate and ate for a good fifteen minutes until it was all gone, and all that was left was two stuffed young women in the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie let out a deep breath, letting her belly press against the table edge, gently tapping her fingers on it. \"Yeah, I don't eat here often,\" she said breezily. \"I'm getting to the point I really need a table. Room to breathe, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why'd we come here if you don't fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz it feels sexy,\" Laurie replied, grinning sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blushed. She wasn't sure if she felt sexy right now, but she definitely felt stuffed. Her flat tummy had a slight bulge to it that she couldn't ignore. It wasn't uncomfortable or anything. Just... full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what next?\" she asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie managed to \"uncork\" herself from the booth and led Jackie out the door. \"Come on! Time for frozen yogurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blanched. She was already so full. \"Seriously? We don't even stop to take a breather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. You'll have time to digest in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey plopped down in the car and buckled up. Jackie tried to subtly watch as her driver struggled with the seat belt a bit as the connector was lost somewhere beneath her growing ass. Of course, Laurie always noticed when someone was noticing her, and as per usual, she grinned. \"One day, this could be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the frozen yogurt place took only a few minutes, and they didn't feel anywhere near long enough for Jackie. She was still stuffed from breakfast and didn't know how much more her tummy could hold at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out and entered the restaurant. Right away, Jackie felt nervous. The place was full of people already, snacking and slurping away at their cups of frozen yogurt. She couldn't help but notice the heavier folks, and every derogatory remark she'd ever made against a fat person rang through her head, and she began to feel the beginnings of a guilty conscious weighing on her. Somehow, that guilt and shame opened up a new hole in her stomach, almost like she was making some room. This wasn't just a matter of testing Hyde's loyalty. This was also her way of punishing herself for years of snobbery towards these people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was jerked out of her thoughts when Laurie tugged at her arm and brought her towards the dispensers. \"Okay, the game is simple,\" she said, grabbing two cups and two spoons. \"I got us the 'fixed price' cups, so all you have to do is load up on whatever flavors you want and whatever toppings you desire. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded as she took her cup and spoon. She eyed up the dispensers and the labels over them. Good lord, one of them was cake batter flavored. She forced down that teeny bit of snobbery and let the guilt flood through her mind once again. She followed Laurie closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie immediately started pouring frozen yogurt of many flavors into her cup. She smiled with glee as several different tastes and smells swirled together, forming a steadily growing mountain of dessert. Jackie followed in suit, getting whatever flavors looked good. Her's wasn't quite as tall as Laurie's, but she was making it as close as she dared. She put lots of rainbow sprinkles on hers before she noticed that Laurie was doing sprinkles, chocolate chips and various candies as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were paid for, they sat down at a lone table in a corner. Laurie immediately started eating. She spooned the frozen treat into her gaping maw with such eagerness that Jackie was concerned she would get brain freeze. Steeling her resolve, she started to do likewise. She kept thinking about all the times she'd mocked fat people, and the resulting guilt made her eat faster. She deserved every calorie that clung to her poor little body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the flavors - oh god, the flavors. The richness, the thickness, this was what she'd been missing out on. It was all coming together in her brain. The combination of guilt and desire made her eat even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was about halfway through hers when she saw how fast Jackie was going. She raised her eyebrows, impressed. \"Dang, girl, cool your jets. Actually <i>taste </i>it, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie slowed and looked up like a small child. \"Sorry, it's just... oh my god, it's so good,\" she said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie grinned. \"Oh, I hear ya. Just don't hurt yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued at a much more reasonable pace for the next few minutes. Soon, the cups were empty, and both girls leaned back. Laurie's belly stretched lazily out into her lap, her growing breasts plopped on either side of it. Jackie, while still tiny in comparison, was much more noticeably bloated than before. They sat there in silence, breathing after their latest onslaught. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully, the trip to Fatso Burger took a bit longer thanks to midday traffic, allowing Jackie to digest her morning meals a bit better. She reclined the seat back a bit and put her hands on her slightly swollen middle. She could feel it gurgle and churn, making her squirm uncomfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie glanced over at her from behind the wheel and smirked. \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jackie grumbled. \"As far as I'm concerned, we can stay in this car for the rest of the day. Should be enough time for me to finish digest everything you made me eat this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! Please. That was nothing. Fatso Burger is just a few minutes away. Hopefully, you'll have made some room in the last half hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie winced. She still didn't feel like she could take another bite. But she'd agreed to it. Her determination to tests her boyfriend's devotion was matched by her guilt for fat-shaming people. She heard her stomach gurgle again, and she hoped it was just digestion and not hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, traffic cleared up and Laurie pulled around the corner to Fatso Burger. She licked her lips at the greasy rundown establishment. It may look like crap from the outside, and the inside wasn't all that attractive either, but the food was excellent. Nice and greasy, just the way her belly liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into a space, she led the reluctant Jackie through the doors and inside. Staring across at the minimum wage lackeys behind the counter, she sauntered over and smiled winningly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Fatso Burger. How may I serve you?\" the teenage loser intoned lifelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the Fatso Combo Number 2, with fries and a chocolate shake,\" Laurie said brightly before turning to Jackie, motioning for her to step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie gulped and eyed the menu. She saw the look in the other girl's eye. She knew she wouldn't allow her to order anything much smaller than her. She steeled her resolve and dove in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the Fatso Combo Number 2, no onions, no tomatoes, fries, vanilla shake,\" she said, squeezing her eyes shut in case her brain exploded from the very thought of more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, no such event took place. They paid for their food, and soon, they were sitting at a table and eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love a table,\" Laurie sighed happily. \"Room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded listlessly as she took out the double cheeseburger. Good god, it was huge. How was she supposed to cram all of this into her tiny body? And all those fries? And the medium shake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, how was Laurie doing this? The older woman was eagerly tucking into the burger, letting the juice drip off onto the wrapper. She was dipping her fries into the shake. She showed no signs of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you put it all?\" Jackie asked, still nervously holding her burger. \"How do you still have room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow. \"Who says I have room?\" she sneered. \"I probably only had enough room left for a small fry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how can you push yourself like this? How can you be eating all of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie, trust me. There's always more room. Trust me. You'd be amazed what your stomach can handle. I mean, I've had more experience stretching it to its limits these past few months, but you'll get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded before looking down at the burger again. Still huge. But it smelled terrific. And it looked delicious with all that melted cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took that first bite, and it was like fireworks exploding in her brain - absolutely amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie watched a strange sense of pride as Jackie took another bite. Then a few more, and then some fries, and then a sip of her shake, and then some fries in the shake, and then back to the burger. Slowly at first, but then a bit faster the more she had. She worked diligently at the meal, clearly dead set on finishing it. She ate with all her might. It was inspiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, though, it came to an end. Laurie finished her own lunch in record time. Everything went into her belly, and she leaned back in her seat, her legs spread apart, and her belly peeking out from under her sweater. She sipped absently on what was left of her shake while Jackie continued to work at her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie had slowed down again as the effects of her daylong feast began to catch up with her. She was undeniably full now. Filled to the brim. Barely any room left at all. But she was still working on it. Just a few bites of burger left. Only a few fries. Still half a milkshake, but that could be worked on. She nibbled and chewed, looking incredibly tired. One hand left her burger and placed itself upon her cute little belly. That dress had been pretty form-fitting when she left the house. Now she was starting to look pregnant. She leaned back in her seat and placed her hand atop it. Yes, it looked like she was carrying a smallish basketball under her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long time getting those last few bites down, but at last, Jackie managed it. The burger was gone. The fries were gone. She noisily slurped up what was left of the shake. She slumped back in her chair, utterly and completely stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled lazily, her hands resting atop her own belly. \"Was it good?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie opened her mouth to reply, only to be taken by surprise when a huge gas bubble found an exit path and caused her to release a huge belch that echoed throughout the restaurant, causing a few patrons to stop and look. Her face went beet red as her hand went to her mouth in humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was just as startled as anyone, but she couldn't help but giggle. \"An angel just got its wings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such a weird thing to say that Jackie felt a small smile split her face, and she snorted a small giggle through her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both girls were laughing at the whole incident. It was like all the tension just melted away, and they were just two friends enjoying a day out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that was a 'yes', right? It was good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie caught her breath. \"Yeah, it was good...,\" she said. \"God, I am soooooo stuffed. I don't know how I did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled. \"I'm so proud. Now come on, kid. Let's move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easier said than done. The effects of their gorge were catching up with both of them now, and Laurie found standing a bit difficult. Shrugging off the food coma for just a while, she got to her feet, arching her back so her belly stuck out a little bit - she wanted it right in Jackie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie dazedly stared up at the pale orb that peeked out from beneath the patterned sweater. It was mere inches from her. All that fat and flab. That navel that went way deeper than it should have. The purple stretches marks that encircled it like rippled in a lake. Her thoughts briefly returned to her boyfriend. Could Steven really still love her with a stomach like that? A stomach so big it looked like she'd swallowed a basketball? She really hoped so. She didn't want to lose him. But if he only loved her for being thin and conventionally attractive, then was he even worth hanging onto?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that Laurie was offering her a hand. \"Need help getting up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stared at that hand for a moment before taking it. \"Thanks.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Throughout the entire car ride, Jackie's hands cradled her stuffed stomach. It bulged so badly she was certain she would bust at some point. Her poor dress was so strained, she was worried breathing too deeply would pop a stitch or three. She couldn't muffle a moan that escaped from her lips as the car rounded a corner, causing her contents to slosh around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unnnnnnnnnnngh...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded. \"I hear ya,\" she agreed, steering with one hand and clutching her gut with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going now? Are we going to the buffet to finish ourselves off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Laurie replied, turning again, this time into a driveway. \"Now we're going to kick back and relax a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sat up in the reclined seat and looked around. She saw they were in the Formans' driveway. She'd been so dazed, she hadn't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women heaved themselves out of the car and waddled inside. They saw Kitty was at the kitchen counter, cleaning away. She smiled brightly when the two girls entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there you girls are!\" she chirped. \"Was wondering why it was quiet! Where've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie attempted a bright fake smile but was too tired for the required energy. \"Oh, you know!\" she said. \"Just lunch. Girl talk. Stuff like that. Right, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie fought to hold down another belch. \"Yeah, we -hic!- just had lunch together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just wonderful! I'm so glad to see you girls getting along! Jackie, will you be staying for dinner tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie tried not to look too ill. She glanced at Laurie, who raised an eyebrow. \"Yes. Yes, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wonderful! You know, when Eric left for college, I thought this house would just feel so empty. It's such a relief that you kids are stilling around, but don't tell Red I said that, okay? Ha ha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, mom,\" Laurie said, trying to hold down a belch of her own. \"We're just going to hang out in my room for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go right ahead, dear,\" Kitty smiled. \"I'll let you know when dinner's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Laurie and Jackie scurried past her and upstairs, into Laurie's room. They shut the door and sighed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, your mom can talk,\" Jackie moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Laurie groaned, heading for the bed. \"I swear, she can turn a two minute conversation into six years.\" She collapsed flat on her back, causing her belly to jiggle and wobble furiously, and also causing her too-tight sweater to ride up, exposing the great orb in all its splendor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stared blankly at the sight. The bloated blonde was sprawled out on the bed, legs draped over the side, and her massive gut sticking out and over the waistband of her stretch pants. She watched as it rose and fell with ever labored breath. She bit her lip and slowly approached. \"... You okay?\" she asked, hovering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie peered up at her, causing her subtle double chin to be very much less-than-subtle. She smiled, showing just how full her face had become. \"Better than okay, kid,\" she said. \"I'm frikkin' stuffed! I should've invited you for a town-wide gorge a long time ago. This is the best I've eaten in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she let out that belch she'd been fighting back, letting it rip across the room with such a ferocity that it seemed to shake the windows. At the very least, it made Jackie jump back in fright. Relieved, she let out a sigh and began rubbing her exposed belly, a cheerful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie couldn't help but be a bit envious. Not necessarily of Laurie's weight, but of how content she looked. From the offset, she looked like a beached whale. To stuffed and bloated to move. But she saw the look of utter contentment, the absolute pleasure, and she wondered if at any point in <i>her </i>life, she'd ever been that satisfied. Hell, she wasn't all that certain that <i>sex </i>had made her <i>that </i>satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of the day's gorge caught up with her again, and she clutched her increasingly sore middle. \"I ate too much...,\" she whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie mock-pouted. \"Awwww, poor baby! Come lie down!\" She patted the space on the bed beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded and laid out on the bed, similar to how Laurie was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now just lie there and rub that poor little tummy,\" Laurie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie did so, silently rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just drift off into a deep sleep so that all that food can become nice thick glorious <i>fat</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's eyes widened at instinctual horror. She peered down (or up) at her round belly, still gurgling as it digested, and she felt a feeling that she was on the precipice. She'd been wrestling with it all day - to gain weight and see what happened, or to stay thin and, therefore, within her comfort zone. The massive part of her brain that was a shallow high school girl told her to stay comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that other slowly-growing part of her brain was telling her to ride it out. That a few extra pounds were no big deal. That she could lose the weight if she really wanted to. That today had been one of the most satisfying days of her life as she'd finally tossed out the cheerleader diet and made a proper pig of herself. She wasn't sure if she would ever find it sexually appealing like Laurie, but then, Laurie found a lot of things sexually appealing. Hell, maybe that was part of it. Now that she'd settled down and stayed with Fez, she had to channel that massive sex drive into something else, and that something else turned out to be food and gaining weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie observed her stomach again. She wasn't sure what she felt at the moment - too many conflicting emotions for that - but for now, she'd had a really good day, and the dull pain in her belly had been slowly replaced by a great comfortable fullness that was making her eyelids very heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced across to Laurie, only to find the older woman had dozed off, hands fallen to the sides of her gut as it rose and fell with every soft snore. Deciding that was a very sensible idea right now, Jackie pulled herself up all the way onto the bed and got a pillow to rest on. She rolled onto her side, feel the day's feast shift within her belly. Unable to help her curiosity, she lifted her dress up a little to observe just how big her stomach actually was. She saw how it poked out, clearly swollen from her gorge. She ran a hand over the bare skin and shivered. It was so taut. So stretched. And it was... nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hand still on her belly, she let her eyelids slide shut, and she joined Laurie in their food coma.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie had drifted off at some point during the thirty seconds between lying down on the bed and cradling her stuffed gut. Her head lolled over and her hands flopped at her sides, and she twitched slightly as she dozed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie woke up in the middle of a large dimly-lit room. She saw that it was dim because it was only lit with candles on tall metal stand and plinths. From what she could make out, it was a gothic-themed room, with bricks and stone floors and gargoyles leering at her from the walls. She blinked her eyesight better, finding that it was a chair. It was a large wooden chair with a cushioned seat and back with nice sturdy armrests, and it was at the end of a long dining table. What confused her was that this was the only chair in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard footsteps from the shadows, and into the light stepped Fez. Except it wasn't quite Fez. The usual warmth and cheery persona seemed to have been replaced by something far more... sinister. He peered up from beneath his lowered brow and smiled in her direction. \"Laurie, my love...,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez...?\" she asked, feeling a tiny bit afraid. \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you most desire, my dear,\" he replied. \"As your husband, it is my duty to bring you love and pleasure. Tonight... I am all about pleasure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow. \"Oh, are you?\" she asked. She knew sometimes Fez tried to sound badass when trying to seduce her, which tended to be eye-roll-worthy yet still amusing enough to at least be cute. Now, she actually believed he was capable of what he said. \"And... how do you intend to pleasure me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez gestured to the lone chair at the end of the table. \"Have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew something was going on. Swallowing, she approached it, checked it over a few times, and then sat down, pleased to find that at least it was comfortable. She scooted her cushioned ass to the cushioned seat and settled down, leaning back and putting her hands upon the hand rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez crouched down so he was eye level with her. \"You trust me, don't you, my love?\" he asked, still as wicked as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked at him, intrigued. \"... Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled. \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clicking sound, and Laurie was taken off guard by some plastic clamps that suddenly seemed to appear from nowhere and restrain her wrists to the chair. She let out a yelp and struggled to get away, but it was too late. She was trapped. \"Dammit! What the hell, Fez?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Fez simply put a finger to her lips, somehow silencing her instantly. \"Shhhhhh...,\" he soothed. \"Do not panic, my darling. I am here to pleasure you. And I do hope it is... pleasurable.\" He began to giggle at his 'joke'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye roll time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the laughter stopped, and Fez clapped his hands twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen... Laurie saw that something had appeared on the table in front of her. To her amazement, it was a full banquet. Plates and platters, all crammed with food. All kinds of food. Every single food group was represented in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez...,\" she breathed, hit by the aroma. \"How...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez patted her shoulder. \"You've been a naughty little piggly wiggly, Laurie,\" he teased. \"Now... it's time for you to face punishment for your gluttonous ways. And I shall administer that punishment now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie could already feel herself becoming turned on at the very thought. \"Ohhh, Fez...,\" she hissed, wishing she had a hand free to at least reach down and take care of this problem. \"Punish the <i>fuck </i>outta me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled and picked up a large turkey leg to Laurie's face. Without any direction, she bit into it, chewing it, loving it. The meat, the juice, the smell, the everything. She let out a moan of pleasure and bit into it again. \"So good...,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ahhhh,\" Fez scolded. \"No talking with your mouthful. Such a naughty little piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink, oink,\" she replied, before resuming her consumption, and in a few seconds, the meat was gone, and Fez was holding a bare bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed it aside and grabbed a hotdog with all the trimmings. There seemed to be a whole plate of them. She opened her mouth wide and allowed it to be shoved entirely into her mouth. She didn't even have to chew this time. She just swallowed it whole, feeling it slide down her throat and into her stomach. Then came all the others - each one shoved whole down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fez presented her with a line of sausage links. Licking her lips, she allowed the first one to be placed in her mouth, and then she started sucking them down like a spaghetti noodle. For a while, she wasn't sure she could do it. There were just so many. But she determinedly sucked them all down into her gut in one single, albeit prolonged, breath. She sighed rapturously in her seat and leaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was a tray of hamburgers. Fez took them and hurled each one like a frisbee. Instinctively, she moved her head in each direction the burger flew, catching each one in her mouth and gulping it down. She didn't even bother with tasting right now. She just wanted to swallow them all down into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all twenty of those were gone, Fez tossed the tray away and walked over to her, patting her belly, which had doubled in size during that particular gorge. \"My, my, you're such a little fatty, aren't you, Laurie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie whimpered at the touch. \"Oh, I am, Fezzie,\" she moaned. \"I'm such a huge hungry fatass. My belly is super-full. Oh god... Don't stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smirked. \"It will never stop, my dear. <i>Never</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers, and to Laurie's surprise, all the plates in the room began to rise up, hovering unsteadily above the long table. She gaped at the sight. There was still so much to finish. They all started floating towards her, circling her from all directions, and each bit of food then rose off its plate and into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome sandwiches forced their way in. Some bananas unpeeled and launched themselves like torpedoes down her throat. A large bag of popcorn fired like artillery until it was emptied. A plate of fresh chocolate chip cookies paraded single file into her mouth. An entire ice cream sundae dropped from the ceiling into her upturned mouth, splattering everywhere, but mostly inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, her stomach was still slowly growing. Now even larger, Laurie realized it was so big she was having trouble seeing over it. It stretched and grew, wider and higher. She heard a loud splintering crack, and the chair's armrests suddenly burst off, freeing her hands. Rather than escape, however, she settled for rubbing the gigantic swell of a belly in her lap. She re-positioned herself. so that she could see into the room around her, and she found when she hunched over, it rest on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez tutted. \"Dearie me, that was an antique. You naughty little piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie panted as she hefted the humongous belly beneath her, leaning closer to the table. \"I am, Fez. So naughty. Oh god, I need more. I want to be bigger. So much fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a long straw suddenly stuck itself in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish is my command,\" Fez replied, gesturing to a huge keg of beer that had just materialized nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie's eyes widened as beer suddenly started flowing into her stomach. She could feel herself blowing up like a waterbed, listening to it swish and gush inside her. Her stomach stretched and groaned as it grew in size, and to her alarm, her feet were lifted off the ground as it grew large enough for her to rest on top of it. It bounced like a rubber ball, and as it grew, she rose higher, but she held onto the straw for dear life, practically crying out for more as she guzzled all that she could from the seemingly endless stream of beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she saw something front of her that made her stop. It was a large chocolate layer cake, sitting all by its widdle wonesome on the table, just in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...,\" Laurie purred. \"Come here, you sexy thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the straw aside, she kicked and rolled over, listening to her stomach slosh and gurgle beneath her. She allowed herself to roll back a bit so her feet touched the ground just long enough to force herself forward. Once close enough, she kicked her feet off the floor again and rolled forward, only to fall face first into the cake with a splat. Rather than grumble, she simply started eating. She grabbed the cake with both hands and ate that cake as fast as she could. She grabbed huge chunks and stuffed them in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, it was done. The cake was eaten. She dusted her chocolate-smeared face and licked her hands clean. \"Ohhhhhhh,\" she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt someone grab her back and found herself roll backwards a bit, away from the table. She groggily looked ahead at Fez, and now, instead of the sinister fellow he'd been at the beginning, he was now warm and loving again. \"Hello, my little beluga whale,\" he said sweetly. \"Are you feeling full yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked at him for a long moment before a small smile split her chocolate-stained lips. \"... Never...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned in close. \"That's my piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips met his, and she leaned into him. He placed his hands upon her enormous belly, as did she. Four hands, all rubbing that enormous orb she was mounted upon. Totally immobile. Totally helpless. Totally happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stirred and woke up, finding herself with her dress up over her rounded tummy on Laurie's bed. Lowering it down again, she glanced around and saw Laurie was still where she was. But now, to her surprise, she Laurie's hand had disappeared down the front of her pants, and she had an impish little smile on her face, and she seemed to be groaning Fez's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing bright red, Jackie quickly got up and fled the room. Best let her have her dream for now.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Laurie awoke, she was sorely disappointed, although she had to admit - she was glad she could actually move in the real world. She looked around the room and found she was alone. Jackie must've gone to do something. <i>She better not have left the house</i>, she thought grumpily. With a considerable grunt, she rolled herself into a sitting position, looking at the round belly sitting in her lap. Not as big as in the dream, obviously. In fact, with the dream in her mind, she looked downright skinny. But she placed her hands on either side and playfully slapped it, smiling faintly. Maybe someday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the clock and was surprised it was now almost evening. She sniffed the air, and immediately, she was picking up the scent of dinner being made. She stepped out of her room and scurried down the stairs, jiggling the whole way. She arrived in the kitchen just as Kitty was carrying some plates to the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Laurie! Good! Can you give me a hand with some of these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie's eyes were blazing at the sight. Ham, veggies, corn, mashed potatoes... It all looked so good. And there seemed to be enough to feed a small army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or me</i>, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried some plates into the dining room, where Red, Hyde and Jackie were all sitting. Good, Jackie was staying after all. She smiled sweetly at her, which was replied by a small awkward smile and little eye contact. Undeterred, Laurie set the dishes down and sat opposite the couple while Red and Kitty were at either end. She plopped her considerable rump into her seat and joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard from Eric,\" Kitty said enthusiastically. \"He says he's looking into the university's teaching program! Isn't that exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Laurie said as she started shifting food onto her plate. \"They say those that can't do, teach. And there's just so much that he can't do, he'd be a natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis elicited a few snickers from around the table, but Kitty frowned. \"Now Laurie, be nice. Your brother's finding some direction in his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for once, it's not to a sci-fi convention,\" Red added. \"God, that better not be what he teaches. Imagine a whole class devoted to that Star Wars crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Red, come off it,\" Kitty scolded playfully. \"You liked Star Wars when you saw it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde, Jackie and Laurie all looked at him, surprised amusement on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Hyde asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did not. I just liked the explosions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like father, like son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, Mr Forman, that's so sweet,\" Jackie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed rolled his eyes and began moaning about having \"too many dumbasses\" in his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, Laurie made eye contact with Jackie, and dropped the subtle hint that she was supposed to be eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sighed and began to ladle food onto her plate. She knew she would have to match Laurie's amount, which was still growing at the moment. They both piled their plates high until they had matching enormous piles. She wasn't stuffed like she was earlier, but she wasn't exactly starving either. She winced as she wondered what Hyde must be thinking right now. God, he probably thought she was such a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hyde wasn't saying anything. He just went about his dinner, chatting with the Formans, throwing in whenever he had a sarcastic quip to give or some social commentary to expel. He didn't seem to notice that his girlfriend had loaded her plate with at least a pound of Mrs. Forman's cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath to settle her nerves, she began to eat. It was such a relief to be eating something homecooked instead of that greasy takeout. It hadn't been bad, but it made her feel less ill. Real food. Actual food. Cooked food. You couldn't beat it. She found eating it much easier than eating at Fatso Burger. She was pleased to find that this was a meal she didn't really mind having too much of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, of course, didn't care what the food was. As long as she was eating, she was satisfied. She shoveled food into her mouth without giving it much thought. She couldn't help but draw parallels between this and her former sex life. She'd had sex with any guy set in front of her, not caring anything about them except their package size. Just sex and then move onto the next one. And that's how she was at meal time. Just eat and move on to the next one. Smiling at the very thought, she continued eating. This was probably healthier in the long run anyway, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening continued as everyone finished dinner. Laurie and Jackie stuffed themselves silly and were soon leaning back with protruding bellies and contented looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my!\" Kitty said, taking away the dishes. \"Hardly any leftovers! I'll have to make this more often! Aha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed kissed on her the cheek. \"Excellent dinner, Kitty,\" he said. \"I'm going to my chair for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adults departed, and Hyde got his sunglasses back out. \"Time to go downstairs and watch Hawaii 5-0. You in, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded sleepily. \"Only if you don't mind me falling asleep on you,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde grinned. \"Sounds good to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and, without saying a word, helped Jackie to her feet. Laurie caught a glimpse of her stomach as she stood. Lord, how it bulged. After a day like today, of course it would. She looked pregnant in that skin-tight dress. She was impressed she hadn't popped a stitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie caught sight of Laurie smirking at her and nodded. She needed to lie down and digest this mound of a belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie got up from the table and groaned at the feeling of fullness. God, it was hard to remember a time when she wasn't stuffed in some way. She waddled off back to bed for another food coma. She still remembered her dream and smiled, hoping that maybe she could live through it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as she was getting comfy, the door suddenly opened, and in walked Fez with a few bags in his arms. \"Good evening, my lovely! I am home!\" he announced cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled sleepily at him. \"Oh hey, hubby,\" she said, lying back on the bed. \"How was work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was fine. I brought home leftovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, Laurie like! Whatcha got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some pork chops, some cherry pie...,\" Fez pulled out a familiar bottle, \"... and your favorite ranch dressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fezzie, you know how to treat a girl right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the best for you, my angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie practically swooned. It wasn't just that he said those things. It was that he actually meant them. The sincerity alone was enough to make her heart go all a-flutter. She took the bottle from him, unscrewed the top and immediately began to chug it. After a few hearty swallows, she lowered it and licked the remnants off her lips. \"Mmmmm, ranchy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jackie had a lovely evening with her Steven, snuggled up on the ratty old basement couch, watching old TV together. Of course, she made good on her promise to fall asleep, where she ended up staying for a few hours. She was awoken a bit later when the last late evening drama ended, and he'd nudged her awake, letting her know that if they wanted to have any sex, they ought to have it now. Sadly, she was still too full, not too mention sleepy as hell, and she also had school to go back to the next day. High school only had a few months left, and she wanted to graduate on time. He was naturally opposed to her going to high school and get her head filled with \"government-mandated facts\", but of course, he was a gentleman and accepted her desire, so they settled for a nice make out session before she said goodnight and headed home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still lived at the Pinciotti house, even though Donna had long-since moved away. Bob was a very accommodating host, although things had gotten weird since he and Joanne had gotten back together. She liked Joanne fine, but she was practically living with them now, and there were times when she could hear... noises... from the next bedroom. Shuddering to herself, she walked into the house, finding the kitchen empty. She did, however, notice a note on the fridge. Apparently, it was Bob's turn to stay over at Joanne's, but he said he'd made her lunch for school tomorrow. She smiled - it was nice to have a parent who actually cared. Her parents had been very distant in the caring department, often just throwing money at her to make her happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that unhappy thought, she turned towards the fridge and gave it a long look. Should she get something to eat? Maybe just some juice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed her reflection in the window. Her belly still poked out under her dress. Clearly, she wasn't done digesting today's utter onslaught. God, she'd made a pig of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fridge continued to stand there, taunting her. After a moment, she finally gave in and peered inside. She smiled at a huge dish of macaroni and cheese that was just begging to be snacked on. Delighted, she grabbed a spoon, took the dish and skipped into the living room to watch some TV. Carson was just coming on. She had time to at least watch the monologue, a sketch and maybe some of the first guest, depending on who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mac n cheese was cold, but she didn't mind. It was delicious no matter what. Clearly, it had been made recently. She snacked away on it, enjoying the show and relaxing a lot. She couldn't help smiling a bit as she thought about her night with Steven. So far, he hadn't been grossed out by the amount she ate or how round her stomach was afterwards. Still, it was only the beginning. It was still too early to tell what his ultimate reaction would be. Just thinking about it made her unconsciously eat faster. By the time the monologue was over, she was surprised to find that she'd already eaten half its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by how much she'd just put away in a few minutes, she figured maybe it was time to stop eating. She took it back to the fridge, only to then let her eyes fall upon the freezer door. Unable to resist, she popped it open and saw there were a few frozen sweets inside - specifically, ice cream. Rocky Road, Cookie Dough, Strawberry... There were so many, surely Bob wouldn't mind if she took one. She nabbed the Strawberry - figuring he'd be less annoyed by that - and started eating it with her spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was halfway through the pint when she once again caught sight of herself in the window reflection, and she stopped. She looked at herself, spoon halfway to her mouth, belly protruding outwards like she was pregnant... She quietly put the lid back on the carton and put it back in the freezer, feeling oddly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to go upstairs and get ready for bed. She got out of that too-tight dress and into a big t-shirt. She was just brushing her hair in front of the mirror when she caught sight of some of the pillows lying on top of her bed. She had loads of pillows. She could never understand Donna only having the one. Decoration was important - even on the bed. She looked at them all with their varying shapes and sizes. Then she looked down at the roomy t-shirt she had on, feeling curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nabbed one of the smaller pillows and tucked it under her shirt, slipping into a pair of flannel pajama bottoms as well to support it. She posed a bit before the mirror, like a runway model. It wasn't the most natural shape, so it didn't really present an accurate representation of a fat belly. So she pulled it out and studied them all. She settled on her usual bed pillow - long, fluffy and rectangular. First, she had to figure out how to wear it. She tried vertically, but from straight on, she didn't look any wider. So she turned it horizontally so it wrapped around her middle. That looked more accurate. She posed back and forth around the room - hands on hips, hands on tummy, back arched, etc. All the standard poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing she couldn't help noticing was that she still looked cute. In fact, she looked damn cute. Somehow, even with a wider frame, she still looked like Jackie Burkhart - just a Jackie Burkhart with a big belly. She patted it, starting to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, her eyes then fell on the clock, and she saw it was getting late. She needed to be up and ready in time for school. With some reluctance, she pulled the pillow out from under her shirt and put it back on the bed, getting under the covers. She drifted off to sleep thinking that maybe being a bit fatter wouldn't be so bad after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, the weeks spun on. Once a week, depending on how their schedules lined up, Laurie would take Jackie out for a day of feasting. They mixed it up a bit, sometimes going to fast food or pizza places, but other times, going to nice places with cloth napkins and everything. Jackie at least enjoyed the chance to go out and enjoy something \"cultured\" for a change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was awkward, however, when she started to notice that the food was really starting to effect her waistline. She had a very long way to go before she caught up with Laurie, but the changes were starting to become more noticeable. Her belly was rounding out, her butt was getting bigger, her breasts were filling out, and her arms were expanding enough that she didn't feel comfortable in short sleeves anymore. She felt really self-conscious. It was one thing to be doing this in the privacy of her own home, but now she was out and about where everyone could see her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how Laurie did it. The bloated blonde didn't seem to care how big she got, not to mention how big she was still getting. She ate what she wanted, when she wanted, where she wanted. She seemed to acquire tunnel vision whenever she was out in public, making a gluttonous pig of herself. She shoveled away whatever was put in front of her, regardless of any judgemental stares she received. How the hell did she get that confident? But then, Laurie had always been confident. That was how she had so brazenly made her way through life with only a wink and a sexy smile - not to mention whoring her way through town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie, on the other hand, was a walking talking cloud of nervous shouting trying to hide the fact that she was scared of what people might think of her if she didn't. That bitchy personality was part of an elaborate defense program to disguise the fact that she was really scared to be vulnerable. It was why she believed more in fairy tale romance than real adult romance - because love was just so much better when it was scripted. Of course, it was difficult when guys wouldn't follow the damn script she had prepared for them. Michael hadn't followed it, going on cheating on her several times. Steven, however, rarely, if ever, tried to follow it, preferring to ad-lib his way through the daily scenes. It was something that had drawn her to him. He rarely put up with her crap, and that had forced her to be more real with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably why she was so scared she was going to lose him. She didn't want to lose that realness she'd found. What if he really didn't still want her after gaining a hundred pounds. She hadn't yet, but she'd weighed herself recently. It was a gain of ten pounds. Ten whole pounds. Ten more pounds of Jackie Burkhart in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she thought, there's just more glorious me to go around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure if she actually believed that, but it made her feel better about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, it had finally become May, and that meant that Eric and Donna's wedding was coming up. They'd heard bits and pieces of the wedding plans in the postcards and phone calls from Madison, but things between the engaged couple were strengthened by being together in college. Jackie had, of course, been selected to be the Maid of Honor, while Laurie had agreed to be a bridesmaid. They would need to find a few more bridesmaids as well. Brooke's name had been bandied about, but they still hadn't had a confirmation yet - seeing as how she was seriously getting really pregnant at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Laurie were both lounging on the couch, enjoying some Saturday afternoon lunchtime. Laurie had obtained some sub sandwiches, and they were both eating them in front of the TV. Big frothy root beers sat on the coffee table - upon coasters, of course, lest Kitty had a conniption. Laurie had long since finished hers and sat with her full belly in her hands. Jackie was about halfway through. She wasn't about to rush herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Kitty came bounding into the living room doing a happy little jig. \"Eric just called! He and Donna are coming home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow. \"Did they flunk out already? Even I lasted longer than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty shot her a stern look. \"No, they didn't flunk out! The semester's over! They're coming back for a few weeks! Oh! And that means more wedding preparations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sat up. \"Oh god, I hope Donna picks out decent bridesmaids dresses. And it better not be anything green.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew,\" agreed Laurie. \"Trust Donna to pick out something ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, girls,\" Kitty admonished. \"Donna makes the decisions. A happy bride is a... happy bride.\" She hurried back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked down at her rounded belly worriedly. \"Oh god... I hope the dresses are fat-friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie waved her off. \"Ehh, they'll measure us in all the right places. Accommodate the extra... space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Donna gonna say when she sees my measurements?! What if she laughs at me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what? Gaining weight? Why would the 'look-at-how-feminist-I-am' Donna mock you for gaining weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean... I used to mock her for her size before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna was never fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to me, she was huge. I was tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you've acquired some actual mass. Your width will match her height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie held her head in her hands. \"Not helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just suck it up. She's not going to make fun of you. And even if she does, so what? You think I get through each day without some loser shouting some fat-related insult at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure. People roll down their car windows to call me a 'fatass' or a 'whale'. Just give em the figure and move on. If they can't accept it, move on. Their tiny narrow little minds can't handle the sight of something outside of their idea of beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Laurie put a hand on her knee. \"Hey, yes, you can. Believe me. You're tough. You're strong. You're Jackie freakin' Burkhart, and you don't take shit from anyone. Notably me,\" she added with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked at Laurie's plump face and saw the genuine kindness and support in it. Who would've thought it would've taken gaining fifty pounds to make her into a decent human being? A small smile worked its way onto her face. \"Thanks, Laurie. I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone was excited when the familiar Vista Cruiser pulled up in the driveway a few days later. Red, Kitty and Bob were there to greet their returning children for their summer break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde and Kelso went outside straight away to join the reunion, but Jackie held back with Laurie and Fez in the kitchen. She was still feeling self-conscious about her recent weight gain and not sure what Donna would say when she saw her. She paced back and forth behind the fridge. \"Oh god oh god oh god oh god...,\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, will you please just chill?\" Laurie admonished. \"You're gonna wear a groove in the linoleum, and that's just gonna make it harder for me to sweep in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, I just... I'm just nervous. I'm ten pounds heavier than when they last saw me. What will they think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That there is more of you to love?\" Fez suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. Eric hates me. He'll make fun of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come on. Don't be like that,\" Laurie replied. \"Eric's not that kind of guy. He likes you deep down. Besides, if he ever said a negative word about it, Donna and Hyde would beat the shit out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai, this is true,\" Fez agreed. \"And he bruises like a banana, so he will not take that chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie continued to wring her hands awkwardly, even as she heard voices and footsteps heading towards the house. She shrank back into the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked in through the kitchen door, followed by Hyde and Kelso, and was immediately grabbed by an enthusiastic Fez. \"Eric, you have returned home to us!\" he cheered, hugging the skinny college student so hard his ribs squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! Hey, Fez,\" he grunted. \"Good to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked at the expression on her brother's face as his friend squeezed the life out of him. She put a hand on her husband's shoulder. \"Okay, sweetie, don't snap him in half. He's so brittle, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks, sis,\" Eric grunted as he righted himself. \"Glad to see you didn't destroy the house in the past nine months we've been away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled. \"I missed you, too, little brother,\" she said, suddenly pulling him into a hug as well, with similar results as the previous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Eric grunted. \"Did everyone get stronger while I was gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, or you've gotten scrawnier,\" Hyde deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we didn't think that was even physically possible,\" Kelso sniggered. \"Do you even cast a shadow anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie released her brother. \"At least your continued scrawniness is a testament to how hard you're working in college. Good to know all the wasted nights doing laundry and dishes on your behalf weren't for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You truly are a saintly woman, my love,\" Fez swooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled at the corny line. \"Oh, get over here, if you're gonna talk like that,\" she said, wrapping her arms around Fez and kissing the snot out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, Hyde and Kelso quietly observed the prolonged impromptu make out session, trying to find the wallpaper interesting to distract themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric jerked his head at the couple. \"Still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shrugged. \"We're all pleasantly surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... So where's Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie and Fez broke the kiss and glanced over at the fridge, but of course, Jackie had disappeared. Her nerve had clearly faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's here somewhere,\" Laurie sighed. \"Probably downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am afraid she is feeling a little subconscious lately,\" Fez said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Self</i>-conscious sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie? Jackie <i>Burkhart</i>? Self-conscious?\" Eric asked, sounding a tad disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, she's porking out,\" Kelso said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde promptly slugged him on the arm, causing him to yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! I meant it in a nice way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie put a hand on Eric's shoulder. \"Look, Jackie's gained... a little weight,\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric raised an eyebrow. \"How 'little'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter? She's feeling insecure about it, so even though it violates the laws of nature, you need to be nice to her, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else,\" Hyde added, holding up the still-clenched fist he'd just used to hit Kelso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shrugged. \"I wouldn't dream of mocking Jackie for her appearance,\" he replied. \"Her taste in music, TV, movies and magazines, certainly, but not her appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde looked at him for a long moment before nodding in acceptance. \"Okay, as long as it's the same stuff the rest of us mock her for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and to be fair, she gives as good as she gets,\" Kelso added. \"Last week, she criticized me for watching <i>Starsky and Hutch</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that girl has no sense of poetry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"Well, thanks for being understanding, Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure. I mean, I can't really afford to be judgemental anyway, considering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the screen door slid open, and in walked Donna. All eyes turned to take in the sight of the redhead, and Fez and Laurie felt their eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had put on weight. And not just a bit of weight. A lot of weight. She had a noticeable gut, an undeniable double chin, some impressive-sized boobs, and a backside that wobbled back and forth as she walked. Her eyes were a bit downtrodden from what they assumed to be embarrassment, but a small hopeful smile sat upon her face as well as she held out her arms awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey, guys!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez managed to relocate his brain and broke into a smile. \"Donna, you have returned as well! Happy day for Fez!\" he cried, running across and hugging the bejeezus out of her. Donna, of course, felt no ill-effects from said hug, simply hugging the happy little foreign man back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Fez! I missed you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez pulled back. \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pulled a package of Twizzler out of her pocket and handed it to him. His eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, candy! I missed you, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked at the candy her husband had better be sharing later. \"Hey, future-sister-in-law,\" she said, approaching coolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked at the sight of Laurie. She had not been expecting to see how much Laurie had ballooned since they'd last seen each other at Thanksgiving. She'd been plump then, but holy cow - she'd ballooned up impressively. \"... Laurie!\" she exclaimed. \"You're... It's so good to see you!\" she faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes at the lame save, but gave her a hug all the same. \"You're looking good,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pulled away, her face red. \"Yeah, well... I don't know. I mean, I know I've gained some weight, and it shouldn't be a big deal. It's just... y'know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie put a hand on the other woman's shoulder. \"Donna, relax. It's just a different kind of sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso nodded. \"Yeah, I mean, you should see Brooke. She's almost nine months pregnant, and she's still smokin' hot. I never knew fat chicks could still be so alluring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna raised an amused eyebrow. \"'Alluring'? That's a big word for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He and Brooke mostly hang out at the library,\" Hyde supplied. \"He likes to let us know when he's learned a new word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed. \"I'm just dreading seeing Jackie. You just know she's going to be super-critical about this, and I feel self-conscious enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shared a look with the guys. They were all clearly debating how to play this. She raised an eyebrow in their direction, signalling for them to follow her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about that, Donna,\" she said. \"I mean, I know she can be a bitch sometimes, but she's still your best friend. She won't judge you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared, unimpressed. \"You're kidding me, right? This is Jackie we're talking about. I love her to death, but she's going to have words with me about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso put a hand on her shoulder. \"Donna, trust me on this one. I think she'll be understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Fez. \"Jackie has changed since the last time you saw her. A lot. I don't think she'll be judging you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shuffled awkwardly. \"You guys really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in the basement right now, if you want to see for yourself,\" said Hyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... Maybe I should work up to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, you ought to do it now,\" Eric said, gently taking her hand. \"Best to get it over with. Besides, I know how much you've missed her. She's probably dying to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gave a small smile. \"You think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Laurie said. \"We'll all go down together, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso snickered. \"Out of context, that sounds so wrong.\" But Hyde nudged him in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie ignored them. \"We'll be your support team. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked oddly moved. \"Wow, thanks, Laurie. That's... surprisingly sweet of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez smiled, putting an arm around Laurie. \"That's my wife in a nutshell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Laurie said, turning around and leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed Fez and Laurie towards the basement steps. Donna looked over at Hyde and Kelso and nodded in their direction. \"Still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're surprisingly stable,\" Hyde replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jackie knew she was being cowardly. She knew she needed to go back upstairs and face Donna. Let her see how big she'd gotten. How she'd broken her own \"beauty rules\" and let herself get fat. What was she supposed to do? Blame Laurie for everything? Not a bad scratch, but shifting blame wouldn't shift the weight either. Nor would it remove the sight of her fat self from Donna's brain. She tried to pace around a bit, hoping it'd burn a few pesky calories, but she just got tired very quickly and had to sit down for a minute, followed by a craving for some ice cream from the deep freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to think rationally - never a strong suit of hers. She tried to remember what Laurie had told her. No one's opinion matters but your own. For years, she'd pretended that was how she felt. Now she needed to actually feel it. Swallowing, she forced herself back onto her feet. She could do this. She could get up those stairs and show Donna that, yes, this was who she was now, so take it or leave it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she became nervous again - what if Donna <i>did </i>leave it? What if Donna walked out on her? She didn't know if she could handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the door opening upstairs, and she heard the footsteps coming slowly down the steps. From the way they were creaking, she guessed one of them was Laurie. She turned and saw her and Fez coming down towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, you guys,\" she said frantically. \"I know I said I'd see Donna, but I'm not ready yet. I need more time. I probably just need a cuter outfit or something. Maybe a shower and a new hairstyle. Something to make me feel more confident, okay? Because I'm just not ready for Donna to see... me... like... this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off when she saw that more were coming downstairs, including a redhead who looked very familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared back at her with a stunned expression, which was just what Jackie had feared. Except she hadn't expected that stunned expression to be such a plump one. Those full cheeks, the developing double chin, the ballooning boobs, the bulging belly... Her best friend was just as big as her, if not slightly bigger! She was completely lost for words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna herself, meanwhile, was finishing coming down the stairs, on her side of the basement, staring at the chubby brunette standing by the couch, looking at her in utter disbelief. She tried to control her mouth from sliding all the way open, but she couldn't help it. Not that she felt too badly about it, seeing as how Jackie's expression was about the same. She stared at her friend's jelly jar of a belly, her rosy cheeks, the slightly-strained buttons on her top... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a bony elbow in her side and realized that Eric was nudging her closer to Jackie. She briefly saw that he looked surprised, too, but as always, he was being the supportive boyfriend. Taking that as her cue, she slowly approached the other girl, wincing slightly at the sound of her jeans as her thighs rubbed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls stood face to face in the basement, looking each other over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna...?\" Jackie breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie...,\" Donna breathed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...? What...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did...? How did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in that instant, they both saw the apprehension in each others eyes, and they felt all their anxiety start to crumble away as small smiles split across their faces. The joy of seeing each other again, coupled with the bemusement at their mutual weight gain, they started to giggle. Then the giggles became full on laughter as realized the absurdity of the situation - how they couldn't believe they'd both been so afraid of the others opinion when they were both in the same boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining members of the group watched all of this from the washer and dryer with growing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez whispered and tapped his forehead. \"Are... are they... y'know... going insane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly,\" Eric replied, \"but at least they're not scared of each other anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Jackie didn't seem to hear them. They just kept laughing and laughing, falling into each others arms and hugging each other tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso smiled. \"Oh, good. They're cementing their friendship with some girl-on-girl action. Laurie, how about you get in there and make it a threesome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, you all wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except me,\" Eric said pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Jackie collapsed onto the couch from laughing so hard, faces red and tears pouring down their faces. They finally came out of the hug and started to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased that the ordeal was over with, the rest of the gang joined them around the TV to swap stories of the past year, and maybe even pass a few joints.</span></div></div>",

Donna was apprehensive about what her future sister-in-law's idea of a \"night out\" until Jackie explained it was just going to be a very big dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we sure we should be eating any big meals when we're already this big?\" Donna asked apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged helplessly. \"Laurie's on this whole thing now. She likes being fat. It agrees with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they all piled into Jackie's car and set off into the night. They found the local buffet that Laurie only ate at when she wanted to be super-stuffed. After all, it was a night for celebration, what with Donna getting married and Jackie graduating high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This will be a night to remember</i>, she thought gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before they walked inside. Laurie could hear her stomach rumble at the sight of the all the food laid before them. Donna and Jackie followed her quietly, also amazed at everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...,\" Donna said quietly. \"Look at all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fat girl's paradise,\" Jackie muttered. \"Laurie says she comes here twice a month. Sometimes with Fez. Sometimes without him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen? What's up with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My theory is since she's settled down, she's got all this pent up sexual energy, so she channels it by eating. And she had a lot of sexual energy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw Laurie had acquired a table, and they joined her. \"Okay, it's time to grab trays and load up! Just remember not to take the entire plate off the buffet. For some reason, they get mad when you do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie led the way to the buffet line, and right away, she started piling whatever she could get onto it - fried chicken, roasted chicken, pork chops, whatever meat she could get her hands on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's mouth hung slightly open. \"Holy crap, look at her go... She really <i>is </i>into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya,\" said Jackie. \"She knows what she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two younger girls loaded up their plates with what they could find that appealed to them, although they were a trifle startled by just <i>how much </i>they found appealing. Their plates were loaded pretty full before they sat down at their tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this,\" Donna said sadly. \"I mean, do I just have no self-control anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shifted in her seat, eyeing her own pile of food with reluctant desire. \"Yeah, about that...,\" she said. \"What happened there, exactly? I mean, you were still thin when you visited last Thanksgiving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed with frustration. \"I just... I don't know... College is hard, you know? I mean, it's a <i>good </i>kind of hard. I love what I'm doing. Like, it's challenging, but the rewards at the end are great. I just... I don't know. There isn't a lot of time to go a gym or exercise... and take out is always convenient... And there are some great restaurants in the area... So, when I'm stressed and out of options, it turns out... I eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not just eat. I mean... <i>eat</i>. I gorge, I stuff, I inhale... One time, while I was working on an article for class, I ate an entire chocolate pie all by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's jaw dropped. \"Donna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know... I felt so embarrassed when I realized what I had done that I tried to hide the pie tin under the rest of the recycling. Didn't help - Eric found it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was just annoyed I didn't save any for him. I made it up to him and got another pie. I think he got <i>one </i>piece out of that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I'm worrying, is this what it's always going to be like? Is my journalism major going to make me fatter? I mean... I wouldn't mind it that much since I love the work, but... I don't know. Eric's been so supportive, considering how stressed he's been at college. It took him all year to find a major, and even then, he's been there for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled slightly. \"Good to know the scrawny neighbor boy didn't let you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled back. \"Yeah... and he's so nice about my weight gain. I mean, he's always ready for sex, y'know? Like, this hasn't been a turn off for him in the slightest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it hasn't been for Steven either,\" Jackie said thoughtfully. \"I honestly thought it would be, but he hasn't said a word about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because he knows you'd kick him in the shins if he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's beside the point. I'm beginning to think... what if he really <i>does </i>love me for more than my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. \"You really didn't think he did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I mean, I hoped, but I wasn't sure if he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly, he does. Jackie, he's crazy about <i>you </i>- not what waist measurement you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie tried to smother the cheesy grin on her face. \"Yeah... my puddin' pop loves me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna laughed. \"Oh god... I'm <i>so </i>calling him that when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare! That's <i>my </i>humiliating nickname for him! Get your own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed, once again appreciating being together again and feeling that friendly familiarity they enjoyed so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter faded, however, when they both heard heavy footsteps coming their way, and they turned in shock to see Laurie waddling towards them with two plates in her arms that were simply loaded high with stacks of food. She set them down on the table between them with a heavy thump before plopping her fine ass in the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, there's no way you can finish all that,' Donna said in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow and gave her usual smirk. \"Just watch me.\" She grabbed a fork and started to dine on one pile of food. She moaned with pleasure and dug deeper into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\" Laurie continued. \"Wedding talk! Have you picked your dress out yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna realized she was being spoken to and blinked herself out of her stupor, picking up her fork. \"Uh... no, not yet. I was going to do that here. Didn't want to lug a nice dress all the way down from Madison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better believe you're taking me with you,\" said Jackie. \"I'm not letting my best friend walk down the aisle in anything remotely frumpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled. \"What would I do without you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably get married in plaid flannel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't knock it til you've tried it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, their eyes drifted back towards Laurie, who was still working her way through all the food. Chicken, pork chops, steak, shrimp, french fries, mac n cheese... She was showing no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" Donna said, hoping to say something that would get the gorging girl to look at her. \"... Laurie, I was wondering if you wanted to be a bridesmaid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked up, a chicken leg poking out of her mouth. For a moment, she looked stupefied, but then she removed the bare bone and asked, \"Me? A bridesmaid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean... you're Eric's sister, and Fez's husband. And you helped me and Eric get out of Point Place and into college. I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laurie looked strangely moved. \"Donna, I'd love to!\" she practically squealed. \"I've never been a bridesmaid before! Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was slightly taken aback by Laurie's enthusiasm, but she couldn't help smiling back. \"Okay, great! Awesome! Now I just need one more. I really wish I had more female friends at times like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your feminist club friends will do it?\" asked Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without serious compromises being made, like wearing jeans and tank tops. I mean, I understand that marriage is a symbol of man's control over women, but I still want this to be pretty, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe ask Brooke. I'm almost certain she won't give birth in the middle of your wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna lit up. \"Oh yeah, are she and Kelso still a thing? I mean, do you think she'd be willing to walk down the aisle with them? Or does him knocking her up mean she wants to kill him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, they're good. They're giving the whole relationship thing a try. Mixed results, but so far so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard a clatter next to them and saw Laurie setting down a fork on her first plate, which was, to their shock, empty. She moved on to the other one and continued eating like nothing had even happened. She ate with one hand while clutching and rubbing her belly with the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shook her head. \"You know, Laurie, it would be great if you can actually fit into your bridesmaid dress when the wedding arrives, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie waved her off dismissively. \"Oh, I'll be fine. Once I'm measured, I'll cool my jets for a while. I mean, the wedding's, what, in two weeks? I can last that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie raised an eyebrow. \"I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can! I totally can! Just because I enjoy eating doesn't mean I have no self-control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Jackie smirked. \"Well, considering you're talking with your mouth full, I hope you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie sneered and swallowed her latest mouthful, only to automatically shovel more into her mouth. She swallowed that too, but then filled it up less than a second later. There was just so much food, and it was all so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Laurie leaned back in her seat, and even then, her stomach was still pressed against the table. She rested her hands atop her belly and rubbed it soothingly. She looked back at Donna and Jackie, both of whom were still working on their first plates. They were eyeing her swollen belly as it rose and fell, and it made her realize they had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'll try to -HIC!- ... control myself...,\" she said sheepishly.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days that followed were tough for Laurie. She had promised that she would behave herself and not eat too much between now and the wedding, if only to fit into whatever dress she was destined to wear. She snuck the odd goodie here and there to sate her sweet tooth, but it wasn't enough. She missed that super-stuffed-bloated feeling after a huge feast. She missed needing Fez to rub her swollen belly when she was too full to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Fez had been supportive of her decision, helping her eat healthier for the time being. It wasn't so much that she disliked fruits and vegetables - it was just hard to fill up on them. Fez would bring home produce from the grocery store, and she'd eat them all in seconds flat. She'd be full enough to get through the day, but that was it. Her lower lip was getting a decent workout from all the pouting she was doing. She didn't know how Donna and Jackie could live like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of whom, Donna and Jackie <i>weren't </i>able to live like this either. They were determined to maintain their current size and maybe even shed a few pounds before the wedding, but to their embarrassment, they found it difficult to do so. Any time they saw something sugary or salty, they heard their tummies growl in hunger. Even just the sight of pork chops or a hot dog made them go crazy with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, however, the day came when they stepped into the bridal boutique place, and it was time for everyone to get their measurements. Donna went for her wedding dress while Jackie and Laurie went to have their bridesmaids dresses fitted. Brooke was busy at the moment, being pregnant and all, but had assured them that once they gave her the details, she'd get a pregnant-friendly version of the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, being the bride, went up first. She was very nervous. She got up on the stool in her underwear, feeling very silly about the whole thing. It was one thing to be fat around friends and family. Here, she was being measured by total strangers. In a public place. Okay, it was technically a private room, but still. She looked at herself in the mirror. Really examined her flab. Her belly that spilled over her waistband a bit, her boobs practically crammed into her a bra she should've thrown out ages ago. She tilted her head at the mirror and angled herself a tad... Oh dear god, was her ass starting to sag??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jackie was in another room, also being measured. She winced when she saw the numbers around her arms alone. How had she gotten this big in a few weeks?! Okay, so she wasn't enormous or anything. She'd been so tiny to begin with, at the moment she was probably closer to \"chubby\" than \"obese\". Still, ten pounds was nothing to sneeze at. It was a miracle she'd only had to go up a couple sizes. Her chubby little belly jiggled as the tape measure was wrapped around her. She didn't dare look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, in the third room, was hardly concerned with how huge she was. She occasionally weighed herself. Last she'd seen, she was two hundred and eleven pounds. She'd immediately had a good wank about that, very pleased with herself. However, now that she was \"behaving\" she was constantly hungry. She had to force herself not to stop off at Fatso Burger or the pizza place, to not buy nothing but cake and cookies at the supermarket, and to certainly not raid the fridge and cupboards after midnight. Seriously, why was binging so much more fun after midnight?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at several dresses. Trying to find the one that just felt right. She looked at the size she'd be wearing - Large. She was a \"Large\". She cursed the stress of college for driving her to food, and the deliciousness of fried and fatty foods in particular. Great. Now she wanted a double cheeseburger dripping with cheese. Hell, right now, she could eat three of them. No. Stay strong. Think of the wedding. Just gotta hold out another week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked her dress up and down. Lavender - just like she'd told Donna to go for. She was a \"Medium\" now. She couldn't believe she'd ever be a medium. She looked at the curve of her belly in the mirror. Good god, she looked pregnant. And not the cute kind of pregnant. At least, that's what she thought. She looked like she'd done nothing but eat cake for months. Now she was thinking about what kind of cake Eric and Donna would have at the reception. Chocolate cake with white frosting was traditional, but there were so many kinds to try, right? Damn. Now that was all she could think of. She was worried that if she made it to the reception without gaining anymore weight, she'd probably just eat half the cake herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie admired the dress. It was beautiful. It was also an XL. She was an XL. She couldn't help but smile at the sight. It was so fitted, it hugged her figure, revealing every roll. Her waistline alone had been thirty-five inches. She jiggled that waistline as she admired the reflection. Pity she had to stay right at this size for a while. She knew she could do it. She had to do it. Had to do it for them, to prove that she could. And also because she was part of the wedding, and she didn't want to let them down. Damn it, when had she developed this caring feeling for her brother's friends? Still, she could do it. That being said, once the wedding was over, she was going to have a feast to remember. A gorge fit for a very fat queen. She briefly fantasized about Fez having to roll her out the door afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled out into the open and saw Jackie leaning against a post in the waiting room. \"Looking good, Jackie,\" she said, smiling brightly as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shuffled awkwardly. \"You really think? It's a bit tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie put an arm around her and made her look in a nearby mirror. \"You look smokin'. You're gonna drive Hyde crazy in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked at her chubby reflection for a long time, taking in every detail, and a small smile appeared on her lips. \"... I do look pretty cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, another door opened, and out stepped Donna. Jackie and Laurie stared in amazement. The white dress fit her tall yet plump figure perfectly, sparkling and flowing majestically. She had a small smile on her face, but it was clear to anyone she was holding back a girlish urge to jump up and down excitedly. \"Well...?\" she asked in an unusually timid voice. \"How does it look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Laurie looked at it, then at each other, and then started bouncing up and down eagerly, squealing with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, you look beautiful!\" Jackie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna let out a deep breath and started laughing joyously. \"Oh my god, you guys do, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls ran toward each other and started jumping up and down, jiggling furiously and causing the room to shake a bit, causing a few people to think maybe there was an earthquake. There wasn't. Just three beautiful fat women jumping up and down in their wedding attire.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The big day had finally arrived. Eric and Donna's wedding was upon them. Everyone was scurrying around, getting everything ready, especially Kitty and Jackie - the mother of the groom and maid of honor - trying to ensure that everything was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More flowers, dammit!\" Jackie bellowed at the decorators. \"If I see one pew without a bouquet on it, heads will roll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, was cooking up a storm. No one was sure why, considering it was a catered event, but it kept her from going insane from the knowledge that her baby boy was all grown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hell for Laurie. She came into the kitchen that morning and saw all the food on the counter and felt her stomach groan. She'd gotten by all week, determined to maintain her current size long enough to survive the wedding. She was doing it for her brother, she told herself. And her soon-to-be sister-in-law. She appreciated that Donna had put her in the wedding, and that the group were more or less accepting her as a friend. It was hard to believe it had already been a year since that fateful camping trip, wherein she was barely tolerated. Amazing what twelve months and fifty extra pounds could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the church and saw Jackie's drill sergeant routine, she decided that maybe it would be for the best if they went to make sure the outside was looking nice - primarily by dragging Jackie by the arm until she was outside in the warm summer air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, it's like I'm surrounded by idiots,\" Jackie grumbled, clutching her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded. \"Yeah, but how come that's starting to stress you out <i>now</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, if this wedding isn't perfect, I am going to kill someone! I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, respectfully, I'm gonna have to ask you to chill. Everything's fine. The guys are with Eric, Donna's mom is with her, my dad's making sure no one's drinking or doing dope on the premises... which is ironic, cuz I think you could do with both right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie rolled her eyes and put her hands on her hips, looking around the parking lot. \"... God, I hate this. I hate everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow. \"You're hungry, too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's bitchy face melted into her whiny face. \"Yessssssss!\" she moaned. \"I can't stand this anymore! It used to be so easy not eating all the time, and then you come along, and now I've tasted the nector! I know what it's like to eat whatever whenever, and I can't live without it anymore! I need fooooood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie patted her shoulder. \"I know, I know. We just gotta hang in there. We're doing it for the soon-to-be Mr and Mrs Pinciotti.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie laughed briefly at the joke before giving way to her pouty face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps behind them made them turn and see Brooke walking up. They took a moment to admire the maternity bridesmaid dress she was wearing. Her massive pregnant belly swayed back and forth as she waddled up to them, beaming away. \"Hey, Jackie! Hey, Laurie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled through her pout. \"Oh, Brooke, you look beautiful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally got that sexy pregnant thing going for you,\" agreed Laurie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke smiled bashfully. \"Thanks. You look incredible, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we know,\" Laurie replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, considering the fact that we're <i>starving</i>!\" Jackie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke nodded. \"Yeah, Michael mentioned the wedding diet. If it's any consolation, so am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, and that's worse for you because you have a baby that needs nourishment,\" Jackie whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a good breakfast this morning,\" Brooke laughed. \"I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you. I'm <i>starving</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reception can't happen fast enough,\" Laurie sighed, rubbing her empty belly. \"Seriously, when I leave tonight, there's gonna be a few popped stitches in this dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Joanne popped out of the church and looked relieved when she saw them. \"Oh, here you all are,\" she sighed. \"You need to start keeping an eye on your bride. She's in here ranting about pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie, Laurie and Brooke all stared at each other. \"Good lord, it's spreading,\" Laurie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls all hurried into the bride's changing room where Midge was trying calm her daughter. \"Honey, we can't order a pizza right now! You don't want to stain your dress before the ceremony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I don't care right now! I'm starving! I feel like I could eat an entire pizza by myself! No, two pizzas! Three! With ham and sausage and pepperoni and --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down there, cowgirl,\" Laurie admonished. \"You're just making the rest of us hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, it's just... I miss <i>food</i>, dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we all?\" moaned Jackie, clutching her stomach. \"I'm so hungry I could eat a whole tub of ice cream in one sitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't have any ice cream,\" said Brooke, pulling out her purse, \"but I do have some snacks in here.\" She produced four chocolate bars and held them out to the three women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You carry candy bars in your purse?\" asked Jackie, looking both relieved and bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke smirked. \"When you're pregnant, you're hungry all the time. Also sore, tired, annoyed and horny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll settle for hungry,\" said Laurie, gratefully taking the chocolate bar. \"I think whatever calories I get from this won't take effect until after the wedding, so I should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Jackie, taking her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four women sat in the dressing room, eating chocolate and generally trying to calm down. Soon, with the sugar in their systems, they felt their nerves settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" said Donna. \"Brooke, you may have just singlehandedly saved this wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The least I can do,\" Brooke replied, rubbing her pregnant belly. \"God, I'm ready for this kid to be born. It's been almost nine months exactly. I'm ready to friggin' pop, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie tilted her head, admiring the perfect sphere of Brooke's belly. \"Yeah...,\" she murmured. She wondered what she'd look like with a belly that perfectly round. Minus the actually having kids part, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Midge popped her head in the door. \"Okay, girls, the ceremony's about to begin! Donna, your ass of a father is on his way here to walk to you down the aisle. I'm so proud! See you in a minute!\" The door shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Donna, who just shook her head fondly. \"That's my mommy dat said dat,\" she said, and they all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in some last minute hugs, Laurie, Jackie and Brooke scurried outside to join up with the respective groomsmen. Eric was twitching nervously in his suit, but Red and Kitty were making sure that he was all right. Kitty was doing her very best not to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you two,\" Red said sternly. \"We're going to do this right, okay? No tears, no twitching. Just get up there and do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Red,\" Kitty sniffled. \"It's just... my little boy is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All grown up, Kitty. Yes, we know. But we need to get him up there before he misses his plane for his honeymoon tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang all smirked at the scene as Eric rolled his eyes. Jackie linked arms with Hyde, practically beaming, and not just because he'd agreed to remove his sunglasses for the ceremony. Brooke linked arms with Kelso, who was hiding a shy smile as she did so - they had really grown closer these last few months. Laurie, meanwhile, stood between the two couples with Fez, who was smiling genuinely at the fussing Formans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, do you wish we had a wedding as beautiful as this?\" he asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged. \"Oh, I dunno. Ours wasn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. I just wish my best man hadn't been that gentleman with the speeding ticket at the courthouse. I had to pay half of his fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie gently tightened her grip on his arm. \"One thing we never did - we never had that honeymoon...,\" she said, giving him a sexy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's smile broadened. \"Ooooh, we should go to Disneyland and eat cotton candy all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that can be arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard the organ start up, and they knew it was time. Eric made his way down the aisle with Red and Kitty, and one by one, each couple made their way down the aisle. Laurie enjoyed hanging onto Fez's arm, but she had to admit, watching her little brother tie the knot with the woman of his dreams was heartwarming. She usually hated those little reminders that she had a heart underneath it all. But seeing Donna's nerves completely melt away when she heard Eric's admittedly touching vows was a sight to behold. She never thought her own brother could ever move her to tears, but it did. They made it through the ceremony without a hitch, although Kitty and Bob had both cried through the whole thing, and Kelso and Fez had almost been the ones to \"object\" until Hyde silenced them with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Pastor Dave had pronounced them man and wife. \"You may now kiss the bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly-minted husband and wife kissed to a round of applause. Laurie clapped eagerly, because as happy as she was that the ceremony had gone well, she was even happier to know that the next best thing was about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding reception!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, everyone was in the banquet hall for the reception. The place was crowded with relatives, all milling around, catching up, reminiscing and pretending they liked each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bride and her bridesmaids wandered through the packed hall, trying to make their way to the buffet table. They had survived the whole wedding, and it was time to finally have some <i>food</i>. Much to their dismay, there was a big crowd around the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, look at all these people,\" Laurie moaned. \"I could be eating all that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience,\" Donna replied. \"We just gotta get in line and load up with whatever we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we got the small styrofoam plates,\" grumbled Jackie. \"Should've gotten regular big ceramic plates. I'm probably gonna have to make so many trips up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Midge came scurrying up to her wedded daughter. \"Donna, come on! It's time for the meet and greet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Eric have to meet and greet all the people who came to your wedding! I wonder if that's why it's called a 'meet and greet'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned as she was dragged away from the group towards her husband and a big line of people she didn't recognize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, more for us,\" said Jackie with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Hyde hurried over. \"Jackie? Did you know anything about a best man speech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked at her surprisingly flustered-usually-zen boyfriend. \"...Yeah? You're supposed to get up before everyone and recite your carefully planned and well thought out best man spee-- \" She stopped at the look on his face. \"Oh, for god's sake! Don't tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shrugged. \"No one told me anything about this! If I'd known, I'd have let Kelso or Fez be the best man. Then I could at least have the joy of watching them fail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sighed. She looked in the direction of the food, and then at Hyde, before letting out a frustrated growl and grabbing him by the collar. \"Come on, let's write this thing. If I don't, you'll just rip off Air Supply lyrics or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde let out a nervous laugh. \"What?! I don't listen Air Supply! I don't know what you're talking about!\" he yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie and Brooke laughed as they disappeared into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there were two,\" Brooke murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, from the direction of the dance floor, Kelso meandered up, looking surprisingly shy. \"Er, hey there, ladies,\" he said, trying to sound all manly and stuff. \"I was wondering... y'know, if maybe... perhaps... Brooke, maybe, you'd like to... y'know... that <i>thing </i>y'do on the dance floor and stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke tried not to laugh. \"Michael, I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big goofy grin split across Kelso's face and he took Brooke's hand. She gave one last helpless shrug to Laurie before allowing herself to be dragged out onto the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shook her head, then realized she was on her own. Looking this way and that, she tried to see if Fez was going to pop out of nowhere and drag her into another wedding related activity, but she didn't see him anywhere. For a moment, she was relieved she wouldn't be stopped from finally having a decent meal, but then she felt a little sad that her husband wasn't coming out to ask her to dance or hang out or something. Where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself, she made her way over to the buffet table, hoping she'd be able to at least get something good. Not a bad spread. Fried chicken, scalloped potatoes, mashed potatoes, devilled eggs, green beans, glazed ham... lots to choose from. She was just about to grab a plate when she felt a hand on her shoulder, and she found herself turning towards the brown eyes of Fez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, my darling, there you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fez! I was just about to get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good. Let me show you where we are sitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie turned where Fez was pointing, and her mouth fell open. There was a table with only two chairs, and it was covered in a mountain of food, all in the styrofoam plates, taking up the entire space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fez...,\" she murmured, feeling drool forming in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have worked so hard to stay the same size for this lovely dress,\" Fez said kindly. \"So I wanted you to finally enjoy getting out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled and hugged him tightly. \"You know how to treat a fat girl right.\" She released him. \"Now then... let's go stuff me silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically ran over to the table and sat in her chair, admiring the table full of food just for her. Licking her lips greedily, she started to eat. Oh god, it had been a long two weeks, but she'd made it. She'd kept the dress nice and snug all the way through the ceremony. Now she could relax and eat, eat eat. She didn't care what it was - she just wanted it in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez was a champ. He knew better than to interrupt, and instead, he settled for helping. He'd pass her plates, hold up a glass of water for her to sip from, go get more if it seemed necessary. His wife's appetite was insatiable, and he was only too happy to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie ate like a real trooper. All the food groups adequately represented, and she just gobbled them all up. So many fruits and vegetables, of course, but she really made good work of all the meat and grains provided, too. So much ham and chicken. And so many biscuits and dinner rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, the best part was dessert. They weren't allowed near the cake yet, but there were loads of pies and cookies to consume. Fez brought her plate after plate of goodies, and she ate as much as she could. All the while, that dress was feeling tighter around her growing middle. She had been hunched over when she started, but now, she had to lean back and sit almost completely straight while her massive belly swelled with the sudden onslaught of sugary treats. It pressed hard against the table, the top half bulging onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't stop her. She grew so full she couldn't feed herself, so Fez naturally fed her instead, placing cookies and slices of pie into her waiting mouth. She loved this so much. Her man feeding her, her stomach swollen and in absolutely pain, the flavor in her mouth... this was heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like years (it was more like an hour), it was over. Laurie had eaten every last scrap of food Fez had brought her. He had noticed she was slowing down a while ago, so he figured he'd better stop for now. He waited to see what she'd say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a very large belch that may have startled a few people sitting near them, but she was too stuffed to care. Her stomach bulged against the table's edge, with both her hands on top of it, rubbing it gently, with a dazed look on her face. She was covered in crumbs from her gorge, but she didn't care about that either. She was just so stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez scooted closer and nuzzled her, putting a hand on her stomach and rubbing it as well. \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded. \"Unnnnngh... that was amazing. I don't think I can move an inch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez's eye wandered out to the main area, and he saw activity taking place. \"Looks like they're getting ready to cut the cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie's eyes widened with renewed vigor. \"Let's get over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You're a bit... full, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laurie nodded vigorously. \"I'm fine... HIC! I just gotta get over there befo-HIC!-hore they give away all the be-HIC!-hest pieces!\"</span></div></div>",

The most popular theory was that Bob had read the description wrong or given the wrong measurements or whatever. In any case, it sat upon the table, almost the same height as Kelso, who was the tallest of the main group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Donna were cutting pieces together - relieved to have something to do that wasn't shaking hands and pretending they remembered all their relatives - but Donna's hunger was beginning to cripple her, so Eric agreed he would handle it for a while. In the meantime, she took a piece of cake and sat down with Jackie and Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" she gasped. \"I'm exhausted. I don't know how other newlyweds do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so negative!\" Jackie said, swatting her arm. \"Some of us would like to get married someday! Don't spoil it for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke moaned with joy as she finished her latest piece of cake. \"Mmmmm... Donna, your dad picked good cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of his special powers,\" Donna smiled, eating her own. \"God, you're right. This is good. I should get a second piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie scoffed. \"Try to keep up, Mrs Forman. I'm already on my third.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke smirked and raised her hand. \"Fifth.\" They both stared at her in surprise. She shrugged. \"I'm pregnant! Baby wants cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie patted her own small bulge of a belly. \"God, to think a few months ago, I would've freaked out about this. Now, I don't care. I just want more cake, dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too,\" said Donna. \"But you know what? It's good to subvert the traditional values that say a woman must be thin to be attractive. I mean, during the Reconnaissance, fat women were revered and admired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" agreed Brooke, resting her hands atop her round belly. \"I'm kinda gonna miss this part of being pregnant - getting to eat whatever whenever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should join us,\" said Jackie eagerly. \"It'd be fun to have a fourth girl on the pig parade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's eye fell on a particularly interesting sight. \"Speaking of a pig parading...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Brooke followed her gaze and spotted a very bloated Laurie waddling up through the line with Fez as her support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god, look at that gut,\" said Jackie, covering her mouth in shock. \"She looks like she swelled up like a balloon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Fez,\" added Brooke. \"He's trying to hold her up. She's so determined, she doesn't even notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll make it up to him later, probably...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, please don't make me lose my appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey observed from their table as Laurie, now one of the last people to get in line, eagerly started loading up on cake. She took the extra knife and started cutting huge slices off the back where no one was really paying attention, putting them on plates for Fez to take away. He would slip them onto a nearby table while she stood at the table, eating whatever slices he couldn't carry, and then when he returned, he took the next batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's mouth was hanging open. \"Does... does she really think she can eat all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's going to try,\" remarked Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, this means we're going to need a custodian soon,\" Jackie moaned. \"I knew we should've sprung for the cleaning service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Laurie was finished, and she and Fez went to the nearby table. They counted at least fifteen pieces of cake, not including the few she'd already had at the serving table. She looked so full and bloated already, but she showed no signs of caring as she started shoveling cake into her mouth. One piece was quickly finished before she moved onto the second, and that quickly gave way to the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...,\" said Donna, in complete awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like watching a wheat harvester,\" agreed Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching her consume five pieces, Laurie seemed to be feeling very full. Her stomach was so round, it looked like a bowling ball. She finished pieces six and seven, and she was partway through the eighth when she stopped for a moment, looking confused. They briefly wondered if maybe she'd had too much. But then, she let out a hefty belch, and she resumed eating. More and more cake went down into her vast belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the twelfth piece, she began to slow down. She leaned back, her belly pressed up against the table, a look of exhaustion on her face, but she kept eating. She made it through the thirteenth, and then the fourteenth... and all that was left was the fifteenth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it looked like she'd had it. She let the fourteenth plate fall to the floor, her arms dangling helplessly at either side. She was stuffed to the gills. Was she done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Fez took that last piece, and the plastic fork, and to their surprise, he began to feed her the last piece. She looked utterly miserable, but she still smiled at her husband as he fed her, bite by bite, never forcing her or rushing her. Just letting her eat at her own pace. A few minutes later, the cake was gone. He set the plate down, rubbed her forehead, and then rubbed her belly with the other, gently kissing her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is... so sweet...,\" said Brooke, very surprised by her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it... kinda is,\" Donna added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie pouted. \"I wonder if Steven would feed <i>me </i>and rub <i>my </i>huge tummy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shrugged. \"Eat half a wedding cake and find out,\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their surprise, Jackie got up and grabbed a plate, heading for the cake. Donna and Brooke watched her in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, I was kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just... the thought of Steven rubbing my fat belly! I got horny! And hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke nodded knowingly. \"Sometimes, Michael rubs my tummy, and it's just so sexy. It's another reason why I'm sad I'm going to give birth soon. I'm going to miss my belly rubs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shifted in her seat. She had to admit, the thought of Eric rubbing her overstuffed stomach to sooth how full she felt sounded wonderful. She grabbed a plate and hurried after Jackie, getting some more cake for herself. And because she was a considerate person, she brought a few pieces back for Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women pigged out on cake all night, letting one piece segue into the next. They ate until they felt sick, and then they ate a little more. By the time the night was over, all three were sitting at their table in a veritable sugar coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric came over, finding them in a pile of empty paper plates and crumbs. He gently tapped his bloated wife on the shoulder. \"Donna...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna jolted awake. \"Huh? Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, it's getting late. If we want to get some sleep before the honeymoon in NYC tomorrow, we should probably get going, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna belched in response, looking very embarrassed afterward. \"Sorry, I... you're right. Let's get going.\" She got to her feet, which was a challenge in her overstuffed state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the commotion, Jackie and Brooke hefted themselves to their feet as well, huge bellies protruding and gurgling with cake. They followed Eric and Donna to the door, where they also found Hyde and Kelso waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where're Laurie and Fez?\" asked Jackie, sleepily leaning into Hyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They cut out early,\" Hyde said with a shrug. \"Said they had things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso grinned mischievously as he supported Brooke. \"Which probably means they're <i>doin' it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, they're not necessarily have sex,\" Brooke admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know them like we do,\" said Hyde dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric cleared his throat. \"Well! We're gonna take off. Get some rest before the honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso grinned again. \"You're gonna <i>do it</i>, too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna scowled. \"Kelso... I mean, yeah, probably, but come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled. \"We just wanna thank you guys for being here and supporting us so we could get this far. Thank you so much for helping us get married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie cleared her throat expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rolled his eyes. \"And thank you, Jackie, for being a kickass maid of honor and getting everything ready. You really saved our butts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie beamed sleepily. \"Damn right, I did.\" Her expressions softened. \"We love you guys, even if some of us our too zen to admit,\" she said, giving Hyde a knowing look, to which he merely smirked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you guys, too,\" Donna said, fighting back some tears. As stuffed as she was, she was still emotional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group all pulled into a group hug - even Hyde was willing to let his guard down and join in just this once - before breaking apart and letting the newlyweds take off for their honeymoon. Jackie and Brooke quietly reflected that Donna's dress was holding together remarkably well, considering how stuffed she was underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was quietly regretting not getting a maternity dress like Brooke. They may look like a tent, but at least she'd have had more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all exhausted at this point, so the two couples split up, and Jackie leaned on Hyde as he took her back to the El Camino. Once they were inside the cab and Hyde had started the motor, he helped Jackie with her seat belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" he said at last. \"Wanna tell me why we noticed you gals trying to make the cake disappear piece by piece?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie moaned. She was too full to feel embarrassed. \"I dunno...,\" she whined. \"It was just so good, and we were starving, and I just... Steven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I ate too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde chuckled as they pulled out onto the road. To Jackie's surprise, he reached over and put a hand on her sore tummy, gently rubbing it in small circles. She glanced over at him as he focused on the road, and she felt her love increase immensely. They would most definitely be <i>doin' it</i> tonight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Jackie woke up to the feeling of Hyde's lips on her cheek. She stirred and groaned at being woken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta go to work, doll,\" he said quietly in her ear. \"I'll see you at dinner, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhmmm,\" she mumbled sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, have a good one. Love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm I luv you too...,\" she replied, already mostly asleep again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of his boots leaving, so she assumed he was leaving, too. She stayed in his cot under the basement for another hour before she decided it was time to get up. She forced herself up, looking around. She saw her bridesmaid dress slung haphazardly over a chair. She smiled briefly as she remembered what a relief it was to have that thing off, allowing her belly to stretch. Speaking of which, she realized she was totally naked right now. There was her belly, poking out, with a few fresh stretchmarks going down the front of it. She gave it a jiggle. She couldn't believe how much she'd eaten the night before. She rolled over and observed herself in the mirror. She'd installed it herself because Hyde didn't want one. She stood to her full height and admired her body. She looked at her growing belly, her growing booty, her growing thighs, her growing breasts, and she thought to herself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, I'm cute!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with herself, she grabbed a few spare clothes she had lying around for nights when she stayed over impulsively. She found a stretchy pair of shorts and one of Hyde's t-shirts so she'd at least look presentable. She tiptoed into the basement, finding it to be around 11 in the morning. Pleased with herself, she plopped down on the couch and grabbed a magazine to skim through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was probably there for almost ten minutes before the side door popped open, and she looked up to see a familiar head of blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie grinned dopily. \"HIC! I'm back!\" she said in a husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stared at her. Her hair was a bit messy. She was clearly a bit drunk. And when she walked all the way in, she saw that her stomach had swollen to twice the size it had been last night, protruding through a massive hole in the front of the bridesmaid dress she was still wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, what the hell...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laurie just chuckled drunkenly as she stumbled inside, kicking the door shut behind her. \"Oh man,\" she laughed. \"Whatta night! Oh man, that was heavenly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plopped down on the couch next to Jackie, putting her feet up on the table and both hands atop her enormous stomach. It was so utterly stuffed that it didn't even jiggle. She looked about as pregnant as Brooke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, what happened to you? What'd you do? Wha...? Where's Fez?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, he's at work. I took a cab home. Ohhhh, man, did we ever have an awesome night last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where'd you go? Last we saw you, you were eating cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Well, after the cake, and Fez feeding me, I felt horny as hell, so I took Fez to an empty banquet hall, and he <i>fucked </i>me on the dining room table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's mouth fell open. \"... You <i>what</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Three times</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated blonde plowed on. \"Then, when we finished, I was hungry again, but there was nowhere open. So we went to the nearest twenty-four hour grocery store and just loaded up on whatever looked good. I must've eaten enough to feed thirty people. A whole box of doughnuts, a pint of ice cream, a bunch of bananas, some strawberries, a whole six pack of beer... And I was so stuuuuuffed after that, I let him take me in the back of the car. We're lucky the cops didn't find us.\" She laughed drunkenly without a hint of shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie just stared at her, slack-jawed and regular awed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie continued. \"So then, the sun was coming up, so we stopped off for a light breakfast. Just a few pancakes and a few chugs of maple syrup. We got some sleep at his place, then he had to get ready for work, so he took off, I raided his host parents' fridge, got a cab, and here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just... ate through the entire night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And had sex. Plenty of sex. Oh my god, for a guy who's only slept with two women, that husband of mine is <i>talented</i>...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww, I don't wanna hear about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie chuckled. \"Oh like you and Hyde didn't have totally awesome cake-stuffed sex last night, am I right? I saw you girls pigging out. I'll bet Eric and Kelso got some action, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blushed. \"Yes, we <i>did </i>have sex, and it was <i>amazing</i>, and he didn't even <i>care </i>that I'd made a pig of myself. My Steven loves me, fat or thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled and patted her shoulder. \"Told ya he would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tender moment was interrupted when she let out an extra long belch that reverberated against the cinder block walls. She let out a sigh of relief and sank deeper into the couch. \"What a night...,\" she said in a husky voice. \"I can't for you and Hyde to get married so we can do this all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie rolled her eyes. \"Good god, how do you not have indigestion right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A belly of iron, l'il lady,\" she replied, slapping it all the way across. The great taut orb gurgled and sloshed with the sounds of her late night feast. She rubbed it gingerly. \"And hey, I kept my promise. Made it through the wedding without ruining the dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you just... waited until afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Details, details... Good god, I'm stuffed. I wish Fez were still here. All this weight in my stomach, pressing down... I need to be fucked so hard right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie went red again. \"Okay, that's nice. I think I'll just make tracks for next door...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie waved her off. \"Oh, don't get up!\" she drawled. \"I'll just... find a place to take a little nap until I've... digested this glorious <i>feast</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like watching a turtle that was stuck on it's shell try to right itself. She was stuck under that mammoth belly, trying to rock herself back and forth until she was in a sitting position. She pushed as hard as she could, but she was so utterly full that she couldn't even make her legs stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning to herself, Jackie got up from the couch and proceeded to haul Laurie forward, pulling with all her might, until at last, she had the bloated bimbo up on her feet. Both of them gasping for breath after this exertion, Laurie nodded a silent thanks to Jackie before turning and waddling back to Hyde's room. Jackie watched in a stupor as she swayed unsteadily, her massive stomach like a wrecking ball, until she made it to the doorway and disappeared inside. She heard the sound of something heavy hitting the springs, followed by another belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Jackie sat back down with her magazine and read in silence for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she didn't get very far because she started to hear very unsettling sounds coming from the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, Laurie gasping and groaning as if in pain. For a while, Jackie wondered if she had hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she heard her wail, \"Ohhhhhhh, <i>fuuuuuuuck</i>...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelping, Jackie tossed the magazine away and hurried out the door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week passed, and to everyone joy, the Vista Cruiser pulled into the driveway, signalling the return of Eric and Donna Forman. Except, of course, Donna had decided all her stationary would say Donna Pinnciotti-Forman. Everyone was there to welcome them home. Kitty and Bob were waiting with huge hugs. Red gave Donna a hug and Eric a handshake - and then told him the lawn needed mowing. Eric attempted to remind Red that he didn't live there anymore, but one foot-in-the-ass comment later, he was taking the mower for a walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Laurie, however, took an interest in Donna. They could tell the redhead had enjoyed the honeymoon considerably, not just from her smile, but also from her size. The buttons on her plaid shirt were a tad strained, and they were mentally trying to recall whether that particular shirt had fit when they last saw her in it. So naturally, they took her aside to Laurie's room for a bit of girl talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it like?\" Jackie asked eagerly. \"Did you meet anyone famous? Did you meet a movie star? Did you meet Johnny Carson?! Are we gonna be on the Tonight Show?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked in amusement. \"Er, in the order of the questions... Nice, no, no, no, and what the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you had a good time,\" said Laurie, breaking out her candy stash. It was usually just for her and Fez, but she figured he'd understand if she shared with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the best,\" Donna smiled, grabbing a candy bar. \"I swear, we did every touristy thing imaginable. Central Park, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Time Square... We even saw a homeless guy take a leak on the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New York, New York - it's a helluva town,\" Laurie chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie bit into some peanut butter cups. \"Yeah, I hope when Steven and I get married, we go somewhere classy. Like Paris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, I don't see Hyde going to Paris, France. Maybe Paris, <i>Tennessee</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked. \"So what else did you do?\" Donna opened her mouth. \"And <i>please</i>, leave out anything that involved having sex with my little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna closed her mouth. \"Well... not much else, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie closed her eyes in despair. \"Oh god... They'll have to burn the city to the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you must've done <i>something </i>else...,\" Laurie insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked down sheepishly. \"Well... we... went to a lot of restaurants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie raised an eyebrow. \"Oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... oh my god, there's so much to choose from in New York City! So many different countries represented by so many different cuisines! And it was like... I just couldn't get enough! I must've gained five pounds altogether from this honeymoon!\" She put both hands on her belly and jiggled it for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie chuckled. \"Yeah, you really put some miles on the ol' gut,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking,\" said Jackie dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking <i>about </i>who's talking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \"God, when did all three of us get addicted to food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just kinda happened,\" Laurie shrugged. \"But who's complaining? Food's awesome. And being fat is a major turn on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie snorted. \"I don't know about that. I admit, I don't mind it like I thought I would, but I don't think it's an aphrodisiac for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither,\" said Donna. Then, an impish smile crept across her face. \"Not that Eric's minded...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! What did we just get through talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on! Has <i>Hyde </i>minded the newer 'fluffier' Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie fidgeted for a few seconds as the memories of the wedding night came back to her, and she felt a small smile force its way onto her face. \"I mean... no, I guess... I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, you're like a shy little schoolgirl!\" Laurie squealed, patting her knee. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Steven gave me a belly rub the night after the wedding, and it led into sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Laurie squealed delightedly. \"Oh my god, that's so sweet!\" Donna gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! It's like... it was so sensual! I was so full! And he was on top of me, and I had his big strong hands on my stomach, and... oh god, I need to stop! I'm getting hot just thinking about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie laughed knowingly. \"I know the feeling. When I think about what Fez does to me when I'm overstuffed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I remember you practically having to roll yourself into the basement that morning. You wanna show Donna what happened to your dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god, how bad was it?\" Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her stomach appeared around the corner about three seconds before she and the rest of her dress did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie simply leaned back and patted her stomach with one hand while eating her fourth candy bar with the other. \"It was glorious. I just wish I'd known years ago what being fat would do to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd probably be so big you couldn't even move,\" Donna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, don't turn me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Jackie rolled their eyes disparagingly. But they had to admit, since she'd gotten fat, Laurie was happier than she'd ever been before. Hell, not just happier. She was a lot more helpful, caring and downright kind - things they never would have thought her capable of. So while it may not be completely healthy physically, it was certainly healthy mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey silently watched as Laurie absently lifted her shirt up, revealing her enormous swollen stomach underneath. They stared at how perfectly round it was - no folds or anything. Just a perfectly round belly. She rubbed it contentedly and smiled at them, and they realized she was watching them watch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, wordlessly, she held out the candy box for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, they all worked hard to finish it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All too soon, the joy of the wedding weeks were over. Eric and Donna were soon off in the Vista Cruiser back towards Madison for summer classes. That meant it was time to get back to the usual routine. Laurie resumed doing chores while Red recuperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, almost a year since it happened, the doctors had good news for the elder Forman - he was fully recovered and could go back to work now. In fact, he was already looking at purchasing an old disused muffler shop in town. He was looking forward to going back to work, having grown bored with \"relaxing\" and \"lowering his stress levels\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was now free to go back to work, that meant Kitty could finally cut back on hours at the hospital, which meant she was more readily available to do stuff around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant Laurie was more or less redundant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Red down at the shop and Kitty doing chores, she was without anything to do. She didn't mind at first, but after a few days, she got bored. Watching TV while she did laundry had been doing something. Watching TV while not doing laundry was just empty. She needed something to do. Some kind of task. She wished she hadn't wimped out of beauty school. But then again, maybe that was for the best. She loved working on her own hair - she wasn't sure about working on anyone else's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't forgotten about hers and Fez's plan to one day get a place together. It would have to be soon, seeing as how his host parents would figure out he'd graduated at some point and kick him out of their house. It also made her wonder where their <i>actual </i>kid was, but that wasn't their problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Fez was having no trouble with employment. He'd already left the hotel to take a job at a local salon as a shampoo boy. He was loving it there. She was tempted to look there, too, but as much as she loved Fez, she wasn't up for actually working in the same building as him all day. She liked having her own time so she could appreciate him at the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poured over the want ads. She knew she didn't want to go back to school. She wasn't even sure how she'd gotten into college in the first.... oh right. Sex. It was also sort of how she'd graduated high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered work at Fatso Burger, but she decided against that, too. She wasn't exactly good at the whole 'self-control' thing, so she would probably eat everything in sight. She briefly enjoyed that fantasy before deciding that food services were not the answer. She also toyed with the idea of Price Mart, for as a cashier, she wouldn't be as tempted as she'd be too busy ringing up groceries to eat them, but the pay was the barest of minimum wage. If she wanted to pay half the rent, she'd have to find something a bit trickier, therefore ensuring better pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, she found a want ad for a receptionist at an office building. Requirements included good people skills, organizational skills, filing, typing, talking on the phone, etc. She looked at the company details. It was a temp agency. Small office building uptown. And the pay looked good, not to mention the dental insurance. Deciding it was worth a try, she set up an interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there a few days later, she made sure she looked professional. She used what money she had saved to purchase a dark blue pantsuit, hoping it looked professional enough. She used the fake charm she'd so finely honed over the years to ensure she stood out among the applicants, showcasing her people skills and generally being very amiable. And okay, she may have flirted lightly with the interviewer and failed to mention she was happily married, but there'd be time for that revelation later. She did very well, and they said they'd be happy to have her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with her day's work, she strolled out the door and looked around happily, taking in the area around her job. She liked what she saw. A few fast food joints, a gas station loaded with sugary snacks, and a discount clothing store. She would need discount clothes after all the eating she'd be doing at the other places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her reflection in a shop window and couldn't help but feel proud of herself. After so much time wearing jeans, sweats and t-shirts, it felt good to be wearing nice clothes and taking some pride in her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just hoped that her office chair was sturdy enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for a trip to the nearby Wendy's. Celebration was in order.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Laurie was comfortable at her new job, she and Fez agreed that it was time to start looking for their apartment. This was not an easy task, but they didn't need a big place. Just big enough for the two of them to be comfortable and not have to hang around the Forman house all day. Red was always eager to have less kids hanging around the house, so he was quick to offer any money to help them out. While Fez felt a little odd accepting money from his father-in-law, Laurie was more than happy to do so. As much as she'd learned and grown in the past year, she would always have that small part of her that knew how to work the \"daddy's little girl\" angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer than expected to find a place, however. First, there was a matter of finding someplace affordable. Even small apartments were a bit pricey, they found. They also wanted something not too far away from the main group. With Eric and Donna off in Madison, they didn't want to fracture the group too much. Plus, it needed to be a reasonable distance from their jobs. They needed to save money on gas, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe search took place during the better part of the summer. During the early part, lots of things happened that were crazy and exciting enough to prevent it from being boring. First, Brooke finally had hers and Kelso's baby, a beautiful little girl named Betsy. Sadly, Brooke had been talked into moving back to Chicago to live with her mother. Kelso was saddened, but he also agreed that since he was off to the police academy, it would be good for her to have extra help in raising the child. She also agreed to visit once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that, they made the discovery that Hyde's dad, Bud, was not in fact his dad, but some rich businessman named William Barnett. Imagine everyone's surprise when he turned out to be black as well. Thankfully, after a slightly awkward start, they soon hit it off with their shared love of government conspiracies and \"circles\". Turned out he owned a chain of record shops named \"Grooves\", and he got Hyde a job running the Point Place shop, which the gang loved because they could hang out and jam while he made money. Naturally, Jackie was both proud of his success and thrilled her boyfriend was suddenly from money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd during all this, Laurie was still steadily gaining weight. Thankfully, most of her work was done from behind a desk, so movement wasn't an issue. She typically wore dresses as well, so her belly was free to grow as desired with discomfort. She frequented all the fast food joints in the area, a different one per day. Plus, there were always snacks to enjoy at work. Seemed someone was always bringing doughnuts, and Laurie always ate whatever ones were put out. After all, she was a workin' girl, and she needed to stay fed so she could focus on work. Otherwise, she'd be all whiny and pouty, and that didn't make for good business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well into September 1979 that she and Fez finally had a breakthrough. An apartment had become available uptown, not far from work, and a decent distance from the Forman house and the record store. It was a small place, one bedroom, one bath, but it was nice, clean and within their price range. Of course, it turned out Fez had a longstanding rivalry with the landlord, Fenton, but Red soon put a stop to any infighting when he made it clear he would not let anyone stand in his little girl's way. They were free to move in within a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all set by October. Red and Kitty donated some furniture, as did Bob and Joanne, creating an interesting clash of styles that gave the place it's own feel. Naturally, there was a housewarming party. Hyde, Jackie and Kelso all brought beer and snacks. Kitty brought a casserole. They even invited WB in the hopes it would make him feel like part of the family. He, of course, didn't know them well enough to bring a decent gift, so he just gave them cash. As soon as they counted the amount, Laurie knew she should invite him over more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the night, after everyone else had gone home and Fez was tidying up, Laurie went to take a shower. She reached behind the counter and pulled out the new bathroom scale she'd gotten for herself recently. She stood upon it, sucking in her considerable gut to see the number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n224<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her petite frame, this was pretty big. She looked at herself in the mirror. Her huge breasts, her engorged belly, her ballooning ass, her thunderous thighs... She smiled slightly at the sight, unable to help feeling pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a tiny bit of excitement shot through her - the holidays were coming up! All the more opportunities for a good gorge! So much feasting to be had! So much to consume! Eating and drinking as the weather cooled! She couldn't wait! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie looked herself up and down in the mirror. She felt a little silly dressed as a giant pumpkin for Halloween, but it was the only costume she could find that fit her at the moment. It was supposed to be stuffed with foam, but she was so big now, she didn't need it. She was supposed to put on orange face paint as well, but she felt dumb enough. But Fez had wanted to do costumes this year, so she went with it. Her parents were throwing a Halloween party - why her dad would ever agree to such a thing eluded her - and they were all going. Laurie loved a good party. Food and booze galore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez stepped out of the bedroom in his costume - Willy Wonka, king of all candy and Fez's hero. He gave the purple coat a twirl and tipped his chocolate brown top hat. \"Are you ready to depart, my lovely? We have so little to do and so much time!\" He pretended he'd made a mistake. \"No, wait. Strike that. Reverse it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked. He was so cute sometimes. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm ready. Just hope nobody decides to make me into a pie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they do, I'll have the Oompa Loompas attack them. Now come! Let us be off! To the candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smiled as she followed him out the door. Candy was definitely going to be the main course tonight. She didn't care how she got it. She just wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the Forman house, the place was decorated with orange and black streamers, a few plastic jack-o-lanterns and bowls of chips, sodas and beers. Kitty was frantically scurrying around the house, dressed as one of Dracula's brides, while Red himself was dressed as Dracula, complete with fake blood dripping down his chin. Ah, so this was all about scaring the neighborhood punks. Should've guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everyone started showing up. Hyde was dressed as a pirate, albeit at the bare minimum with only a plastic sword and belt, captain's hat and eye patch over his usual clothes. Jackie was dressed as his wench, her considerable potbelly protruding proudly over her belt. Kelso showed up later with a visiting Brooke and Betsy. He was dressed as Emmett Kelly the clown, while she was dressed as a lady clown, and little Betsy in a clown onesie - being too young for face paint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing she was too young for - trick or treating. Kelso understood that, as a child only a few months old, she wasn't old enough to properly take part in candy gathering - she wasn't even on solid food yet. But Brooke had agreed that, as it wasn't too cold, and as long as they had her back at a reasonable hour, they could take her out trick-or-treating. Fez and Laurie, of course, wanted to come along as well, carrying buckets for the candy. If Betsy couldn't eat candy, they'd just have to do it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for them, Betsy was big on the adorability factor, and she was already pretty good at smiling, even if she didn't have a clue what was going on. This got a lot of people practically fawning over her and pouring loads of candy into the buckets. Most places only had the small \"fun size\" candies, but there were also a few that had gone for the full-size candy as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amazed them how much candy they got based on a five-month-old's cute outfit and toothless smile. Both buckets were nearly half-full by the time they had rounded the block. One thing that took them by surprise, though, was when they came to a house where no one was home, but they'd left out a full bowl of bite-size chocolate bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hot damn,\" Laurie exclaimed. \"Jackpot! Load 'em up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez eagerly grabbed the bowl and started to fill up the buckets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure we're only supposed to take one,\" Brooke said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Brooke!\" Laurie replied snottily. \"This is the chance they take! Besides, who's gonna find out? It's the perfect crime! We're already in disguise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She speaks with wisdom,\" Fez agreed, finishing his pouring. He picked up his bucket and grunted under the weight, the plastic handle warping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what a haul,\" admired Kelso. \"We're gonna be the envy of every kid in Point Place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel bad just taking all of it,\" said Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie handed her a Three Musketeers. \"Here. Maybe that'll make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke looked at it for a long moment, then sighed and took the candy bar, taking a bite out of it. \"Damn you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking triumphantly, Laurie led Fez over to the next house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso stood with Brooke, Betsy in his arms, watching her munch on the candy bar. \"So... does this mean if I give you candy, you'll do stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... not even... y'know... that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke looked at him for a long moment, then felt a small amused smile on her lips. \"Well... I'm not ruling anything out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night wound on, but all too soon, it was time for them to head back so Betsy could have her nap. Fez and Laurie reluctantly agreed, even though their massive buckets were loaded to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are never going to be able to finish all that,\" laughed Kelso. \"Take it from someone who's tried to live on candy. At some point, you just start throwing up and you have to see a dentist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, moron,\" Laurie sneered. \"We're not gonna eat it all in one sitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" agreed Fez. \"This shall last us until at least after Thanksgiving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I mean, that's an optimistic viewpoint, but yeah, longer than tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they went back to the Forman house and set the candy aside to partake in party games with everyone else. Fez was an absolute master at bobbing for apples. Jackie somehow made it through an entire bowl of dip with only one bag of chips. At one point, Brooke left Betsy with an eager Mrs Forman so she and Kelso could disappear and ... do things. All in all, it was a good Halloween party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive back to their place was slightly awkward as Fez was driving with one hand and unwrapping candy with the other. Fortunately, they made it home alive. They got out of the costumes, had a sexy shower together, and then watched a hokey scary sci-fi flick on TV. They sat there, with Fez noticeably frightened by the cheesy special effects, while Laurie reclined with her head in his lap, letting him feed her candy. He took some for himself, naturally, because he was an addict, but he loved her enough to share the bulk of it with her. Laurie ate piece after piece. Peanut butter cups, Kit Kats, M&amp;Ms, Snickers, Hershey Bars, they all were gobbled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez finally couldn't stand the horror movies anymore and decided to turn in early, but Laurie elected to stay up a little longer and enjoy a few more. Robot Monster came on - a schlocky black-and-white fifties flick about an alien gorilla with a deep-sea diving helmet on who wandered around trying to invade Earth - and she continued eating the candy. She ate and ate and ate well past midnight. The resultant sugar buzz was pleasant for a while, but as she finally made it halfway through the bucket, she began to notice that she wasn't really getting that \"pleasantly full\" feeling she enjoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was feeling a little sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was three thirds of the way through the bucket, she was feeling very sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up on the couch, hearing her stomach make rather frightening gurgling sounds. She laid there for a long time, whimpering a bit as she rubbed her belly and silently wishing that Fez would wake up and come back to rub it for her. God, she hardly ever felt like this. Bloated, achy, sickly, like she wanted to barf... She hoped she wouldn't. It'd be a waste of dedicated trick-or-treating. She was scared to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had to, if only to get to the cabinet. She had lots of antacids. It was a necessity when your hobby was overeating. Hopefully, they would help in a chocolate overdose situation. Just a matter of making it there with the contents of her stomach remaining inside. She gently got into a sitting position and forced herself up, listening to her stomach bubble as she did. A small belch broke free, but she managed to remain calm. Any anxiety would just make it worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her stomach in a circular motion as she made it to the cabinet and got out the antacids. She got a glass of water, let them dissolve therein, and gulped it all down. God, those tasted weird. She settled herself back down in an easy chair, trying to relax. Her stomach continued to hurt for a long time, and she continued to let out those little burps, worried one of them would end messily, but thankfully, nothing happened. After half an hour of sitting still, the stomachache finally dissolved, and she felt well enough to make her way to the bedroom and join her husband in some much-needed slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got comfortable in bed next to him, she realized this was the first time in a while she'd done a major stuffing and it hadn't gone all that well. It was a good lesson that too much candy was not good for a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that's not the lesson she took from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she believed that she was loosing her ability to eat massive amounts of food. That simply wouldn't do. Not when Thanksgiving was a few weeks away. She was looking forward joining her family in a massive all-day gorge-athon. She was going to wear a dress that was slightly too big so she could grow into it while she was at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she'd just have to do something about this. She was going to start \"prepping\" for Thanksgiving. She would get her stomach used to holding gargantuan meals again, increasing their size every time. She smiled eagerly at the thought as she slipped off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few weeks were epic for Laurie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day between Halloween and Thanksgiving, she made it a point to eat as much as she could every single day. She'd make big sandwiches for her lunch breaks. She'd stop off at a few fast food joints on the way home, supersizing every order. Double cheeseburgers, extra-large fries, large milkshakes, all gave their lives to the cause of preparing her for her Thanksgiving feast. She munched and guzzled and slurped and chomped her way through each and every meal. Each and every fast food drive thru attendant soon began to recognize her voice through their staticy intercoms as she drove through and ordered her latest feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her delight, Laurie soon found that she wasn't experiencing the same overstuffed misery of Halloween night. That \"pleasantly full\" feeling she got from each meal was comfortably achieved. So even though her stomach was probably primed for Thanksgiving by the end of the first week, that didn't stop her from supersizing it every day after that. There was still so much fast food to eat fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of all that grease and salt she was consuming, she also had dinner with Fez at home. After cheap and quick food in public, she'd come home to find nicely-grilled chicken or porkchops waiting for her, with a variety of vegetables, fruits and grains to consume. In his spare time, since he'd learned his wife was quite the glutton when she wanted to be, Fez had decided he'd better learn to cook, and Laurie was all too happy to taste everything he made. Their dinners were small, considering they were on a budget, but combined with what she was putting away before reaching home, Laurie would slouch away from the table more than stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days turned to weeks, and Laurie's appetite grew, so did her waistline. Her clothes quickly became very tight, to the point that the button on her \"fat jeans\" finally burst off on the way home from Burger King. She was half-startled and half-aroused by the sight of her stomach springing forward and planting itself firmly against the steering wheel. She looked around the car at the dozens of fast food bags and wrappers. She had definitely done a good job training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her office didn't have the strictest dress code, and she was behind a desk most of the time, Laurie got a pair of stretch pants to accommodate her growing gut. She briefly toyed with maternity pants, but that seemed a step too far. She got some cute colorful stretch pants that had plenty of give and no buttons to pop off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got nearer to the big day, Laurie decided one evening - after consuming two cheeseburgers, half a dozen doughnuts, a pint of ice cream and a large Dr Pepper - to get out the scale once again and see what she weighed. She stripped down to her underwear and stood on the scale. She had to hold her gut back just to see where the little needle came to a stop. She peered down in silent wonder as it halted by a number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n245<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth hung open in stupefied silence. That was unbelievable. She'd gained over twenty pounds in just a few short weeks. She hefted her massive stomach in her hands. It was so perfectly round. She looked at her meaty fingers, her thick juicy arms, her gargantuan boobs... She turned around and admired that huge fat ass in the mirror. She smiled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, she was sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also damn, she was full. She couldn't stand for much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled off to the living room to join Fez for some late night snuggling. The big day was almost upon her. She was ready for it.</span></div></div>",

She put on a nice dress that had plenty of give, so she'd be able to eat to her heart's content. And food aside, she was looking forward to catching up with family. Eric and Donna would be returning once again, while Kelso had invited Brooke and Betsy, along with - as a token of goodwill - Brooke's mother. He was hoping that by having her over, she'd see that he was a good father and would be okay with Brooke eventually moving back to Point Place. Hope sprang eternal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived around 3:00. The game was on, so most of the guys were in the living room, reacting to whatever nonsense was currently going on. Laurie could rarely keep her eyes open during sports. She casually poked her head in the room and greeted her father, along with Bob and a few other men in her family. She rolled her eyes at their antics as they cheered on the game before crossing to the kitchen where she found Kitty and Joanne and a few other women working away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Laurie! Good! You're here! Keep an eye on those yams for me! I need to make sure the turkey's okay!\" Kitty scurried away, trying to do several things at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie raised an eyebrow, but did as she was asked. \"Fez, why don't you join my dad in the living room and watch football?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez winced. \"I do not care for football. Or sitting with your dad. Especially <i>during </i>football. He'll only get mad when I don't cheer correctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanne chuckled. \"Sweetie, it's the Cowboys versus the Oilers. Your father-in-law only cares about the Packers. You're going to be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez looked nervous, but he went into the living room all the same, just as there was a massive group cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll eat him for breakfast,\" Joanne sighed, going back to making stuffing. \"So... how're things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged as she helped move food around. \"Good,\" she said amiably. \"They're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apartment's not too bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a nice place. Love the furniture you gave us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good... Looking forward to dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie bit back a small smile. \"Yeah, I guess so... Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're practically drooling over the devilled eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie quickly backed away from the food in question and tried to look innocent. \"What?! I mean... it just looks good! That's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanne smirked knowingly. \"I know, I know... Can't wait to stuff yourself at the table, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... well, I mean...\" Dammit, Laurie wasn't used to feeling flustered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. You're not alone,\" Joanne continued, patting her own stomach. \"Got my elastic waistband pants on today. One of the reasons we agreed to Brooke's mom coming over is she's going to bring a few dishes as well. We're guaranteeing there will be more than enough to go around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smile widened. \"So we're all just gonna go nuts today, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There won't be a buttoned pair of pants in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the sliding door slid open, and in walked Hyde carrying a bag of groceries. \"Okay, I couldn't find shiitake mushrooms, so I got Uncle Ben,\" he said, setting the bag on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Steven,\" Joanne said, already rooting through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jackie came scurrying in with another bag, wrapped up in her coat. \"Steven - when your girlfriend has a bag of groceries, you're supposed to carry it for her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde shrugged. \"I already had one. Felt like sharing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie glared at him and put the bag down on the counter before huffing away. \"Come on, Laurie,\" she grumbled. \"Let's go to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie allowed herself to be grabbed by the arm and dragged upstairs towards her old room. She wasn't surprised to see how bare it was, save for the old bed and make up table. Clearly, her mother had plans for this room. She'd already started making Eric's old room into a sewing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie got out of her hat, scarf and overcoat. Laurie couldn't help but be impressed by what was hidden underneath. She was wearing a lovely dinner dress that had the loveliest bulge in the middle. Her pot belly had grown since she'd last seen it. She looked at least four months pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Steven is so annoying sometimes! He doesn't know how to be a gentleman at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, how dare he expect you to carry a single bag of groceries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I had a half-gallon of milk in mine! You don't think that's asking just a <i>bit </i>too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you must be out of shape if you're whining about <i>that</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked affronted, which just made her double chin more prominent. \"I'll have you know I'm in perfect shape! I'm just... you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie playfully poked her friend's belly. \"Round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie swatted her away and put her hands over her stomach. \"No... I mean, yes... I just... Ugh. Don't men just bug you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You and Fez never fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure, once in a while, but then we have makeup sex, and it's all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shook her head. \"Man, who would've thought you and Fez would be the most stable couple ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged. \"Definitely not me. But here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door, and they turned to see it creak open, and Donna looked inside. \"Hey, Hyde said you were both in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, thank god,\" Jackie sighed with relief, walking over to her. \"You will not believe the crap Steven puts me through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard about the single bag of groceries,\" Donna deadpanned, walking all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they could all get a look at each other, Laurie noticed that Donna, while definitely dressed nicely, was also sporting some extra poundage since the last time they'd seen her - which, if remembered correctly, was just after their honeymoon back in May. She looked so utterly plump. Slightly bigger than Jackie, but not quite up to Laurie's girth. And unlike Jackie, who seemed to be gaining more in the gut, Donna was gaining a bit all over, but her ass was looking particularly voluptuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookin' good there, Big D,\" Laurie remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blushed. \"Yeah, well... More like Big DD now,\" she said, holding her massive boobs up for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie raised an eyebrow. \"Still stress eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda? I mean... things are starting to get better at school now. I just... I really like eating lately, y'know? Like, all the time. Lately, I've had this thing for Italian food, like pasta. And there are so many carbs in pasta, but it's so good. There's this little Italian place not far from campus. Eric and I go there once a week.\" She paused, sheepish, before adding, \"And sometimes, I go there by myself. Their lasagna is amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice,\" said Jackie. \"Me, I didn't realize until lately, but I've got a serious sweet tooth. I've started keeping pints of ice cream in the deep freeze buried under all the popsicles and stuff. And oh my god, it's like I can never have enough doughnuts! There's this little bakery in town that makes the best doughnuts. I once got a dozen just to tide me over for a few days. I finished them all in two hours.\" She patted her stomach. \"I swear, I've gained so much lately, I could probably beat Eric or Fez at arm wrestling. I mean, we'd have been pretty evenly matched before, but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked. \"I just can't get enough of everything,\" she said, running her hands up and down her side rolls. \"There's so much food out there to choose from. I'm like the ultimate omnivore - a strict 'all-of-the-above' lady. I see it. I eat it. The end. It's just the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you're not picky,\" Donna chuckled. \"Dinner's gonna be interesting, I take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you better believe it. I've been training for weeks, in case you couldn't tell,\" she said, hefting her belly under her dress. \"Trying to make my stomach stretch out more and more so I can eat myself into a coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief,\" said Jackie. \"I was honestly worried I'd be the only porker at this party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! Are you kidding?\" scoffed Donna. \"I think we might as well face it, girls. We're fat chicks now. To hell with traditional body standards. We like good food, and nothing will stop us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right,\" said Laurie proudly. \"Now let's see about dinner, shall we?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three ladies made their way downstairs just as Hyde was opening the front door for Kelso, Brooke, Betsy and Brooke's mother. Laurie took a moment to observe the group. Kelso and Hyde were already talking about something stupid - as was their habit - while Brooke was greeting Mrs Forman and introducing her to her mother, but Mrs Forman was too busy fussing over Betsy to take much notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two men chattered and the two moms fawned, Laurie beckoned to Brooke to join them. Brooke patted her mom's shoulder and followed them into the kitchen. Right away, they saw the amount of food simmering on the stove and already laid out in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, this looks amazing,\" said Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, it's always amazing how it comes together every year, but man - your mom went into overdrive,\" agreed Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded. \"Well, she's got extra help from Joanne this year. The two of them going at it together doubles the food output right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my mom has loads of food in tupperware containers waiting in the car,\" added Brooke with a knowing grin. \"She was actually kind of happy to be cooking so 'little' this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" laughed Donna. \"We're all gonna have to be rolled out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke rubbed her own stomach. Even though she was no longer pregnant, it still protruded considerably, albeit in a much more flabby fashion. \"God, you know, I was always kind of hoping to get back in shape after I gave birth, but it's like... I enjoy sitting around doing nothing, y'know? And mom helps so much with Betsy, and she's always doting on me... I feel like I'm going to just regain all the weight soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie put an arm around her. \"Welcome to the club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty suddenly came scurrying into the kitchen and started working again, taking things out of the oven and sticking things in the microwave. \"Oh, girls, it's so wonderful having everyone over for Thanksgiving! I swear, we'll be swimming in leftovers for weeks!\" She let out her trademark laugh before hurrying over to the fridge. \"Oh dear, I think I got too much whipped cream... Oh well! We'll find a use for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna peered into the fridge. \"Mrs Forman, there's, like, ten cans in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. They were on sale. I wonder if it'll go good on turkey... Oh, never mind. That's what gravy is for. I swear, I must've made half a gallon of the stuff. Joanne keeps adding things, though, so that helps. And your mother, Brooke, brought some scrumptious-looking casserole. I hope she doesn't mind me interrogating her for the recipe later!\" She laughed again before going back into master chef overdrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all wisely decided to stand back for now. The wonderful odors wafting from the dishes before them were driving them each a bit insane. They decided they would hang out with the guys in the basement until it was time to start eating. But even as they departed, their bellies were rumbling. They compensated for their hunger by getting popsicles out of the deep freeze. Maybe they could tide them over until it was time to start eating.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At last, the waiting was over, and it was time to partake in some Thanksgiving feasting. The tables were all put together throughout the living room, with plenty of room for everyone. They stared in amazement at the amount of food that sat upon the table. It was a wonder the tables weren't about to collapse under their immense weight. They all took their seats 'round the table, all couples paired off in their spots - Eric and Donna, Hyde and Jackie, Fez and Laurie, and Kelso and Brooke sat towards the end with Betsy's highchair between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty had Red say grace, during which he thanked the lord for their health, their togetherness and for allowing football to be played on Thanksgiving, and then, it was time to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Laurie felt paralyzed. She'd dreamed of this moment for so long. Where was she supposed to start? But then, to her relief, Fez started spooning food onto her plate, and she began to relax, rubbing her stomach eagerly. It amazed her how hungry she was. She'd been holding back all day. The joy of what was to come had been exhausting. Now that it was actually here, it was like she was in a dream. So much food to consume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around the table as she started getting food for herself. Donna was already piling on the extra food, while Jackie was pouring gravy all over everything she'd already accumulated. She glanced down at Brooke, who, while also tending to Betsy's needs, was also loading up on whatever she could reach. Kelso was actually being very attentive as he took over feeding their daughter so she could focus on food for a while. She licked her lips and continued piling stuff onto her plate. God, there must be eight different kinds of potatoes alone. She poured on the gravy and slathered on the butter. She fidgeted in her seat - her ass was slightly uncomfortable now that it had started spilling over the sides. Maybe next year, she'd need <i>two </i>chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that thought just made her even more excited, and that made her hungrier. She couldn't wait anymore. With an absolute heap of meat and sauces on her plate, she dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the table, most of the adults were talking about what was going on in their lives. Kelso practically gushed about how things were going with Betsy, Bob and Joanne were talking about taking a cruise later in the year, Eric was doing well in college and on his way to becoming a teacher, and Hyde said the record store was doing great, even though with 1980 around the corner, he wasn't sure what to make of some of the more recent developments in music. Jackie, of course, was all over the new music, which just confirmed everyone's fears that it was crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chipped in about her journalism major occasionally, but she was too focused on eating right now to care much. She worked so hard in college that it was fun to finally kick back and consume. She ate with a reckless abandon she hadn't known herself capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was more or less silent as she consumed food herself. She had been smart not to put on anything too restricting. She knew what this holiday was about. She wasn't about to let her fabulous clothes get in the way of the glorious free for all laid out before her. A little turkey here, some butter-soaked cornbread there, a few spoonfuls of stuffing to the left, a gravy-drenched blob of mashed potatoes to the right... She was in hog heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke was putting in her fair share as well. Maybe it was from having to tend to a baby for the last few months, but she hadn't really had a lot of opportunity to eat much except snack food and whatever her mother got her. She relished the thought of consuming plenty of real food. God, there was a lot right now. She had a huge pile of turkey on her plate, and she was determined to eat as much of it as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went on, for what felt like hours. Huge portions of food going 'round and 'round, seemingly in a never-ending cycle. Once they'd made a sizeable dent in their plates, something else would be passed down that would prompt them to fill up the hole they'd made. Still so much more to eat, eat, eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the people seated around the table began to get full and finish. Everyone was content to stay at the table and chat, though, about whatever came to mind from current events to distant memories. And that was good, because the four girls were still stuffing their faces. There was still so much to eat. How could anyone be done yet? Cranberry sauce, scalloped potatoes, green beans, casserole, sausage, glazed ham, stuffing, potato salad, steamed carrots...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no end in sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, all good things come to an end. One by one, they all began to have their fill. Brooke dropped off first, absolutely crammed full, with her face covered in cranberry sauce and gravy. A few minutes later, Jackie gave up next, pushing her at last empty plate away with a grunt, hands atop her now-enormous belly and a sleepy pout of on her face. Fifteen minutes later, Donna had had enough as well, letting out a quiet sigh as she reached under the table to cradle her overstuffed belly in her hands, rubbing it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Laurie was the only one left. She made sure to laugh when everyone else laughed, like she was really engaged in whatever conversation or anecdote was taking place, but really, her mind was on keeping her plate full. The other girls kept watching her out of the corner of their eyes, keeping an eye on how much she ate. She just kept going back for more. More turkey, more stuffing, more potatoes. God, how many carbs could one girl consume? The bloated blonde babe was sweating and almost certainly slowing down, but there were no signs of stopping yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie's stomach, meanwhile, was stretching to almost inhuman lengths. It was getting stretched to the point her loose dress was actually starting to feel tight. But she couldn't be done yet. There was still so much left. And she'd waited for this day - trained for this day - for so many weeks. She'd finally admitted it to herself that she was an utter and complete glutton. Before, she'd been obsessed with sex and having it no matter what. Now, she was obsessed with food and eating it no matter what. And she wasn't about to quit just because she was swollen like a beachball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she felt something pressing against her stomach. Something smooth but hard. She peered down to find that it was the edge of the table. She'd actually eaten enough that her stomach was pressing against the edge of the table. She felt that tingling sensation downstairs as she realized just how sexy this was. But she also realized just how utterly stuffed she felt. Not to mention tired. All that turkey... crammed into this humongous stomach of hers. She finally laid down her fork, placing both hands atop her rock hard belly. That was easily the most she'd ever consumed. A cursory glance at the clock showed that it was an hour and a half later that when they'd all started. She'd been eating nonstop for a solid ninety minutes at least. She held back a burp and got as comfortable as she could. Good lord, even leaning back, her stomach was still pressing against the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely got a few minutes in to relax before the door suddenly burst open, and in walked Kitty with a tray of pumpkin pies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Who's ready for dessert?\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls sat up a little straighter at the word, and that just made their stomachs slosh slightly as their contents shifted. There was so much pie now. More than enough for everyone. And it smelled amazing. Looked delicious. Kitty took a can of whipped cream and put little dollops on each slice. Their mouths watered. And even better, scoops of ice cream were being placed alongside each slice that got passed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, Jackie and Brooke each took a piece. They were so utterly stuffed, they weren't sure if they could do it. But dammit, it looked so good, they were going to try anyway. Just got to get those single slices down, and they'd be fine. Easier said than done, though. Getting each bite into their mouths was a challenge. All of them clutching their full bellies, rubbing them and taking deep breaths between each bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, of course, was hardly going to stop at just one. Not that it wasn't difficult for her to do, so dangerously overstuffed, but she was hardly going to give up. She took the first piece and slowly ate it, but then, as everyone was listening another one of her dad's war stories - just as good a sleeping potion as tryptophan - she managed to hook one of the pie tins with her fork and drag it closer. Still about three-quarters of pie left. She'd quickly make short order of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, Jackie and Brooke all came out of their misery just long enough to glance up and notice what Laurie was doing. Good god, the woman was going to finish off an almost entire pie with a stomach as big and bloated as that?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laurie was undeterred. She ate. No giving up. No fear. Just ate. Ate every last bit of pie. It took ten minutes, but she did it. The pie was soon completely and utterly consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie slumped in her seat again. This time, her stomach was so huge that it didn't just bulge against the table, it seemed to bulge onto the table a little bit. Maybe it was just the bad posture, but her stomach was so bloated, it was a miracle she hadn't exploded by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty announced it was time to start cleaning up and put things away, shooing everyone away to sleep off their meals. Red and Bob both collapsed onto the couch to take a little nap. Eric, Hyde and Fez found themselves roped into helping with dish duty while Kelso stayed behind to help Brooke's mom put Betsy down for her nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left the four bloated females around the table, all clutching their bellies of varying sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, in their opinion, a truly wonderful Thanksgiving.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a long time before anyone felt like leaving the table. The four women just sat there, rubbing their bellies and quietly hiccuping or burping when the mood struck them. There were some feeble attempts to move, but none of them felt like it truly. They just leaned back in a stuffed stupor, silently wishing for the transporter beam from Star Trek to beam them up and put them to bed. That's what they needed - to lie down, propped up by pillows, and digest this insane onslaught they'd dared to call dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Joanne worked away at the wreckage of dinner, tidying away the dishes and leftovers. As she came over to take away Laurie's plate, Joanne winked broadly at the bloated blonde. \"Impressive work,\" she whispered. \"I remember a time when I could put that much away.\" She slapped her now-stuffed stomach for emphasis before departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie didn't reply. She was too dazed. It was like being drunk, but somehow more... pleasant. She felt... cozy. Like, as if swallowing a bowling ball had made any stress completely melt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, Jackie and Brooke all began to stir, however. They were a bit uncomfortable from sitting for so long and felt like moving. Red and Bob were still passed out on the sofa. The guys were by now down in the basement for a post-Thanksgiving \"Circle\". Kitty and Joanne were working in the kitchen. Not a lot of options except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio glanced at each other nervously across the table. They were to stuffed move upstairs. Definitely too drowsy. But they didn't want to stay down here for too long. They wanted to lie down and take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, Donna decided to be the first one to try. She scooted her chair back and determinedly hoisted herself up, bracing against the chair, until she was finally back on her feet. She took a moment to stare at how enormous her stomach was. Probably twice as big as when she'd arrived. She let out a deep breath as she peered down at the rounded bulge, noting the rolls of fat creating a dent in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was next. The usually perky brunette moaned slightly as she hauled herself onto her feet. She was surprised by her knees knocking as she tried to summon the necessary strength. Her own stomach also seemed to have doubled in size, perfectly spherical, like she was pregnant with twins. Her dress looked like it was covering a beach ball. She held it in her hands, accentuating the curve and looked very pouty as she tried to soothe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke struggled as well. While she hadn't been as big as them when she arrived, she was definitely looking pregnant again now. She had surprised herself with how much she'd put away. She had thought that her milk-engorged breasts would be causing her problems, but now she was even more in danger of tipping over forwards thanks to this gut of hers being so heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them looked at each other's stomachs in silent wonder. How were they capable of consuming so much in one sitting? How were they not exploding all over the place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all eyes fell to Laurie. They saw her, slumped in her chair, practically asleep. Her face was covered in various juices and sauces - although how she'd gotten through that without staining her clothes was nothing short of a miracle. She had both hands on her stomach, which looked as though it could double as a globe. A really big globe. It rose and fell with every labored breath. Her mouth hung open ever so slightly in a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing they couldn't just leave her there, all three women decided they would have to move her themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, this was gonna suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna came around and pulled Laurie's chair back, heaving her gut out from under the table, revealing it to be slightly bigger than it had seemed initially. Then, with Brooke's help, she lifted Laurie out of her seat, and they both draped an arm over their shoulders to help her stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jackie guiding them like she was guiding an airplane to the terminal, they all made their way for the stairs. It was a very long walk. Laurie was moaning quietly and not helping at all. Her massive stomach swung back and forth like a mighty wrecking ball with every step. Groaning and complaining, they waddled their way up the stairs towards Laurie's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took almost twenty minutes, but they did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie opened the door, and they all got inside. They got their shoes off and looked over the room. The bed was clearly big enough for two of them. Figuring that Laurie was in such a stupor that she wouldn't care where she slept, it was democratically decided three to one that she would sleep on the floor. Fortunately, Kitty had added several decorative pillows to the bed, so they laid her out on her back and placed a few under her head for support. Jackie and Brooke would share the bed, while Donna took the remaining pointless pillows to sleep on the floor as well. Fortunately, it was still the same plush carpeting as before, so it wasn't nearly as bad as it could've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four bloated beauties lay in companionable silence. They were well and truly rooted to their respective spots. They lay perfectly still, not wanting to jostle their bellies too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her spot on the floor, Donna discreetly lifted her dress to peer down at her overweight body. God, she had so many rolls. Like little hills and bunkers of fat. She ran her hands up and down them, enjoying the feeling as her fingers caressed every bulge of flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie felt a small whimper in the back of her throat as she silently wished Steven were here to give her another belly rub. Of course, that would just make her want sex, and she was in no fit state to hold hands, never mind any hanky panky tomfoolery. God, she was practically pinned under this overstuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke was still marvelling at her unbridled gluttony. She really hadn't expected that. But it had been so... liberating. She had always been the smart girl. The valedictorian. The brainy beauty. The sensible one. And now... she lay stuffed and bloated with three other women. How did this happen? She peered down at her rounded stomach and gave it a rub. Not that she minded. She liked these girls, and she liked the group. And she loved being able to eat all the time. Maybe she could put off losing the pregnancy weight for just a bit longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, meanwhile, had a brain full of mush. She couldn't think. Couldn't speak. Hell, she could barely breathe. This had been everything she hoped for and more. God, she was fat. If one small thought could work its way through her tryptophan-riddled brain and make itself known, it was that. She was so fat. And she was going to get even fatter after this. She wanted to feel like this all the time. So fat and bloated she couldn't move without assistance. That her stomach stuck straight up in the air, inflated like a balloon, filled with juicy delicious food that she had <i>forced </i>herself to eat. Until she had to be rolled away from the table. Until she got so wide she was wedged in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as her stomach towered over her. It rose and fell. It gurgled and sloshed as it struggled with digestion. She let a dopey smile split across her face. This was bliss. True heaven. To be so utterly gorged and fit to burst. To just lie here and gurgle away. She wanted to reach up and rub her stomach, but she couldn't get her arms to work. She felt so helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she loved it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna awoke some considerable time later, still feeling a bit bloated. She rolled over and was surprised to find a blanket covering her that hadn't been there when she fell asleep. Curious, she looked around the room, forcing her eyes to adjust to the darkness. She saw Laurie still on the floor, lying flat on her back, arms splayed out and her stomach still poking straight up like she'd swallowed a basketball, but she had a blanket over her, too. She could make out Jackie and Brooke passed out on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted the blanket off and rolled over. She could feel the contents of her stomach sloshing as she moved. She stretched a kink out of her neck and dragged herself wearily over to the door. Getting to her feet, she peeked out side and saw the house was silent. But there was still a light coming from downstairs. She made her way down, relieved the task was easier now that she'd digested some of her massive dinner. When she got there, she saw the light was coming from the kitchen. She passed inside and saw Kitty in her curlers and nightgown, putting things away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Donna! There you are!\" she said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mrs Forman... what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, coming up on 11, I'm afraid. Just locking everything up. Did you want to go across to your dad's house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... no, I'll stay in Laurie's room with the girls tonight for now. Where is everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Eric's asleep in his room. He saw you girls passed out upstairs and got you some blankets. Steven's in his room, Fez is asleep on the basement couch and Michael took Betsy and Brooke's mother home. They'll look after her until morning, and then he'll come back to pick up Brooke. He just didn't want to disturb her while she slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled slightly at the thought of Kelso being considerate for a change. \"Were you just going to bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, are you going to stay up for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, just a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just turn out the light when you're done. Goodnight, Donna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty scurried off through the kitchen door and up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna hung around for a moment. She didn't know what to do with herself, really. She could probably get some sleep on the living room couch now that it was unoccupied. Maybe join Eric in his room - although his bed probably wasn't big enough for both of them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she felt her stomach rumble and realized she was kind of hungry. It amazed her that she could still be hungry after her gorge this evening. Still, she ought to eat something, otherwise she'd just wake up with a headache. She ventured over to the fridge to see if there was a snack or something inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greeted by at least nine cans of whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at them all in bewilderment, she quickly shut the door. No, she thought, don't even think it. She grabbed a cookie from a nearby jar and made her way back upstairs. She wasn't about to go down that road of gluttony again. She hurried, jiggling the whole way, back upstairs to Laurie's room. Maybe just a little too quickly, and a little too loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shut the door, but her commotion had caused the other three to stir. Jackie managed to find a bedside lamp and switch it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Jackie moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" whispered Donna. \"Just... went for a cookie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" Brooke asked, wiping the cobwebs from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly 11. Kelso took your mom and Betsy home. Should be back tomorrow, so you can stay the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... good...\" Brooke looked around the room. \"So... anyone else kinda... hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's eyes bulged. \"Are you kidding?! After everything I ate tonight, you think I'm hungry?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay, yeah, I am, but that's not the point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\" Donna said. \"There's plenty of leftovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. No more turkey. I'd sooner starve than eat anymore of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's mind flitted back to what she'd seen. \"Well, it's either that or the nine cans of whipped cream in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Brooke stared at her. Even Laurie managed to sit up and look her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well...,\" said Brooke. \"That's just ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Exactly what I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, there's no point in even trying to consume all that whipped cream,\" added Jackie, sounding not very sure of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a little,\" said Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we're not having any?\" asked Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sat in silence for a moment, thinking about all that whipped cream. Sitting the fridge. Waiting for them. Calling for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Donna found her voice. \"You know what? I forgot to turn off the light in the kitchen. I'll go do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie heaved herself out of bed. \"I'll help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here!\" agreed Brooke, just barely making it to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I'll help, too!\" cried Laurie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other three didn't stop. They scurried downstairs. Laurie was forced to struggle her way onto her feet. Her stomach was still swollen from her holiday gorge. It took a lot of rocking back and forth to get her into a sitting position. Then she had to roll over onto her hands and knees so she could use the bedpost to brace herself, forcing herself onto her feet. Her stomach weighed a ton, and she wasn't even remotely hungry, but she just had to get after them. Practically carrying her stomach in her hands, she waddled awkwardly after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, Jackie and Brooke made it quietly to the kitchen, not daring to make a sound, lest they wake anyone else up. That would just spoil the whole thing. What was the point of midnight snacking if everyone knew about it? The element of secrecy just made it more fun. The pulled open the fridge door, and there they were. Nine glistening cans of whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" said Donna. \"Are we going to bother with the pretense, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just move over,\" grouched Jackie, reaching into the fridge and pulling out a can, shaking it up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Brooke did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and in waddled Laurie, out of breath. \"Don't you dare start without me,\" she whined, still holding her stomach in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you should have any?\" Brooke asked, regarding her friend's protruding stomach. \"You already had a lot to eat at dinner. More than any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked despite herself. \"Oh, honey, when it comes to dessert, there's always room in my stomach. Now pass me a can. Let's get our 'chug' on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shrugged and tossed her a can, which she deftly caught. She joined them in shaking the cans up for a while before they popped the tops and put the nozzles in their mouths, like throwing back a bunch of beers. The creamy white goodness filled their mouths, and they gulped them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie finished her first guzzle. \"Awwww, yeah, that's the stuff,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke licked her lips. \"It's moments like this that make me worry I'm going to be a bad influence on Betsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please. Kelso's got that totally covered,\" laughed Donna. \"Overeating is nowhere near as dangerous as falling off the water tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your point.\" Brooke chugged even more cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to consume the cream for a long time. Not saying a word. Just chugging it all down. It took a while, seeing as how Kitty had gotten the extra large cans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, Jackie and Brooke had to pause for a bit at times for air, plus rubbing their stomachs. They were beginning to get full again. Their stomachs were becoming taught and firm once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie, however, just kept going. Even breaths. Steady pace. Just let it slosh and swish down her throat, adding to the monstrous pile of content within her growing gargantuan gut. She kept rubbing it in concentric circles, honestly feeling like she could pop at any moment, and that was enough to make her continue. She moaned softly as it forced its way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, the other girls had to call it quits as their respective cans ran out. Donna, Jackie and Brooke lowered the empty containers and staggered a bit, leaning against whatever was convenient - the fridge, the counter, the table - as their stomachs sloshed with their new load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhh...,\" moaned Jackie, rubbing her beach ball belly. \"I'm probably going to have to go up another size once this is all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on the bright side - shopping trip,\" Donna reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie lit up. \"Ooooh yeah! I can go down to the mall and see if they - ugggggghhhh... Don't get me excited! My tummy's too full for thinking about a shopping spree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke chuckled. \"Man, that hit that spot,\" she groaned, running both hands on either side of her belly. \"All topped off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie had finished hers as well. She made absolutely sure it was fully depleted before setting it aside and waddling over to the fridge. She pulled out another one of the remaining five and started shaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others looked at her, aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not serious,\" said Jackie flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deadly serious,\" replied Laurie in a husky voice. \"It's all about finding your limits. And then surpassing them until you just can't anymore. And then surpassing that, as well.\" She flicked off the cap and started chugging once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three stared at her in open shock. How as she doing this? They watched as she rubbed her stomach, which seemed to actually be getting visibly bigger by the second. Her wrinkled dress was smoothing out its creases around her midsection, and she still showed no signs of stopping.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With their own bellies filled to the brim to be comfortably stuffed, Donna, Jackie and Brooke watched in silent fascination as Laurie downed her second can of whipped cream. On top of the first one. And both of those on top of the massive Thanksgiving feast she'd just had. Her stomach seemed to actually be growing right before their eyes. She was rubbing it soothingly, moaning softly as she swallowed down more and more whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke found her voice. \"Should... should we do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugged helplessly. \"Like what? Get a mop after she blows up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean... stopping her seems like a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. She seems rabid right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not foam, Jackie,\" Donna pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but still. I don't feel safe going over there right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we ought to do something! Otherwise, she's going to make herself sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Laurie's knees buckled and she clutched her stomach. For a silly moment, the girls thought she really <i>was </i>going to explode. But she simply sank into one of the chairs by the table, leaning back as she finished off the second can. When she let it fall from her mouth, she let out a gasp for air, patting her taught stomach and letting out a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie tried to look nonchalant. \"... Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie licked the remnants of the whipped cream off her lips. \"... More... I wan' more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke's jaw dropped. \"You can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very serious...,\" Laurie gasped, fanning herself. \"I want more... I just... can't move right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie rolled her eyes and made for the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" exclaimed Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting her more. What else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, she'll just barf all over you,\" Donna warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well, let's see if this bitch's stomach really can handle anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie licked her lips and smiled devillishly. \"Good girl, Jackie. Bring it here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out her hand but Jackie shook her head as she shook the can and popped the top. \"Oh, no. We're doing this my way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted back Laurie's unsuspecting forehead and plugged the whipped cream into her mouth, squeezing the nozzle and letting it spray straight down her throat. The older blonde was momentarily stunned, but then, she felt pleased. Not just pleased. Pleasured. She moaned heavily as the cream continued to pour into her expanding stomach. She rubbed it with both hands now, feeling it grow like a balloon. A cream-filled balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Brooke watched in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she doing this?\" Brooke demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...,\" Donna murmured. \"But now... I'm intrigued.\" She went to the fridge and got out another can of whipped cream and started shaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna!\" exclaimed Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shrugged. \"We're gonna find her limits. She's gotta give up at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes, but soon, Jackie's can was emptied, and Laurie was slightly bigger than when she'd started. She lifted up her dress and rubbed her bare belly, which looked like it was pregnant with triplets now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for your next one?\" Jackie asked, faux-sweetly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie nodded, tired but still eager. \"I wan'... more...,\" she slurred, clearly food drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled excitedly, like she was embarking on something terribly naughty, before she scurried over and started feeding Laurie her next batch. She watched as she gulped it down, moaning in ecstasy. She could only imagine what it must be like, to be stuck like this, being force fed an endless stream of sweet goodness. She briefly wondered if Eric would ever go for this kind of thing when they got back to Madison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, the whipped cream ran out. Fortunately, Jackie had gotten the next one. Laurie moaned as she began to consume it, but at no point did she indicate for the others to stop. While she rubbed her stomach, Donna began rubbing it as well, curious as to what it felt like. It was rock hard. Tightly packed. Not even the tiniest of jiggles. Her stomach was officially as rock hard round as a bowling ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brooke just watched all of this, having absolutely no idea of what to do. What kind of crazy Thanksgiving was this? All this gluttony was ridiculous. No shame. No realization of how bad this was. And this was bad. Soooooo bad. The kind of bad thing that a sensible smart librarian shouldn't be engaged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe that's why she took out the remaining spray can of whipped cream from the fridge and started shaking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Laurie was enormous. That stomach of hers must've expanded to twice the size it'd been when she'd started. She looked very nearly comatose. There was the faint glisten of tears in her eyes from the pain she must've been in. Her head lolled back like a wet rag. Both hands rest atop her swell. She didn't seem aware of her surroundings anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke stood over her, uncertain. \"Laurie...?\" she ventured. \"This is the last can. The very last. Do you want it? Just say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie didn't seem to hear her, and for a moment, the girls considered stopping. But then, the beached blonde made a sound that took them all off-guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... More...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke blinked, astonished. \"More?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... want.... more....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Jackie looked at Brooke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" asked Jackie. \"What're you waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like she was teetering on the precipice, Brooke took a chance and put the nozzle in Laurie's mouth, gently squeezing, being careful to keep the flow slow and gentle. Laurie let out a moan of pleasure that sounded like half-joy half-sob. The tears were really pouring from her eyes now. God, she must be in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna and Jackie knelt at her side to help her rub her belly. They could swear they could feel it stretch from how much was packed inside. How was she not getting sick from all of this? What was keeping it all in? It was incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at least seven minutes before Brooke depleted the very last of the whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie laid there for a long time, sprawled in the chair, legs splayed apart, and her big ol' gut plopped out over the waistband of her panties, which were looking like they'd rip off at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna cleared her throat. \"Laurie...? You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie slowly lifted her head to look them in the eye. Her mouth hung open in a super-stuffed-stupor. Then, to their alarm, her eyes widened as she seemed to realize something was going to happen, and their heard a loud gurgle come from that enormous pale orb she called a stomach. They all involuntarily took a step back, thinking all that whipped cream was about to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Laurie let out one of the biggest burps they had ever heard in their lives, causing them all to leap into each others arms in terror before they realized what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the belch ceased, Laurie let out a sigh of relief and smiled happily. \"Ohhhh, that's so much better,\" she moaned. \"Ugh... that was just... Oh my god, girls, that was... so... amazing...! Makes me wanna... ooh... go downstairs and wake up Fez and just have him on that ratty old sofa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie crinkled her nose. \"Ewwwww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie hiccuped before patting her engorged stomach. \"Oh, man... So stuffed... God, I'm full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine you are,\" said Brooke, looking her over. \"It'll be a miracle if you can even move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie snorted. \"Pfft! Who cares about moving? If nothing else, I'll be on time for breakfast tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you want breakfast at a time like this?!\" demanded Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't want it <i>now</i>! Duh! I'll probably want it more in the morning... Ugh, this chair isn't all that comfortable, though... Come on, let's get me to upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell are we supposed to do that?\" Jackie whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie held out both arms with a patronizing expression. \"Well, getting me on my feet would be a good start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a group eye roll, the girls reluctantly helped Laurie to her feet. Her stomach sloshed from the movement, causing her to hiccup again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took even longer to get her back upstairs in the condition she was in. It was almost midnight by the time they made it. Working carefully and gently, they lowered her to the floor up against some pillows and laid her out. Her stomach stuck straight up in the air like a mound of flesh. She rubbed it and let out a small moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, girls,\" she swooned sleepily. \"This... has been the absolute best Thanksgiving ever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad we could help,\" sighed Donna, giving the other girl's stomach a gentle pat before heading back to her blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ought to do it again next year,\" added Jackie sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wait til next year? I'm free next Wednesday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good <i>night</i>,\" snapped Brooke, thudding back down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged and continued to contentedly rub her stomach. So huge. Enormous. And so full. She wasn't sure if it would be right to start masturbating right here in the room with the others drifting off to sleep, but dammit, she wanted to so bad. She tried to reach down there and try, but dammit again, she could reach around her stomach when it was this swollen. Pouting in the dark, she tried to get comfortable. She looked forward to being back in her own bed tomorrow night. With her Fez by her side. She'd have to stuff herself again just so she could enjoy him rubbing her belly like it was now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so came the end of the 70s. It had a been a wild ride in Eric Forman's basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had gathered for New Year's Eve. It was one of their favorite holidays. Mainly for all the booze. The roll on into 1980 would not be remembered. Everyone had come over. Absolutely everyone. Even a recently-returned Leo, much to their delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys were down in the basement, having one last circle to salute the brain cells they'd all toasted during the 70s. The adults had all broken into their little mingle groups. Kitty, of course, was drunk off her housewife ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that just left the girls in the kitchen, making short order of the snacks and goodies lying around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Thanksgiving had ended a month ago, their appetites had only increased, and they were steadily getting used to copious amounts of overeating. Lots of fatty snacks, greasy meals, sugary sweets and so on were constantly passing their lips and into their eager bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna continued her love of carbs. Lots of pasta and bread items. She was a constant visitor at the Italian restaurant near campus and continued to frequent it to the point the servers all knew her name and what she would order based on the day. Her waistline had paid the necessary toll for such indulgence, but it was her ass that was accumulating most of the weight. It wasn't a problem, aside from finding pants that fit for long. She had to wear sweats a lot. Still, Eric didn't seem to mind the extra poundage, and he was always eager to grab her ever-widening seat when the opportunity arose. Only in private, of course. He was a gentleman, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's sweet tooth had more or less dominated her life. If it was sweet, she wanted it. She always grabbed a candy bar or three at the check out line. She stopped off for ice cream on the way home from work almost daily. She even had a special stash in her bedroom that was just for her. Plenty of Twinkies, Ding Dongs, Nutty Bars, M&amp;Ms, Kit Kats... It had to be kept in a very large cardboard box beside her bed, and she was constantly adding and subtracting to and from it. She carried most of her weight in her belly. It was nice and round without a single fold, making her look very pregnant. Whenever she ate her fill, to the point where she couldn't even breathe from being so stuffed, she could always rely on her Steven to rub any pain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke was the thinnest of the bunch, but that wasn't saying much. Her baby weight never went away, and it only accumulated after that, especially in her bosom, much to Kelso's obvious delight. That wasn't to say the rest of her wasn't doing a good job expanding as well. She was discovering a healthy appreciation for meat. Kelso was very good at cooking and grilling things like pork chops and chicken, having been practically raised on it, and he was always eager to cook for her. She wasn't about to complain. And he was still a very attentive father to Betsy, making her wonder why she had ever doubted him. Who would've thought getting knocked up at a Molly Hatchet concert would be a good life choice for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was, of course, the biggest and proudest of them all. While the other three were content to just gain weight as it came, she was actively achieving it. While they all had personal preferences, she preferred all of the above and more. Always more. It was never enough for her. Gotta eat it all. Munch and guzzle and slurp and gulp. Stretch that belly out so it could more. She had gained a good five pounds from Thanksgiving alone, and it was only increasing. She was certain she would be at 300 pounds sometime in the next year. She didn't know what her plan was after that, but she was going to enjoy the ride. Her belly was enormous - so large that it forced her legs apart when she sat down. She was gigantic. It was a wonder to some people she could still move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was content with her life. Properly content for the first time in years. She was married to Fez, a man who adored her and treated her like a queen - and always bringing her food. She had a good job that paid well, enabling her to continue her fattening lifestyle. She had repaired relations with her family, finally having stepped up and helped out when they needed her, thereby helping them achieve <i>their </i>happiness. Plus, now she had real friends - friends that she could count on and talk to and, more importantly, eat with. She never would've guessed that her younger brother's loser friends would be the social circle she had unknowingly needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe contemplated all of this as she and the girls finished off every last scrap of food that had been set out. The reasoned that everyone would be too drunk to care at this point, so no point in wasting it. All the chips, cookies, cheese and crackers had been consumed. Jackie had even devoured an entire bowl of guacamole - some of it still smeared on her face. All four girls leaned back in their seats around the table, bellies full and protruding out from under their respective tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sipped a glass of champagne. \"So...,\" she sighed, rubbing her taut gut. \"Plans for the new year? Anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sipped her own glass as well. \"Gonna apply at the TV station for that internship. Then slowly claw my way up to the top and become a producer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna Mary Tyler Moore this bitch?\" Laurie smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" Jackie replied, giving her a high five. \"And at some point, I'm going to drag Steven Hyde's ass down the goddamn aisle and marry him. Just gotta get him onboard first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, he's <i>totally </i>onboard,\" laughed Donna. \"He's been probing me about jewelry all month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, are you serious?! Oh my god...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that we've established that you're living 'happily ever after'...,\" droned Laurie, \"... how about you, Brooke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke held her own glass in one hand and rubbed her bloated stomach with the other. \"Oh, I dunno...,\" she drawled, clearly a bit tipsy. \"Gonna enjoy every moment of my Betsy-boo while she's still small... Gosh, she's so teeny-tiny... How do babies do that? Be so little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie rolled her eyes. \"Brooke, you know I love my god-daughter, but holy crap on a cracker, do you have the baby goggles on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, where everything your baby does is amazing because it's your baby,\" Donna added. \"Happens to all new mothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke harrumphed indignantly, but the harrumph gave way to a belch, ruining the effect and causing her to pout. The others chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's up with you and Kelso?\" Laurie asked slyly. \"Things still good between you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile split Brooke's face. \"Yeah... things are real good. He's talking about moving to Chicago so we can get a place together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwwww!!\" the girls swooned drunkenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout you, Laurie?\" Donna asked, her glass now empty. \"Any plans for the 80s?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie shrugged. \"Same ol', same ol'... Kinda hard to plan for the future when I'm so happy in the present, y'know? Got my Fezzie, got my home, got my job, got my constant barrage of fabulous food... What more can a fat girl want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others rolled their eyes. \"That's right. Show off, why don't'cha?\" Jackie slurred, already looking for more to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, all the guys came walking up from the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh boy, look at this mess,\" Eric sighed playfully. \"Told ya we shouldn't have left them alone together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss my ginormous fat ass,\" laughed Donna drunkenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, here? In front of everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why don't you burnouts go back downstairs?\" Jackie groused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost midnight,\" Hyde replied, putting a hand on her shoulder. \"Time to say goodbye to the 70s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked touched. \"Awwww, and you wanted to spend the first moments of the new decade with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's beer up here.\" She gave him a swat in the stomach for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still kinda bummed we're almost to the 80s and there hasn't been a moonbase or anything yet,\" Kelso added. \"I mean, it's only twenty years until 2000 gets here. It's gonna be a rush to get all those flying cars in the air!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke bit back a smile. \"Michael, we've been over this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso rolled his eyes. \"I know, I know, it breaks the laws of physics, but still...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty popped her head in the door. \"Kids! Come on! Only a minute left! Then the balls drop! Oops! I meant 'ball'! Sorry. Little too much champagne. Aha ha ha ha ha!\" She ducked back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed fondly. \"Another Forman family tradition is upheld.\" He took Donna's hand and helped her to her feet and into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyde and Kelso did the same for Jackie and Brooke, and they ventured into the next room as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFez, of course, had to grapple with Laurie, who was much heavier than the others. He tugged on her arms, and she pushed against the chair with all her might, until finally, she was upright and ready for motion. He playfully jiggled her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like my little beluga whale enjoyed herself this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie smirked devilishly at him. \"Come on,\" she said. \"When the new year starts, my lips better be on yours, and those hands better be groping my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you do the same for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled after him through the door. She let out a small yelp as she was briefly wedged between the door and the frame, but Fez deftly popped her free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seconds ticked away, and the 70s faded into the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked around the room of friends and family. With a belly full of food and her husband's arms around her, she knew the 80s would be kick ass. 300 pounds would be a cakewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she wanted cake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock struck twelve, she leaned her lips into Fez's and kissed him, and indeed, she felt his hands digging her to thick juicy ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodnight, Wisconsin </span></div></div>",

Captain Renalds had insisted that Serenity run with minimal power, due to the ever increasing threat of the Alliance and so most of the lights on the ship had been turned off, much to everybodys annoyance. Inara ran a brush through her amazing dark hair, pulling it away from her face and letting it fall gracefully over her shoulders. She was still brooding over Mals latest insult he had offered her way earlier that day, as he had referred to her as a prostitute (which she was, but she loathed the term) and also said that she dressed like a 'genie', in reference to her fine silk, belly dancer style clothing. Truth be told there had been a lot of tension on the ship of late not only between her and Mal, there seemed to be clashes happening almost daily, as everybodys tempers began to fray due to their predicament. Jayne was fighting Mals orders at every turn, as he longed to be rid of the 2 fugitives they had aboard (who were the reason for the Alliances attention), but every time the pair came to blows Mal always had his way leaving Jayne to sulk some more. Inara was getting frustrated that she was unable to find work anywhere due to the fact that they never stayed anywhere for long enough for her to even find a client, but this didn't seem to bother Mal; on the contrary Inara believed he preferred it that way. Inara stood and examined herself in the mirror but not out of vanity, she was just making sure that she looked the best she could as all companions must keep themselves properly. Standing at 5ft 7 weighing only 106 pounds Inara was astonishingly beautiful, her skin was golden and soft and her figure was trim and perfect. It was no wonder why her clients often fell in love with her, and also no wonder why Mal harbored secret affections for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>            Before landing on the planet, Inara checked the video monitor to see if there were any potential companion clients on the large, wealthy planet they were about to land on. She was disappointed to learn that Mal was landing his ship on one of the few planets in the verse' where enlisting the services of a Companion was taboo, although not illegal. \"Dang you, Mal!\", Inara thought to herself. Sure enough, only one potential client came up on the screen: A wealthy, good-looking, eloquent and well-mannered man named Sloan. Considering the client's good looks and charm, and the Companion taboo on this planet, Inara wondered why Sloan would want, or have need of, a companion to fulfill his \"needs\". A look at the client's requested services showed the answer: He liked to see skinny women eat large amounts of food and.gain weight. \"I'm NOT doing that!\" Inara thought out loud. \"I'll wait till the next planet we land on. I can't ruin my perfect figure!\" Unfortunately, Inara's predicament would not be that easy to get out of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Several Hours After Landing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      While she was spending time with her fellow crew members in a pub on the planet, Mal walked up to the crew with a troubled look on his face. \"Well, I have got some good news, and some bad news,\" Inara rolled her eyes. \"Just tell us what's going on...\" Mal gave Inara a serious look, and she added,\"Captain Reynolds.\" He continued, \"the good news is, I gave our clients the supplies, they ordered, and they even gave us more money for getting them here early, enough to pay for the parts we need for Serenity, and feed the whole crew for about six months!\" \"We need to work for generous, wealthy people more often!\" Kaylee exclaimed, clearly exited at the prospect of finally getting Serenity back into prime condition. \"What's the bad news?\" Zoe asked. Mal sighed. \"We can't fly anymore without the parts we need, and there being shipped her from about halfway 'cross the 'verse. It will take about a month or so for them to get here. Until then, we can't go anywhere!\" The other crew members did not seem to upset with that prospect. After all, this was a nice planet, and they had not been planet side for any significant length of time for months. Inara, however, was very concerned. She would have to be Sloan's Companion now, and for a whole month, no less! She couldn't leave the planet, and if she did not get another Client for a whole month, she could be dropped from the Companion's guild! Therefore she had no chose but to take Sloan on as a client, fulfill his strange request for a month, and try to lose weight before she had another client, there was simply no way out of it! Reluctantly, Inara said goodbye to her friends and told a surprised Mal that she had to be on \"client business\" until they left the planet. Without another word, Inara left for Sloan's estate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        At the Estate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Sloan immediately ran out to greet Inara as soon as she entered his grounds. He was just as good-looking and mannerly as his view-screen message had made him look. \"So pleased you could join me, Inara! I have tried to get others Companions to visit, but they did not like my....alternative preferences. I do hope that fulfilling my requests won't cause you any discomfort. I know that you are only here for a month, but, full disclosure, I plan to make you as plump as I can!\" Sloan signaled his request pat Inara's slender stomach, and she reluctantly nodded in agreement before he did so. She decided if she had to do this, it would be better for both Sloan and herself if she pretended to enjoy the prospect of being fattened. \"Actually, I had always wondered what it would be like to just let go, eat whatever I want, and get fat, but I didn't want to lose my position as a companion! This should be quiet fun!\" Inara lied. Sloan almost lit up at the prospect, \"In that case, we will have to feed you even more than I anticipated this month!\" Come now. let me show you to your dining room and bedroom!\" \"Are they next to each other?\" Inara asked, puzzled. Sloan laughed. \"Let me show you!\" He led Inara to a very large room that was already filled with exotic foods from around the verse', both Alliance-controlled and \"Independent\"(well, kinda) worlds! Inara was taken back by all the delicious aromas in the room, and became VERY hungry, despite having eaten a meal barely an hour ago! She then noticed a large bed in the very center of the room, located within arms reach of most of the food. Sloan gestured for Inara to lay down on the bed, and she complied. Sloan explained, \"This is your bedroom AND dinning room! I want you to eat and sleep in the same room so that you won't burn off calories by walking back and forth from the dining room. You will get a lot fatter if you are gluttonous AND sedentary, so you should only leave this room when you need to use the shower or washroom, I hope that won't cause you any discomfort. \"Not at all.\" Inara said. She was almost in a daze from the aroma of all the delicious food in the room. Although she did not enjoy the idea of getting fat, her present hunger, and tiredness brought on by months in a shaky ship, made her almost look forward to a month of gorging herself and relaxing. \"Straight to the the fun then!\" Sloan exclaimed in excitement, before quickly using a spoon to get a big chunk of a chocolaty, custard-filled dessert of off a nearby plate and sticking it into Inara's opened mouth. Inara's eyes popped open in surprise. That dessert was the best-tasting food she had ever had! And that was just the beginning.<br>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                                      What happens next....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                      ...</span></div></div>",

Inara had found her client; a kind man named Richter, who she immediately set out to meet after a hurried goodbye to her ship mates. Her and Richter had liaised before, and she always enjoyed his company so she was quite looking forward to their engagement. She found Richter waiting for her at a nearby market, and she smiled at him as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Richter\" She said, the warmth in her voice genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Inara... you look so beautiful!\" He said, and she smiled sweetly at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair left arm in arm, heading towards Richter's luxurious home. After a short walk they found his place at the top of a steep hill, it's white walls noticeable from a long distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Said Inara, \"I forgot how beautiful your home was\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not nearly as beautiful as you my dear\" Said Richter, kissing her neck and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house stood 3 stories high and was bathed in the shadows from the orchard that surrounded it. The orchard was bustling with activity as Richter's workers worked hard picking apples from the many trees which were then packed for distribution. Richter was a very wealthy man, though his wealth didn't come from his orchards as they were there specifically to provide for the markets. Richter led Inara inside through the huge main doors into the extravagant entrance hall, where they were greeted by some of Richter's house staff. Richter looked at them, before checking up and down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Christine?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was right behind us, I'm not sure where she went\" Replied a rather severe looking old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Richter know that \"Christine\" (who had also operated under the names \"Saffron\", \"Bridget\" and \"Yolanda\") was watching the group keenly from a small hole in the wall. She had seen Inara approaching the great estate and as soon as she had her mind quickly turned to revenge. \"Christine\" was actually a very successful con artist, who had been thwarted on two separate occasions by Inara and her ship mates of the Serenity. Before Inaras arrival she was planning to steal Richter's fortune, but upon seeing Inara her plans immediately changed. Inara would pay for the humiliation she had exacted on her she thought with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was a testament to Christines tracking and stalking skills that Inara did not realize she was being followed, and it wasn't long until Christine tracked her back to her ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there..

The stowaway thing had happened so fast that Christine hadn't realized how unprepared she was for the situation, but luckily being a con artist for so long meant that she was good at thinking on her feet. She made special note of all the hidey holes that Serenity had to offer (which was one of the main reasons the Firefly class ship was so popular with pirates and thieves), as she wondered quietly down a hallway.

She frowned slightly as she rose from bed and felt her midsection, which felt a little bloated. Due to her secret force feeding Inara had perhaps gained 5 pounds from the fattening substance Christine had fed her, which wasn't really noticeable but her stomach was still a little bloated from it. Suddenly Inara smelt an intoxicating aroma coming from the dining area of the ship and she quickly forgot about the strange feeling in her stomach. The mixture she'd been forced to consume the night before had a couple of interesting properties, aside from merely being extremely fattening it also massively increased hunger and helped to dispense fat around the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smells good\" She said to herself as her stomach rumbled loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was back in her hidey hole, fully enjoying watching the clueless young beauty. Inara smiled serenely for a moment as she inhaled the amazing smell, and she unconsciously licked her lips as she left her quarters in search of its source.

With added speed and stealth Christine took the chance and rushed over to the air vent cover above her plate. As quick as a flash she opened the vent and poured a small bottle of liquid onto it, which contained many of the same ingredients as the mixture she had fed Inara in her sleep, only this bore no taste nor smell. Christine was back behind cover just as Inara greedily grabbed the plate and hurried to sit down. Kaylee watched in surprise at Inara's uncharacteristic eagerness as she dug greedily into the large meal. Inara ate like a woman possessed, stuffing her face at a furious speed while Kaylee watched in amazement and Christine watched with amusement.

Inara was now just a whirlwind of activity, as she stuffed her face at an incredible speed and soon she was chowing down on the final piece of her gargantuan meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This was followed by a weak hiccough and Inara succumbing to her food coma and groggily faceplanting the table. The sounds of Inara's soft snoring and gurgling belly now filled the room, which went someway to breaking the awkward silence that had grown amongst the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shun-Sheng duh gao-wahn...\" Said Hal, breaking the silence with Mandarin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Said Simon, staring at the slumbering stuffed beauty whose hair looked uncharacteristically wild and unkempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she just really... Really likes my cooking\" Said Kaylee, determined to find the positive as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah that ain't it\" Said Jayne gruffly which prompted a glare from Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well regardless...\" Said Simon \"I think it best if I examined her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of Mal and Jayne (the latter copping a feel when noone was watching), Simon helped the snoring Inara to her feet and manoeuvred her down the corridor to the first aide room. Inara didn't wake up and remained snoring softly as she was lowered into the examination chair. The rest of the crew watched on in cocern as Simon began his examination of Inara. It was a real compliment to Simons extraordinary skill as a doctor that he was able to understand what was wrong with Inara with the very limited medical supplies at his disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's definitely been drugged\" He said finally \"But with what I'm not sure... Frankly I've never seen anything quite like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were like... Super doctor\" Said Jayne angrily \"That's the best you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea where it came from at least?\" Asked Zoe \"It must have happened when we last landed... Perhaps her last client slipped it to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possible...\" Said Simon slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wangba dan!\" Said Kaylee, uncharacteristically angry at the thought of somebody drugging her dear friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But unlikely\" Simon continued \"This is high level stuff... Like the kind that money can't buy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alliance?\" Said Mal in disbelief, \"How is that even possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... The motive makes no sense\" Said Simon thoughtfully \"But whatever the motive, this drug is a very powerful appetite increaser... Which also seems to vastly increase the amount of calories consumed, and the speed in which they are transferred around the body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Christina had managed to track the crew to the first aid room and was eavesdropping on their conversation. She almost laughed outloud as she listened to them reach their conclusion over the mystery of who had drugged Inara, and honestly she was a little impressed as it wasn't that far off the truth. The drug was indeed Alliance in creation, and was yet another forgotten failed experiment of theirs that Christina had managed to steal, believing it to be worth something. It was funny how things worked out she thought to herself happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Inara awoke in her private cabin and whilst stifling a yawn scanned the room blearily. She discovered that she was fully dressed, a fact that confused her a little and she tried her best to recall what had happened the day previous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. What...\" She wondered aloud in confusion, frowning slightly as she poked at the slight bump at her midriff which she couldn't decide was just her own imagination or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found that her memory was incredibly cloudy and vague, almost like she were trying to recall a dream lurking just behind the memory centre of her brain and she frowned as she tried to remember something useful. Her attempt was in vain, because try as she might she just couldn't remember anything though little did she know that her crew mates could have filled her in on some very interesting developments. After eating every member of the crews breakfast yesterday, Inara had fallen asleep and been left in the med bay while the rest of the crew went about their daily business. It hadn't taken long for Inara to awaken again, and when she had done she was just as ravenous as she had been before without anybody around to stop her. Over the period of the day Inara had made a serious dent in the crews food reserves, to the point where Jayne had suggested that they should just lock her in her private quarters before she had eaten everything they had. With some difficulty, and with a greater use of team work than the crew often managed to display they managed to pull the gluttonous beauty from their precious food reserves and carry her to her own quarters, which she was promptly locked in. Inara had then fallen into a serious coma, which is what she had just awoken from now. She groggily rose from her bed, but before she could further investigate the feeling of hunger began to rise inside of her once more. It wasn't long before Inara had lost all of her facilities and her mind became fixed on very simple, almost animalistic agenda; eating. She headed towards the door of get quarters, but no matter how hard she desperately pulled at the handle it wouldn't budge. She was about to throw herself at it in an attempt to break it down but somewhere deep within her brain a thought came to her. Under her bed she had a large box, which contained all the gifts and presents which had been brought for her by her satisfied clientele over the years. These gifts were very luxurious, and often quite expensive, but the important thing for her right now was that there were alot of tasty treats amongst the jewellery and perfumes. In her normal state of mind Inara would never have dreamed of eating these, as despite how luxurious they were they were incredibly calorific and being in the line of work that she was she couldn't risk the slightest fluxuation in her weight. This discipline had been long forgotten by this point however and Inara now practically flung herself under her bed, tearing at the box and flinging any inedible items over her shoulder carelessly. The edible morsels she found were shovelled into her greedy maw and she moaned in pleasure at the glorious and complex flavors she experienced. There was at least 9000 calories worth of treats in the box, but even so it disappeared all too quickly and when it had Inara wasn't even close to being satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Fay-Fay duh pee-yen!\" Growled Inara in mandarin at the blinking red light and alarming noise that proceeded it, indicating her shuttles low fuel reserves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically Inara examined her command console to check for planets in her vicinity, finding only one that she could reach. For a moment she weighed her options as she realised the planetoid in question was the seedy planet of Talingo. As a companion this particular planet was strongly forbidden, as it was a planet where every sexual fantasy imaginable was on offer with very little,  if any, limits or rules. Inaras options were basically take her shuttle to this dark and seedy place or return to Serenity, the latter being obviously the best option but due to Inaras ravenous hunger she was not currently operating very logically. Suddenly her grumbling belly made the decision for her, as there was going to be more food on this planet than there would be on Serenity and at present that was the only factor that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara landed her ship in a landing area and even here the planets seedy atmosphere was well pronounced. As soon as she disembarked the ship she was approached by a woman, dressed in a rather extravagant burlesque style outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Talingo\" She said \"Are you here for business or pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food\" Inara blurted out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked Inara up and down, clearly liking what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think companions were allowed to come here\" Said the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you...?\" Said Inara slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a companion when I see one\" Replied the woman simply \"I bet you are a rather popular one...  You are very beautiful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the compliment\" Said Inara cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure\" Said the woman \"Now you mentioned you were hungry, please follow me and I will see to you getting fed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Inara had been thinking straight there was no way should would have followed this woman into the heart of such a place, but alas her rumbling stomach was calling the shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Maybe something quick\" Said Inara,trying to hide her ravenous hunger but failing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady grinned to herself, \"Yes...

If she had one done she would have noted how seedy the planet of Talingo actually was, and certainly not the kind of place a companion of her stature should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lana\" Said the woman, breaking the silence \"What is yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inara\" Inara replied, breaking out of hunger trance for a moment \"Where are you taking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just to my own personal premises\" Said Lana, in a off hand and deliberately vague manner \"You will be well looked after there I assure you... And you'll be well fed of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promise of being fed overruled any misgivings Inara had about the situation and the two continued through the 'entertainment' hub of the planet. Heads turned at the sight of such a well kept and beautiful woman walking through the back streets as she followed Lana to her premises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must excuse them\" Said Lana, referring to the many eyes that were ogling Inara \"They are not used to seeing certified companions around here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne pair of eyes actually belonged to somebody Inara knew very well. Christina followed in the twos wake with a stealth born from years of being a thief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they reached Lanas premises Inara was ravenous, her need for food so great that conversation with her was impossible. She didn't even take in the ridiculously huge burlesque club she was now walking through, with many branching rooms which seemed to cater to all tastes, no matter how deviant. Lana lead Inara through to a large and lavish dining area, which was empty and quiet in stark contrast with the bustling sexual activity of every other room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take a seat\" Said Lana \"I shall bring you something to sate your appetite\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara grunted a response, looking impatient as she sat down. She didn't have to wait for long (though it was still too long for her as she was looking more and more ravenous by the second) as Lana returned with a large tray of food. The tray was piled high with very delicate and luxurious looking pastries, which was definitely in stark contrast to her surroundings. Inara was noticeably salivating, any of her usual self control completely abandoned at the promise of a big meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't find anything better in all of Talingo\" Said Lana, placing the tray infront of Inara \"My cooks use only the finest ingredients...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Inara had stopped listening as soon as the tray had been placed down, because as soon as that had happened she tore into the divine smelling food with reckless abandon. Lana smiled as she watched the gorgeous woman make a complete pig of herself, stuffing her face at a dizzying speed while moaning in ecstacy at the robust and delicious flavours. Little did Inara know but the exquisite pastries contained a few extra secret ingredients which caused them to be both incredibly fattening and addictive (something that was definitely not improved by the drug Christina had given her).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, eat\" Whispered Lana \"Grow large with food... You shall be my most favoured whore of all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara wasnt listening to the brief view into her new life that Anya had given her, instead she continued shoveling food down her throat barely stopping for breath. It seemed to happen all too quickly for Inara, but soon she felt her fingers touch the bottom of the tray signalling the end of her meal. Inara licked and remains from her fingers greedily, and also did the same to the steel tray with no regards to how she looked in front of Anya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc!\" Exclaimed Inara suddenly, looking suddenly mournful at the lack of food though trying to remain calm \"Umm.. Anya? Is there anymore? Still... Hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please, Anything you want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is exactly the answer I was hoping for\" Said Lana smiling broadly \"In that case you'll be starting your shift right away... Follow me my dear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara followed Lana like an eager puppy, desperate to stuff her face once more. She was lead into a large room that was bustling with activity, there was a bar serving drinks and a large stage where women danced on poles. The women on the stage were a little chunkier than the burlesque club norm, but of course Inara paid no attention to that as her mind was focused on food and nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be your pole\" Said Lana gesturing to a pole of the stage which had been left vacant \"If you put on a good performance for the clientele you will get more of what you desire... It is worth noting however if you wish to do well, or clientele have rather particular tastes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara nodded and climbed up onto the stage, grabbing the pole to pull herself up. Being a companion she had a good knowledge and skill at the vast majority of the exotic arts (those which were allowed by her Order), and she was no stranger to the sexy pole dance though it had been awhile since she'd had a client who had requested it. With a seductive grace she held the pole and got to work for the hooting crowds. She found that she was a little less limber than usual, which was due to recent gluttony, but nevertheless she put on a great show to the seedy clientele of the club. As she danced a man sat at the stage leaned over to her so she slid her way down the pole so they were face to face. Without saying a word the man stuffed a large food bar into Inaras mouth, which she greedily accepted despite not knowing what it was. She chewed and swallowed it and frowned at its bland taste feeling very unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too skinny\" Said the man, smiling am unpleasant smile \"The thicker you get the greater the reward\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar he had given her was a calorie bar, and was common on the poorer planets in the colony. As the name suggested it was very high in calories, but low in flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I eat enough of this muck, I'll be given something decent?\" Asked Inara hotly, feeling frustrated her appetite had not been quelled \"Seems totally worth it-mrrrf!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would talk less\" Said the man, carelessly stuffing another bar into her indignant mouth, though she did not fight it \"Eat more, talk less\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInara remained knelt down and accepted calorie bar after calorie bar into her mouth. She looked annoyed when the bars stopped however and the man just shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all I am prepared to waste on you\" He said \"If you want things better, you'd better earn some extra weight... When you get a good belly you will get a lot more interest i assure you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She brushed her beautiful dark auburn hair from her flustered face as riled herself up to yell down the phone at the poor individual who had envoked her wrath. It was no secret that Steph was a truly gorgeous woman, you only had to see her enter a room and every guys head to turn to realize the effect she had. Her long brown hair streamed down her delicate, stunning features and rested on her shoulders, with her amazing hazel brown eyes staring out from beneath it. She was currently wearing a black business suit, with a white shirt underneath and silver tie, but even this modest get up looked incredible on her. The suit was tailored to hug her slight curves, with the effect of showing off her amazing bosom and perky ass to a splendid degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean the fireworks won't be ready for tonight?!?!\" Bellowed Stephanie down the phone at stammering man on the other end, \"Do you realize who I am?!!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie banged her fist on the table, causing her hair to fall over her breasts which bounced slightly at the impact. She was expecting another shipment of fireworks for the evening show, all especially for her husband Triple H. Truth be told it wasn't really a big deal, as there were plenty of fire works for her husbands entrance, but Stephanie had insisted that more were needed to make Hunters entrance even more awe inspiring. It was true that, due to Stephanies merciless attitude, she had her fair share of enemies but because of her cocky, arrogant nature she neither really cared or was fully aware of how serious it had gotten. Suddenly there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Once again however Stephanies arrogance had blinded her, because she didn't think her father knew of her plans, thinking herself to be a much better business woman than she actually was. But of course Mr. McMahon was more than aware of her plans, and had been for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Mr. McMahon want?</span></div></div>",

Have to live in a house...\" Stammered Stephanie \"With all of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other divas cheered at this as Stephanie looked forlorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets get you settled in to your new home\" Said Lita \"As our house pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie was pushed and shoved from the divas limo which had taken them to what would be their home for awhile. The house itself was large and lavish, as was befitting of the vast McMahon fortune, but this was of little consolation to Stephanie. She knew that her time here would be truly awful, and what made it worse was that every minute of it would be filmed and broadcast to millions of homes worldwide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well make yourself at home Stuffanie\" Said Trish \"Because your going to be here for awhile\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Said Lita \"And by the time you do leave... They'll have to use a crane to lift you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie mumbled a dejected response as she was led to the kitchen area of the home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the cameras are going to be turned on real soon\" Said Trish \"So, before they do I think it would be really nice if you really kicked it into gear and got to a nice even 140lbs for your first weighing! What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" Said Stephanie huffily \"You can stop the rhetorical questions, I know I have no choice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very true, you catch on quickly\" Said Trish \"But less talking, more eating... The fridge is fully stocked, you have about twenty minutes or so I'd say to gain the weight... I'm sure you'll have no problem with that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah\" Said Stephanie sullenly, opening the fridge and removing several fattening items from it. Stephanie sat on the soft sofa, and began to slowly stuff her face just as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later the film crew were ready to begin filming and the cameras were switched on. Stephanie had been steadily gorging for this entire time, knowing that if she didn't she probably would have been force fed anyway. When she had finally finished the last morsel she groaned as she rubbed her taut, food stuffed belly and the other divas approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then Stuffanie\" Crooned Trish \"Lets get your fatass weighed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie mumbled a poisonous response but nevertheless allowed the divas to lift her from her seat and lead her to the scales. The cameras filmed as Stephanie was stood on the scale and the numbers slowly rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"138... 139... 140...\" Chanted the divas as the numbers rose \"141... 142!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\" Said Trish \"Way to go above and beyond you fat tub of lard! But that isn't a nice round number I'm afraid... Girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looked at her sexy, bikini clad tormentors in bleary confusion before the divas suddenly set upon her. They began forcing yet more junk food into poor Stephanies already stuffed belly, who was far too weary to stop them at this point. Poor Stephanie was fed mercilessly, live on camera, as she stood on the scales and watched her weight slowly climb first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right you chubby little bitch\" Said Staci, as she forced Stephanie to glug a whole carton of double cream \"Keep stuffing your stupid fat face and soon no man will ever want you again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glug glug glug glugg\" Was the only sound coming from Stephanie, who was being held in a standing position at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the numbers rose as Stephanie was stuffed more and more. By the time it reached 145lbs, poor Stephanie was limp and the divas allowed her to sit down. Her top noticeably ride her bloated, grumbling tummy exposing it to for millions of viewers who would be watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better Stuffanie\" Said Trish, prodding Stephanies tender belly making her moan and squirm in miserable discomfort \"God I can't wait till you get big and fat! Just imagine how everybody will react when your too fat to fit into your clothes! They'll all be laughing at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The billion dollar princess was ritualistically humiliated and stuffed silly by the beautiful divas until her weight reached 160 pounds. Stephanie stared at the number with tears in her eyes, trying to suck in her belly pudge to try and save some dignity from the cameras. As her wardrobe was just as sexually arousing as the rest of the divas (that being clothing which covered as little of the body as possible) poor Stephanie's added poundage looked much more obvious. Her belly bulged above the waistband of her tight hot pants, with the top button looking like it was ready to burst off. She looked ridiculous, like a chubby girl who still thought she was slim and dressed sexy. Her ass and chest also received a generous amount of the new poundage, as non of her underwear would fit her comfortably, so she was constantly rearranging her panties which gave her luscious ass a wedgie, and her tits bulged above the cups on her bra. During a segment in which she was force fed cakes whilst having her pudgy tits and ass groped by the divas, Stacey Kibler arrived holding an important piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an announcement everybody\" She said, clearly happy at having important news while Lita and Trish looked annoyed that they had to stop playing with Stephs fat \"As it's Summerslam this weekend, Stephanie's predicament is going to be worked into an angle...

I understand, I'll just be feeding her in front if the audience\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish was a little hasty in her optimism, as she should have known how cruel and unpredictable Vince McMahon could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

What?\" Stammered Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls\" Announced Stacey \"Get her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish backed away in fear as a group of the divas led by Lita advanced on her menacingly (the others were still feeding and groping poor Stephanie).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we talk about this?!\" Pleaded Trish desperately as she was grabbed by the arms and Lita tied her hands behind her back with rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orders are orders\" Said Lita coldly \"Though I must say I didn't require much convincing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large box of Krispy Kreams was opened, and Trish gulped at the sight looking very scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" She pleaded again \"My figure is all I have... Without it I'm nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know\" Said Terri darkly, before grasping Trish by her cheeks with one hand so that her face look comically squished before forcing her to look at Stephenie who's feeding had no slowed one bit \"Take a good hard look bitch... Your looking at your new life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Stephanie's ever softening and expanding muffin top burst the top button off her skin tight hot pants, sending it flying across the room and everybody laughed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point Steph you fat fuck!\" Said Terri \"Let's see if we can get Trish to pop of her buttons! What do you think Trish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleashhmmrrrff\" Trish attempted to say before the first donut was forced past her lips and her fate was sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two when then mercilessly fed by the group of sexy divas, which was edited to be sped up for the enjoyment of those watching the show. The cuts were quick and to the point, showing each of the gorgeous girls miserable faces as cakes and donuts were forced down their throats, switching to side on views of their ever expanding bellies. The zipper of Stephanie's hot pants could be seen slowly unzipping itself as her belly swelled, even more so when a funnel was shoved into her mouth and weight gain shakes were dumped down it. The audience were also treated with the sight of Trish's once so flat and perfect tummy begin to bulge outward with food, also threatening the top button on her own tight hot pants. Trish looked positively mortified as she was shown with two chocolate ecclairs poking from her mouth, which were briskly shoved in by a very amused Stacey. More shots of Stephanie's belly followed as the divas fondled it, squeezing the fat that had accumulated there and making it jiggle. Stacey Keibler even began licking her deepening navel just for the enjoyment of the viewers at home. Next followed a quick sequence of edits which condensed Trish's hour long feeding into a few minutes. The shots flicked between her face as she was stuffed silly, to her belly as it inched outward until the final money shot of her also popping her top button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo!\" Cheered the divas as they celebrated her forced gluttony around her defeated form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations you fat cow!\" Said Stacey \"You just popped your first of many buttons, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Trish looked barely conscious at this point (she had to be physically held up by the other divas) so her round dome of a belly answered for her with a miserable growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good answer!\" Said Stacey \"Oops you missed a bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was referring to the end of a highly glazed Danish which poked from Trish's miserable lips, which she then forced in and Trush somehow chewed and swallowed. Trish let out a low weary burp as she and Stephanie were then dragged to the scales (they were held under both arms and were both so exhausted they couldn't even walk). During the journey Stephs buttonless hot pants slowly fell past her chunky booty and down her thickening thighs, so Lita roughly pulled them off her to reveal her black lace panties to the audience. Both of the overalls stuffed beauties were then thrust onto their individual scales and their new weights were read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unsurprisingly the billion dollar fatass is we in the lead\" Announced Lita, slapping Stephanie's belly pudge causing it to wobble and her to whince \"One hundred and fucking sixty six pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish is 121 pounds\" Said Stacey, sounding quite displeased at her former rivals progress \"Fucking pathetic\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better step it up a notch bitch Growled Chyna who loomed over the much smaller Diva, grabbing her dainty chin in her powerful grip to force her to make eye contact \"Wrestlemania is only a few days away and you'd better be at least a little chubby by then, otherwise there will be hell to pay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish, who had regained her senses slightly at this point, gulped at the threat. At only 5'4\" it was likely that her weight gain would show much quicker than Stephanie's had (as Stephanie was much taller, standing at 5'9\"). Trish knew this but also knew there was no way to win really, either way she'd be gaining unwanted weight and ruining her perfect figure to the enjoyment of millions of viewers. All she could do was win at Mania and hope that doing so would get her off the hook with Vince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Stacey Keibler spoke directly to the camera and those watching at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a new day in the divas house, and it seems we were not alone in our displeasure of Trish's pathetic gain...\" She said \"Because Mr. McMahon has very generously sent us a present\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey stepped away from the camera revealing a large steel casket type contraption, which resembled a tanning bed though it had two tubes which connected to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the weight gain pod\" Said Stacey happily \"And we are going to test it on our dear friend Trish here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera panned to reveal Trish standing in her underwear surrounded by an entourage of divas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all be so kind and give the viewers at home a nice side on view Trish\" Ordered Stacey, and Trish glumly obeyed \"Hmm... I can't be too sure but it looks like you might have the ghost of a belly there... Perhaps for the first time in your life, is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Answered Trish sadly \"I've never been a pound overweight in my whole life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's going to change right now\" Said Stacey cruelly \"Get your bony ass in the pod bitch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish meekly obeyed, climbing up to the soft bedding of the bed where she was positioned on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wiiiide!\" Crooned Stacey, smiling broadly as she stroked Trish's golden blonde hair like she were a dog \"It's feeeeding tiiiime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hose was pushed into Trish's mouth, which was attached to her face with a leather strap. While the strap was tightened Lita approached her with the other tube, which Trish eyed with deepening concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I bet your wondering where this tube goes...\" Said Lita darkly \"Well as your mouth is taken, it doesn't take a genius to figure it out does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nurr! Nurr!!\" Trish tried to squel, shaking her head frantically as her panties were pulled down by the other divas as Lita approached her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tube was fitted with an end that resembled a dildo, though it had a large hole at the top which was to allow fluid to be pumped through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw don't worry baby\" Crooned Lita as she stroked Trish's head tenderly \"This will at least give you some pleasure during your feeding... While also pumping you full of even more weight gain mixture\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say we never do anything for you\" Whispered Stacey as she squeezed Trish's cheek \"No man will ever want to fuck you again when we're done with you, so make the most of it... This is going to be your only source of pleasure from now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up slut\" growled Lita as she gripped poor Trish roughly by her hair and proceeded to push the dildo tube up her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnrrghh\" Groaned Trish through her feeding tube, grimacing as she felt the tube being pushed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lid was then pulled closed and locked, trapping her in a kneeling position inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see\" Said Stacey in matter of fact tone as she looked over the machines various controls \"As the dumb slut is only just starting maybe we should be a little easy on her, until her stomach gets used to eating more... Hmmm, how about one hour of feeding at level 1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped the buttons and the machine whirred into motion as the highly calorific lard based mixture pumped down the tubes into Trish's mouth and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't forget the vibrator can we? Hehe\" Giggled Lita and flipped the switch turning it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could hear a muffled moan from inside the casket confirming that the dildo was now vibrating in Trish's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then\" Said Lita \"Back to the main event as it were... Stuffanie!\"</span></div></div>",

The camera showed her face as her stunning, brown eyes opened and she looked around in cute confusion, heavily under the influence of sleep amnesia. The divas were stood around her bed in their skimpy attire which she frowned at, not understanding what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's awake girls!\" Yelled Stacey Kiebler which made Stephanie jump, causing a ripple of movement on her soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast timeee!!\" Yelled another eagerly and Stephanie gulped, having a fair idea what this meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" She said miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react a funnel was stuffed into her mouth, and several of the divas held her arms and legs preventing her from moving. Stephanie's breakfast consisted of ten huge protein shakes, each of which were dumped into the funnel with reckless abandon. The sounds of frenzied gulping filled the room as she was forced to consume the fattening shakes and everybody present jeered and laughed at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Trish being otherwise \"occupied\" Stephanie benefited from the divas full attention... Something she obviously lamented. To top off this extra unwanted attention the other divas seemed even crueller than before, not only stuffing her none stop but also teasing and humiliating her at every step. Due to this Stephanie was seen stumbling throughout the divas house, heading from one feeding to the next. Her ever swelling belly was poked, slapped and squeezed for the benefit of the audience, each jiggle and wobble being shown in slow motion. To even further drive the point home that the once so perfect and slim billion dollar princess was becoming a fat cow, the divas seemed obsessed with dressing her in the tightest and sluttiest clothing possible. Over the length of the day the clothing changes became a much more frequent event, as the girls mercilessly fed Stephanie. They specifically liked clothing with plenty of buttons or fastenings, so that during the feeding process poor Stephanie would swell to the point of popping the buttons right off. It became almost a game to them, as each time they tried to break their last record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you fat fuck, eat faster!\" Yelled Stacey as poor Stephanie was roughly fed by almost all the divas at once \"We've got a record of 7 minutes to break! Pop another button you fat cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the third outfit change for Stephanie, and the divas were clearly eager to beat their last record. Steph had been stuffed into a very ill fitting, slutty school uniform, the buttons of which were noticeably straining under her ballooning weight. Lita held a stopwatch and lead the feeding mercilessly, as the stop watch hit five minutes and Stephanie let out a weary burp and a chain reaction of button pops occurred as her bloated stomach expanded outward against them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo!\" Cheered the divas as the camera panned from Stephanie's exhausted, forlorn expression to her impressive and lusciously chunky exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I Guess that's that record left in the dust!\" Said Stacey, absent mindedly playing with Stephs pot belly pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Stacey Kiebler slapping her chubby belly around to make it wobble, Stephanie seemed to relax and breathed a (rather weary) sigh of relief, thinking the ordeal was over. She was of course being very optimistic, thinking the divas were done humiliating at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... We have a new record to beat!\" Announced Lita suddenly \"Undress the fat whore and get the stop watch ready! I bet we can get four minutes this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... What??\" Stammered Stephanie \"Nn... No! Please... Have mershhhheeemfff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh\" Crooned Stacey condescendingly, as she pushed a donut into Stephanie's mouth to block her feeble pleas \"Shut up and eat you fat slut... That's all your going to be doing until we say otherwise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Stephanie was forced to finish the whole box of ten heavily iced donuts until the stop watch was even readied. She was then stripped roughly naked yet again, ready to be dressed and fed until she burst her next button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this whole ordeal Trish had been locked inside her feeding pod, being pumped full of the lard based weight gain mixture whilst being pleasures by the dildo in her ass. As the minutes turned to hours in complete solitary, time began to lose all meaning as poor Trish felt her belly slowly fill and swell outward while she moaned and squealed in unwanted pleasure. Unlike her feeding at the hands of her cruel former friends, this seemed much more manageable as the flow was slow and steady to avoid pushing her meagre frame too much. Being alone with just her thoughts and no other visual distractions caused Trish to reflect on her predicament and the what her miserable future would hold. She began to imagine a scene, with herself as she always had been; a slim, perfect, blonde bombshell. She imagined how every man used to look at her with lust and desire, and how every woman with awe (and sometimes jealousy) as they desperately wanted to be her. In front of these admirers she stood in her favourite, elegant (yet sexy and revealing) black dress, their lustful gazes filling her with deep satisfaction as she twirled around, being sure to show off her surging enhanced cleavage. Suddenly she stopped in her tracks, as she felt a pressure building inside of her, and to her horror she saw her belly (which had began flat and toned) slowly soften and bulge outward. She could feel her whole body softening as the pounds began to pile on, and soon the admiring crowd began to notice and their lustful gazes were replaced with looks of shock and surprise. Slowly but surely her slim figure disappeared under layers of fat as Trish expanded and bloated outward against the tight confines of her sexy black dress. She could feel the seams strain, before beginning to pop open from her growing girth. Rips began to grow as her body could no longer be contained and it tore her dress apart, as the crowd began to jeer and laugh at her. As the dress completely tore off revealing her flabby body to everybody, the dildo also aided her to reach a screaming climax which seemed to coincide with her slowly reaching obesity while being completely humiliated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He flirted with the idea of telling Piama about how he felt but came to the conclusion that it was far too likely this would kill his dream before it had even started. No, he thought, the best strategy (as he often found) was through sneaky tactics and deceit. He knew just who to call about this, somebody who had been through the same scenario themselves and would therefore be able to share some advice... and hopefully some tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Dad\" Said Francis, after dialling his home number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Francis\" Said Hal, happy to hear from his eldest son \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah great thanks\" Francis replied, starting to feel a little awkward at what he was actually planning to do \"Uh... Listen... I've got a bit of a personal question... Are you alone at the moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Yeah I'm alone\" Said Hal, a little touched that Francis wanted to confide in him \"What's wrong son?

Luckily for him however, unlike his mother while Hal had tried this exact thing, Piama was not at all concerned or suspicious about her weight (yet) so Francis could be a little more daring in his methods. Due to the fact that Francis didn't exactly have a lot on for the day, he decided that spending it secretly shadowing his wife was a good way to spend it. He followed her around the ranch, perhaps getting a little too into his ninja impersonation as he dashed between cover to stay hidden. He watched as she entered the spa, which was a new addition to the ranch and only added to the places overall lack of credibility with the other ranchers in the area. She was obviously attending a spa appointment, and Francis carefully followed her inside taking special time to examine a particular cupboard that he knew to be filled with certain items that would be a great help to him. The cupboard contained numerous vitimins and powders (which it had been his job to stock here) for a variety of purposes, but there was one product in particular that interested him. Somewhere at the back of cupboard was a small box, containing a number sachets which in turn contained one of the most powerful protein/ weight gain powders on the market. He grabbed the whole box and settled behind a large potted plant to obscure him from view from his clueless wife. He watched her from behind the plant as she poured herself a chilled glass of orange juice which, after taking a sip she soon left unattended. He decided that if he truly wanted to fulfil his fantasy of making Piama bulk up then he was going to have to take full advantage of moments like this, so this is exactly what he did. When the coast was clear he sprang into action, pouncing from his hiding spot and emptying a large sachet of the weight gain protein powder into her drink, stirring it with a plastic spoon before returning to his hiding spot to eagerly await Piamas return. It didn't take long, within minutes Piama had returned wearing a dressing gown and to Francis's glee she downed the entire glass of tainted orange juice like a jello shooter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that'll do for now...\" He said rubbing his hands together, and left the spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Over the next few days and on toward the end of the week Francis took every opportunity to sabotage his wifes meals with unwanted calories. He drew up a goal chart, which detailed the amount of calories he wanted Piama to consume in order to keep her weight on a steady increase. Over the week he used all the tricks in the book and thankfully Piama never really seemed to notice when she was consuming way more calories than she thought she was (though the odd bacon fat infused celery stick did raise her eyebrows). Of course, due to the top secret nature of his operation Francis couldn't exactly weigh his wife to monitor her progress (something which definitely frustrated him, as he yearned to know) but he figured in time his handiwork would begin to have noticeable physical effects on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Francis\" Said Piama after a 'special' salad that exceeded 3000 calories \"You really know how to make low fat food taste great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know honey\" Said Francis, a rather suspicious smile on his face \"Now here have some dessert... Its also, um... Low fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama raised an eye brow at the large ice cream sundae that Francis pushed toward her, seemingly dubious of Francis's claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Its low fat?\" She said in slight disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Said Francis, trying his upmost to sound convincing \"Why would I lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments silence Piama shrugged and dug into the dessert. The corners of Francis's mouth twitched slighty into a pleased smile as he watched his beautiful wife unknowingly consume, what could only be described as the exact opposite of a 'low fat' dessert. Francis found that he was able to get Piama to eat pretty much anything he put in front of her, provided she believed it to be low fat. He exploited this more and more throughout the week, though he was a little disappointed by her stomach capacity at times but he thought this would probably increase in time with a little 'encouragement'. Whenever Piama claimed that she was too full to continue eating Francis gave the old puppy dog eyes (something he'd somewhat perfected over the years) to guilt into continuing, which she often did after sighing to herself. Each night Francis would use the intimate time with Piama to  explore her body for any signs that his plan was working. He frowned to himself as he groped the gorgeous tanned flesh of his beautiful wifes body, annoyed that he couldn't obviously notice any change. Truth be told Piama had probably gained about ten pounds in the space of three days, which was an impressive feat but frustratingly difficult to notice on Francis's behalf. Despite his frustration however Francis forced himself to remain patient, knowing that this slow gorging process would definitely show results soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piama was taken aback by the shere volume of food Francis expected her to eat, as throughout the week his portion sizes were growing. Truth be told Francis was probably getting a bit too ambitious and daring, his eagerness to see Piama gain weight beginning to overrule any semblance of caution or tact. It seemed like there was never a time when Francis wasn't pushing some delicious 'no fat' snack in Piama's direction, and by the weekend it was becoming second nature for her to just accept it without much question. It was Saturday morning, after a huge meal the night before, which as usual she had completely finished despite her stomachs protests to avoid offending Francis. He watched her as she climbed out of the bed and scanned her body for any visible results from the weeks gluttony. He could see Piama sleepily adjusting her nightie top, which he knew was because it was getting snugger and smiled. Clearly Piama hadn't noticed her own gain, despite it beginning to show on her body and Francis wondered how many pounds it would take before she did. He watched his gorgeous wife change out of her nightie and stand in her underwear as she perused the wardrobe, before selecting a pair of jeans. He could see that the weight she had gained had localised around her waist and stomach, as there was the ghost of a bulge forming. By now Francis had managed to force 18 unwanted pounds onto Piamas body, which wasn't at all bad for five days work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn pants!\" Mumbled Piama angrily, going red from exertion as she struggled with the zipper on her jeans \"What the hell... They fit fine just last week...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that would be Otto\" Said Francis, quickly thinking on his feet \"He insisted on laundering some of our clothes... He shrunk my favourite jacket to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Piama, sucking her stomach in which allowed her to force the zip up and do the top button \"... Its sweet he tried to help... But that guy is just a walking disaster area\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah totally\" Said Francis, grateful Piama bought the story \"Well meaning though... Anyway, time for breakfast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was pretty predicable, as in it was large serving of supposedly 'fat free' pancakes dripping with maple syrup. Piama raised her eyebrow as she took her seat, the huge stack all but blocking Francis from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know\" Said Piama slowly \"There reaches a point where the whole 'fat free' thing becomes moot... With servings like this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis knew he'd been too reckless, perhaps getting so caught up in his own success that all tact had been completely forgotten. He vowed from this point to employ more underhanded tactics to get the results he wanted. Despite her reservations however Piama demolished the pancakes, and Francis grinned knowing that her stomach capacity had definitely increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

However, it was a sobering reminder of where he had come from each and every time he spoke to his mother, as soon as he heard he voice he was a juvenile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom\" He said \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Francis\" Said Lois \"Was talking with your father earlier, and he was saying how much he'd like to come and see you, as its been so long. What do you think? I have a few weeks off work so I thought it would be nice. Get the whole family together... And um, Piama I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis frowned at his mothers tone when mentioning his wife, though it was no secret that she didn't particularly care for her. He was about to reply rather sharply, but then it occurred to him how this visit could be used to his advantage. The visit of his family could really help with his new 'project', saying up his wife without her knowing. He knew that Hal wholeheartedly shared his own enthusiasm on the subject, which Francis knew could definitely be put to good use, but he also thought that maybe his mothers disdain for Piama could be manipulated for his cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds great Mom\" He said, smiling as he spoke \"I look forward to seeing you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arranging an exact time and date for the visit Francis hung up the phone, a sly smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Francis's mind being mainly focused on his families visit in a few days time, he nevertheless continued his regime of secret weight gain for Piama. He had become much more subtle in his efforts after rousing Piama's mild suspicion, focusing more on spiking seemingly healthy food with hidden calories to throw her off his trail. He found this approach gleefully effective, with Piama having no idea what was happening as she slowly piled on pound after pound. Three days later Francis was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his family as he was making a special breakfast for his wife. He was currently making a large pan of scrambled eggs (his planned excuse being \"Oops, guess I made too much\") which he was carefully adding several additional ingredients. Along with the usual ones, such as protein powder, butter and lard, there was also another special powder he'd bought the day before. The powder was advertised as a particularly effective appetite increaser, as Francis had figured it would help with his mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi honey\" Came Piamas voice from the doorway, just as Francis was hiding his 'special' ingredients \"You sexy animal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis smiled at the compliment, it alluding to the sudden spike in his sexual appetite which stemmed from the whole process of secretly fattening his wife. He found living out his deepest darkness fantasy a real aphrodisiac, and Piama was certainly not complaining about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby\" Replied Francis \"I made eggs... Maybe went a little over board\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay\" She purred \"Think I need a big breakfast after all that... Cardio\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis was delighted at her attitude about the huge (and secretly calorific) breakfast he'd prepared, and promptly filled a plate with a heaping portion for her. He put the plate on the table, taking the time to subtly examine her growing figure. Piama was dressed only in a sexy black nightie, so there was no hiding any of the weight she'd gained, especially considering the Inuit beauty stood at a mere five foot tall. She now weighed in at 136lbs, which was impressive considering before Francis had started she had weighed a meager 115lbs, though of course Francis had no idea of the exact numbers. What he did know however was that his beautiful wife was getting decidedly thicker around the middle. Her once flat stomach now sported a slight (yet obvious) bulge, and her whole abdomen looked softer as it was clearly bulging slightly above her waistband. As she took her seat Francis noted how her nightie bunched tightly around her middle, which spilled out slightly onto her thicker thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy\" He said with a grin as she dug into the huge plate of eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Piamas recent increase in appetite, the gargantuan breakfast was a tall order and Francis doubted she would finish. He watched, vaguely trying to hide his arousal as she dug into the fattening mound of eggs with vigour, shovelling large forkfulls into her mouth. Piama said nothing, the only sounds coming her being the odd grunt as she worked her way through her breakfast. At the half way point her pace began to slow and a few mouthfuls later she hit the food wall hard and stopped completely. She sat there panting, lying back in her chair the large portion of eggs she had consumed lumped in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good effort baby\" Said Francis, looking a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Piamas eyes regained their focus, and a look of fierce hunger grew on her face as the appetite increaser did its work. Francis had no idea how effective it would be, as he only bought it on a whim, but nothing could of prepared him for the effect it was about to have on her. Reanimated by a secret reserve of energy she didn't know she had, Piama pulled her chair back to the table and practically launched into the eggs. Her arms were a blur of frantic motion as she systematically shovelled down the rest of her breakfast. Francis decided to experiment a little, as he grabbed the pot which still contained some scrambled eggs, and proceeded to pile it onto her plate. Each time Piama got close to finishing, Francis would add another large helping to the plate which she would consume without argument. Francis was amazed by the effect the drug had as he tested the limits of her ferocious hunger, and he thought about other ways he would be able to use it over the coming weeks. After about ten minutes of constantly topping up her plate, Piama finally finished every last bit of it. When she had finished she gave a cute hiccough and rested back in her chair once more, clutching her gurgling full belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Piama... I'm impressed...\" Said Francis in awe, and poorly hidden arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama merely groaned in response, her eyes closed as she reclined in her chair holding her incredibly full tummy. It was at this point that Otto entered the kitchen, clearly baring news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francis, your family have just arrived\" He said in excitement, happy to share the news \"They are waiting in the foyer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Said Francis happily \"You want to get changed honey, then come and say hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Sure... Urrrp...\" Piama replied quietly, struggling to get to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis had to turn the other way to hide the bulge in his trousers at the sight of his wifes insanely full tummy (though due to her food coma it was highly unlikely should would noticed anyway). Piama staggered slowly from the kitchen to get changed into suitable clothes to greet Francis's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francis!\" Yelled Dewey, as he was still young enough to show his excitement in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\" He said, smiling \"Hope the drive up was okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell from the look on Lois's face that it hadn't been (which was more than likely to do with something his brothers had done) but he felt like asking anyway just to tease her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah it was fine, just fine\" Stammered Hal nervously, seeing the anger rising in Lois's eyes from being reminded of just how unfine the journey had been \"How are you Francis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis smiled at his fathers attempt to steer the conversation in another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great thanks\" He said, just as Piama entered the room behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned when he saw the familiar look of disdain on his mothers face, and saw that she had got dressed from her sexy nightie into a plain white top and jeans. The clothes were not particularly designed to show off Piama's figure, so it was a testament to her new weight gain that it actually did so. From the look on his fathers face he knew that he could immediately see the new weight she had gained (the fact that her stomach was still bloated from breakfast making it even more obvious), his eyes lighting up at the sight of the slight bulge above the waistband of her tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\" Said Piama brightly, though still seeming lethargic from her large breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Piama\" Said Hal, who was almost licking his lips as he looked her thicker form up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois clearly noticed this and she caught his eye, giving him the look of death which made him shrink noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This left Hal and Francis with the not so easy task of watching the boys, who had already managed to break a lamp in the brief period nobody was watching them. The boys had happened to notice several other guests riding quad bikes around the outer parameters of the ranch, and needless to say that's all they'd been talking about for the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you can't have quad bikes!\" Yelled Hal angrily after a solid hour of badgering from Malcolm, Reece and Dewey \"The last time you went out on roller skates you ended up in police cell!

I think Francis is sticking up for our right to ride quad bikes\" Replied Malcolm slowly, seemingly finding it difficult to believe his own theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" Said Reece dismissively \"He's too grown up and sensible now, last time we were here he wouldn't even let us hunt snakes with fireworks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Hal and Francis returned to them.

You in or out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis smiled at the excited response from his brothers, showing that not only were they in but they were eager to get started immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama and Lois were lying down on comfortable beds, having just received luxurious massages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Piama\" Said Lois \"This was a great idea, just what i needed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama was momentarily taken aback by the uncommon praise from Lois.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. Your welcome Lois\" She said, sounding more uncertain than she meant to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis smiled as she looked at a Piama, clad only in a black bikini. With no clothing to hide her body Lois could really see the changes that had happened to it, as every extra pound was visible for her to scrutinise. Piama's mid section seemed to be storing most of the new pounds, as she now sported the bulge of a small pot belly and her hips, ass and thighs were undeniably meatier. Lois wondered how far gone Piama was going to get before she finally noticed and she smiled at the thought, imagining the look of horror on her face when she did. Piama lay her head down, fully relaxed and content and before long she had dozed off. On the way to the spa Lois had happened to notice several items that had been left lying around that were designed specifically for the purpose of weight gain (rather suspiciously like a certain son wanted them to be found), which had inadvertently got her creative juices flowing. As Piama slept Lois thought about what Francis had said before, and devious ideas soon formed in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the back of her mind Lois knew that what she was about to do was crazy, and definitely crossing some sort of line but something in her propelled her forward. There was a smoothie bar on the other side of the room, where Lois had noticed a funnel alongside a blender and numerous conveniently placed ingredients. Without putting too much thought into it Lois piled in as many of the fattening ingredients as the blender would allow, before blitzing it into a drinkable form. Lois approached the slumbering form of her sons slightly chunky wife, holding the full blender and funnel with obvious intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill apologise in advance for this my dear\" Whispered Lois softly \"But I just couldn't pass up this chance... I think you'll look so much better with even more meat on those already meaty bones of yours... And if Francis doesn't agree, well that's just too bad for you I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois carefully pushed the end of the funnel into Piama's slumbering mouth, before carefully tilting the blender glass to the top of it. Lois was careful, pouring the mixture down the funnel slowly whilst gently massaging Piama's throat to ease it down into her belly. Lois found the soft sounds of Piama gulping down the fattening mixture to be quite therapeutic, and before long she had poured the last mouthful down the funnel. To Lois's joint surprise and amusement Piama had not stirred once during the feeding, which only spurred her on further. Quick as a flash Lois was back at the smoothie bar, making another helping of the calorific concoction. This was again gleefully poured down the funnel into the poor girls every growing belly, which looked noticeably larger already. Lois lost herself for awhile in the cycle of making a calorie cocktail, force feeding it all to Piama before returning to make another. By the fifth one all semblance of care was lost as Lois just wanted to stuff the poor girl as fast as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" She said to herself as Piama had glugged down cocktail number 7 and suddenly stirred, her eyes slowly opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois knew she had been too heavy handed and very hurriedly hid the evidence, not wanting to be caught and have her extremely inappropriate behaviour reported to Francis by an outraged Piama. Lois had managed to lay back down on her own bed just as Piama opened her eyes fully and looked round in confusion. Instinctively Lois closed her eyes, wanting to give the illusion that she to had been asleep the whole time as to avoid any suspicion from Piama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yawnnn... Uhrrrppp!\" Exclaimed Piama, taking herself by surprise \"Uhrr.. Whats going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama was clearly confused as to why she felt so incredibly, uncomfortably full all of a sudden and she groaned as her belly made unhappy grumbling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccough! What the...?\" She said to herself as she suddenly the bloated dome of her belly, which stuck out very obviously almost making her resemble the final stages of pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong dear?\" Asked Lois, pretending to just wake up herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um -Hicc!- feel so... Bloated\" Said Piama, obviously suffering from a food coma \"Does my um... Belly seem... Bigger to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really dear\" Said Lois, scrutinising the very obvious bulge of Piama's mid riff \"I think your imagining things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... Maybe...\" Said Piama slowly, stifling a burp as she spoke \"Yeah... Your probably right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois couldn't help but smile at how easy it had been to manipulate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be easier than I thought\" She said darkly to herself when Piama's attention was elsewhere \"Lets see just how fat you're going to get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama and Lois returned to the main ranch after finishing off at the spa and found Hal, Francis, Otto and the boys in the main reception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey\" Said Francis, trying to keep his cool as best he could when he saw her bloated belly and knew his plan had worked \"Did you enjoy the spa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze flitted to his mother for a split second, as he saw the corners of her mouth twitch slightly which inadvertently gave him the answer he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was good\" Said Piama a little uncertainly \"What are you guys doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to go for a ride with Otto and my dad\" Francis explained \"Would you be okay to watch the boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Said Piama brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Said Francis smiling \"Oh, and if they say anything about us giving the okay for them to ride quad bikes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francis\" Said Piama holding up her hand with a wry smile \"I've met your brothers before remember? Now go, we'll be fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks honey\" Said Francis, sharing a meaningful look with his brothers before leaving with Hal (whose face also bore the same look) and Otto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama then turned to Lois, in order to find something to keep the boys occupied and therefor hopefully out of trouble. Reese took the moment to turn to Malcolm and Dewey to discuss a plan of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nows our chance\" He said sounding determined \"How are we going to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francis will be out all day, we can count on that\" Said Malcolm \"So the only real way to do it is if we each take it in turns... Say we each get a couple of hours, and the person who gets her to gain the most weight in their allotted time wins\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we know how much she's gained though?\" Asked Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've set up a special scale underneath her mattress, so whenever she sits or lies on there it'll be recorded\" Said Malcolm with a smile \"And when she next lies on it ill be able to get her starting weight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue the boys overheard Lois's conversation with Piama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go have a lie down\" She said, with very convincing yet fake concern \"Your looking a little tired dear... And fat and bloated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois muttered the last few words under her breath so Piama merely smiled wearily at what she mistook as a friendly suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think I will\" She said, holding her uncomfortably full stomach \"Ill just have a power nap then ill be back to help watch the boys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois smiled at her, and Piama left for her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that worked out pretty good\" Said Malcolm \"In a few minutes ill go check...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes the boys crept into Piamas bedroom and found her fast asleep. Malcolm carefully lifted up the corner of the mattress where a small digital set of scales had been placed and read what it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"142\" He whispered \"And I've accounted for the weight of the mattress so that's an accurate reading\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Said Reece thoughtfully \"She's not exactly wasting away like Francis made out..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, who cares\" Said Dewey \"Once I'm done with her she'll be super fat... And that quad bike will be mine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho goes first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piama stared around her blearily when she awoke, having slept for much longer than she had intended. It was funny how a day of relaxation at the spa had tired her out to this extent, but she was unable to fixate on it as a noise from outside garnered he attention. It sounded like a small boy crying and she frowned as she strained her ears to listen. She knew that the noise was most likely a product of her mischievous brother-in-laws misbehaving, and she wondered why Lois was allowing it to happen. She carefully climbed off her comfy mattress, wondering briefly why her pants felt a little constrictive before following the sound. Outside she found the source of the noise, which was Dewey who was sat on the floor sobbing loudly. Piama sighed to herself, wondering what Deweys older brothers had done this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Dewey?\" She asked, her voice soft before changing to a firmer tone \"What have Reece and Malcolm done this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... Its... Not thh... Them\" He said between sobs \"You wuh.. Wouldn't understa... Stand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her better judgement Piama felt herself becoming drawn in, something Dewey immediately became aware of as this was the greatest ploy in his arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Dewey\" She said giving the poor sobbing boy a tender hug \"What's wrong? Its okay, ill do anything i can to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your my big sister now right?\" Asked Dewey, his voice suspiciously steady all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's right\" Said Piama with a warm smile \"I'm your big sis now so just tell me whatever I can do to cheer you up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Dewey, looking up at Piama \"Its just that... You don't feel like my sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why sweetie?\" Asked Piama gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you haven't been initiated\" Dewey explained \"Like Francis initiated Reese, then Reese did to Malcolm and Malcolm did for me... It makes us siblings for real\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama raised an eyebrow at this, suddenly warey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of initiation?\" She asked carefully, very aware of what Deweys brothers were like to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welll...\" Said Dewey delicately \"Your just gonna have to trust me with this... It'll be over before you know it and then I can finally start calling you big sis. Sorry Piama, its the rules\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama sighed, relenting despite her (now larger) gut feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Dewey\" She said, sounding reluctant but forcing a smile \"Ill do it... What do you want me to... Um... Do exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit down on your bed over there\" Said Dewey walking Piama back to her bedroom \"And put this over your eyes... Like a blindfold\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewey handed her a silk handkerchief which, after sharing a slightly concerned glance with him she tied around her head to obscure her vision. Piama waited nervously for the next phase of her sibling 'initiation' and was soon rewarded by the feeling of what felt like a tube being pushed past hey lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oowee whart are oo ooing?\" Stammered Piama, her voice blocked by the hose which Dewey had seemingly attached to her face with a leather harness around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see\" Dewey replied simply, and a single bead of sweat slowly formed on Piama's forehead signalling her second thoughts of the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewey had several large barrels marked 'lard' which he had found by the kitchens. He connected the end of the tube to a pumping system, with another tube being fed into the first barrel. With complete disregard to Piama's obvious discomfort Dewey began pumping the lard through the tube into her mouth. Soon only the sounds of pumping and frenzied gulping could be heard as poor Piama was forced to consume the insanely fattening lard. Dewey had also found a substantial amount of honey, which he had added to the barrels figuring that it would at least improve the taste of the lard (as well as adding yet more calories to it). At first Piama made a vague attempt to remove the hose, but as more and more lard was pumped down it she had no choice but to suck it down as quickly as she could. As the first barrel was slowly emptied into her swelling belly Piama could feel her tightening belt and trousers (which had felt snug before she had even started this) digging in uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" Dewey crooned as he pumped away and Piama showed vague signs of fighting the feeding \"Just let the lard take you away... To a new life of extreme obesity\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama began to relax, which Dewey didn't realize was due to the drug his brother had given her at breakfast. The more she sucked down the honey lard, the more she craved and so it wasn't long before she had slurped down the entire first barrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Said Dewey as Piama greedily sucked down the last of the barrel \"I'm impressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe read out of the electronic scale was visible poking out from under the mattress, and Dewey was appeased to see it had risen three whole pounds to 145lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merr\" Said Piama through the tube, the hunger clearly taking over\"Give me merrr!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so... You really are going to be my \"big sister\" at this rate\" Said Dewey before happily complying and putting the hose in the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama sucked and slurped away, the hunger drug causing her to become completely lost in her own gluttony as her belly swelled and swelled. Dewey watched happily as he pumped more and more of the calorific mix down the hose and soon he was rewarded with the top button popping off her pants having been strained too far by her bountiful belly. Towards the end of the second barrel, her belt finally followed suite, giving in to the strain and snapping off. Her belly was now huge, taut and bloated and could no longer be covered by her tight t-shirt as it bulged out obviously underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Dewey as he looked at the electric scale \"149... Not bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Francis had seen his brothers handiwork he would of definitely been impressed (and maybe more than a little aroused), as his gorgeous wife was laid out on the bed like a bloated beach whale. Soon Piama drifted back to sleep, seemingly signalling the end of the 'initiation'... Though Dewey had one more barrel left and figured it would be a waste not to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't handle one more barrel can't you?\" Crooned Dewey, taking her silence as a \"yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully began pumping the barrel into Piamas sleeping mouth, being sure that she was swallowing correctly. Slowly Piama's groaning belly expanded outward further and further, the fattening really testing is confines and probably increasing them forever. The zipper on her pants was slowly pushed down and the waistband dug uncomfortably and tightly into the soft flesh of her belly and hips. As the barrels contents dwindled Piamas clothing was beginning to look painted on, as both her top and pants were clearly several sizes too small for her growing frame. Upon finishing the third and final barrel Dewey checked the scale and found that it now read \"153\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat that guys\" He said to himself as he undid the straps and removed the tube from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama was snoring softly, the intense feeding putting her into a deep peaceful sleep. Dewey left the room smiling, and heard Piama burp behind him as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Piama slept off the insane feeding at the hands of Dewey, Reese prepared for his own attempt at widening her waistline. In a move that would surprise most who knew him, Reese had decided to take a less heavy handed approach. He planned to use his recently acquired culinary prowess to prepare the most tempting and addictive food (and obviously fattening) that Piama would be unable to resist. He didn't question why the kitchen appeared to be stocked to the gills with every fattening ingredient known to man, instead choosing to make as much food as possible... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Piama came round she sniffed the air, as an incredible aroma filled her room (Guided by a well placed series of electric fans). Despite the amount she had consumed only hours ago Piamas ever growing belly grumbled, and she licked her greedy lips. With a little difficultly due to her tight clothing Piama managed to hoist herself up from her bed and followed the inviting fragrance from her room to its source. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um hi Reese\" She said when she found him stood over the kitchen stove \"That smells amazing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh glad you think so\" Said Reese \"I'm not too sure about the taste though, could you do me a favour and try it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess one taste wouldn't hurt\" She said, seemingly trying to convince herself as her hand clutched at her belly fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese grinned as he handed Piama the wooden spoon which was coated in a rich chocolate mixture, and watched her eyes widen as she licked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh\" He said, knowing that in that instant she was hooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out Piama was wrong; One taste could hurt. The initial taste had quickly inspired another taste and another, until pretty soon she was shoveling down any of the food she could get her hands on. For the next few hours Piama was lost, as she ate and ate, completely oblivious to how she looked to her brother Reese, who merely grinned smugly at the piggish spectacle. With her cheeks bulging with food, Reese lead Piama to a seat at the table where there were piles of exquisite and masterfully created desserts the likes of which Piama had never seen. She made her way through the piles of fattening treats, making the odd grunt and orgasmic groan as Reese sat and watched his handiwork; His brothers gorgeous wife making a complete pig of herself for his amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those guys don't stand a chance\" He said happily to himself \"I'll be riding that quad bike in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReese knew he had an ace up his sleeve with his method of fattening Piama up, as she was genuinely addicted to his food at this point. He knew that even after this particular stuffing was over, the craving for his food would remain, and he was more than happy to fill that craving whenever it presented itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very full and weary Piama was led back to her room by a gleeful Reese. It was impressive how much she actually put away, as despite being clearly full and bloated (To the point that her buttonless pants had split a seam or two) she had not skipped a beat in stuffing herself silly. She was clearly regretting her gluttony now however as she staggered along, groaning miserably and grimacing slightly as she clutched her taut gurgling belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy girl, thats a lot of food you've got in your belly\" Said Reese as he helped her gently onto her bed \"Just sleep it off okay?.... Oh, and if you ever want any more all you need to do is ask\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicccurrrp\" Replied Piama \"Uhhrr... Thanks Reese...urrrp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama lay down on the bed groaning and was soon fast asleep again. While she slept Reese lifted the mattress to check out what damage his calorific treats had done to the poor oblivious girls figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"158\" Said Reese thoughtfully \"Not great... But let's see how much damage her new food addiction will do... I bet Francis will appreciate that extra touch hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama slept soundly for another few hours, her stomach gurgling as it digested the huge feast she'd just devoured. Her dreams were punctuated with visions of herself as a huge fat shapeless blob, unable to move and being constantly fed so she grew fatter and fatter. She felt resigned to her fate, destined to be a huge beached whale, a massive jiggling blubber ball for the rest of eternity. These dreams were interrupted as she was awoken by her grumbling stomach, peckish once more despite the amount she'd already consumed that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

But I am relaxed silly tehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm smirked, knowing that he was now firmly in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good\" He said \"Because you've been so stressed lately... I mean your always hinting in a not so subtle way that you hate being so skinny... in fact I bet you were dreaming about that... sounded like you really enjoyed getting fatter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm was masterful at his manipulation, knowing exactly what to say to get the response he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... did?\" Said Piama, her IQ clearly lowering by the second as she tried her best to think \"Well... yeah maybe your right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always right sis... in fact you should do exactly what I say all the time\" Said Malcolm, revelling in his control over her \"Dont you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... eerm...\" Piama struggled, her eyes unfocused \"Like yeah totally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you agree.... And on that note there's no time like the present dear sis\" He said sounding very business like and confident now \"Lets fatten you up a little shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... OK! Tehe!\" She said sounding almost childlike from the effect of the drink \"Whatever you say lil bro, your the boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad your catching on so quickly\" Said Malcolm smugly \"get your ass up then, let's get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama nodded smiling serenely, grunting as she struggled slightly with the girth she'd already been forced to gain by her other brothers. Malcolm couldn't help but stare at the ever growing beauty, seeing how thick she'd already become. As she struggled he could swear he could actually hear seams popping all over her tight clothing, and she stood her tight buttonless pants began to slide down. She stood there, still smiling her stupid smile, as her panties became visible as her pants slowly fell down. Malcolm decided to test the level of control he had over her, for purely scientific purposes of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh say Piama... why don't you do some warm ups?\" He asked carefully \"you know, before we get started\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... okay dokey!\" She said stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet... erm... do some jumping jacks\" He said slowly \"While eating this box of donuts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a large box of donuts, which she took with a giggle before stuffing one into her mouth and beginning her workout. Even though Malcolm had formulated his plan in advance, he was still amazed at just how suggestible Piama seemed to be. Always a keen scientist, he found himself wanting to experiment with the control he had over her... when would he find himself in this situation again after all. He watched her for a while, frantically stuffing her face with donuts while performing very comical and rather unbalanced jumping jacks. The extra weight she'd gained thus far was incredibly apparent now, as her skin tight clothing accentuated every ripple and jiggle of flab on her new thicker frame. Pretty soon Malcolm had to take a seat, positioning himself in such a way as to hide his excitement over what he was seeing. Piamas buttonless pants soon found their way past her luscious thick thighs, which completely exposed her cute pink panties to Malcolm. He felt himself zoning out, unable to take his eyes off his decidedly chunkier sister in law perform her humiliating routine while the large box of donuts dwindled down to nothing. At this point the bedroom door opened and Otto entered, as he was in fact part of Malcolms plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. uh hello\" He said awkwardly in his thick German accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm snapped out of his trance just as one of Piamas movements caused a ripple over one of her juicy love handles which in turn split a seam in her skin tight to shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um you can stop now sis\" He said hastily and Piama looked relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubled over slightly panting, her stomach bulging out under her top as she did, perspiration clearing forming on her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um were all ready to go\" Said Otto after an awkward pause and Malcolm nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on sis\" Said Malcolm opening another large box of donuts and holding one aloft \"Come get the donut... remember you need to get as fat as possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiama nodded happily and approached the donut, chomping it down quickly without using her hands. Malcolm then backed up before holding up the next pastry and Piama was led from the bedroom in this fashion, greedily stuffing her face with whatever Malcolm offered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Urrp!\" Said Piana, her IQ having dropped considerably since being betrayed by Malcolm \"To get as fat as possible tehe! I am a silly fat piggy, and I want to get super fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so glad you said that\" Said Malcolm clearly enjoying the control he had over her \"Seeing as your going to be the fattest pig in history, like so fat you cant even move... I think you should start acting the part dont you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled as he could actually see the cogs turning in the stunning girls primitive brain, a cute yet silly look of vacant airheadedness remaining until she smiled serenely and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah\" Said Malcolm, wagging his finger patronisingly as his gorgeous sister pouted cutely at being denied \"Beg for it pig... beg to be fattened up like the fat glutton you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink oink!\" Exclaimed Piama obediently and was rewarded with 3 donuts, one after the other stuffed down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm now trained Piama into being a pig, rewarding her abit excessively perhaps as after every oink, grunt or pig like behaviour she was treated to a feeding, which got more intense each time. More seams had popped open in her top (which looked painted on at this point) and you could see her soft tanned flesh bulging through each gap. After 2 and a half huge boxes of donuts Otto finally nudged Malcolm to get him back on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right heh\" Said Malcolm \"Say, Piama... now your acting like a pig, dont you think itll be nice if you looked like one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brrrurrp\" Exclaimed Piama, clearly weary from the feeding but continuing to eat whatever she was given \"Hiccurrp! Yeah thatd be like... urrrp.. totally great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you agree\" Said Malcolm quickly forcing the rest of his box down her weary throat \"After that i think we need to restock\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dis is not my first rodeo\" Replied Otto in his thick German accent \"We are well stocked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the trio had reached their destination at this point, as Piamas top looked ready to burst at any minute. They were at the stables where Louis stood waiting, a rather dark smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girl\" She called, brandishing her own large box of donuts to tempt her \"Keep gorging you fatass pig\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrr... uhrrapp!\" Replied Piama, looking a little worse for wear at this point as she was breathing heavily from how much shed eaten already, before adding weakly \"Oink oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how swollen her impressive tummy looked at this point, she still happily accepted the next donut into her mouth from her mother in law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we timed this well girl\" Said Louis, sniggering at the sight of her daughter in laws tanned flesh poking through the popped seams on her top \"Looks like your one donut away from bursting out of your clothes like the fat gluttonous pig you are... speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis helped the very full and bloated out of her tight tattered clothing, much to Malcolm's excitement, leaving her stood swaying in her equally Ill fitting underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my my just look at you\" Said Louis as Piama stood before her, her new curves fully on show \"Someones let themselves go abit haven't they? Whatever will Francis say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis now held up a new outfit which consisted of some rather skimpy and revealing pink dungarees with small hotpants. There was also a curly tail protruding from the rear, with a pig's nose and ears to complete the cute pig girl outfit. Piama gave no indication she had any problem with what was happening, as she allowed Louis to redress her in the silly outfit while Malcolm gleefully continued shoving donuts down her throat. She was given a pair of cute pig tails tied with pink bows to finish the look before ushering the dazed beauty into her new pig pen where the gate was closed behind her. She looked around the new space with a silly vacant look of interest, noticing bedding in the corner of the actually very clean space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like most of Greendale's facilities, the classroom set aside for economics wasn't exactly top of the line. It had been crudely converted from an old science lab, with Bunsen burners next to the mixers, beakers and test tubes interspersed between the bowls and other crockery.  This didn't bother Annie however, who was almost giddy with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be so great, a class with just us, no Abed, Pierce, Jeff or Troy.\" Annie said happily, rubbing her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta nodded sceptically. \"I wish we could have picked something slightly more inspiring than a baking class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now Britta, this isn't about your precious gender roles, this is about an easy A!\" Shirley scolded her. \"Now, where's the professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wassup, bitches!?\" An all too familiar voice rang out from behind them, causing them to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chang? What in the hell are you doing here?\" Shirley asked, turning to face their diminutive nemesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Se\u00f1or Professor Chang, Miss Bennett.\"He smirked, holding up a framed certificate. \" I'm an accredited baking teacher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Way.\" Britta gasped, her mouth dropping open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes way, Miss Per-ray! Turns out a two week online course and a one time payment of three hundred dollars is all it takes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Chang pushed passed them, awkwardly vaulting over their counter (sending a mixing bowl clattering to the floor and almost kicking Annie in the face), before spinning around and calling the class to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up! Everybody needs to split into pairs for the semester. Pairs will be given a shared grade, and no swapping or changing of partners will be allowed. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Annie said anxiously. \"What will we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dibs Shirley!\" Britta interrupted suddenly, grabbing Shirley by the upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? B-but...\" Annie stuttered, only to be interrupted once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Edison, where's your partner?\" Chang said snidely, running his finger down a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked around, but everyone else was already paired off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There aren't enough people, I don't have a partner.\" she explained, glaring at Britta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess you'll have to work twice as hard then. To your station, chop chop.\" He replied, shooing her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said chop chop!\" Chang yelled , slamming his clipboard down on the counter, causing her to squeak and hurry to the vacant station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pushed her hair back behind her ears and tied her apron strings, Annie looked over hopelessly at Shirley and Britta. Shirley waved sadly, and Britta shrugged and mouthed 'sorry'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay students! Today, so I can get some idea of just how hopelessly inept you  are, I want you all to make the simple cupcakes found on page fourteen of your recipe books. You have thirty minutes. Go!\"<br>\r\nChang yelled out his instructions in his usual over the top style, before sitting down at his desk and taking out a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie quickly riffled through the thick volume sitting on the counter. The book was old and stained, and some of the pages were missing, but the cupcakes seemed simple enough.<br>\r\nShe hurriedly gathered the ingredients and began to mix them together. Flour, sugar, butter, milk... As she stirred she glanced over at Shirley and Britta, who seemed to be having a lot more more fun than she was, joking and laughing, something about eggshells...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggs! Annie had forgotten to add them! She was a few steps beyond that stage, but she hurriedly added the eggs and grabbed the electric mixer, hoping the extra power would make up for it. By the time she put them in the oven, she was five minutes behind the others, and she wasted another five minutes on adjusting the temperature setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got started on the frosting, but that part of her recipe was obscured by some ancient spillage. She leaned over towards Shirley but Chang cried out without even looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No consultations! If you must talk, talk to your partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't...\" Annie began, but Chang only shushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did her best, mixing cream, butter and sugar together in a small bowl, but it didn't look quite right. She only just had time to pull the baked cakes out of the oven and dab them with the frosting before Chang yelled that time was up. He got up and walked around the tables, tasting each group's cupcakes. Mostly he shook his head, passing some comment, others, like Shirley and Britta's, he gave a begrudging nod to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he worked his way around to Annie, he picked up a cupcake and gave it a critical stare. With a sigh, he took a small bite, only to immediately spit it out, spraying her with crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting!\" He yelled, retching and sticking out his tongue dramatically, throwing the rest of the cake to the ground. \"F! You get an F!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie's face went from surprised to annoyed. \"What? But no one else even got a grade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang squinted at her, scraping her tongue with his fingernails. \"Oh, I'm sorry, I meant you all get an F, thanks to Miss Edison and her toxic cupcakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not that bad!\" Annie protested, turning to appeal to the class, before noticing the glares she was receiving. Even Shirley and Britta looked put out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class dismissed! I need to go wash out my mouth.\" Chang declared and exited swiftly, followed by most of the students, who were still grumbling as they passed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Annie, its just Chang being his usual insane self.\" Britta consoled her once the others had left. \"Come on, lets go to the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I should probably clean this up first.\" Annie sighed. \"I'll catch up with you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sink filled with hot water, Annie was still fuming about what had happened. Her cupcakes weren't that bad, surely? She picked one up and took a bite, chewing thoughtfully. The icing was a little gritty, and the cake itself was kind of doughy, but it was still perfectly edible. As if to prove it herself, she finished that cake and took a second. They were actually kind of tasty, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she cleaned, washing the utensils and wiping down the counter top, Annie continued to eat the cupcakes, eventually working her way through the entire dozen, minus the one Chang had thrown to the floor. By the time she took off her apron, she was feeling a little too full, her stomach pressing against the waistband of her skirt. She unconsciously readjusted it before heading to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would show Chang. She just needed a little practice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay students, time's up!\" Chang yelled, seemingly prompted by the collapse of the card house he'd been building for the past ten minutes. There was a general grumbling as everyone hurried to finish what they were doing, but Annie was feeling quietly confident. Her chocolate bundt cake looked perfect, and she had followed the recipe to the letter. She had been thrown off by Chang's surprise appearance last time, that was all. Even without a partner, she had managed just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Chang made his way around the table, cutting a slice from each cake and tasting them, before assigning a grade. They all seemed quite low, Cs and Ds mostly, with the occasional B. Shirley and Britta's only got a C, Annie noted, a little smugly. Finally he made his way around to Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Edison. I hope your baking has improved, I just got the taste of those cupcakes out of my mouth.\" He said snippily, looking her up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie didn't say anything, but simply pushed forward the cake for him to try. He cut a thin sliver, and tentatively scooped up a forkful, and tasted it. He chewed it thoughtfully, then leaned over and opened his mouth, letting the half eaten cake fall on to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting. F.\" He said, marking it down on his clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie's face fell and she stomped her foot. \"What? It's perfectly good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang turned back with a smirk. \"Oh, I'm sorry Miss Edison, I forgot that you were a fully accredited baking teacher, and capable of judging these things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie pouted as he returned to his desk, informing the class that they were dismissed. Shirley and Britta immediately came over to console her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot about it Annie, he's just a jerk.\" Britta told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still here.\" Chang said loudly, gathering up his fallen cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring him, Shirley patted her arm. \"Yeah, he's just a weird, sad little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not fair, my cake wasn't even that bad.\" Annie insisted, having tried some herself. It was a little dry maybe, and there was kind of a weird aftertaste, but it was still good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley and Britta nodded sympathetically, turning down her offer of trying some, before leaving for their next class. Annie wrapped her cake in some cling film and brought it down to the fridge at the back of the classroom. The students could store their baked goods here until they were ready to take them home at the end of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the fourteen other bundt cakes inspired Annie. There was no way they could be that much better than hers, right? Maybe she should check, to see just how unfair Chang was being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Annie had a knife and was carving off a slice off the first cake. It was certainly rich and moist, but maybe too moist, almost soggy, she decided, after finishing off the slice. It was certainly no better than hers had been, that was for sure. The same went for the next cake, and the next one, and the one after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the eight slice, Annie was feeling pretty full, but she was determined to see it through. She pulled her skirt down a little to give her belly some more room, and cut another slice. The icing on this one was too thick, the next one was a little burnt. Britta and Shirley's was okay, if a little sticky. With the fourteenth and final slice, Annie had eaten roughly an entire cake, and it showed, her stomach sticking out over her skirt and pressing against the fabric of her sweater. She let out a little burp and wiped the chocolate from around her mouth, feeling pleased and only a bit queasy. There was nothing wrong with her cake, it was just Chang being Chang, she was sure of it now. She put her cake inside and closed the fridge, reminding herself to come back for it later. One good thing about this baking class, at least she could save money on dinner.</span></div></div>",

In order to prove it, to herself at least, she had continued to try out the rest of the class's efforts once they had left, helping herself to a slice or a sample of whatever they had prepared that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had been brownies, and she had washed down the chocolatey treats with a large beaker of milk, meaning her stomach was especially bloated, actually straining the buttons of her pink sweater.  She burped again and rubbed her belly softly. Her skirt was digging into her uncomfortably, and it had already been a little tight when she put it on this morning, cutting into her hips and forcing her to readjust it occasionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her burgeoning muffin top, Annie closed the fridge, grabbing one last brownie from Shirley and Britta's batch, which she had judged the best, a little better than hers even. As she bit into the tasty treat, she heard footsteps from the corridor outside. Without thinking, she ducked down behind the nearest counter, groaning a little as she compressed her swollen stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly suppressed another burp when she heard the door open and someone entered the classroom. </span></div></div>",

She could hear Chang moving around, and prayed he wouldn't notice her satchel still sitting by her workstation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I left it...\" Chang was muttering, moving back towards the door. Annie, her cheeks still bulging with chocolate, let out a little sigh through her nose, only to immediately regret it as he turned back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" He said, taking a step towards where Annie was hiding. She was sure she had been caught, only to hear the sound of turning pages. She risked a peek up over the counter top, and saw Chang leading through a recipe book. He stopped on a certain page, scanned it, and shrugged. \"Yeah, that'll do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Chang finally left, and Annie got to her feet with a groan, brushing crumbs from her knees. As she chewed and swallowed the last of the brownie, she glanced at the recipe Chang had settled on. \"Chocolate Chip Cookies.\" She read with interest, pulling the book towards her. This must be what Chang was planning for their next class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around furtively, Annie carefully tore the recipe out of the book, folding it neatly and slipping it into her bag. As she headed to the library, smoothing her sweater down and adjusting  her skirt, she smiled. She had a whole weekend to master the recipe, and then she would really show Chang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Annie got up early, ready for a long day of baking. The previous afternoon she had picked up all the ingredients and hauled them back to her small apartment. Without bothering to change out of her pink pyjamas, she set to work measuring out the quantities and mixing them together, following the recipe exactly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn under half an hour, she had her first batch of cookies cooling on a wire rack. Striving to be as scientific as possible, she sat down with a pen and paper to record her thoughts. Having eaten three of the cookies, she decided that they were a little too chewy, and marked this observation down. Despite the chewiness, Annie continued to munch on the cookies even as she mixed up the next batch, using a little less flour this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process repeated itself over and over, as Annie baked, tasted, adjusted and baked again. Each time she would discover a new flaw, whether it was a lack of crunch or a bad cookie-to-chocolate chip ratio. And each time she would devour every single one, regardless of flaws. She didn't mean too, she just couldn't help nibbling as she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy early afternoon she had finished off seven batches, and her pyjama top, which had already been a little snug, was struggling to contain her bloated belly, the buttons straining.  After a brief nap on the couch she got her second wind, baking and consuming another five batches, each time a little bit closer to that elusive perfection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally decided to call it a day, she had eaten almost a hundred and fifty cookies. Her stomach bulged out like she was pregnant with triplets, her pale skin exposed as far up as her belly button after she had undone the buttons to prevent them from popping off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crawled into bed, moaning softly and letting out the occasional belch, Annie was bizarrely proud of her accomplishment. At this rate, by Monday morning she would know how to make the greatest cookies of all time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nMonday morning arrived at last, and Annie couldn't wait for baking class. Another day of intensive baking (and eating) meant she was now sure she could bake the perfect batch of cookies. It also meant that she was having a little trouble fitting into her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra pounds that had accumulated around her hips had made her skirt almost impossible to fasten. It took a good ten minutes of tugging and squeezing before she finally managed to get it closed. As well as digging in uncomfortably, it also gave her an impressive muffin top all the way around, which her yellow cardigan didn't quite cover. It didn't help that her belly had bulged out another few inches, putting pressure on the garment's buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the extra effort it took to get her clothes on, Annie didn't really notice her weight gain. She was too excited by the idea of finally showing up Chang and getting the A she deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gotten to the study room in the library early, with a tupperware container of her carefully crafted cookies, in order to look over her notes and memorise the adjustments she'd made. Gradually, the others started to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, cookies!\" Troy smiled, reaching for them, only to have Annie slap his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Troy, I need those.\" Annie said apologetically, before grabbing one for herself and nibbling on it as she made some more notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what's up with her?\" Troy asked Abed quietly as they took their seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbed looked at Annie critically. \"Hmm, inconsistent characterisation, bizarre plot line, increased girth... Seems to me like poorly written fanfiction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy narrowed his eyes. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Abed.\" Britta said hurriedly, but Annie hadn't even noticed. \"She's just... really focused on getting a good grade.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's been focusing on getting fat! Ha!\" Pierce guffawed at his own 'joke', drawing glares from Shirley and Britta and an eye roll from Jeff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie was still engrossed in her cookies however, and didn't even look up. Eventually the group broke up as they each headed for their first class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the home economics lab, Annie smiled broadly when Chang announced the days recipe, Chocolate Chip Cookies of course, and quickly set about the well practiced motions of baking. Fifty grams less flour than the recipe said, an extra three ounces of butter, half a dozen little changes that made a big difference. Soon Annie was removing a tray of perfectly baked cookies from the oven, golden brown and studded with delicious chocolate chunks. She just about resisted the temptation to eat one, instead arranging them neatly on a plate and waiting for Chang to come around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual he saved her for last, grimacing over his clipboard as he picked up a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked smug as he took a bite, chewing thoughtfully. Finally, he spoke.</span></div></div>",

The class\u2019s next assignment was strawberry shortcake, which happened to be one of her favourites, and Annie was determined to be the leading authority on the matter. She had three days to prep for the class which she spent reading different recipes and giving each one a test run. Annie got into a routine of researching the recipes during her breaks and preparing the shortcake when she got home. Every night ended with Annie chowing down on her tasty results while absent mindlessly watching her favourite medical drama on her laptop, taking the occasional note on her baked goods in her trusty notepad. By the time she had finished her pan of goods, the food coma set in and she would pass out on her couch rubbing her bloated belly trying to subdue the dull pain.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    When Annie woke up for her first official day as a TA she was psyched. She played over everything she learned from her \u201cresearch\u201d in her head while she got dressed, not noticing that she was showing more cleavage than normal since she couldn't get her last button closed, or that it took a longer than normal amount time to get her skirt on.

Chang\u2019s \u201cgrading\u201d process was him going around the class nibbling a small piece of the student\u2019s creation and then writing notes in his notepad *which was just a game of tic-tac-toe he kept losing against himself*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Miss EqualTreatmentOfEveryone, go do you job and leave your grades on my desk.

The cake, a Black Forest gateau, was topped with a thick syrup glaze and dotted with tiny pine trees crafted from dark chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is just a guide,\" she said, gesturing to the cake, \"so feel free to simplify your decorations. These ones might be a little complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't just being boastful, she must have carved and consumed a whole forest's worth of trees before she perfected the technique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNibbling on a leftover bar of the rich chocolate, Annie strolled around the classroom, looking over the students' attempts and offering advice or praise. Chang meanwhile, was napping in an armchair at the front of the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the weeks had passed, Annie had taken more and more control over the baking classes, responsibilities that Chang was more than happy to relinquish. As well as grading the assignments, she was now in charge of choosing the recipes, providing demonstrations and even beautifying the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once dingy former science lab was now bright and clean, with the last of the Bunsen burners and old test tubes cleared out, along with some chemicals she found in a cabinet, the smell of which had left her feeling lightheaded for hours. She had added a few homey touches, the aforementioned armchair, rescued from the curb outside her building and thoroughly disinfected, along with potted plants for the windowsills and an embroidered wall hanging reminding students to turn off their ovens. She had even wheedled some extra funding out of Dean Pelton for some proper baking supplies, primarily by bribing him with a supply of fresh cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other major transformation was Annie herself, the near-constant eating inevitably resulting in more than a few extra pounds. Her stomach had grown into a significant belly, sitting snugly beneath her bright yellow apron. Her face and even her arms had also rounded slightly, giving her a somewhat cherubic appearance. These areas aside, the majority of her weight gain had settled in her lower half, her hips spreading and her thighs thickening, putting her skirts under constant strain. Her ass, once small but firm, had rapidly eclipsed her bust as her most notable feature, growing large and jiggly. It swayed slightly from side to side as she walked around the classroom, drawing more than a few stares from the male students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Shirley, that looks great!\" Annie said, once she got to her friend's station. The cake in question was decorated with an intricate swirl of leaves and vines, with three blossoms made of white chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Annie.\" Shirley replied, unable to keep the hint of smugness out of her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the students in the class, most of whom barely cared, Shirley had had the most trouble with Annie effectively taking charge of the class, especially after she gave her a B on the first assignment she graded. Since then she had been quietly but intensely determined to reach the top of the class and prove it was her who should have been selected as the Teaching Assistant. A goal that was impeded by the surprise baking talent of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garret!\" Annie said with a gasp. \"That's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward young man squirmed, standing next to his elaborate dessert. It was a perfect mirror glaze, the shiny surface reflecting Annie's chubby face as she admired it. Picked out in milk chocolate was the word 'Schwarzwald'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means Black Forest, in German!\" Garret told her in his stilted, screeching way. Annie was hardly listening, entranced by the sight and smell of the cake. She licked her lips as she reached for a knife, and cut herself a generous slice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out an audible moan as she took her first bite, the rich chocolate, thick cream and tart cherries combining perfectly on her tongue. She took another, larger, bite, then another, then suddenly the whole slice was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was perfect Garret.\" She said breathlessly, licking the chocolate from her fingers and around her mouth. \"Top of the class again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But you haven't even tasted mine yet!\" Shirley said anxiously, hurrying over with a slice of her cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie began to say something but Shirley didn't hesitate, cramming the cake into her open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie's eyes widened but she didn't protest as her cheeks ballooned with the delicious confection. She chewed and swallowed as Shirley pressed the thick slice into her face, crumbs falling down and bouncing off her tight apron. By the time it was gone her face was a mess, chocolate and icing all around her mouth, a rivulet of cherry syrup running down her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's is better?\" Shirley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Annie could speak, the bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class quickly filed out, leaving their cakes on their worktops for grading, leaving just Annie, Garret, Shirley and the still sleeping Chang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked thoughtful, then smiled, revealing teeth stained with chocolate. \"I'm not quite sure. Maybe I should have another slice of each?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took thirty minutes and half a gallon of milk for Annie to finish both cakes, with Shirley and Garret watching in agitation. Alternating slices, and occasionally bites, she kept finding reasons to go back and compare, new criteria to judge by. Moistness, sweetness, lightness, richness... Every time she had no choice to call it a tie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finished, Annie's belly was round and taut as a drum, pressing hard against a painfully tight apron. She could barely stand, leaning her significant rump on a creaking stool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who won!?\" Shirley demanded once again. Garret looked even more uncomfortable than usual, avoiding looking at Annie's swollen stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-OH-rry Shirley.\" She said finally, letting out a belch as she spoke. \"But Garret's was -URp- better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley glared, first at Garret then at Annie, before gathering up her things and storming out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarret quickly followed, thanking her and mumbling something about missing his next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone aside from the unconscious Chang, Annie reached behind her and fumbled with her apron strings. Just when she thought she might have to cut her way out did the knot finally give. She sighed as she slipped it off, allowing her bloated belly a little more room to breathe. She rubbed it gingerly, accidentally smearing chocolate across its pale surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe massaged it a little harder, causing her to let out a few more belches. She needed to make some room, she still had a whole class of cakes to grade. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Halloween was always enthusiastically celebrated at Greendale Community College. As well as decorations lining the halls, many students attended class in costume, adding a further air of festivity. Baking 101 was no exception, and there were a number of ghosts, ghouls and various pop culture references populating the classroom. Their instructor was also in on the act, wearing a form-fitting spandex skeleton costume under her yellow apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as you can see, these 'spooky cookies' make a delicious Hallowe'en snack, perfect for handing out to trick  or treaters, or even for a more grown-up costume party.\" Annie said, holding up a cookie frosted to look like a jack'o'lantern. \"Speaking of which, I hope to see you all at the annual Greendale Halloween party, tonight in the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang to signal the end of the lesson, and while the other students quickly dispersed, chatting and discussing their plans for the evening, Britta and Shirley made their way to front of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I can't wait for the party later!\" Shirley said, clapping her hands. \"I spent so much time on my costume, it's going to be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it should be a real hoot.\" Britta agreed. She was already wearing her costume, a baggy green T-Rex outfit. \"Do you need a ride home Annie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks Britta, I need to finish off a few more things then I'll be heading straight to the party.\" Annie explained, already measuring out ingredients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie had been thrilled when the Dean asked her to provide some refreshments for his Halloween party, even offering to pay, and had spent the whole week testing recipes and mastering the art of creepy yet delicious decorating. As well as the spooky cookies there were bloody eyeball cakepops, chocolate covered tombstones, and ghostly cream-filled cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the extra work had meant she didn't have time to put a costume together, but luckily she still had last year's one hanging neatly in her closet. The skeleton costume was a little snugger than she remembered, but she had still managed to squeeze into it that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBidding her friends goodbye, Annie set to work, baking and decorating. As usual, this involved plenty of testing and tasting, making sure that everything was just right. Nothing went to waste of course, if a cookie or cake didn't meet her exacting standards she would simply munch it down, careful not to get any crumbs on her costume, which was slowly growing tighter and tighter. It also meant the whole process took a little longer than she thought it would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally finished icing the last of the cupcakes with only ten minutes until the party started. She quickly packed them into a large Tupperware container and stacked this on top of the other three boxes of tasty confectionery. After washing her hands and hanging up her apron, she was just about ready to go when she noticed that there was one cupcake left over. She was already feeling pretty full, but there was no room left in any of the Tupperware...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, she crammed the whole thing into her mouth, cheeks bulging as they filled with cake and cream. She chewed and swallowed, letting out a sigh of satisfaction that quickly turned into a shriek of surprise. Her costume, already put under significant strain by her more curvaceous figure, could take no more, and the cheap spandex split along the centre, from just below her breasts to just above her hips, allowing her bloated belly to burst out. She looked down in shock at her stomach, her pale pink skin sharply contrasting with the black and white costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" She said quietly, offering an honest if not particularly eloquent assessment of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie? Are you in here?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlready perturbed, the sound of Jeff's voice sent her into full-on panic mode, especially when the handle of the door began to turn. She couldn't let anyone, especially Jeff, see her like this! Without any other thought, she ducked down behind a table, and was rewarded with the sensation of her costume tearing again, right across the rear end. She bit back a groan as the door swung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie?\" Jeff called again. She stayed quiet, hoping he wouldn't notice the stack of Tupperware. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must have already gone to the library.\" Troy  suggested from out in the hall, before Pierce's gruff voice joined in the discussion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, I want to get there before Leonard eats all the free taco mix.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff responded with his usual request that Pierce shut up, but seconds later the door swung closed again, and a few more second later Annie allowed herself a sigh of relief. Grabbing the edge of the table and hauling herself to her feet, she twisted her head to try and assess the damage. There was a large crescent shaped hole, exposing the seat of her plain white panties as well as a significant amount of her expanded butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do? She couldn't go to the party with her ass hanging out and her belly on full display, but she still had to deliver the food. Where could she find another costume on such short notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up as she realised the obvious solution. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I'm going to say something.\" Britta said for what Troy reckoned had to be the hundredth time. And that was only since they had sat down to lunch twenty minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the cafeteria, Annie was sitting at a booth by herself, practically surrounded by Tupperware containers. Every so often she would dip her hand into one of the boxes and retrieve some sort of baked good, take a few bites and then make some careful notes on a pad of paper. Once the pastry was gone she would brush the crumbs from her notepad and the process would repeat itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta hadn't really minded when Annie took over their baking class, even when she had insisted on splitting up all the pairs, which meant Britta could no longer just sit back and let Shirley do all the work.  She was happy for her friend, who seemed so excited about her new job. Sure she had put on a little weight, but she had been under stress, and hey, it was college. A small part of Britta, one she tried her best to suppress, was actually glad the perfect little Miss Edison had finally succumbed to the Freshman Fifteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once it became clear that the Freshman Fifteen was rapidly turning into the Freshman Thirty, Britta began to have reservations. Far be it from her to impose some artificial standard of body image, but she couldn't help but feel concerned. She wanted to ask the rest of the group what they thought, but she felt Annie wouldn't appreciate her talking to Jeff about the subject, and Shirley had been acting even more passive-aggressive than usual whenever Annie's name came up. She hadn't even bothered with Pierce, and Abed just kept babbling something about fanfiction. That left Troy, so she had invited him to have lunch. She had just broached the subject when they spotted Annie sitting just a few tables away. Watching her for a few minutes had elegantly proven Britta's point, and since then she had simply been arguing with herself about what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Britta asked finally, turning back to Troy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" He said distractedly, still looking over at Annie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta followed his gaze and saw that Annie's dark green skirt was hiked up on one side, exposing an acre of pale milky thigh. Britta rolled her eyes and stood up from the table, having at last made a decision. Troy didn't even notice her leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Annie a minute or two to notice her arrival, she was so intent on the cookie she was eating. She had chewed, swallowed and even jotted down a few notes before she realised Britta had sat down across from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hi Britta.\" She said cheerfully, already reaching for another cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Annie.\" Britta said, in a sympathetic voice. \"I need to talk to you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked confused, then nodded in understanding. \"Is it about your grades?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's- wait, what's wrong with my grades?\" Britta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked confused again. \"Don't you check the online noticeboard I set up? I post the grades for each class at the end of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta looked at her blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, you've gotten an F for the last three classes. Technically you're failing.\" Annie told her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I failing?!\" Britta asked, with a mixture of shock and anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, remember those butter cookies we made yesterday?\" Annie asked, handing her one from the open box. Britta shoved the whole thing into her mouth and began to chew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'sh good.\" She said, spraying crumbs across the table. \"What'sh the problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie smiled sadly. \"That was one of Shirley's cookies.\" She reached for another box and popped open the lid. \"These ones are yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering inside, Britta saw that her cookies were much smaller, flatter and paler than the one she was eating, as well as being slightly burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" She said, swallowing in embarrassment and nearly choking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Annie said kindly. She reached over and patted her friend on the shoulder, her belly bumping up against the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta was stunned. She had taken Baking to pad her grades, not to tank them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, I could give you a little tutoring, maybe some extra-credit assignments?\" Annie offered, before taking a bite from another one of Shirley's cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Britta asked hopefully. \"That would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can start now!\" Annie said excitedly, squeezing out of the booth and gathering her notes. \"Could you carry those boxes for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Britta gathered the Tupperware into a wobbly stack the pair made their way out of the cafeteria together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if my cookies were so bad, why were there only five left?\" Britta asked as they walked. \"I made like, two dozen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Annie looked embarrassed, a slight flush coming to her chubby cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to give them a fair chance.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened it and sniffed it suspiciously, taking a small sip and then a larger gulp. She wrinkled her nose and looked over to Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What flavour is yours?\" She asked, before taking another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says Kiwi-Strawberry on the can, but it just tastes like, well, sweet.\" Annie admitted, drinking some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta nodded agreement and they resumed walking, still chatting and drinking. When they reached the library, they both had roughly half a can left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta shook hers, listening to the remaining liquid slosh around. \"Do you want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie shook her head. They both took one last gulp and tossed the cans into the trash, before entering the library. They talked quietly as they made their way to the study room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can still taste that stuff.\" Britta complained, sticking out her tongue. \"I wonder what idiot let them set up on campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all I have to do is let you test-market your new energy drink here at Greendale, and I get all this merchandise for free?\" Dean Pelton asked happily, adjusting his 'Joost' baseball cap and zipping up his 'Joost' bomber jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" The voice coming over the phone's speaker was deep and slightly garbled. \"This process is intended to estimate the potential market share of 'Joost', as well as field test a certain number of potential side-effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Side-effects?\" The Dean asked distractedly, admiring his new 'Joost' mousepad and staple remover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice paused for a few seconds, then continued. \"Yes, as well as the intended addictive qualities, 'Joost' has also produced secondary side-effects in a small percentage of female subjects. Over consumption can lead to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After sorting through the latest issues and emotional drama, they had just been about the actually start studying when they were interrupted by Dean Pelton sticking his head around the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, my little study group-troopers, what can I 'Dean' for you today?\" He continued, walking into the room, carrying a cardboard box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you could just 'Dean' us the hell alone... What are you wearing?\" Jeff asked, looking him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked Jeff. See, as well as overseeing the smooth sailing of your \"education\", I'm also here to inform you about the exiting new brand partnership that is taking Greendale to the next level.\" The Dean explained, gesturing to his heavily branded clothing. \"Who's ready to boost some 'Joost'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he walked around the table placing a can in front of each person. \"Now available in Pineapple-Guava.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPierce squinted at the label. \"What is it, some sort of lubricant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude, it's an energy drink.\" Troy said hurriedly, taking the can from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's not just an energy drink.\" The Dean responded, taking a card from his pocket and adjusting his glasses. \"''Joost' is an energy drink'... Well I suppose it is an energy drink but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this.\" Abed interrupted. \"Blatant product placement is more suited to daytime soap operas and crass CBS sitcoms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Abed, but for actual, rational reasons.\" Jeff . \"This doesn't really help with your whole 'this is a real college' shtick. How much money are you getting to give up what little academic dignity Greendale has?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean Pelton adjusted his 'Joost' branded tie nervously. \"Yes. Money. I am definitely getting some of that, I can tell you. Um, I have to go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scampered out, leaving Jeff rolling his eyes. \"Well, I've lost all motivation for studying, I'm going home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood up, Annie spoke up. \"Don't you want your 'Joost'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some general mumbling as the others left one by one, until finally only Britta and Annie were left with the abandoned cans of 'Joost'. They smiled across the table at each other, then spoke simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you.-\"<br>\r\n \"Well, I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled again, until Britta broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm actually kind of thirsty.\" She said casually, picking up the can and scanning the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie nodded. \"I haven't tried this flavour yet.\" She said primly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling justified, they both popped the tabs and took a long drink. Annie broke away first, gasping and sticking out her tongue. It didn't taste any different from the other one she had tried, still sickly sweet and syrupy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta had drained half the can before she took a breather. \"That's disgusting.\" she said, stifling a burp.<br>\r\nAnnie agreed, but they both kept drinking until their can was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another small pause. \"It's a shame to just throw these away.\" Annie said quietly, gesturing to the other cans dotted around the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasteful.\" Britta said solemnly, shaking her head. \"We could recycle the cans, if we empty them out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they both grabbed a second can, drinking this one faster than the first. Britta guzzled hers in under thirty seconds, with Annie just a few seconds behind. Without hesitation they each grabbed a third and drank that too. As the empty cans hit the table, Britta let out a large belch, unable to hold it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite both feeling quite full at this stage, as one their eyes fell upon the final can, which had nominally been Troy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, hic, I could take that, hic, one, if you're not thirsty any, hic, more.\" Annie said, hiccoughing as she inched down the table towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really, its fine. It's uh, pineapple-guava, which is actually my, urp, favourite.\" Britta said politely, mirroring Annie's movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they were right in front of it. They both offered to take it one last time, the other insisting against it. Finally, glancing around to make sure they were unobserved, they settled it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scissors! I, hic, win!\" Annie said happily, grabbing the can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta, cursing her selection of paper, turned and grabbed her bag as Annie started drinking, a thin stream of the green liquid escaping the side of her mouth and running down her chin. The blonde stomped out, her full belly sloshing slightly. She knew she had to get to class, but maybe she would go see if she could snag some more 'Joost' first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she left she gathered up the empty cans and dropped them into the waste paper bin, a little embarrassed at how much she had drunk. Strangely, she didn't feel bloated at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie had to hurry to get to her next class, taking her usual seat right at the front. She was usually incredibly attentive, taking copious, exhaustive notes, but today something was a little off. She was feeling a little  flushed, even though it was a mild enough day. She undid the top button of her sweater, exposing more of her cleavage, and felt a little better. By the end of the class however she was uncomfortable once again, shifting in her seat and attempting to surreptitiously adjust her bra. Could it have shrunk in the laundry? It fit her fine this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, she hurried to the girl's bathroom, the one down by the old woodworking shop that most people avoided. After making sure she was alone, she undid the rest of her buttons, revealing her lacy red bra. Annie had been a late bloomer, and was decidedly proud of her assets, and so liked to invest in supportive, well-fitting underwear. This bra was now only meeting one of those requirements, as her breasts were bulging over the tops of the cups, the straps digging in to her shoulders.<br>\r\nShe placed her hands over her boobs, feeling the extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the bra hadn't shrunk, that must have meant her breasts had grown, which, while not outside the realm of possibility, shouldn't have happened so fast. Under her palms, she felt her nipples harden through the thin material, and suddenly felt a deep thirst. She licked her lips and quickly re-buttoned her sweater. She could figure this out later, she decided, right now she needed some more 'Joost'! </span></div></div>",

The person on the other end of the phone ignored the implication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, only a small percentage will experience... that. The majority will only suffer from the usual side effects of energy drink consumption, albeit at an accelerated level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean Pelton frowned. \"What side effects are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply was casual and disinterested. \"Bloating and hyperactivity, followed by skin irritation and weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... Ugh... I don't feel so good...\" Britta groaned, before letting out a thunderous belch. She had gotten two cans of 'Joost' from the mascot who was handing them out, and found another three sitting abandoned on a bench. Added to the ones she had already drank, her stomach looked and felt like she had swallowed a basketball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bulged out over the waistband of her jeans, and the buttons of her shirt strained to contain it, allowing glimpses at her taut, pale flesh underneath. She rubbed it gently, causing another belch to come bubbling up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britta?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated blonde turned her head to see Shirley giving her a concerned look. She blushed, her cheeks flushing red as she attempted to do up her leather jacket, keeping her back to Shirley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Shirley... How, uh, how are you?\" Britta asked, fumbling with the zipper and sucking in her swollen gut as best she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm fine. Are you?\" Shirley replied, raising her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Britta got the jacket zipped up and turned to face her friend. Her stomach was still causing a noticeable bulge beneath the leather, even though she was holding her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm just... Is that 'Joost'?\" She said suddenly, spotting the can in Shirley's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman frowned at her friend's odd behaviour. \"Yeah, it's orange-mango flavour. It's  new, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta nodded silently, her eye twitching slightly as she licked her lips slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley was now officially freaked out. \"You want it?\" She asked holding it out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta didn't hesitate, grabbing the drink and practically scurrying away, leaving Shirley shaking her head in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt what she deemed to be a safe distance, just behind a large shrub, Britta cracked open the can, cursing her shaking fingers as she lifted it to her mouth. Within seconds it was empty, and she let it fall to the ground, burping three times in quick succession. Her bloated belly surged out even further, pressing against her jacket with an audible creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed both hands on the large dome of her stomach, massaging it gently. She had to stop drinking that stuff, she told herself sternly, no matter how good it tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" She murmured, having caught a glimpse of her watch. Her next class started in five minutes. Walking as quickly as she could with the unaccustomed weight around her middle, she set off, feeling like she was going to throw up.</span></div></div>",

Could I please have some of that 'Joost'? I'm so thirsty.\" She had pleaded, biting her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Neil was surprised, but after looking her up and down, he seemed more than happy to share with her. And he didn't  seem to mind when she tilted her head back and drank the whole thing. Neither did Garrett, or Pavel, or Leonard, or even Star-Burns, all of whom eagerly crowded round and offered cans of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie was genuinely touched, unaware that their generosity was motivated by her newly expanded assets, which were practically popping out of her hastily-buttoned sweater. After finishing off the last can, she burped, causing her breasts to jiggle slightly, and causing her admirers to let out a simultaneous groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, excuse me!\" Annie had said obliviously, handing the empty can back to Star-Burns, who was practically drooling. \"Are there any left?\" She had asked, still not quite satiated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, no.\" Garrett had replied. \"But, we can go get you some!\" He squawked, spinning around and running down the hall, followed closely by the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie had shrugged, once again causing her boobs to bounce, and continued on to her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow,  at the same moment Britta was hurrying across the quad, Annie was sitting in class, taking notes as the professor droned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually however, her mind began to wander and she started feeling uncomfortably warm again. Fanning herself with a notebook, she winced as she felt a pinch across her shoulders. She tried to ignore it, squinting at the blackboard as she attempted to focus on the lecture. It didn't go away however, actually increasing to a sharp pain as her bra straps dug deeper into her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she vainly tried to pretend it wasn't happening, Annie's boobs continued to grow larger. They had already been straining her bra, but now they were threatening to burst out. With an audible ping, her sweater's top button went flying off, actually hitting the blackboard and allowing her breasts to surge forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, Annie grabbed her open textbook and used it to cover herself up, just as the other students turned to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Edison? Is everything all right?\" The lecturer asked, unaware of what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, I just uh, have to go now, I have a, uh, a doctor's appointment.\" Annie stammered, awkwardly extricating herself from the desk as she kept the heavy book pressed against her chest. She almost dropped it as she bent down to grab her book bag, before leaving the room as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the relative privacy of the empty hallway, Annie peeked beneath the book. Her bra was just about hanging on, pushed to the limit by her now D-cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's happening to me?' She wondered, placing one hand on her right boob and squeezing it tentatively. Her nipple hardened under her hand, and she let out a little moan. It seemed they had increased in sensitivity as well as size... It took her a second to remember where she was, but when she did she blushed furiously. She had to get somewhere more private...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had run all the way from the quad, which hadn't exactly helped with the queasy feeling in her stomach. The changing room was empty, and judging by the rhythmic stamping coming from the next room, her dance class had already started.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly took off her leather jacket and unbuttoned her blouse, pausing for a moment to examine her bloated belly. It seemed to have gone down a little, which she took as a good sign. After wiggling out of her jeans, she fumbled around in her bag and pulled out a pair of sheer black tights. These slipped on easily enough, coming up just over her hips, but she could have sworn they felt snugger than usual. Her leotard, once she squeezed into it, was even worse, constricting her stomach and riding up slightly between her butt-cheeks. As she bent down to lace up her tap shoes, this turned into a full on wedgie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged on the wayward spandex, but it refused to budge. \"Stupid thing must have shrunk...\" she grumbled to herself, forgetting that she had neglected to wash it after the previous class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off, Britta clacked her way into the studio, taking her place at the back of the group and attempting to follow along with the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, two, three. One, two, three.\" She counted under her breath, her movements made clumsier by her uncomfortable clothing. She slid her hand behind her back, attempting to pick out the wedgie. As she ran her hand over her butt, she raised her eyebrows. It felt a lot fuller, and softer, than she remembered. She looked over at the mirror that covered the far wall, and couldn't suppress a gasp. Her ass was huge! The leotard had been completely swallowed by her butt crack, allowing her butt to bounce up and down freely as she danced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinched and squeezed it, unable to believe it was actually hers. She had stopped dancing at this point, twisting her head around to try and see it for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked back to the mirror, she saw to her horror that it wasn't just her ass. Her thighs appeared to have gotten thicker as well, and her hips had accumulated a little extra width. She poked her belly, which she realised was no longer hard and swollen, but soft and jiggly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music stopped, and the teacher announced a five minute break. The other students began stretching, drinking water and talking quietly. A few of them glanced at Britta, but no seemed to notice anything too out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she imagining it? She looked in the mirror again, putting her hands on her hips and turning to the side. Her butt stuck out proudly, her panty lines clearly visible through the thin material. Had she just gained weight without noticing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a second opinion, and she needed it now. As stealthily as possible for someone wearing tap shoes, she slipped back into the changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, she really let herself go.\" Someone remarked once the door swung closed, to a general murmur of agreement.</span></div></div>",

What are you doing in here?\" She asked, sucking in her stomach as her friend turned towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I had my dance class earlier, and I left my walkie-talkie in here.\" He explained, holding up the colourful plastic handset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, cool.\" Britta said, inching towards her bag, careful to remain facing Troy. \"Well, I was just going to get changed, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy nodded, turning on his walkie-talkie and extending the antennae. \"Constable Reggie to Inspector Spacetime, do you read me Inspector?\" He enquired as he walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta relaxed. Troy hadn't said anything about her weight. Maybe it wasn't as bad a she thought. She was still eager to get out of her uncomfortable dance outfit, even if she wasn't sure how well her jeans would fit anymore. She bent over and opened her bag,  giving Troy a prime view of her expanded rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had re-opened the door intending to ask her a question, but the sight of her Lycra-clad badonkadonk was enough to drive it out of his mind. The material of her leggings was stretched so tight by her enlarged buttocks that it was almost transparent. He silently allowed the door to swing shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy's mind was still reeling. Where had Britta been hiding that booty? She had always had a nice ass, but this was on a whole other level. There was a short burst of static from his walkie-talkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Constable Reggie? Are you there?\" Abed asked, affecting a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh muh bluh nuh...\" Troy mumbled into the receiver, his brain still not quite recovered from the sight of Britta's bountiful butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast, the Blogons must have hit you with their bamboozle ray. We must rendez-vouz at the space cafeteria.\" Abed continued obliviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy nodded, and wandered back down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the changing room, Britta was re-buttoning her shirt. She had managed to squeeze back  into her jeans, though the faded denim was now practically skin-tight, and the waistband dug  into her hips and stomach, creating a small muffin-top all the way around. Her bulging potbelly was also putting a strain on her shirt,  the lower buttons straining to contain it. With a sigh, she put on her leather jacket and took a look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as noticeable as it had been in her dance outfit, but it was still pretty obvious she had gained some weight, especially if she turned to the side, her ass sticking out prominently behind her. On top of everything else, a pimple had sprouted just to the left of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frustrated groan, the bottom-heavy blonde grabbed her bag.

The sensation almost caused Annie to let out a groan of her own, biting her lip to stifle it. Squeaking with embarrassment, she hopped up as quickly as she could and helped the blonde to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.\" Annie apologised, as Britta brushed herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, I'm...\" Britta began, before she caught sight of her friend's chest. Their collision had spelt the end of her sweater's last remaining buttons, as well as her strained bra, meaning Annie's boobs were now completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly realised this and attempted to cover herself with her arms. \"Um, yeah, I think I might be having an allergic reaction to something.\" She said lamely, as Britta gawked openly at her expanded breasts. \"Could you, um,  lend me a shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring with amazement, Britta reached into her bag and pulled out an old grey t-shirt with the Greendale Athletics logo on the front. Annie grabbed it gratefully and turned around. After slipping out of her ruined sweater, she pulled the shirt on over her head. It was a little small, clinging to her skin and displaying the full curve of her breasts. It didn't quite reach down to her skirt's waistband, leaving her midriff bare, but it was still preferable to walking around half-naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back around, to see Britta still looking confused. She answered the question before Britta could ask it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how. It might have something to do with all the 'Joost' I've been drinking.\" Annie explained, being a lot smarter than people might have guessed based on her looks, especially if they had seen her recently. \"Have you noticed anything strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta looked down at her own chest, but it seemed that her growth had been confined to her ass, thighs and stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... No.\" She lied, through a mixture of embarrassment and slight envy. \"But, uh we should investigate this, see if anyone else is being affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie nodded. \"Or we could just go straight to the source of the 'Joost', and get some answers.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently Dean Pelton decided to place these machines in due to popular demand, leaving the water fountains that once charged people to drink out of, abandoned and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out,\" Annie observed, \"It seems that the females are the only ones who are affected by the Joost!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed so. The males, some who had even more Joost cans on hand than the females, looked no different whatsoever weight wise. Fat Neil, who had several cans, looked around at the females in confusion, but just smiled and went on drinking his Joost, no longer feeling so out of place as a student walked by and just called him \"Neil\". Meanwhile, in comparison, Professor Michelle Slater walked by, her clothing looking tighter than usual. Her slim stomach now sported a small bulge as she stifled a small hiccup and took another sip of her Joost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this calls for a protest Annie!

Before they even knew it, they were stuffing more change into the machine and drinking more of the addicting drink. Annie's grey shirt that Britta gave her previously was already tightening with every can she went though, riding up more and exposing more midriff. Her belly, while not as bloated as Britta's, poked out more from under the shirt and became more swollen and noticeable. The outline of her bra became visible as her shirt pressed against her chest, almost enough to notice the purple flower pattern on the bra if one looked hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritta was expanding just as fast as Annie was, only more located in her butt and belly areas. Her jeans tightening as she continued to go through Boost Joost cans, her belly almost inflating like a balloon. Her stomach almost looked pregnant as her shirt had rode up and exposed a fair bit of her rounded, swollen belly. Even her chest joined in the growth, rounding out and protruding outwards at least another cup. Britta didn't even notice when a button flew off her jeans and pelted a passing student in the leg. The student yelped then looked up, seeing that the V fly of Britta's jeans had pushed down, revealing a peek of the front of her floral green panties. He whistled and limped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor these two girls, it was almost like a trance, each time they hiccuped, the two ladies seemed to bloat out a bit more. Finally, they laid back swollen and filled with Joost, holding back a hiccup everyone now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're quenced, Annie\" Britta said through her bloated cheeks finishing the last mouthful of Joost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a small crowd of students formed around them, muttering to each other and even made a few females promptly throw their Joost in the recycling. Annie noticed the crowd around her in her bloated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britta, look, I think we're inadvertently protesting! They are seeing us and seeing the effects of the Joost!\" Annie looked in both surprise and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Britta pondered. \"We could use that to our advantage. We can keep drinking Joost, and the more we do, the more students will begin to stop drinking the stuff!\" Britta began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that,\" Annie concurred. \"Or we can think of another plan of protest to spare our bodies. Right green flower?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm willing to do whatever for the cause, for the women Annie- what?\" Britta looked down and remembered her exposed green flower panties from the fly of her jeans pushed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, purple flower\" Britta retorted as Annie promptly pulled up her shirt more to cover her bloated chest that showed a peek of her purple flower bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whichever we choose though Annie, we first got to get a change of clothes.\" Britta stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie nodded her head.</span></div></div>",

Her skin appeared greasy, with a small crop of pimples visible on her forehead and a larger one sprouting just beside her nose, and her left eye was twitching occasionally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie suppressed a smile at the Dean's comments and continued the questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this stuff coming from? Who's the parent company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dean almost broke down, but miraculously thought of one last ploy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure that kind of thing is probably on the label.\" He said, reaching beneath his desk and heaving up a case of Joost cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just check on these cans of all-new raspberry-lime flavoured Joost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie and Britta both took a step forward, almost unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raspberry-Lime?\" Annie asked, her eyes widening as she licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't tried that one before...\" Britta murmured, taking another step towards the Dean's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean Pelton smiled, pushing the pallet towards them. \"Please, help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the invitation they needed, and soon the pair were feverishly slugging back can after can of energy drink, their stomachs swelling and bloating with every gulp. There were thirty-six cans in the pack,  but that would only buy him a few minutes if they kept up this rate. Keeping this in mind, the Dean quietly slipped past them and exited the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the phone on the desk outside and carefully dialled the number he had been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have two students here, asking some difficult questions.\" He whispered, looking nervously at the door to his office. After a pause he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're distracted right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another brief pause as the person on the other end if the phone asked another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of them's just a regular fatty, but the other must be part of that 'very small percentage'' or whatever, because she's gone from cantaloupes to freaking watermelons!\" He said, his voice getting more high-pitched as he began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person on the phone told him to calm down, that they had a protocol for handling this kind of thing. Could he stall them for another twenty minutes? If he could, they would definitely be able to discuss monetary rewards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dean nodded, before remembering he was on the phone, and emitting a strangled 'yes'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the phone down and gingerly stepped back towards his office. Even through the closed door he could hear the sounds of slurping and gulping, along with the fizz of fresh cans being opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A short fifteen minutes had passed since the girls began their glut upon the addictive and chemical loaded energy drinks and it sure did show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie's already large breasts were straining the shirt Britta had leant her to its limits. Even through such a short amount of time they must have bumped up near another cup size leaving her nipples even more taut and sore then before and quite obviously digging into the fabric despite the embarrassment of their owner.  Even Annie's belly, once firm and toned had started to bloat out significantly. Her shirt already not completely covering her midsection now rested slightly above her navel. The button having been released from its fabric confines long ago in order to make breathing slightly more comfortable for her sloshing gut. Resting slightly over the waistband, the slightest press would quite possibly leave those eighteen cans she drank all over the floor. It even seemed like her skirt was beginning to get quite snug against her rear. Just beside her, Britta was having wardrobe troubles of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving drank the other half of the Joost supply, Britta's sloshing gut wasn't doing to hot. It hung a full inch over the button on her jeans, or it would have had said button not popped off halfway through her eleventh can. A sliver of pink panties was visible in between the the v of where her pants were unzipped. In its stuffed stupor, the slightest movement would give way to the uncomfortable jostling and wobbling of all the liquid inside of her gut.  Her bare belly nearly fully on display due to her complete inability to button the bottom half of her shirt. The top half of her shirt however was completely comfortable as little to none of the weight had made its way up to her breasts. Her hips, ass and thighs however, had really absorbed the calories. Even though her jeans were unbuttoned they were still being stretched to capacity by her flabby lower body. Her meaty rump filling out the jeans and then some as the top inch of her butt crack peaked out to say hello to the world. She was currently seated in the deans chair massaging her gut in order to release the gas in whatever way she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls continued to groan, moan and belch. The Dean, or Craig, reemerged with a couple more cans of Joost and as well the prospect of a potential solution. <br>\r\n\"Dean-a-ling! Hello ladies how are you-,\" Craig stopped his over charismatic drabble to actually inspect the girls. They looked miserable. \"Oh no, let me see if I can find any of those antacids I keep in here.\" <br>\r\n\"ThURRRPanks,\" Annie tried to mutter before her gaseous eruption. Craig having found his tablets laid them on his desk only for both women to be unable to lean forward enough to reach it. Having noticed this the Dean quickly popped out a couple and placed them in each ladies open palm and both having gulped them down as soon as they had the opportunity. Both girls let a sigh of relief as they immediately felt better having those tablets inside them. To be honest, after that Joost binge neither lady exactly remembers why they came in to the deans office to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I urp, feel so much better now after urrrp having those antacids.\" Britta exclaimed. She even tried standing up in which she did so successfully, but not without passing gas a few times shamelessly. She then waddled on over to the still full Annie and helped her out of her chair with a loud grunt. Both girls exhausted, thanked the Dean as they waddled out arm in arm and leaving the Dean breathless as to how he managed out of that situation without any conflict. </span></div></div>",

She stormed out of the kitchen, almost bumping straight into Boyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Diaz, I saw you were running late, and I figured you'd want a donut, so...\" He held up two donuts, one with a chocolate glaze, the other with powdered sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz grabbed the chocolate covered pastry and took a large bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoyle smiled. \"Perfect, one for you and one for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish she crammed the rest of the donut in her mouth and grabbed the other one as well, grunting her thanks and making her way to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, the answer is somewhere in these files and we can't stop looking until we find it.\" Santiago insisted, her enthusiasm undimmed despite the late hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long conference table was covered in piles of manila folders, with more boxes stacked neatly by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on guys, got one more box here.\" Peralta announced as he entered the room, carrying a box of Chinese food containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a ragged cheer as Peralta dumped the box on the table and began distributing the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crispy duck for Diaz, mu shu pork for me, chicken balls for Boyle, sweet and sour ribs for Diaz, chicken  chow mein for Santiago, spring rolls for Diaz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause as the three detectives looked down the table at their colleague, who was already digging in to her crispy duck, chewing as she opened up the other containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked, with a menacing glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Santiago, Boyle and Peralta said simultaneously, returning to their own meals without further comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right Diaz, these are the best subs on the East side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz nodded, stifling a belch and taking another bite of her sandwich. She and Peralta had been on stake-out for almost ten hours, sitting in a car across the street from a run-down little boxing gym, which was apparently the centre of the biggest steroid ring in New York.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished off her sub and was unwrapping a second when Peralta tapped her urgently on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our guy!\" He said, pointing at a muscular woman who had just exited the gym, a sports bag slung over her broad shoulder. She must have heard him, because she glanced in their direction and immediately set off running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeralta cursed and twisted the key in the ignition, the car jolting to life and peeling out with the squeal of burnt rubber. The suspect had already covered a fair distance, but her powerful legs were no match for the<br>\r\neight cylinder engine of the Crown Vic. The car juddered as Peralta pulled up on to the sidewalk, cutting off her escape, and Diaz immediately jumped  out of the car, gun and badge raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NYPD, freeze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drama of the moment was somewhat undercut by the cascade of paper bags, food wrappers and plastic cups that had collected under her seat during the ten hour stakeout. Even as Peralta was cuffing her, having opened the sports bag to reveal a treasure trove of performance enhancing drugs, she continued staring at Diaz with bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz returned her stare with a glare of her own, and climbed back into the car to radio for a pick-up. Plus, she still had that second meatball sub...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, Boyle succeeded in pulling the filing cabinet away from the wall, revealing a previously hidden air duct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot.\" Santiago smiled, pleased that her guess had been proven correct. She took the flashlight from her belt and held it out towards Boyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I always have to do it!\" He whined, taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't do it, this is a new suit.\" Santiago countered, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz rolled her eyes. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Santiago and Boyle seemed to have a change of heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, no, I'll do it.\" Boyle said, stepping forward to block her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago nodded, but Diaz ignored them, shrugging off her jacket and throwing it over a nearby chair, before unclipping her holster and handing it to Boyle. She grabbed the torch and knelt down, peering into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked on the torch and slid forward into the vent, the light bouncing off the dull metal, and she glimpsed something about six feet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something down here all right. Looks like a phone\" She called back to the others, crawling deeper into the vent. It was smaller than she had thought, and only got narrower the further she went, squeezing in on her from both sides, forcing her down on to her stomach. She had almost reached the phone when she realised she couldn't get any closer. She stretched out, her fingertips brushing it, but she was unable to get a grip on it, only succeeding in knocking it further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and tried to move backwards, only to find she couldn't. She braced herself against the walls of the vent and pushed, but she was stuck fast. She tried again, pushing harder this time, but her hands couldn't find enough purchase on the smooth metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diaz, is everything okay?\" Santiago asked, her voice echoing down the vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz considered her options. She could either admit she was stuck, or stay here until she starved to death. Right now, she was leaning towards the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Boyle and Santiago almost ten minutes to get her out of the vent,  grasping her ankles firmly and and pulling as hard as they could. When she emerged, red-faced and sweating, she grabbed her jacket and stormed out without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the station, she had swiftly made her way to the locker room, and stood in front of the full length mirror. Cracked and grimy as it was, it still clearly reflected what she had been denying for weeks: she had gained weight. She had put on at least thirty pounds, and it was no wonder she had gotten stuck in that vent, as most of it had gone straight to her ass, hips and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had felt her pants getting tighter over the last few weeks, but she had blamed the laundromat for shrinking her clothes. The fact that her appetite had increased was perfectly illustrated when she opened her locker, and a number of candy bars  tumbled out. Bending down to pick them up, she was horrified to to hear the sound of her jeans ripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jerked back up and pressed herself against the lockers, just as Gina entered the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diaz? Captain Holt wants to see you.\" The civilian administrator said in a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, waiting until Gina had left to turn around and examine the new hole in her pants. It was the size of a playing card, right across the seat of her pants, exposing the top of her thong and a good portion of her expanded buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd have to find something else to wear before meeting with Captain Holt. But why did he want to see her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was he going to talk to her about her weight? She picked at the grey fabric of her track pants, the only other clothing she had in her locker. They were a lot more forgiving than the tight denim of her jeans, but still couldn't disguise the wideness of her hips or the swell of her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed as Captain Holt continued to read what looked like a memo, and Diaz continued to worry. Surely he wouldn't say anything. He never said anything to Hitchcock or Scully, he couldn't single her out because she was a woman. What made it worse was that she was hungry, starving in fact,  and to her horror her stomach actually emitted an audible growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Holt looked up from his memo, but Diaz played it cool, unconcernedly studying her fingernails.

She had done undercover work twice before, and she had enjoyed it, a nice break from the day to day routine. She nodded her head, recovering her confidence a little.

She had been briefed on the suspect, one Rodrigo Ramos, owner and operator of 'La Hacienda', a small Mexican restaurant in Williamsburg. He had apparently been supplementing his income by dealing drugs, and now Vice needed someone on the inside to find out where the drugs were kept, and when they would be on the premises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'La Hacienda' wasn't open when Diaz arrived, just past noon, but after knocking on the glass door, the man behind the counter waved for her to come  in. The man was Rodrigo Ramos, she had recognized him from the surveillance photos. She walked straight up to the counter and told him she was looking for a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely even glanced at the resume that she placed on the counter, continuing to polish a glass as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Miss...What did you say your name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delgado. Rosa Delgado.\" Diaz said, playing up her accent a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry Miss Delgado, but I already got all the staff I need.\" He left the resume where it was and grabbed a damp cloth. He emerged from behind the counter was about start wiping down the tables, when he must have caught sight of her ass. It was pretty hard to miss, packed tightly into what had once been her largest pair of jeans. Judging by the way he smiled, he must have liked what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... Now that I think about it, I could use someone to cover the afternoon shift, couple of days a week.\" He said, still staring at her ass. \"Strictly off the books of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz had been expecting this. According to her briefing notes, none of his employees were actually 'on' the books. She nodded, trying to look grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamos pulled out a chair and gestured for her to sit down, before  disappeared into the kitchen. There was some shouting, and he emerged a short time later with a small platter of burritos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can start tomorrow, one o'clock. Six bucks an hour, plus tips.\" He placed the platter down, gestured for her to eat, then returned to his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz needed no encouragement, as the burritos smelled delicious. The first one she tried was chicken,  with the perfect balance of beans, rice and cheese, and plenty of sour cream. It was nice and spicy too, the way she liked them. She finished it quickly and moved on to the next one. This one was pork carnitas, and if anything was even better than the first. Why did he need to deal drugs if his food was this good, she wondered as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final burrito was filled with some sort of braised beef, and she was just swallowing the last bite when Ramos returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you ate all of them.\" He said, sounding impressed. \"I'd offer you some more but we're opening soon, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiaz grabbed her purse and Ramos walked her to the door. He held the door open for her, and as she walked past him he gave her ass a quick squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow.\" He grinned, and it took all of her self control not to spin around and punch his leering face. She walked quickly down the street until her anger subsided. She was supposed to head straight back to the precinct, but those burritos had really just whetted her appetite. There was pizzeria just down the block, maybe she could get a slice or two...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It makes the force look bad, it makes us look bad, and worst of all, it makes Captain Holt look bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It' was Gina, the precinct's office administrator, or more specifically, her belly. Recently Gina had put on a noticeable amount of weight, while neglecting to adjust her wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was a pot-belly that was constantly on display, peeking out from under all of her shirts, while the tight waistband of her slacks caused her flabby midsection to form a muffin top all the way around. Her tendency to lounge back in her chair with her feet up on the desk didn't help matters, displaying her doughy physique to anyone who entered the precinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm just going to mention it to her. She'll probably thank me.\" Santiago continued, standing up and walking towards Gina's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rolled his eyes, while Boyle just looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina?\" Santiago said quietly, but wanting to make a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Santiago.\" Gina said, looking up over the magazine she was reading. \"Just doing a little filing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can I talk to you about something?\" Santiago said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it.\" Gina said, letting the magazine slide to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago took a deep breath. \"Well, recently, I've noticed you've been putting on a little, well, weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina looked a little surprised, but didn't seem too upset by the observation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I have been porking up a bit while the old dance troupe is on hiatus.\" She said, patting her belly. \"We're down to only three members. You know, if you want I could probably get you an audition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago ignored the offer and pressed on with what she had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just think, in the workplace, you should try to dress more appropriately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina smiled wryly. \"I guess it is a little unprofessional, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Santiago said, also smiling. \"You just need to go shopping, buy a few outfits that fit you better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'll take any excuse to go shopping.\" Gina said jovially. \"And thank you  for the advice Santiago, I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it!\" Santiago said, returning to her desk with a satisfied smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Peralta, I told you she would thank me.\" She said, unable to resist gloating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up from his doodling.\"I'm sorry, what? I stopped paying attention when I realised this didn't affect me in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago's smile turned into her usual scowl, and from there the day carried on as usual too. There were plenty of cases to investigate, suspects to interview, pieces of evidence to collect. Santiago didn't give her conversation with Gina another thought. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a quiet morning in the precinct,  and most of the detective staff were sitting at their desks, catching up on their paperwork. Santiago had just gotten herself a refill of coffee and was sitting back down in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it.\" She said, loud enough for Peralta to look over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" He asked. \"Still having trouble with that strangler case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up in surprise. \"Uh, no, I was just... I just remembered something I forgot to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it pluck that hair from your chin?\" Peralta said, grinning as she reached reflexively for her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real reason for her annoyance was that her pants button had just popped open as she sat down. She looked around to make sure no one was looking and fastened it again, sucking in slightly to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago had always made a point of staying fit, eating healthily and working out regularly, but recently this had been impossible to achieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo begin with, for the past month her rostering had been unusually irregular, a mixture of early and late night shifts, and barely any days off. When she asked Gina about it, she had told her they were still working out the kinks with the new scheduling software.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this she found herself spending a lot more time sitting at her desk. Some of it was simply filling out the paperwork generated by her various cases, but a lot more of it was undertaking the special projects Captain Holt had started assigning her. Looking through cold cases, collating arrest data, summarising departmental reports... Every few days she would find a new box of files on her desk, with a note from the captain congratulating her on her good work and requesting she make a start on the next one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't even realised what she was doing at first. When she got home late it was easier to eat junk food or order some takeout rather than spend an hour cooking. If she was trying to finish a project, it was better to work through lunch, just grabbing some pastries and coffee from the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was that over the past month she had slowly but surely been putting on weight. Just a few pounds here and there, but it was starting to add up. Most of it seemed to be settling in her ass, just like her mother had always warned her it would. Her underpants clung uncomfortably to her rounder butt, riding up and giving her a wedgie if she attempted anything faster than a walk. There had also been softening of her midsection, which had transformed from a well toned stomach into a pudgy little belly that pressed against the inside of her shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she should buy some new clothes, but part of her didn't want to give in. As long as her clothes were snug and uncomfortable, it would be a motivator for her to lose weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, that lady whose hat you found sent these over.\" Gina announced, holding up a box of donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, we found that woman's missing son.\" Boyle said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Gina yawned, dropping the box on the closest desk, which happened to be Santiago's. The other detectives swarmed over and took their pick of the freshly baked pastries, before returning to their duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Santiago alone, with a box that still contained seven donuts. She deliberately told herself she wouldn't have one, but it was hard to resist when they were sitting under her nose. She decided to allow herself one. After all, they were a gift from a grateful citizen. It would be rude to refuse. This train of logic was enough to see her through a second donut, before she shook her head and got back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked however, her hand kept creeping back towards the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Sergeant Jeffords was walking last when he noticed the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, donuts.\" He said, licking his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped open the box only to find it was empty, aside from a few crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hitchcock! Scully!\" He said, looking around angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago cringed and hoped he wouldn't notice her swollen stomach, which had once again popped the button of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't, and merely stalked off in search of a different snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip of her coffee and brushing some crumbs off her desk, Santiago pledged to skip lunch and hit the gym when she got off work. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her best intentions, Santiago didn't hit the gym that day. Or the next day, or the day after that. She was embarrassed, unwilling to show off her flabby midsection and rounded rear in her tight work out clothes. She tried working out at home, but even simple aerobics or basic cardio was so much harder than she remembered. And with the couch and especially the fridge only a few feet away, she found it impossible to stay motivated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, she was still swamped with work, Captain Holt sending so many special projects her way that she had to stay late most nights. She started relying on sugary energy drinks to stop herself from crashing, and after a certain time of night only the greasiest fast food places would still deliver. Needless to say, this didn't help with her little weight problem, and in the space of a month she put on another twenty pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer softer stomach had grown into a proper little potbelly, forming a round and noticeable bulge under her shirts.  She had noticed her thighs thickening as well, the gap between them narrowing perilously. This was nothing however, compared to her ass. It had continued to expand, her once pert butt being replaced by a seriously thick booty. It stuck out behind her, pressing hard against the seat of her pants, drawing stares from men wherever she went. She had mixed feelings about this. Even though it was degrading, and it made it more difficult for people to take her seriously as a detective, she couldn't help but feel a little flattered. She had even caught Peralta looking once or twice, which she also had mixed feelings about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she knew that she had to do something, before her weight spiralled out of control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago was walking down the bustling sidewalk, ignoring the wolf-whistle of a construction worker. This morning Sergeant Jeffords had assigned her, Boyle and Diaz to a robbery in an apartment building, just a few blocks from the station. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had volunteered to go get some coffees and meet them there, taking any opportunity for a little extra physical exertion. This was probably made pointless by her decision to get a hotdog on the way there, and another on the way back, but she tried not to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wiping some mustard from her chin when she entered the lobby, walking across to the elevator and pressing the up button with her left hand, a small tray of coffee cups balanced in her right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Miss, the elevator's out of order.\" The doorman called from behind his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago was so dismayed she didn't even bother to tell him that it was 'Detective', not 'Miss'. She double checked her notebook, confirming with a groan that the crime scene was on the 27th floor. She could have jogged up there without breaking a sweat two months ago, but these days she was a little winded after getting up from her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped her notebook back into her pocket and headed for the stairwell. By the second floor she could feel the perspiration beading on her forehead, and by the seventh floor she was sweating freely. The very tops of her thighs were rubbing together, chafing slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was times like this that she was glad that she had given up on regular underwear weeks ago, sick of picking out painful wedgies, and had switched to thongs. These were much more comfortable, though it had increased her embarrassment when her pants split open after she bent down to get a snack from the vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the 13th floor she stopped to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halfway there.\" She told herself, leaning against the handrail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed another break at the 20th floor, and another at the 23rd.  Damp patches were spreading from under her arms, dark against her white blouse. Finally she arrived on the 27th floor, still clutching the tray of now cold coffees. She stepped out of the stairwell and wiped her brow, panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Santiago! Stop him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up to see a scrawny white guy sprinting towards her. Despite her exhaustion, instinct and training kicked in, and within seconds he was down and handcuffed, with her not inconsiderable weight pinning him to the floor. The tray of coffees had been sacrificed, the cold caffeinated liquid now soaking into the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice moves Santiago.\" Boyle said as he trotted over, with Diaz following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found this idiot returning to the scene of the crime, but he bolted.\" Diaz said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago nodded, still short of breath. Diaz helped her to her feet while Boyle dealt with the suspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Diaz asked, looking her up and down. Her shirt had become untucked, exposing a crescent of her belly, and she was still breathing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" Santiago said quickly, trying to disguise how out of shape she had gotten. \"Just, uh, you know, adrenaline rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and hurriedly tucked her shirt back in, difficult due to the snugness of her waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. The techs will finish up with the scene, you want to get some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago had actually had breakfast before work, not to mention the two hotdogs. But after her exertions, she decided she had earned a snack. </span></div></div>",

As the last few people sat down,  Leslie banged her gavel and called the meeting to order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point of the forum was to discuss the location of a new Paunch Burger restaurant, across the street from Pawnee Central High School. Leslie was against it, of course, and had hoped to raise support from the community. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir, this is an issue of public health, not \"nightmarish Orwellian fascism.\" Leslie said with admirable restraint. \"Next question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman in the third row stood up. Leslie stifled a groan as she recognised who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kathryn Pinewood, Pawnee Restaurant Association.\" The woman announced, turning to face the rest of the attendees. \"And I'm here to defend Paunch Burger against any baseless allegations made by government busy bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Leslie's dismay, this was greeted with a round of applause. She glanced at Ann, who gestured for her to re-take control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, this forum is simply to warn people about the danger of exposing our youth to unhealthy eating habits...\" Leslie began, but Kathryn interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for that question Leslie.\" She began, speaking into a microphone she seemed to have conjured out of nowhere. \"Can I just say that Paunch Burger is committed to ensuring our children's health for generations to come, and recent additions to our menu include the Super-Fruit-Smoothie and the Green Garden Salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn jumped to her feet to pre-empt any more applause. \"Oh please. The 'Super-Fruit-Smoothie' doesn't contain any actual fruit, and your salads are just onion rings, bacon bits and cheese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathryn was unfazed. \"Onions are vegetables.\" She stated confidently. \"And as well as these 'healthy' options were are introducing the new 'Paunch Burger Deluxe Junior'. All the flavour of the classic 'Paunch Burger Deluxe', with only twice the calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense.\" April  countered, without looking up from her phone. \"You corporate hag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathryn ignored the insult, turning back towards the front. \"Now Councilwoman Knope, I'm sure you and your associates would never condemn something without even trying it first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words, the doors swung open and three busty women wearing sexed-up versions of the Paunch Burger uniform and carrying heavily laden trays entered the hall. They made their way down the aisle to murmurs and wolf-whistles, as the smell of burgers permeated the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous!\" Leslie protested, as the trays, multiple burgers on each one, were placed down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now Councilwoman,\" Kathryn said sternly, \"the only thing that's ridiculous is you, denying our children the right to delicious burgers without having eaten one yourself. Just try it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she began to lead the assembled citizens in a chorus of 'Try it! Try it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie exchanged looks with Ann and April, then looked down at the burger that had been put in front of her. It was enormous, two quarter  pound patties, three buns, four slices of American cheese, garnished with bacon, onions, and an entire fried egg. The noise from the crowd was almost deafening now, and she knew that there was only one way to shut them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took both hands to pick up the massive burger, and grease dripped down on to the table as she lifted it to her mouth. Taking a deep breath, and opening her mouth as wide as possible, she bit into it, managing to get a little bit of everything. As she chewed, her eyes widened, and silence filled the hall.  When she finally swallowed, she let out a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, this tastes amazing!\" She moaned, immediately taking another, larger bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd let out another round of applause, and Kathryn Pinewood smiled wolfishly. \"Won't you other ladies try one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril shrugged and followed Leslie's example. Ann was more hesitant but she couldn't deny that they smelled delicious. After a few more seconds she gave in and grabbed a burger, and was soon pigging out alongside April and Leslie, the latter of whom had almost finished her first burger and was eyeing a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three more satisfied customers!\" Kathryn announced smugly. \"Now who wants a free t-shirt?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Paunch Burger spokesmodels reappeared, now armed with t-shirt cannons, and began firing them into the crowd, who reacted with whoops and cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie knew that she had just suffered an embarrassing political defeat, but right now all she cared about was eating these delicious Paunch Burgers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the last of the t-shirts had been distributed and the excitement ended, the hall emptied fairly quickly, until the only people left were Kathryn Pinewood and the three representatives of the city government.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was the worst off, having somehow managed to pack away four of the enormous burgers. Her stomach had swollen to the size of a basketball, popping the button on her pants and straining her blouse. She was sitting back in her chair, tentatively poking her belly and letting out the occasional hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril and Ann had both eaten three, matching each other bite for bite. Ann looked queasy as she rubbed her bloated stomach, while April just groaned before letting out a series of small burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathryn Pinewood walked over to the table, ignoring their obvious discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to hand it to you Leslie. I never could have convinced them without you.\" She reached into her pocket and removed what looked like three gold  credit cards, featuring the Paunch Burger logo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are Paunch Burger Gold cards,\" she explained, handing them each one. \"With them, you can get unlimited free food from any Paunch Burger location in Pawnee. Just my way of saying thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie belched. \"We don't want your free, urp, food Ms Pinewood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corporate spokeswoman smiled. \"Fine. Feel free to throw them away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril picked up her card. \"Wow, they have our names on them.\" She said, running her fingers over the embossed plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cool!\" Ann said, before noticing Leslie's expression. \"Or, you know, terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie struggled to her feet. \"Kathryn Pinewood may have beaten us today, but the final decision on the new location isn't until the end of the month. We're each going to go home, destroy these cards, and come back tomorrow with three fresh ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Ann said enthusiastically, while April rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making their way back home, each woman found she was exhausted, and just wanted to crawl straight into bed. As for the Paunch Burger Gold card, Ann decided to leave it until the morning, while April just forgot. Leslie got as far as taking the scissors out of the drawer, and was preparing to snip when the memory of those burgers stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she would use the card, just once. Then she would throw it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If  Paunch Burger had been the only issue that Leslie had to deal with, she might have hardened her resolve and destroyed the Gold card. But of course, she had a dozen other things on her mind. Chairing various committees, attending city council sessions, meeting with constituents, overseeing the river restoration project, finalizing the Parks department budget, there was always something that needed doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Making it worse was the fact that Ben had been called back to Washington for a few weeks to do some emergency intervention on an ailing Senate campaign. At the end of a stressful day, she felt herself craving Paunch Burger, and having the Gold card in her purse made resistance all but impossible. Despite her misgivings, and constant pledges to stop, she was soon eating there at every meal, and stopping in for snacks whenever her schedule allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie did her best to hide her new routine from Ann and April, unaware that they had also given in to the temptation of Paunch Burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril treated her new appetite for Paunch Burgers like she did most things: with almost total indifference. Rather than torture herself about it like Leslie, she simply gave in and ate whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted. If she tried to keep it a secret from Ann and Leslie, it was only because she didn't want to have to listen to a lecture about healthy eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was probably the most conflicted. She had read numerous health department reports, studied the correlation between restaurant locations and obesity rates, and had personally treated dozens of patients who had suffered Paunch Burger related heart attacks. And yet, all that only served to make them more irresistible to her. It was like she could taste every single calorie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they all secretly indulged themselves, unaware that the others were doing the same. But however hard they might have tried to hide their new eating habits, there was no hiding the effect it was having on their figures. Needless to say, Paunch Burger certainly lived up to its name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ann, any progress with the 'Don't eat food you found on the ground\" public health campaign?' Leslie asked, sucking in her stomach, afraid the buttons on her jacket might be unable to take the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, we finished the graphics for the posters, and I scheduled a press conference for next week.\" Ann told her, holding a bundle of folders in front of her rounded belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the conference room swung open, and April entered carrying a large paper bag. Her own prominent potbelly was peeking out from under her t-shirt, but she appeared unconcerned as she sat down and opened the bag, taking out a burger. She unwrapped it and was about to take a bite when she noticed them both staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, you've been eating Paunch Burgers?\" Leslie gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They're really good, and they're free.\" She said coolly. \"Plus, I saw you there yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie!\" Ann chided, squeezing the files a bit closer to her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you there this morning, Ann.\" April said, biting into the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn's face reddened slightly, and she let the folders drop to her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Leslie said, breathing out and letting her stomach surge forward. \"So we've all been eating at Paunch Burger. That's okay. We're all adults, we can still object to one being placed next to the high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unbuttoned her jacket, giving herself a little more room to breathe, before turning to the white board, to which she had tacked up pictures of the other members of the city council. \"Well, Councilman Jamm will definitely side with Paunch Burger, and Milton will do whatever Jamm does. I already convinced Councilman Hauser, so that leaves Dexhart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he'll go with whatever seems the most popular.\" Ann said distastefully, having had a few run-ins with the infamously lecherous Dexhart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Exactly.\" Leslie smiled. \"So, we need ideas as to how to convince people to oppose the new location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn nodded and tried to think, but she was soon distracted by the aroma emanating from the bag at the other end of the table. Leslie was also unable to concentrate, looking longingly at the burger April was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, could we have some of those?\" Ann asked, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril stuck out her bottom lip, pretending to think about it, but Leslie was impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on April, hand them over.\" She demanded, snatching the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" April said through a mouthful of burger, snatching it right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief struggle, before the bag spilt right down the middle, spilling burgers across the table. Suddenly the three women were scrambling to grab as many burgers as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the scuffle, they all ended up with three burgers each, and promptly set about stuffing their faces. Within minutes, they were all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie's pink blouse was now struggling to contain her bloated belly, triangles of creamy flesh visible where the buttons were straining. April's t-shirt had ridden up even further, exposing her belly button, and the button in her jeans had popped open. Ann's dress was bunched up around her middle, and she was fumbling to unbuckle her belt. She finally undid it with a gasp of relief, before letting out a cacophonous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Ann.\" April said, wrinkling her nose in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\" Leslie panted as she leaned back in her chair. \"I've eaten Paunch Burger before, but it was never this good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn grunted, picking a sesame seed out of her teeth. \"Maybe they changed the recipe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the secret ingredient is people.\" April suggested spookily, as she rubbed her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie gave her an exasperated look, but then thought differently. \"No, but they still might be doing something illegal. A new additive, something the FDA hasn't approved yet. If we could expose them, that might be all we need to sink the new location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn looked doubtful, but Leslie was on a roll. \"April, can you help me with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril groaned at the prospect of more work. \"I still need to find a sponsor for the new pet adoption center. You said you'd help.\" She added, with an air of accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, right after I deal with this. I need to make a phone call.\" Leslie rushed out of the conference room, slamming the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" Ann began, but April had already got up and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Cool. See you later.\" Ann sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They're using addictive new ingredients that haven't been approved for human consumption.\" Leslie insisted, exaggerating slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna was still skeptical. \"What's your source on this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Leslie, I can't just write a story based on wild accusations from an unnamed source. Now, if you wanted to make these accusations on the record...\" Shawna made to start writing, but Leslie actually slapped the pad out of the her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! No, I can't. But you really should look into it. Just think of the headline: 'Paunch Burger Exposed, Crusading Reporter Uncovers Scandal, Credits Heroic Whistleblower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna held up her hand, laughing.\"Fine Leslie, I'll do it. No promises as to an article, but I'll see if there's anything worth reporting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Shauna.\" Leslie sighed, catching her breath. \"Off the record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna leaned down to pick up her notebook, incidentally getting a good look at Leslie's belly. Judging by the size of it, she appeared to be about five months pregnant. Even if the Paunch Burger story was a dead end, this trip might not have been a complete waste of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she saw the Shauna out, Leslie's thoughts turned towards lunch. Maybe she would get a salad from the Executive Dining Hall... Although there was a Paunch Burger just down the street.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ann always looked forward to the days she got to work at the hospital. As much fun as it was working with Leslie and the others at City Hall, she sometimes felt a bit out of her depth. It was nice to get back into her element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently another advantage of going to work at the hospital had been getting to wear scrubs. The loose, elasticated clothing was much more forgiving of her expanding figure than her usual wardrobe. Unfortunately her weight gain was no longer confined to her midsection, with her lower half seeing its fair share of growth. Her thighs had thickened slightly, and her juicier ass now stuck out prominently behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Doctor Harris.\" Ann said cheerfully, handing him a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nurse Perkins.\" The physician nodded, looking her up and down. \"Have you put on weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn glared at him, but he didn't seem to take any notice. She knew she had gained a few pounds, more than a few, but she had hoped it wasn't that noticeable. As she began her morning rounds, she could feel her underwear riding up further and further with each step. She grimaced and tried to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of her morning was spent going from room to room, taking patient histories from new admissions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many times a week would you eat fast food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, fried chicken counts as fast food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am, you have to include weekends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a bit hypocritical lecturing her patients about their eating habits, but in another way it gave her a strange thrill. It was oddly exciting, hearing them list off the all the fast food they'd eaten that week, and realizing that it wasn't half as much as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her lunch break came around, Ann had built up a serious appetite. She grabbed her jacket and hurried to the nearest Paunch Burger. The lunch rush meant there was a twenty minute wait, leaving her only fifteen minutes to eat. She ended up eating some of it on the go, finishing off the last burger just as she reached the hospital. As she wiped her mouth with a napkin, she imagined all the damage her meal was doing to her body. Arteries clogging, blood pressure rising, insulin spiking... So bad, and yet, so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile,  April was sitting at her desk in the Parks department. Unusually, she was actually doing some work. She still needed to find a sponsor for the pet adoption center, and the deadline was looming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so as you can see, sponsoring this project would be the right decision for your business.\" She explained, in the strained manner she used when she was trying to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if... No... But please, think of the... Fine. I hope your store burns down and all your teeth fall out!\" She slammed the phone down in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had called almost every business or organization in town, and none of them showed any interest in sponsoring the shelter. With a sigh she reached into the paper bag sitting on her desk and pulled out a burger. After getting breakfast that morning  she had ordered another twenty burgers, and had gradually been working her way through them as the day progressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer potbelly had grown rapidly into a proper paunch, resting in her lap whenever she sat down. The only other area of significant growth had been her chest, her perky little 32 Bs swelling into substantial 36 Cs. Andy had been unable to keep his hands off them, especially since she had outgrown all of her bras. Right now she was making do with an old tank top underneath her striped blue sweater. She had attempted to stretch it down over her stomach, bit it kept riding back up to just above her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate the burger, she looked through the folder, searching for a number she had yet to call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, April, could you make some copies for me?\" Jerry asked, standing awkwardly in  front of her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I need you to make some copies for me.\" She picked up a random sheet of paper  from her desk and handed it to him. \"I need a hundred copies, alternating between blue and red ink, by three o'clock. It's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez.\" Jerry cringed, grabbing the sheet and hurrying out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril rolled her eyes and returned to the list, looking for a company she had yet to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Glitter Factory, no, JJ's Diner, no, the Quiet Corn, no...\" She mumbled, checking them off one by one.  There was only one business in town she hadn't called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, cramming the rest of the burger into her mouth and dialing the number. It rang half a dozen times before someone picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paunch Burger Corporate Headquarters, how may I direct your call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot!\" Leslie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Ben asked, his voice slightly tinny through the computer's speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I was just expecting a call from someone, they still haven't gotten back to me.\" Leslie explained, somewhat truthfully. While she was still waiting on a call from Shauna Malwae-Tweep, the real reason for her exclamation had been her pants button popping open for the hundredth time as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it the maintenance department?Your webcam has been broken for almost a week .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie felt a little guilty. The only problem with her webcam was the strip of duct tape she had placed over the lens. She still wanted to video chat with Ben, she just didn't want him seeing how chunky she had gotten. As well as her growing gut, supported by thick love handles, her hips had widened by a good few inches. Her face had grown rounder too, and a second chin was now visible whenever she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, they said they needed to fly in a specialist, then there was a problem with the union...\" She lied, standing up and attempting to do up her fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to fix a webcam?\" Ben might have been more suspicious, but he well aware of how inefficient the civic government could be. \"Never mind. I'll see you this weekend anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze, eyes widening. \"Um, actually, I can't come to Washington this weekend because... I have to help Ann... install her new... humidor.\" She grunted, finally refastening her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked surprised. \"Oh. I didn't even know Ann smoked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow, I guess you need to pay more attention. Okay, love you sweetie, bye bye bye!\" Leslie ended the call with a few taps of the keyboard, before slumping back down into her seat. This time the button actually broke, ricocheting off of her desk and landing neatly on top of her ample belly. She sighed and put it in the drawer with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then opened another drawer and took out a burger. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Leslie, are you sure this looks alright?\" Ann asked, turning around with a worried frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in Leslie's city council office, doing some last minute preparation  for Ann's press conference. They had finished going over her speech, but now she was back to raising concerns about her outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, you look... fine.\" Leslie said, leafing through her folder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn narrowed her eyes. \"See, it's that little pause before 'fine' that worries me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had called Leslie in a panic that morning, when she discovered that none of her clothes fit. Well, she could still squeeze into her old sweatpants, but nothing she could wear for a press conference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were no shortage of plus-size stores in Pawnee. Leslie had visited one a few days previously when she burst out of her last pantsuit. Ann was more reluctant to shop at a place that provided double-wide dressing rooms, but in the end she had no choice. They didn't have time to try anything on, so they had just picked out a variety of skirts and dresses, avoiding anything that would cling too tightly to Ann's expanded ass and thickened thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing a few blouses and some underwear, they just had time for a quick stop at Paunch Burger before heading to City Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafely ensconced in Leslie's office, Ann had gotten changed, swapping her sweat pants and t-shirt for a skirt and blouse. They were a little... snugger than they might have hoped, mainly due to Ann's insistence that she didn't need the extra extra large. With Leslie's help she had managed to get the skirt fastened, though it restricted her movement a little. The blouse wasn't much better, hugging the curve of her belly and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're sure I look okay?\" Ann asked one more time as they made their way to the press briefing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Ann, you'll do great.\" Leslie reassured her, before reaching into her pocket and pulling out a cigar. \"Also if Ben asks, you smoke these all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn pocketed the cigar without comment and, taking a deep breath, tottered up to the podium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her  misgivings, it went pretty smoothly. She simply gave a brief speech on the new initiative and unveiled the new public awareness posters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ann talked, Leslie stood at the back of the room, fruitlessly scanning the assembled journalists and photographers for Shauna Malwae-Tweep. She had called the Pawnee Journal multiple times, but apparently Shauna hadn't been into work in almost a week. Leslie couldn't help but remember April's suggestion that Paunch Burger was making their burgers out of people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so the Department of Public Health urges all Pawneeans, that 'no matter what you found, leave it on the ground.'\" Ann smiled, having come up with the slogan herself. \"Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a woman sitting in the front row stood up, and Leslie got an eerie sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim Terlando, Pawnee Sun.\" She announced, holding up a digital recorder. \"To clarify, Ms. Perkins, you are the person in charge of this new 'health initiative'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes.\" Ann replied warily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are saying that Pawneeans shouldn't eat food that has been on the ground?\" Kim continued, as though this was a strange opinion for someone to hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn glanced at Leslie, who shrugged.\"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Our studies have shown that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kim apparently wasn't interested in what the studies had to show. \"Ms. Perkins, would you care to make a comment on this set of photographs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she strode forward and handed Ann a brown envelope. \"There are copies under each of your chairs.\" She told the other members of the press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a general rustling as the envelopes were retrieved, followed by murmurs of surprise. Leslie hurried forward and grabbed one for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first photo showed Ann in her nurse's scrubs, emerging from a Paunch Burger carrying a bag of food. It was obviously a recent photo, judging by the size of her belly and thighs. The next few photos showed her reaching into to bag and pulling out a half-eaten burger as she walked, licking her lips. In the next photo Ann looked distraught, and the burger was clearly visible on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Leslie moaned quietly, flipping rapidly through the photos now. Ann looking from left to right, apparently failing to spot the photographer. Ann bending down, awkward with her bloated belly. Ann standing back up, triumphantly holding the burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the final, damning photo which showed Ann, blissfully taking a huge bite of her slightly disheveled burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked back up at Ann, who looked like she was about to throw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any comment Ms. Perkins?\" Kim asked with a superior smirk, as cameras began to flash and the other reporters got to their feet, crowding forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I...\" Ann stammered, but Leslie came to her rescue. She bustled her way in front of the podium, making good use of her added bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This press conference is over!\" She yelled, pushing a camera away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn tried to make a break for it, but she must have moved a bit too fast. She let out a shriek as her skirt split right up the side. The cameras continued to flash as she waddled out, clutching her skirt with both hands to protect her modesty. Leslie tried to break through the mob, but an accidental elbow to the gut sent her reeling backwards. By the time she caught her breath Ann had disappeared, bringing the press with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't alone however, as a familiar face was standing at the back of the hall. Kathryn Pinewood waved cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie frowned. So Paunch Burger had something to do with this...</span></div></div>",

Once upon a time she would have been drowning in excess fabric, but now it was actually a little tight. Her bare legs had thickened as well, luscious thighs running down into chubby little cankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChampion, the three legged dog she and Andy had adopted, hobbled over and began licking the sole of her foot. She squirmed, but was too comfortable to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud, insistent knocking at the door was more difficult to ignore, though April gave it her best shot. Finally, with a groan of frustration, she rolled off the couch and wobbled to her feet. Her sizeable paunch sagged down in front of her, and as she stretched her unrestrained breasts bounced up and down. She slouched her way to the door and pulled it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away.\" She scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie ignored April's customary rudeness and pressed a newspaper into her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril unfolded the paper, which turned out to be the Pawnee Sun.<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as she examined the front page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that caught her attention was the lurid photo of Ann, grease dripping down her chin as she bit into a burger. Her eyes flicked to the headline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do as I say, not as I chew?\" She read with a smirk, looking up at Leslie, who seemed less amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's terrible. There's more on pages two, three and five.\" She said, pushing past April and going inside. \"Whoa.\" She gasped, as she saw the state of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Ben had left for Washington, April and Andy had reverted to their less-than-sanitary living habits. Trash, at least half of which was made up of Paunch Burger wrappers, bags and cups, littered the floor. Leslie picked her way through the debris, almost slipping on a pile of baseball cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril didn't notice, still fully absorbed in the newspaper. There were more photos inside, including the ones Kim Terlando had revealed at the press conference, and the ones from the press conference itself. She grinned at the sight of Ann desperately trying to hold her skirt together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie perched herself on the arm of the couch, difficult with her ample backside. \"Paunch Burger is behind this.\" She explained, \"Kathryn Pinewood was at the press conference.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril looked unimpressed. \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So go put on some pants.\" Leslie said, standing back up. \"We need to go find Ann, and figure out exactly what Paunch Burger is up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once April had gotten dressed, pulling on a pair of black leggings and  slipping on her sneakers, they got in Leslie's car and drove in the direction of Ann's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay April,\" Leslie began after buckling her seatbelt around her belly. \"I've come up with a six-point plan for making Ann feel better. Step one...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril responded by turning up the radio until Leslie was completely drowned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Pawnee, you're listening to Crazy Ira...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the Douche!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual barrage of sound effects that always accompanied Pawnee's own morning zoo radio show filled the car. When they finally died away, it was Crazy Ira who spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And our most requested clip this morning continues to be  Nurse Ann 'Porkins'-\" Here he was interrupted by a brief burst of oinking and squealing, \"-taking her 'Hypocritic' Oath. Here it is, one more time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Leslie's horror they then played the audio from yesterday's press conference, starting with Kim Terlando's invitation for comment, followed by Ann's stuttered response, her own voice calling an end to the the event, and finally the sound of tearing fabric and Ann shrieking as her skirt split open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the recording, Crazy Ira and the Douche could be heard laughing uproariously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Douche, didn't you used to date this woman?\" Crazy Ira asked once they finally calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure did Ira, and let me tell you, I'm not surprised she got so fat.\" The Douche admitted.\"She always did have a weakness for sausage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed again, as a woman's voice saying 'Me so horny!' was played on repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ann, if you're listening, come on down to the studio, we've got plenty of food lying around.\" The Douche joked. \" In fact, for every burger you eat off the floor, we'll give you ten bucks towards some much needed liposuction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound effect of a cash register opening was followed by a salacious sucking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they burst into laughter again, Leslie reached over and turned off the radio in disgust. April made a noise of protest but Leslie ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rode in silence for a few minutes, before April spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we have to do this, can we get something to eat first? We just passed a Paunch Burger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie should have said no, but she was actually feeling pretty hungry. She had gone to JJ's diner for breakfast, and had ordered her favourite, a stack of waffles with extra whipped cream, but somehow it just hadn't hit the spot. The bacon and eggs hadn't done the job either, or the pancakes. By the time she left she had eaten her way through half the menu, but she still hadn't been satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a u-turn and soon they were entering the extra-wide double doors that marked every Paunch Burger location. Despite her big breakfast Leslie's mouth started watering as soon as she heard the bubble of the deep-fat fryers. She was already mentally preparing her order, but stopped when April grabbed her by the arm and pointed over to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked and gasped as she realised what April was pointing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ann, sitting alone in a booth, wearing a light grey sweatsuit with her hair pulled back into a ponytail. She had been there for some time judging by the large pile of burger wrappers and other debris on the table, not to mention the size of her stomach. Her top had been zipped up originally, but it appeared to have been forced open from the bottom upwards, exposing the lower half of her incredibly bloated belly. As Leslie and April watched, she unwrapped another burger and took an enormous bite, her cheeks bulging as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie hurried over, with April trailing behind, and sat down opposite her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann! What are you doing?\" She asked in a hushed tone, glancing around the restaurant to see if they were being observed, but the other patrons seemed to be fully absorbed in their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter? I've already been completely humiliated.\" Ann told her, suppressing a belch before taking another bite of her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it helps, I never had any respect for you.\"  April told her, forcing Leslie to scoot over as she squeezed in beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn didn't even bother to glare at the younger woman, which worried Leslie even more. She had never seen her friend looking this dejected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now, it wasn't that bad. I'm sure most people didn't even hear about it.\" She assured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn responded by taking out her phone and holding it up for Leslie to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's a lot of missed calls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also trending on Twitter.\"Ann told her bitterly.\"Hashtag 'Porkins'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this,  April took out her own phone and investigated, snickering as she did so, while Ann resumed stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie could see she was losing them, and slapped her hand on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, both of you, there's something happening here, something bigger than all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't possibly be bigger than Ann.\" April said without looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie shushed her and continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paunch Burger is trying to undermine us. They're  planning something, not just the location near the school, something that could affect all of Pawnee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn wiped her mouth and took a sip from her soda. \"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, right now it's just a hunch.\" Leslie admitted. \"But I'm sure that they're up to something, and we need to find out what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn and April looked less than enthused, but Leslie pressed on regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann, you need to see what's really going into these Paunch Burgers. Get some samples and being them down to the lab, see what they can find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie, I'm a nurse, I don't have a 'lab', and even if I did...\" Ann tried to explain, but Leslie wouldn't hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, you need to find out everything you can about Paunch Burger, go to City Hall and check the records, planning permission, anything that might tell us what they're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll get right on that.\" April said, unwrapping a burger for herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do Leslie?\" Ann asked, adjusting the waistband of her sweatpants and rubbing her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I'm going to have something to eat.\" Leslie said, unable to ignore the rumbling in her stomach any longer,  \"And then, I'm going to find out exactly what happened to Shauna Malwae-Tweep.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oof...\" Leslie groaned, reaching down to undo her pants button. She had definitely overdone it, eating until her belly was once again straining the buttons on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril had eaten her fill and disappeared without another word, but Ann was waiting for Leslie to finish her meal, partly out of politeness, partly due to the fact she was stuck, her incredibly swollen belly wedged against the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie slurped down the last of her milkshake and  wiped her mouth delicately with a napkin before recommencing her strategy session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we need to find Shauna Malwae-Tweep. This could take a while, as she isn't answering her phone, and she hasn't been to work in days. We need to get her home address, and start compiling a list of possible locations that she might have... Yes Ann?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that her over there?\" Ann said, pointing across the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe craned her head around and saw that Ann was right. Shauna Malwae-Tweep was standing in line just opposite them, though she hadn't noticed them yet. Leslie was immediately relieved to see that she was okay, but her relief turned to shock when she noticed the journalist's midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usually skinny Shauna was now sporting a sizeable gut, which bulged out over the waistband of her skirt. As Leslie and Ann watched, she untucked her blouse and re-adjusted it, giving them a brief glimpse of her rounded belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's one mystery solved.\" Ann remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Leslie managed to extricate herself from the booth, Shauna had already reached the counter, and was fumbling through her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for your Gold card?\" Leslie asked, causing the other woman to look up in alarm. <br>\r\nWhen she saw who it was, she seemed to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Leslie.\" She said, without pausing her search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was astonished by her lack of reaction.  \"What are you... When did you... How could you sell out to Paunch Burger like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna, to her credit, looked a little remorseful, but refused to let herself be bullied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Leslie, but this story you put me on to is way above my pay-grade. If you knew what I know now, you would do the same thing.\" She looked Leslie up and down, taking in her expanded figure. \"Though some people might think you already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie's outrage returned. \"Well, you just tell your new friends at Paunch Burger that Councilwoman Leslie Knope is not for sale. I will find out what they're up to, and I will put a stop to it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struck a defiant pose, which was slightly undermined by the fact that her fly was down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By, the way, this entire conversation has been off the record.\" She added, folding her arms across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna nodded disinterestedly, having finally retrieved her Gold card. As she began to order, Leslie returned to the booth where Ann was still sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you give me a hand here Leslie?\" Ann asked, attempting to suck in her stomach enough to free herself. But her friend wasn't listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This proves that Paunch Burger are up to something.\" She said, grabbing her own purse from the table. \"We need to find out more, and fast. See you later Ann.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she walked quickly out of the restaurant, leaving the double doors swinging in her wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn sighed and slumped back down against the plastic seat. This was definitely a low-point, and from now on she would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" She said, spotting an unrated burger partially hidden under a pile of napkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe just this last one...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would need all the help she could get if she was going to defeat Paunch Burger. Unfortunately, turn out was less than spectacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everybody?\" She asked in exasperation, looking around the near-empty conference room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's Justin Timberlake's birthday, so Rent-A-Swag is having a special 'sales event' in his honour.\"<br>\r\nAnn said, explaining why Tom wasn't there. She was dressed in her nurse's scrubs, testing the roomy pants to their limit, perching rather awkwardly on the edge of her seat. She was concerned that if she sat too far back she would get her ass wedged between the arms of the chair. It had taken the intervention of a manger and an application of lard to free her from the booth on Saturday, and she was not eager to repeat the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Donna is still on vacation.\" She continued, shifting her balance once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about Ron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he couldn't make it.\" April yawned, scratching her belly. The top she was wearing barely reached halfway to her belly button, providing similarly scanty coverage up top as well. \"He's super busy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie rolled her eyes, as from  where she was standing she could actually see Ron, sitting at his desk with his arms folded, staring straight ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no one is turning up for this meeting?\" Leslie asked in exasperation. \"We can't do this all by ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Leslie!\" Jerry smiled as he bustled into the conference room. \"I heard this meeting was top priority, so I cleared my schedule, I am free all day. Plus, I brought donuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Jerry, I don't think we'll be needing you today, you can go back to your desk.\" Leslie told him, taking the box of pastries off his hands and shepherding him towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed it closed behind him and immediately opened the box, grabbing a chocolate covered donut and cramming it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her encounter with Shauna, Leslie knew that she had to stop eating Paunch Burgers. While she had been successful so far, doing so required her to eat almost constantly. It wasn't ideal, but it was definitely an improvement, even if she hadn't gotten rid of her Paunch Burger Gold card just yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate another three donuts before she felt ready to commence the meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what have we found out so far?\" She asked, licking some raspberry jelly off of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it will be a few days before we get the results back from the lab.\" Ann said, grabbing a donut before Leslie ate them all. \"They should tell us what exactly these new and improved Paunch Burger's are made of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her previous protestations, Ann did have a connection with a technician at the hospital who had been willing to run a few tests, in exchange for a date. She had been pretty surprised when he asked her out. They had flirted a little before, but he didn't seem to be put off by the fact she had put on weight. If anything he seemed more interested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most difficult thing had actually been getting a Paunch Burger for him to test, as the first two times she tried she ended up eating the burgers before she got them back to the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Ann. Let me know as soon as you hear anything.\" Leslie said, while subtly moving the rest of donuts out of her reach. \"April, what have you got for me? April?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply, unless a rasping snore could be considered a reply. April was asleep where she sat, her head tilted forward until her face was almost resting in her vast cleavage, cushioned by her double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie sighed and clapped her hands together, startling April out of her slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked sullenly, wiping a string of drool from her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find anything that might tell us what Paunch Burger are up to? Any permissions requested, any plans filed?\" Leslie asked exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril picked up a folder and looked through it, flipping through the pages and perusing them carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She concluded, dropping the documents back on to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You couldn't find anything?\" Ann asked, narrowing her eyes. April  had never exactly been a dynamic worker, and her new diet had propelled her to new levels of lethargy. It seemed she grew lazier with every pound she gained. She had even stopped working on the pet adoption centre, the one project that she had ever seemed to care about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't blame me, Ann.\" April replied tartly. \"Paunch Burger isn't even incorporated here, it's based in Eagleton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eagleton?!\" Leslie gasped, almost choking on a mouthful of half-chewed donut. She coughed, thumping her chest before she managed to swallow.  \"I should have known those snooty Eagletonians would have something to do with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was sceptical, and was about to interject when April spoke up \"I tried to access the records over the phone, but they said there was a six-week waiting period for non-Eagletonians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie scowled. \"Those snobs. Well we'll just have to go over there right now and get those records in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril nodded and got to her feet, while Leslie grabbed the remaining donuts and stuffed them into her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Leslie, don't you have a city council meeting this afternoon?\" Ann said, trying to get her friend to stop and think for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Leslie refused to be reasoned with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ann, this is more important. Sometimes being a politician means breaking the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she was gone, April practically pushing her out the door. They crashed straight into Jerry, sending the stack of documents he was carrying flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had vanished before the papers even hit the ground, leaving Ann to hurry out and help gather them up. She bent down without thinking, and winced as she heard the now all-too-familiar sound of fabric ripping.

I need to see any and all records... relating to the Paunch Burger corporation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry,\" the man replied, in a tone suggesting he was anything but, \"but the head of our records department is out of office at the moment, and she would need to authorise the release of any documents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie wasn't going to be beaten so easily. \"Well, when will she be back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"Oh, she won't be back today, she's a judge at the Eagleton Food Festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food festival?\" April asked, having arrived just in time to hear the last two words. \"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked down his nose at April's exposed midsection, but answered her question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Pennington Square Park, just across the street.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hurrying over to the park and paying the exorbitant thirty dollar entry fee for non-Eagleton residents, Leslie and April began to search for the judges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, everywhere they went they found that they had just missed the judges, the food stuffs already bristling with ribbons of various colours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also hindered by the fact that everyone was extremely generous handing out samples, offers that Leslie and April were unable to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they exited the cake pavilion, almost an hour after they began their search, they were both being slowed down by their increasingly full stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll never find them at this rate.\" Leslie said anxiously. \"We should split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" April said, brushing some crumbs out of her cleavage. \"You go that way, I'll check this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie nodded and followed the signs for the 'cookie marquee', waddling slightly due to her swollen stomach. She entered the tent, which smelled delightfully of vanilla and cinnamon, and scanned the crowd. The place was packed, which gave her hope that the judging was still going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to force her way through the crowd, her added bulk useful for once. There were scattered yelps as she accidentally trod on people's toes, but eventually she made her way close to the front. The last two rows were more stubborn than the others however, and refused to let her through. She could hear that an announcement was being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winner in the shortbread category is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie glanced around for something she could use to see over the crowd, and spied a folding chair leaning against the edge of a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Leslie hoped that maybe the chair had already been faulty, and that's why no one had been using it. She didn't want to believe she was heavy enough to cause the entire thing to collapse underneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, that was what happened, sending her flying forwards and crashing into a display table stacked high with elaborately frosted cookies, which also collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, she was pulled from the wreckage by two men, as the contestant whose entries had been crushed complained bitterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked up to see her ex-best friend and opposite number at the Eagleton Parks department, Lindsay Carlyle Shay, wearing a sash emblazoned with the word 'JUDGE'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leslie was helped to a different,  sturdier chair, Lindsay followed behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie, what are you doing here?\" She asked once they were alone. \"And what happened to you?\" She added, taking in her rival's expanded figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie gave her the abridged version of events, mainly focusing on the sinister angle of Paunch Burger's agenda, glossing over her addiction to their mysteriously delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We need to know what Paunch Burger is planning.\" Leslie concluded.  \"And that's why I need to find the head of your records department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're looking at her.\" Lindsay said, picking a mostly intact cookie from Leslie's hair. \"And if they're as 'evil' as you say they are, I guess we should check them out.\"</span></div></div>",

After dragging April away from the pie-eating contest, they had gone straight there. April was lying on the couch, her mouth still stained with blueberry filling, while Leslie and Lindsey huddled around the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, they would never have met Eagleton's restrictions on saturated fats in food products.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie furrowed her brow. \"But that's impossible. April said that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by a knock on the door. It swung open to reveal the man from the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Shay, there's a call for Ms Knope on line two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Brandon.\" Lindsay said, waving him away. She picked up the phone and handed it to Leslie, before pressing the flashing button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie? Thank god! I've been trying to reach you for an hour.\" It was Ann, and she sounded stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie pressed the phone to her ear. \"Ann, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to get back here, now!\" Ann told her. \"They called a special session of the city council, and they're going to vote on the new Paunch Burger location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie gasped, but her mind worked quickly. \"Okay, Ann, you need to stall for time. Citizen filibuster, phoney bomb threat, whatever it takes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do what I can, just hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie dropped the phone and ran out of the door, yelling a garbled thank you to Lindsay and promising that they would do lunch some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay bent down and picked the phone up off the floor. As she stood back up, she noticed that Leslie had left her jacket behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rasping snore drew her attention to the couch, where April had apparently fallen asleep. A string of blueberry drool dripped from her open mouth on to the expensive white couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it Leslie.\" Lindsay sighed. \"Any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite momentarily getting wedged in Eagleton's City Hall revolving door, Leslie made the journey back to Pawnee in close to record time. Her car screeched to a halt outside City Hall, and cursing Pawnee's lack of valet parking, she hurried inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran through the building and burst through the double doors of the city council chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here! I'm here, stop!\" She panted, bending double as she attempted to catch her breath. Clutching at the pain in her side, she looked up at the other members of the city council, who were watching her with a mixture of bewilderment and contempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too late Knope.\" Councilman Jamm said with a sneer. \"We already voted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Leslie wheezed, as Ann helped her into a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid he's right Leslie.\" Councilman Hauser said. \"The new Paunch Burger location was approved three to one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, despite the best efforts of this hefty mulatto gal.\" Councilman Milton added, drawing an indignant glare from Ann. \"We had to threaten to eject her from the chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie squeezed her friend's hand in silent gratitude, then took a deep breath and stood back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen, you can't possibly call this a legitimate vote. I was given no warning about this special session, and therefore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try Knope.\" Jamm interjected. \"But we called your office yesterday and left a message with your staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true Leslie.\" Hauser confirmed. \"I double-checked with one of your people this morning and they said you knew about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked confused, but Ann was already piecing it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did you talk to?\" she asked, sounding like she already knew the answer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHauser paused as he tried to remember. \"I think it was that young woman who's always scowling and muttering under her breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie gasped. \"April?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn snapped her fingers. \"I knew she was up to something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would she do this?\" Leslie asked, biting her lip. \"There must be some explanation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamm cleared his throat. \"I'm sure this is very interesting to you ladies, but some of us have custom ski boot fittings to get to. Let's put a bow on this sucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouncilman Dexhart seconded the motion, and Hauser adjourned the session with a bang of his gavel. As the other council members filed out, Leslie was still reeling. They had lost, and it seemed that April was the one who had betrayed them. </span></div></div>",

The vote was official and Leslie had no grounds to challenge that. Leslie and Ann now had their larger asses parked on the steps to Pawnee City Hall trying to piece together what options they had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Leslie, you\u2019re not beat yet\u201d Ann tried to console Leslie with a gentle rub on Leslie\u2019s upper back. Ann couldn\u2019t help but notice the developing rise and fall of back fat creasing into a roll along the once smooth posterior.  \u201cCouldn\u2019t we still Rally Public support against it? They may have permission to build there but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to let them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie pulled her face from its pocket between her folded arms and cleavage and let out a mopey sigh. \u201cAnn you brilliant beautiful delicious dollop of cream cheese\u2026\u201d  Ann stopped her consonant massage and gave Leslie a worried look \u201cSorry, I\u2019m starting to get pretty hungry\u201d Leslie put a hand to the butterball gut she had developed. \u201cAnn you\u2019re right, I can\u2019t let them win like this!\u201d Leslie\u2019s passion for public service beginning to build once more \u201cPaunch Burger cannot be allowed to bully its way through the flawed but wonderful world of government procedure! I\u2019ll find enough loop holes and ancient clauses to keep them from breaking ground as long as it takes to put a stop to this for good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar BMW pulled up to the front of city hall and a thick pair of legs swung out trying to find support on the sidewalk. Leslie and Ann pulled themselves up from their stoop and began to advance towards the car. With a little help from inside April managed to rolled herself out and get herself standing as several empty burger wrappers tumbled out with her. She turned back to Lindsay huffing \u201cJust call that number and ask to speak to Emily West, she\u2019s the PR director for Paunch Burger and she\u2019s a wiz at getting things like those restrictions cleared out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApril!\u201d Leslie squawked as soon as they reached the bottom of the steps \u201cYou betrayed me! You betrayed Pawnee!\u201d April retrieved several Paunch Burger bags from the car before shutting the door and shifting her weight to turn and face Leslie who wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cI cannot believe you lied to me and helped those\u2026 those, evil, manipulative thugs to pass this vote!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry alright?\u201d April sighed in her own way that showed no real remorse but still showed she meant it. \u201cThey said if I didn\u2019t help them with this they were going to revoke our gold cards!\u201d April\u2019s voice took on a low whine \u201cLeslie, I can\u2019t lose this card. It\u2019s too amazing; I get so much free food with it!\u201d As if to emphasize her point April held up the three brown bags that bore the Paunch Burger logo and sizeable grease spots climbing the sides of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you and your stupid Gold card! Leslie sneered with a cross tone \u201cI\u2019m so mad that I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m taking one of those!\u201d Leslie reached out and snatched on of the stuffed bags of fast food and tore it open. She had done so well to resist the temptation until now but Leslie was stressed and angry, not to mention hungry. She just needed something to eat to calm herself down a little. She tried to look disappointed at April while fumbling to open the bag and grab a burger as fast as her fingers would allow. She passed the bag off to Ann who also couldn\u2019t resist the temptation. Leslie tore open the wrapped and too a big needy bite. Her Scowl instantly melted away, the flavor making her knees weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god was it always so good?!\u201d Leslie moaned practically in ecstasy with her mouth still full. Ann not in a rush to indulge this habit but unable to resist now that Leslie had made such an outburst was quickly unwrapping one for herself too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d Ann exclaimed in a similar state \u201cNo, there is something different about these!\u201d She cried and greedily took several more bites filling her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril\u2019s expression was one of guilty remorse \u201cThey\u2019re the new Paunch Burger Deluxe Junior Triple\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie wanted to scold April some more but she was too busy relapsing her burger addiction into a second one. Ann was furiously licking her fingers trying not to do the same. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen those before, I haven\u2019t even seen them advertised\u201d Ann said sucking the last bit of grease from her thumb<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the other thing I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you\u2026\u201d April looked down and away from Ann and Leslie \u201cPaunch Burger also threatened to take away my other perk if I didn\u2019t help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaff othr purk?\u201d Leslie chomped with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting advance access to their new stuff they are planning to unveil\u2026 Things they will unveil as a part of new sponsorship deals.\u201d April felt like she needed a burger now to ease her mind and moved to pluck one from the bag in Leslie\u2019s hands \u201cThe Deluxe Junior Triple is going to be announced when they hold the press conference for the pet adoption center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sold out the pet adoption center to Paunch Burger?!\u201d Ann was shocked.  \u201cThat\u2019s the one job I\u2019ve ever seen you show the slightest pride in and you let it get taken away-no you <b>gave</b> it away to some large corporation that\u2019s just going to use it to market to kids already in need of companionship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you\u201d Leslie said unconvincingly as she was going for burger number three. Ann had also lost her defiant posture and was getting her second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I Don\u2019t know... Leslie they\u2019re so good!\u201d April tried to rationalize \u201cI\u2019m not strong enough for this, they showed me the new burger and they said I could order them any time I wanted with my card if I just gave them the contract\u2026\u201d April ran her hand through her hair trying not to get emotional \u201cI mean your friend seems to think I did the right thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Leslie slurped some sauce into her mouth as it tried to run down her lip \u201cLindsay? You told Lindsay about this and she wasn\u2019t as outraged as I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril pouted and fussed about for a moment \u201cOn the way here I asked her to stop at Paunch Burger, I needed a snack and I knew this was coming when I got back. I actually\u2026 shared my feelings with her I was so stressed out. She did say the same things as you at first so I made her try the burger herself, she didn\u2019t want to but I was stronger than her, after she finished her third she said she could see how I let myself get taken in by them. She didn\u2019t exactly sound like she was upset about it though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t excuse betraying your friends and selling out your pride!\u201d  Leslie was mad again but digging into the bag for more. \u201c\u2026What\u2019s this?\u201d She asked pulling out a larger carton with the paunch burger logo. Opening she found it was full of small fried balls of some sort. Not even waiting for the explanation she plucked one out and popped it in her mouth. \u201cWow!\u201d Leslie\u2019s eyes lit up and she grabbed several more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn also had to try one but after she overcame the look of bliss she cocked her head to the side and examined a second fried ball \u201cWait, you said you got advance access to new items for new sponsorships\u2026\u201d Ann said piecing the situation together. \u201cThat\u2019s plural\u2026 What other sponserships are there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril didn\u2019t answer and looked away again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApril\u2026\u201d Ann called her name in demand of an explanation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re the new Butter Bites\u2026\u201d April mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis fried butter?!\u201d Ann reeled in horror and put the ball back. She had to slap Leslie\u2019s hand away from grabbing more. \u201cWhat other sponsorships have you given them?\u201d Ann interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI let them see some of the proposed projects the parks department didn\u2019t give funding to\u2026\u201d April snatched the butter bites from Leslie and scooped a large handful up with the plump fingers to stress eat. \u201cI let them put in funding for a few projects without telling you\u2026 These are what they gave me for the campaign to place a bench every twenty feet on Pawnee sidewalks\u2026 The one you both said was a bad idea and didn\u2019t approve\u2026 I kinda let them slip the paper work past you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou went under my nose and gave Paunch Burger fast track approval to projects you knew I was against!? That does it little missy!\u201d Leslie said getting genuinely upset now \u201cAs of right now you are on suspension! Without pay!\u201d Leslie boiled with civic rage \u201cI can\u2019t even look at you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie grabbed a second bag from April\u2019s hands and stormed back into the government building. Ann turned and gave April a disappointed shake of her head and followed Leslie. April was left on the sidewalk with only one bag of fast food left to console her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she started college, she was slim, skinny, downright scrawny. But away from the supervision of her parents, introduced to the wonders of beer, late night pizza and a generous dining hall plan, her weight ballooned. She gained the freshman fifty rather than the traditional fifteen, with most of it settling in her hips and ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA summer spent under her parents watchful eyes carved a few pounds off of her widening rear, but by the time she returned home for Thanksgiving they were back, and had brought reinforcements. Her weight increased slowly but steadily over the next three years thanks to instant noodles, beer bongs and ice cream binges, and by the time she was accepted into Columbia Medical School, Mindy weighed just over two hundred and fifty pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it wasn't health concerns that convinced her that she needed to lose weight, but rather the photos from her senior year spring break trip. She looked like a beached whale in her red two piece swimsuit, especially next to her best friend Gwen's svelte physique. A summer of rigorous diet and exercise dropped her down to two hundred, and throughout med school her weight continued to fluctuate, gradually trending downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally graduated, she was hovering right around one hundred and fifty pounds, and had been, more or less, ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning however, she stepped on to the scales and watched them tick up to one hundred and sixty two pounds. She placed her hands on her spreading pot belly and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end, Mindy decided not to worry about her few extra pounds. It was just a little winter weight, nothing more. She got dressed for work, trying to ignore the little extra effort it took to fasten her skirt, the little bulge of flesh that muffin topped out over her waistband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resolved to have a light breakfast, a resolve which broke down when she reached the bagel shop. She ordered a double bacon and cream cheese bagel, though as a compromise she decided to get a skim milk latte, with only a single shot of caramel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Dr. L.\" Morgan said cheerfully as she walked out of the elevator, wiping her mouth with a napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Morgan.\" Mindy replied. \"Any mail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only this.\" He reached behind the counter and pulled out a large, expensive looking box of chocolates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy looked surprised. \"Who sent them?\" She asked, taking the hefty box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shrugged. \"The note just said 'For Dr. Lahiri, thanks for everything'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be from a patient.\" Mindy said, examining the box as Morgan walked away. 200 luxurious milk chocolate over rich caramel centers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to her office, and even opened one or two emails, before giving in a opening the box. The chocolates, laid out in rows on a paper lined tray, were delicious, and she ate a dozen without really thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the morning, Mindy continued to graze on the tasty treats, grabbing a few every time she had a spare moment. Her concerns about her weight were forgotten, as she focused on the demanding daily routine of an OBGYN. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen lunch rolled around, she had emptied the first two trays, exactly one hundred of the chocolates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for lunch Dr. Lahiri?\" Betsy asked, pen and paper in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy looked guiltily at the half empty box. \"Just a smoothie, I think. Bananatastic. With energy boost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy smiled and wrote down the order. She was still smiling when she stopped out of the office door, but once it clicked closed behind her, it changed instantly to a worried frown. Morgan hurried up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" He asked expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bananatastic smoothie.\" Betsy told him in a hushed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, quietly. \"Perfect. Make sure to get an extra large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy looked conflicted. \"Morgan, I don't know if we should be doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Morgan frowned. \"C'mon Bets, we agreed that we'd do whatever it takes to get Dr. L and Dr. C together, and this is how we do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy nodded. \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took her by the arm and lead her to the elevator bank. \"Now bring that smoothie to me when you get back, and I'll mix in a few scoops of the weight gain powder. We'll have Dr. L porked up in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy's smoothie was delicious, if a little thicker than usual. She slurped down the whole thing in a manner of minutes, her stomach bloating out slightly further, bulging visibly under her sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon, she had some appointments with patients, all in various stages of pregnancy, from baby bump to ready to drop. She put the chocolates away in a desk drawer, and told herself it was to look professional, not to avoid sharing them with her patients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just finishing up for the day when Morgan came in with a thick slice of cake on a paper plate. A birthday party in another office was the vague explanation, but Mindy didn't even listen, setting about the red velvet with a plastic fork. She never questioned free cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked on, grinning evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course the 'low fat' statement had been a complete lie on Morgans behalf, as the cake could scarcely have contained more calories than it did (Morgan had added a generous amount of weight gain powder to the thick icing). He smiled as he saw Mindy slaver, her eyes wide in greedy anticipation of the gorging to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Morgan\" She said, trying to compose herself in front of her colleague \"Now I would be alone...  Um paperwork and doctor stuff to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" He said \"See you later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Morgan had closed the door Mindy launched her attack on the large cake left before her. With her bare hands Mindy tore the cake into bite size pieces which find their way quickly into her mouth. Mindy shovelled the cake into her mouth at an ever accelerating speed, ignoring the feeling of fullness she felt in favour of gorging on the delicious fattening confectionary. Mindy was completely lost in her own gluttony, her surroundings fading as her only focus was on eating as much cake as possible. Suddenly the was a knock at the door which brought Mindy back to earth with a bump. The plate before her was bare, meaning that she had consumed the entire cake in about five minutes. Mindy quickly composed herself, removing the plate from the table and brushing the crumbs from its surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in -hicc!-\" She said, rearranging her top which clung tightly over her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Danny entered, which made Mindy sit a little more stiffly and feel self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dr. Lahiri\" He said \"Do you have that... Um... I think you've got some chocolate on your face or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Damn\" Said Mindy, clearly embarrassed \"Urrrrrp!! Oops, excuse me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny raised an eyebrow as Mindy hurriedly wiped the chocolate frosting from the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could come back later\" Said Danny awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no\" Said Mindy, regaining her composure and trying to exude professionalism rather than gluttony \"I am listening Dr. Castellano, how can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny smirked, not wanting to admit to himself how cute Mindy was when she tried to look professional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every day when she tied her apron down at the coffeehouse she felt it cutting a little more into her midsection. Her flat stomach had been replaced by a little potbelly that hung over her waistband, and a matching set of love handles. She ignored it at first, but even when she decided to do something about it she found she couldn't stop herself from overindulging. Even at work she started snacking of muffins and croissants whenever she figured Gunther wasn't looking.

Well if you're going... could you pick me up a dozen donuts from that place on third?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure.\" Monica replied, as Rachel ordered a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. This wasn't going to be as easy as she had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!\" Rachel let out a burp, having drained the last of her soda. She still had two slices of pizza left, but she was already pretty full. Her stomach was hard and round, but the pizza was just too good, the perfect balance of grease and cheese. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and picked up another slice. She folded it in half and crammed it in her mouth, letting out a little satisfied moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Monica opened the apartment  door, awkwardly balancing the large pink box of donuts. She had considering not getting them, but on the way back she was kind of in the mood for then herself. As she walked into the kitchen, she saw Rachel on the couch, shoving the last slice of pizza down while rubbing her distended stomach with the other, before laying back and letting out a long satisfied belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw Monica, she still had the decency to look faintly embarrassed. \"Oh, hi.\" She said, sitting up and pulling her shirt down over her stomach. \"Did you get the donuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica nodded and brought over the box, which Rachel took eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched her friend happily grab a donut and start eating, Monica made a decision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If Rachel wanted to indulge a little, who was she to judge? She had been there, she has been the fat one to Rachel's skinny friend. Would it really be that bad if she had her turn as the skinny one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" She said, handing Rachel the ice-cold glass as she sat down beside her. As she chugged it down, Monica took a quick glance at her belly, which was bulging out like she'd swallowed a basketball.

Maybe even as big as she had been...<br>\r\nWell if she was hungry, Monica would be a good friend, and cook her whatever she wanted. In fact, she would get up early tomorrow and make her a big breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, she examined her own stomach. Was it looking a little round...

Is that French toast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica grinned. \"Oh, just some things I whipped up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sat down and pulled up a plate, scooping up some scrambled eggs and a generous portion of bacon. As she grabbed a heap of French toast, she looked to Monica. \"Is there any maple syrup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica sat down across from her. \"In that jug there. It's specially warmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachel poured the sweet liquid over her breakfast, she noticed Monica's workout gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going for another run?\" She asked through a mouthful of egg and bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already went.\" Monica said, nibbling on a dry piece of toast. \"Just felt like it, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nodded. \"Oh yeah, I'll probably hit the gym later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica coughed, pouring a glass of OJ for Rachel. \"Oh, but I was hoping you could try a few new recipes for me this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel shrugged. \"Oh, we'll then I guess I'll go tomorrow then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow!\" Monica agreed happily, piling some more eggs on to her friend's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Rachel put her knife and fork down, she had probably eaten enough for three people. She went to clear her plate, but Monica stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about those, I'll clean them. Why don't you go sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel yawned and stretched, causing her swollen belly to jiggle alarmingly. \"Thanks Mon, I guess I should go find some pants that haven't shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica laughed. \"Yeah, I'm sorry about that, my boneheaded mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Rachel said sleepily. \"You know, I might grab a few more zzzs, could you wake me in like, twenty minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" Monica said cheerfully, already scrubbing a pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched Rachel slump back to her bedroom, Monica tried to hide her grin.

As se walked over to the window, ignoring people's barked orders, she couldn't help but wince. Monica must have shrunk her underwear as well, as her current pair kept working its way up between her buttocks, giving her an uncomfortable wedgie. Her black shorts were almost as tight, clinging tightly to her ass. She had just managed to get the button closed, but hasn't been able to zip them up. She blamed it on her big breakfast and figured her apron would cover it, at least until she bought some new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel reached the table and set down the tray. \"So, a black coffee and two cappuccinos.\" She said, placing the drinks on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women sitting there groaned. \"No, it was 2 lattes and a green tea!\" One of them snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, just one moment ma'am.\" Rachel picked up the tray and began to make her way back to the counter, taking a shortcut between two tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'll take one if those cappuccinos!\" Shouted an impatient patron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by this, Rachel didn't hear the cries for her to watch out, and as she squeezed between the tables her expanded butt swept off two cups of coffee and a plate of muffins, which shattered on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I'm so sorry!\" Rachel gasped, putting the tray down as she bent to clean up the mess. She snapped back up when she heard a ripping noise, and craning her neck she could see the large hole right in the back of her shorts, her overworked underpants peeking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few ironic cheers, and a lot more angry muttering as Rachel, blushing furiously, hurried to the bathroom and locked herself into a stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Monica got home from work, she found Rachel snivelling on the couch as she worked through a box of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong sweetie?\" Monica asked, genuinely concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel swallowed and took a swig of milk before answering. \"I got fired. Just for knocking some stuff over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What happened?\" Monica asked, sitting down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, I was walking between two tables, and I must have bumped into one cause a bunch of stuff fell on the ground, and when I went to pick it up by stupid shrunken shorts ripped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's eyes widened. \"You ripped your pants?\" She asked, with a mixture is sympathy and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nodded miserably, cramming another two cookies into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, don't worry sweetie, you'll find a better job, I'm sure if it. Is there anything I can do?\" Monica asked, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked up and smiled a little, her cheeks still bulging with chewed up cookie. \"Could you make one of those cheesecakes with the blueberries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica nodded, and hurried to the kitchen to start setting out ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Phoebe's here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe turned her head, and her jaw dropped as Rachel emerged from her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere before she had just put on a few pounds, she had now definitely made the transition to chubby. Her pink tank top was baring a lot more of her fleshy midriff than it was supposed to, riding up to just above her belly button. Her breasts might have been a little bigger, but it was her lower half that really drew the attention. Her hips had really flared out, meaty love handles jutting over the waistband of her sweatpants, and thickened thighs that were just on the verge of rubbing together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachel pulled Phoebe into a hug, the blonde looked over her friend's shoulder and gasped at the size of her ass. It was easily the size of a basketball, with both cheeks clearly outlined against the thin material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Rachel,\" Phoebe began as the trio sat down. \"Is everything... Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had already filled her plate, and as she answered she was rapidly grating a hunk of cheese over her meal. \"Oh, about the job? Yeah, I should have been looking for something better anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she helped herself to a much more modest portion, Phoebe gave Monica a significant look, but she didn't seem to notice, busy handing Rachel an entire loaf of garlic bread. As they ate, there was the usual amount of conversation  although it was stilted waiting for Rachel to swallow each enormous mouthful of food before answering. In the end, Rachel helped herself to about three quarters of the rich food, with Phoebe eating a much smaller amount, while Monica only seemed to eat a tiny amount of pasta  and some of a piece of garlic bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo-boy!\" Rachel grunted, pulling back from the table and rubbing her swollen belly. \"That was delicious Mon! I am too too full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not 'too too' full for dessert I hope?\" Monica chided playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoebe gaped, Monica went over to the fridge and pulled out a large pie and a can of whipped cream. She cut three huge slices, about half the pie, and added a liberal spritz of cream to each before passing them around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel immediately dug in, lowering her face to the plate and working her fork furiously, but Phoebe hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Phoebe, it's apple cinnamon.\" Monica informed her in a singsong voice. Phoebe was still concerned about Rachel, but it did smell good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fifteen minutes, Phoebe had finished her piece, and was feeling a little over full. She had no idea how Rachel must have felt, having finished both her own and Monica's slices, which had been untouched aside from one small bite. Her top was now riding up to just under her boobs, her stomach round and taut like a drum. Rachel rubbed it delicately with both hands, while letting out an occasional little burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Monica, that was delicious, and Phoebe, its great to catch up, but I could use a little nap.\" The bloated brunette struggled to her feet, rearranging her sagging pants before slowly making her way to her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door clicked shut, Phoebe couldn't hold back any longer. \"Oh my God!\" She cried, looking across at Monica, \"She's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked nonchalant as she cleared the soiled plates. \"What? Oh yeah, she has put on a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was shocked. \"A few? Her ass is the size of Staten Island!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica put a stack of dishes down with a clatter. \"So what? She just lost her job, she's not allowed a little comfort food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\" Phoebe was momentarily thrown by the anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give her a little time, let her get back to work, and I'm sure she'll slim down again. But for now, just let her do what she wants.\" Monica assured her, the tone leaving her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" Phoebe agreed, still feeling a little unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finished cleaning up, Monica gestured to the remaining pie. \"You want to take this? It might help Rachel if there was a little less temptation around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe bit her lip. She'd already eaten a lot, but it was delicious, and if it helped Rachel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica sent her off smiling, with a Tupperware container under her arm. Monica couldn't help from smiling herself as she shut the door, imagining Phoebe eating the rest of that pie. Soon, maybe she would be the only skinny one, she thought happily as she started baking another pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was breathing hard by the time she got inside, but was heartened as she saw Rachel in the exact same place she had left her, sitting on the couch watching TV, munching on a wide variety of snack foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mon.\" She said, without looking away from the television, \"Good run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Monica panted in reply, before downing a large tumbler of water, and then half of another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get the paper? I wanted to look through the want ads.\" Rachel asked as she opened a new bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, I forgot.\" Monica lied, \"But I did pick up Cosmo and Elle. Plus, donuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of donuts was finally enough to cause Rachel to heave herself to her feet and come investigate. As she hurried over, Monica heard the tiny sound of the material of her pyjama bottoms being rubbed together between her flabby thighs. The pink pyjamas were already much too small, the seat only covering about three quarters of her butt, revealing a significant valley of ass cleavage. The buttons on the matching top had burst days ago, so it had been replaced by a white t-shirt that had once reached down to the brunette's knees, but now clung tightly to her impressive gut, leaving a pale band of flesh visible all the way around. Some of the extra pounds had finally found their way to her boobs, which had grown to strain most of her bras, and now rested on top of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel wasted no time in opening the box and grabbing a donut, and as she ate she quickly riffled through the magazine pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" She said, swallowing a large mouthful, \"See these? As soon as I get a new job, I'm buying a pair of jeans just like those ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Monica nodded, personally doubting if Rachel could get those jeans past her thighs, let alone over her ass. After pouring a glass of milk and leaving her friend to her magazines and donuts, she retreated to the bathroom to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling off her workout gear, Monica paused to admire her naked body. The gap between her thighs, the proud jut of her hip bones, even the faint hint of her ribs beneath her small perky breasts, she was looking incredibly hot, especially compared to Rachel, she thought with a self-satisfied grin. Just needed to tone up that little belly, and she would be perfect, she added stepping under the hot water. </span></div></div>",

The sounds and smells of cooking were usually enough to rouse Rachel from her slumber, and she would hurry to the table to eat whatever Monica put in front of her, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes... She was at her hungriest in the mornings, because a night's sleep was the longest she went without food. After eating to satiation, and then a good bit beyond that, she would return to bed for another few hours sleep. In the meantime, Monica would clean the dishes and have her own breakfast, a piece of fruit or maybe some dry toast, washed down with ice cold water. Then she would do some quick sit-ups or stretches before getting ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround eleven, Rachel, throwing a robe over her stretched pyjamas, would switch from her bed to the couch, usually just as Monica pulled a freshly baked confection from the oven. As soon as she had set her friend up with enough snacks and food to keep her on the couch all day, Monica would head to the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter work, having picked up the necessary groceries, Monica would return home to cook a late dinner. Even though she'd been eating all day, Rachel made a good dent in whatever she was served up, usually something thick and rich. Once she'd returned to the couch to nap off her meal, Monica would go out for another jog, or just run up and down the buildings staircases if it was raining. At eleven, she would order some takeout, pizza or Chinese usually, and then ask Rachel if she wanted some. 'Some' ended up being all of it, and just before she collapsed back into a food coma, Monica would help her back to her bedroom and leave her to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she heard Rachel's gentle snoring, she would quickly and quietly  clean the apartment, particularly the area around the sofa, which was always covered in crumbs, stains and wrappers. Once it was spic and span again, she would head for bed herself, setting her alarm for five so she could start the while cycle again. <br>\r\nShe had taken to sleeping naked, enjoying the feel of the silk sheets on her tight and toned body, ignoring the rumbling in her stomach as she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of this...</span></div></div>",

How could you do this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's heart froze in her chest as she dropped the whipped cream. Had Rachel finally realised?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of my clothes have shrunk! Nothing fits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked angry as she came out of the bedroom, her significant girth covered only by a sopping white towel. The weight had really piled on in the last few days, her thighs thickening and causing her to walk with a noticeable waddle, her gigantic ass and hips swaying from side to side with each step. The towel was pulled so tight that Monica could still make out the deep dimple of her belly button. Her stomach had grown into a proper heavy gut that hung down over her crotch, with a second roll of fat forming on the top, supporting her boobs, which had only grown relatively larger, barely a full cup size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight had also spread to her arms and face, giving her upper arms a pillowy appearance, while a double chin made an appearance whoever she opened her mouth. She was pouting now, which exacerbated her chubbier cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand one or two loads, but I swear every scrap of clothes I have is too small for me!\" She complained, holding up a ripped pair of underpants for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica stuttered as she looked for an explanation. \"Um, the super said there was something, uh, wrong with the machines, the detergent catch was, um, caught, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel folded her arms across her chest, still not looking happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So he says they were fixed now, I have another load down there right now if you want me to go get them?\"<br>\r\nShe continued, her voice speeding up as she talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can hardly go in just a towel can I?\" Rachel said, gesturing to her body. \"I could cause a riot.\" She joked, obliviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Monica chuckled, \"Haha. You stay here, have some trifle. I'll get your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachel dug into the trifle, Monica headed down to the basement. She bypassed the laundry room, instead heading to the storage area. After digging around in the boxes for a while, she found what she was looking for. Her parents had sent it when they turned her old room into a gym. A box of her fat clothes. Returning to the laundry room, she began searching through the box and pulled out anything she thought she could use and placed it in a laundry basket, anything that wasn't too dated or out of style. It was hard, but eventually she found three pairs of pants, a half dozen t-shirts and even a couple of blouses that could work. She felt a little gross as she tossed in a bunch of underwear, but didn't see any alternative. With a sewing scissors, she carefully removed any labels that contained an incriminating XXL or noticeably high number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she carried the laundry basket back upstairs, Rachel had made a serious dent in the trifle, the towel now stained with chocolate and jam where she had wiped her hands. Monica handed over the laundry basket, wondering if her plan could possibly work. Surely Rachel would notice the clothes were three times bigger than the ones in her room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel finished off the whole trifle before she went back to her room. There was a tense five minutes, but no scream of anguish or cry of betrayal. Instead, Rachel simply emerged more dressed than she had been in weeks, wearing a pair of black cords and mint green blouse. They didn't fit perfectly, especially around the rear, but they actually buttoned and zipped, which amazed Monica. Had she really been that fat? Was Rachel really this fat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for lunch Mon?\" Rachel asked as she sat down on the couch, springs creaking beneath her. \"I'm pretty hungry.\" She remarked, apparently forgetting the entire dessert she had just demolished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica smiled. It seemed she could get away with anything.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was lying down on her side, arms cradled around her swollen belly, which was already bulging out from underneath Monica's old blouse. After confirming she was out of it by poking and pinching her friend's flabby arm, Monica smiled and crept into Rachel's empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica was excited, but took a moment to sit down on Rachel's bed. She was pretty tired from cooking all that food and waiting on Rachel hand and foot. It just felt like she had much less energy these days. After catching her breath, she began to root through the discarded clothes that littered the floor. Some of the clothes were, unfortunately, ripped along the seams or simply torn from Rachel's attempts to squeeze them on over her expanded frame. There was a particularly cute green top which she actually remembered watching Rachel burst out of as she shovelled down a third tray of lasagne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she assembled a few articles of clothing that hadn't been ruined or stained, and quickly stripped down to her underwear. She buttoned up a blouse and pulled on the grey cashmere sweater Rachel had gottten for Christmas, admiring herself in the mirror as she ran her hands over the silky material. She held her breath and sucked in her cheeks, striking a pose. If she cold just lose a few more pounds, she'd look so hot in this! She picked out a pair of jeans and slipped them on, and took a step back to get the full affect, only to stumble over the pants, which had slid back down her legs. As she regained her balance, she cursed. Rachel must have stretched out the waistband! Oh well she'd just steal one of her belts. Or maybe two, and some of the fancy lingerie she'd outgrown. And maybe those boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sopping<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days passed, and as the weekend rolled around, an unseasonable heat wave hit Manhattan. This meant Rachel had even less motivation to leave the couch, the soaring temperatures causing her to sweat if she even thought about moving. In an attempt to beat the heat, she had eschewed clothing, and was currently lolling across the couch in only her underwear, the white cotton straining to contain her massive bulk. Right now she was working her way through a pack of double stuf Oreos, experimenting with different methods of consuming the tasty treats. Her current favourite was simply to cram four in her mouth and then bite down all at once, causing her already cherubic cheeks to bulge out cartoonishly with cookies and cream. As her chewed, she let out little murmurs of pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, just a few feet away in her bedroom, Monica was feeling far from blissful. She too was in her underwear, hers black silk, but unlike Rachel she was all too aware of her figure. It appeared those last few pounds she had been unable to shift from her stomach had multiplied. Instead of being nice and flat, it was noticeably round, sticking out prominently. She couldn't be sure, as she had gotten rid of the scales to stop Rachel from stepping on them, but it looked like she had put on at least ten pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this have happened? She knew she had stopped working out so much, but that was only because she had so little energy these days... Probably because she spent so much time cooking for Rachel, cleaning up after Rachel, waiting on her hand and foot... Monica was so angry, she actually forgot that she had enabled her roommate to become such a degenerate glutton. She pulled on a t-shirt on, hoping it was enough to disguise her gut, and stormed out into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had just finished off the Oreos, the last crumbs disappearing into the vast cleavage created by her overworked bra. She smiled obliviously at Monica's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Mon. Do you think you could make me one of those great low fat milkshakes? It is soooo hot today!\" She asked, blowing a strand of auburn hair from her pudgy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica had been planning to work out, but paused. Fine, she thought. If she was going to get fat because of Rachel, then she would just have to make sure Rachel got even fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Rach, just give me a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly walked to the kitchen and began gathering the ingredients. Of course it wasn't low fat, she had just started saying that about everything to get Rachel to eat even more. There were two gallons of ice-cream in the fridge, one strawberry, the other chocolate. She took them both out, along with two gallons of whole milk, though one of these was half empty. She hooked up the blender, dumped in three large scoops of the strawberry, filled the rest with milk, and let it go a few seconds on full blast. She poured the creamy mixture into a tall glass and brought it over to Rachel, who grasped at it greedily. She slurped the whole thing down in less than ten seconds, and held out her glass for more. Monica filled it up and returned to the kitchen to make up another batch, of chocolate this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for some time, though Monica had long since stopped being impressed by how much her friend could consume. Still, as her already prodigious belly began to bloat outwards, Rachel slowed her pace noticeably, and Monica began to murmur words of encouragement, urging her to keep drinking. After the fifteenth full glass, Rachel's  hands dropped to her sides, her flabby arms exhausted, but if Monica held the glass to her lips she would continue to suck down the fattening mixture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the twenty fifth glass, Monica had run out of milk, but did find some of the rich cream she used for baking, and poured that in the blender instead. After a moments hesitation, she grabbed an entire stick of unsalted butter and crammed that in as well. If Rachel noticed, she didn't say anything, having been reduced to the occasional moan of either discomfort or pleasure. Finally, Monica had just a quarter gallon of chocolate ice cream remaining. It was pretty melted from sitting out in the heat, and with a shrug Monica simply poured it straight into the blender jug, taking the whole thing over to the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked dazed, her eyes open but unfocused, a thin string of chocolatey drool running down her chin. Her stomach was bigger than Monica had ever seen it, and was almost totally round, all the little rolls and dimples vanishing as her belly swelled out further and further and further. Monica had to stand on her tip toes to reach over it and pour the last of the melted ice cream into Rachel's unresisting mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer task finally completed, Monica collapsed into the nearby armchair, feeling totally exhausted.  She  looked over at her roommate, who was now gurgling audibly, punctuated by an occasional hiccough. Rachel lazily raised her hands and began to gently massage her beach ball sized belly, groaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica placed a hand on her own stomach, comforted a little by Rachel's hugeness. Still, she could definitely get fatter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica shut off the taps and looked at herself in the bathroom mirror, casting a critical eye over her pudgy physique. Her belly was even bigger, practically basketball sized, now supported by two budding love handles. Her butt and legs had also grown a little too.  On the plus side, some of the weight she had gained had found its way to her breasts, sending her up a few cup sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe applied some deodorant, and pulled a white t-shirt on over her head, forgoing a constricting bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the bathroom, Monica was immediately presented with the sight of Rachel's enormous backside. Her massive flabby buttocks and tree trunk sized thighs were hanging from the window that lead to the apartment's balcony. For a moment Monica thought her room-mate was naked, but then she saw the tiny triangle of black material wedged into the very top of her titanic ass crack, the bikini's waistband cutting into her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Rach?\" She said finally, after taking in the tableau for another few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief delay, she got a reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica?! Oh thank god!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Monica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's butt began to wobble, as she attempted to turn her head. Combined with the muffling of her voice, the effect was uncannily like she was talking out of her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going out to sunbathe on the balcony when I got stuck!\" It explained. \"The window must have shut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica peered carefully over the mounds of flesh, to see the window was still fully open. It was just Rachel's fat ass that had become lodged in the frame, after she had somehow squeezed her equally fat tits and belly through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help Mon, I've been out here for like twenty minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica tried to keep the laughter out of her voice. \"Twenty minutes? Why didn't you call for help sooner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. \"Well, I brought some snacks out with me, and I figured I should try and keep my strength up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica glanced over at the counter, where a cake she had baked earlier was no longer sitting. She had to bite down on her fist to keep from laughing. Rachel was so huge that she was stuck in a window, and her first instinct had been to stuff herself with cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Monica?\" Rachel asked, with a tone of annoyance. \"A little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming.\" Monica said, stepping in between her friend's legs. Her thick, pillowy thighs were warm to the touch, and Monica actually had to squeeze in between them to reach the window. Up close, Rachel's ass was a mass of dimples and cellulite, the slightest touch sending it wobbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica rattled the window latch back and forth. \"No good Rach, it's really jammed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well find something to un-jam it!\" Rachel said petulantly. \"I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica smiled. This was probably the most discomfort Rachel had experience in weeks, and she didn't know how to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try something.\" She said, taking a few steps back. She grabbed one of Rachel's chubby ankles and began to move them up and down, slowly at first, but gradually picking up speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jiggling started in her legs but soon spread throughout her body, from her back fat to her belly rolls, from her meaty  ass to her pendulous boobs. Her whole body was practically vibrating, the window frame creaking under the pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel yelled, her voice distorted by her wobbling cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MmOoOoNniCcCaAaAaAaA! SsTtOoOoPpPp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Monica relented, mostly due to the fact that she was exhausted. She bent double, trying to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that didn't work!\" Rachel said pointedly, even before the last of the jiggling had subsided. \"You better call Treager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica stood back up, the grin leaving her face. If the building's super had to physically cut Rachel out of the window frame, it seemed likely that she would realise just how fat she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, surely you don't want Treager to see you like this?\" She said, stalling for time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't just stay stuck like this!\" Rachel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica figured that if Rachel had gotten stuck the other way, she would have been happy to stay there, as long as Monica kept shovelling food down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, you can just put some jeans on me before he gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica didn't think it would be possible to get a pair of jeans past Rachel's knees, let alone her ass. <br>\r\nShe needed a better solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me try one more thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried to the kitchen and located the olive oil. Removing the stopper, she went back to the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! What is that?!\" Rachel yelled, as Monica dripped the oil across her back and sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just oiling up the window!\" Monica explained cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more careful! You're getting it all over me!\" Rachel complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica  paid special attention to Rachel's hips, which were properly wedged against the wood of the frame. Once the bottle was empty, she cast it aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Rach, are you ready?\" Monica asked, digging in her heels and grabbing Rachel's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for wha...aaah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica pulled as hard as she could, bracing herself against the wall, her arms wrapped around Rachel's knees.  For a moment nothing happened, but then she felt Rachel begin to move, the oil lubricating her widened hips enough to squeeze them through the window. Rachel was still squealing like a stuck pig, appropriately enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww! Ow! Ow! Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica ignored her friend's pain and, taking a deep breath, pulled even harder. All at once, and with an audible pop, Rachel came unstuck. Monica was sent flying, landing on her butt and cracking her head against the bathroom door. She barely had time to register that before Rachel landed on top of her, burying her face in the vast canyon of her butt-cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds Monica actually thought she might suffocate, before she was finally able to claw her way free. Both women lay in a crumpled heap for quite some time, letting out feeble moans and groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica recovered first, wriggling out from under Rachel, who she then helped get to her feet. Her bikini top was askew, revealing the tops if her nipples, and her face and hands were still covered in chocolate icing from the cake. The red marks from where the window had cut into her were still fresh, and her hips, belly and thighs were dappled with olive oil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, that could have been embarrassing, huh?.\" She said, without irony, licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica smiled, weakly. \"How about some lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Roaring from the other side of her wall was the constant sound of Rachel's snoring, her lardy friend having only just finished the huge midnight feast she had laid out for her. She rested a hand on her stomach and frowned, detecting a faint trace of flab on the surface, one that seemed bigger than yesterday. Something she needed to watch out for, living with the tubby Rachel. The temptation to sneak the occasional snack was growing more tempting, and she had to resist. The last thing she wanted to do was be like her friend. Finally, sleep came, and she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was dropping in her mouth, sugary and sweet, and she looked up to see Phoebe standing above her, emptying a bag of M&amp;Ms onto her face, the chocolates dropping down her throat as she struggled to chew. She ran her eyes over her friend, widening as she saw the huge, dropping belly running over her waistband, her top struggling to contain mammoth, flabby breasts, a sheen of grease around her friend's mouth as the obese blonde reached over to a tray held by a tall, busty maid, snatching a burger and stuffing it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to wake up, sleepy-head,\u201d she said. \u201cYou're going to miss breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked down, and caught her breath as she saw the huge belly reaching from the floor, obscuring her feet, covered in chocolate stains. Reaching down with her arms, she saw flabby wings dropping down, and couldn't link them, her flabby stomach getting in the way. On either side, she felt strong arms reaching down, tugging her to her feet, two more maids pulling her up, supporting her weight, her legs struggling to support her mass. One of them held up a platter of Krispy Kremes, and before she knew what she was doing, she'd reached out to snatch one of them from the tray, stuffing it into her mouth, jam running down her double chin as the taste of sugar hit her taste-buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver to her left, she heard a loud ping, and turned to see Rachel sprawled on a couch, stuffing a huge cheesecake into her mouth, crumbs running into her jiggling, flabby cleavage. A button had evidently snapped off her blouse, allowing her colossal belly to spill out across her lap, but she hadn't even stopped gorging for a moment. As she watched, a trio of cakes were placed in front of her friend by a maid, and her stomach began to rumble, her hand absent-mindedly reaching across for another doughnut. Phoebe had moved over to another chair, collapsing like a mound of blubber in front of a heaped pile of junk food, burgers, fries, chicken and pizza already forcing its way into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne chair was empty, and she struggled over to it, sitting down with relief in front of an empty table. Before she could say a word,two the ubiquitous maids stepped forward, bringing over a platter loaded with a mountain of ice cream, hundreds of scoops in dozens of flavors, drowned in a rich, chocolate sauce. On either side, to complement the meal, cream cakes and eclairs, dozens of them, and she reached down to snatch one away, stuffing it in her mouth, before taking a huge scoop and starting to shovel the ice cream down, chocolate and strawberry and vanilla, coffee, mint and toffee, rich cream loading into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could hear was the sound of her friends eating, slowly gorging their way through the heaped food, no other thoughts in their minds than to fill up their stomachs, load them with rich, heavy food. She looked up at her mountain, already visibly smaller, then reached across for a jug of thick chocolate milkshake, pouring it down in huge gulps, allowing a belch to escape. She could feel the rolls of flab gathering around her waist, her arms thickening as she continued to gorge. Then, behind her, she heard the sounds of doors opening, and turned to see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast had finally arrived, and the three super-obese friends lurched from their seats towards it. A huge silver tray, fifteen-feet across, was sliding across the floor, pushed by a dozen maids, six-feet high with sausages, bacon, fried eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, steaks, chops, leaving a greasy trail across the floor. Monica salivated as she saw it, eyes widening, and reaching back for a last eclair, or even three, stumbled across the floor in a desperate bid to reach it before the others. The smell made her nostrils twitch, and she reached out for the calorie-laden mass, stumbling down to the ground, burying her face in the pile.</span></div></div>",

She landed on the couch with a loud creak and opened the first box. Monica replied while finishing up the dishes, \"Rach I don't know what to tell ya, I think I saw it on the coffee table\". Rachel surveyed her surroundings, from the empty pizza boxes and snack wrappers to half full bags of chips. \"Found it,'' she said while stifling a belch. Albeit a little discolored due to the pizza grease, it still seemed to be in one piece. \"Monica the classifieds are ruined\", screamed Rachel as she threw them across the room. Rachel picked up two slices of pizza, stacked them together, and took a big bite. \"Anf fif wosh thoo weeks old\", she said with a mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica crouched down to pick up the newspaper when suddenly her pants split down the middle. After about 2 months of secretly stuffing Rachel to the 500 pound behemoth, she seemed oblivious to notice that her own figure was blowing up, and blowing up fast.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\", thought Monica, \"I weighed myself last week; i couldn't be that big\". Thinking back to when she was weighing herself she couldn't actually see the number due to her large breasts. \"Stupid boobs\", she said as she gave them a quick shake. She remembered the issue and quickly darted into her room, glancing at the enormity of Rachel shoving a few more slices into her maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I've created a monster\", said Monica as she turned her back to her closet mirror. Immediately noticing the rip, Monica took herself all in. \"Jeez, look at the size of my ass\", she said as she gave it a hearty slap. \"Maybe I should have sent bigger portion sizes to Phoebe like she asked so I wouldn't have been so tempted. She was practically begging for more after that first week\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------Fla shback-2 months ago------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Monica, I'm just worried about Rachel\", begged Phoebe, \"She was huge the last time I saw her and now it's been at least 3 weeks\". Monica sipped her coffee with a surprised look on her face. \"Phoebe I don't think that's such a good idea. Rachel is in a delicate place right now\". \"Yeah single, jobless, and one piece of cake away from becoming Mrs. Marlon Brando\", replied Phoebe, \"All I'm saying is if you send me some of her \"generous\" portions she might be able to start working it off\". \"Well I suppose It could work\", Monica said as she finished off her coffee and the rest of her muffin, \"I was going to buy 2 dozen muffins before I went home. Maybe you could take some?\". \"OOH great start Mon\", shouted Phoebe, slightly startling Monica, \"I'll take 6!\", Phoebe grabbed 6 muffins, stuffed them in her purse, and darted out of the entrance way, \"Umm, OK nice hanging out with you too, I'll pay for those then\", said Monica looking confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to Gunther and ordered her muffins, \"I need 2 dozen muffins. I'll also be paying for the 6 Phoebe just ran off with\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                --------------1 month later-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe I'm here with today's portions\", shouted Monica as she came in with a cart full of various foodstuffs. \"Ugh oh come on pants...thanks Mon you can leave it by the coffee table. I'll take care of it in a little bit\", said Phoebe as she came out of her room. Monica could notice that Phoebe was enjoying the daily portions, evident by her curvier figure. Phoebe grabbed the big chocolate cake and took it to the kitchen. where Monica got a good look at her larger ass, clearly outlined with the dress she was wearing. \"Thanks Mon, you're an amazing chef\", said Phoebe with a mouthful of cake. She gave Monica a hug, Allowing Monica to feel Phoebe's belly, which was bigger than her own. \"OK then\", said Monica, \"I'll see you tomorrow\". \"Oh and Mon\", asked Phoebe as she reached for a veggie burger, \"are you gonna bring even more than today's helping?\". \"Sure\", said Monica as she stepped out the door, \"I'll bring you all you can handle...and more\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------Bac k to present day------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica\", shouted Rachel from the living room, snapping Monica back to reality. She threw on a Knicks t-shirt and some sweatpants, which were still feeling tight around the ass area. \"Yes, what do you want Rachel?\". \"Have you seen the remote? I can't find it\". Monica watched as Rachel twisted her body on the couch looking for the remote. With a huff, Rachel gave up and went back to her pizza. Monica then saw that the remote was lodged between Rachel's stomach rolls. \"Found it\", said Monica. She handed it to her enormous roommate. \"Anyway\", said Monica as she headed for the door, \"I'm going to the coffee house, want anything?\". Rachel stood up with great difficulty and waddled into the kitchen, \"would you be able to pick up 4 dozen muffins for me? Also another Joey Special. You know what, make that two Joey specials\". Monica's eyes went wide with shock. \"I deserve it, I've had a productive week\", said Rachel as she landed back on the couch. Monica turned to the hall when Rachel spoke up again, \"By the way Mon, I didn't want to mention it but I noticed that you put on a little weight\". Monica turned around with a discouraged look on her face, \"if you want I can help you work it off\". Rachel then heard the door slam, \"Hmm wonder what that was all about, and I hope she remembers my Joey specials...BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica stormed into Central Perk So frustrated with what Rachel had said that she ordered 3 muffins for herself to go with her coffee. \"the nerve of that fat cow to bring up how I'm gaining weight. I'll show her who's fat\". She went to go sit down on the Central Perk couch until she saw someone sitting there with a huge feast in front of them. This woman was huge, almost as big as Rachel. \"Umm...Excuse me?\", said Monica. She was about to tap her shoulder...until she saw the guitar case. Monica's eyes went wide again. \"Phoebe?\". Phoebe looked up from her huge meal. \"Monica!, hey what's up, long time no see\". Now that Monica just shipped over Phoebe's portions without seeing her in the last few weeks. Phoebe had turned into Rachel, a 450 pounder who plopped her huge body in front of the TV and destroying the food in front of her. She stood up to hug Monica, and Monica could barely get her arms past Phoebe's huge boobs. She saw Phoebe's belly rolls exposed in her too small shirt. \"Oh my, Mon, was it always this hot in the coffee house\". Phoebe then used a chubby hand to stuff a muffin in her mouth. \"I thought I'd have a snack before I performed tonight\". Monica eyed Phoebe's \"snack\" and looked back at Phoebe. \"Hey Pheebs\", said Monica eyed Phoebe's 10 foot ass. \"How about instead of performing we have a girls night back at the apartment?\". \"Well\", thought Phoebe as she obliviously rubbed her belly, \"I do have new songs to debut tonight\". \"I'm sure Rachel would be happy to see you, we're ordering a few Joey specials\", said Monica. \"You had me at Joey specials, I could go for a couple. I guess I can debut \"empty plate blues\" and \"99 pizza slices on my plate\" next week. Kinda need the pizza here with me anyway\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica and Phoebe made it to the apartment with 8 boxes of pizza in each hand. \"It's gonna be a good night\", said Monica as she opened the door and led Phoebe in. Monica noticed that Phoebe barely slid through the door. Rachel was still taking up most of the couch with her huge body. \"Rach we're home\". Rachel stood up and saw Phoebe...</span></div></div>",

Her face was a testament to gluttony, triple-chins smeared with grease and fat over a piggy nose and wild eyes, jewels nestled in her hair, carefully arranged to be well clear of her greedy mouth.<br>\r\n\tShe looked down at herself, and her eyes widened as she saw a mighty expanse of bare, jigging belly, huge wings of fat hanging from her arms as she struggled to raise them, a huge burger in each hand and an empty platter in front of her, covered in the remnants of a mighty meal. Her stomach rumbled, and for a moment her mind screamed that this was wrong, but a louder voice drowned it out in the urgent demand for food, that there was an empty space inside her that she had to fill.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMore food!\u201d Rachel screamed again, and a pair of servants ran into the room with a huge bowl of lasagne, a ladle dumped into it that the obese tyrant snatached out, dumping mouthfuls of pasta, tomato and cheese into her waiting mouth, heedless of the sources dribbling into her cleavage below. Monica looked at the burgers and stuffed them into her mouth, huge bites sending grease tumbling down her chins, eagerly gorging away. Another servant raced up with a bottle of champagne, tipping it into Rachel's mouth in between bites, froth oozing from her lips with each mighty swig.<br>\r\n\tBefore she could even ask, a vat of rice was dropped in front of her with a ladle of her own, covered in hot, spicy, meat-filled sauce, and she started to shovel it in, as though racing her friend as she devoured her own gluttonous feast. She could feel her belly slowly expand, beginning to move down her lap, and gobbled away at her food in between desperate breaths, all urges other than the desire to stuff herself to repletion removed.<br>\r\n\tSomehow, she beat Rachel to the end, and the words, \u201cFood! Now!\u201d came from her lips unbidden, another pair of servants pushing a trolley loaded with a huge, ten-layered cake came in, one of them taking her empty bowl away before moving the new meal into position. Rachel looked at her enviously as she finished her own meal, the last button snapping from her top as she dumped a pile of food into her waiting mouth. <br>\r\n\tThere was a spoon in Monica's hand, but after the first few bites she simply dived into the food, snatching great fistfuls of cake into her mouth. She reached down with her hand, feeling her huge, wobbling rump that was straining the fabric of her chair, a servant standing by with a huge jug of strawberry milkshake, pouring it into her mouth whenever an opportunity presented itself. Now Rachel had her own desert, a chocolate mousse, and was slobbing it in as fast as she could, dropping a brown trail across her front as she snatched at her food.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMore,\u201d Monica screamed, as the cake began to collapse. \u201cMore!\u201d She meant it, her desperate mouth snatching every scrap of food as fast as she could eat it. The servants swarmed in with more treats, surrounding her with platters of sugary and greasy food, her hands snatching ever-larger morsels as she rested back on her divan, watching her belly slowly rise like bread dough in an oven, Rachel screaming for assistance but being ignored as an ever-larger army of servants worked to satisfy their mistress.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMore!\u201d she yelled, and her arms, so heavy that moving them was an unwanted effort, rested on her belly as she felt it growing, her servants now feeding her, pushing food into her slovening mouth, drool, grease and chocolate streaming clear in equal measure as her belly rose higher and higher, wider and wider, pushing into the sides of the chair. \u201cMore, more, more!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally, she contentedly dropped off to sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing in the corridor outside their bedrooms, stick thin, thinner than she had ever been, pushing an immense trolley laden with delicious food. She pushed into Monica's room, her eyes widening at the sight inside, a huge, bloated blimp sprawled on her reinforced bed, her mouth covered in the remnants of a super-sized snack, ketchup and grease smeared on her four chins. Her fat belly draped across the sheets, useless legs writhing back and forth, and on either side, Phoebe and Ursula lovingly caressed her obese forms, stuffing candy bars into her waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Monica said, greedy, beady eyes scanning the trays. \u201cWhat have you got for second lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPizzas, burgers, fried chicken, half a dozen footlongs, fries,\u201d Rachel replied, pushing it close enough for an eager hand to snatch the nearest piece of junk food, stuffing it into her waiting mouth. \u201cMon, could I have some of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God, no way,\u201d Monica replied, as Phoebe stuffed a fist-ful of fries into her mouth. \u201cI'm on a new diet, and I've got to eat as much as I can, so all of this is for me.\u201d With a loud belch, she accepted a greasy burger from Ursula, taking a massive bite. \u201cAnd look, I'm just wasting away.\u201d With a near-useless hand, she slammed onto her gargantuan paunch, her rolls of oily flab rippling to the touch. \u201cNo, I've got to eat all of this.

About a week had passed since Phoebe had last been over, and Monica had taken up the mantle of fattening her friends with a new fervor. Once she realized that Rachel would normally eat a large lunch and then fall asleep in her room, Monica had begun to call Phoebe over \"to spend more time with each other.\" What actually happened was Monica would try and get Phoebe to eat as much food as possible and then send her home with some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked over her handiwork with pleasure. Where Rachel had continued to grow more and more of a pear shape, so much so that she was having more and more trouble fitting her butt into even the largest pairs of her \"shrunken\" sweatpants. Phoebe, on the other hand, seemed to be more top heavy. Her belly was poking out from under her shirts more and more, and her breasts had gone up a whole cup size. Monica stared at the pale, rounded flesh jutting out from underneath her friend's shirt with glee. She couldn't wait for more of her belly to be visible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you been up to, Phoebe?\" asked Monica as she started sliding trays of various deserts and food out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe started blathering on about various activities, TV shows, and guys while she started nibbling on the various foods in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica let her go on for a few minutes before pulling out her trump card. \"Something wrong, Phoebe?

Pushing the trolley in front of them, she placed it carefully in position where they could both easily reach them, then took a seat in the middle, dropping down onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn either side, the increasingly elephantine forms of Phoebe and Rachel bulged from the couch, their flab-laden arms reaching for the food she'd set before them, stacks of easily eaten snacks, cupcakes, cream puffs, pastries. Some of it brought with their increasingly meagre bank accounts, the rest carefully but quickly prepared by her. The eager grunting from her two friends as they started to feast made it all worthwhile, and she looked across at Phoebe, the obese blonde eagerly snatching a brownie and slamming it into her mouth, sending a cascade of crumbs into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChange the channel,\u201d Rachel said through a mouthful of chocolate. Monica knew what she wanted to watch, another cooking show to give her fresh means to indulge her gluttony. Idly, she reached for cupcake, taking a heavy bite of icing and cake, while Phoebe eagerly snatched at two more. Gently, she patted Phoebe's belly through the gap in her top, then looked across hungrily at Rachel as her friend devoured a tray of pastries. She was starting to seriously envy their indulgence, but there was nothing she could do about it. The forty pounds she'd gained was starting to slow her down, but someone had to provide the constant trail of food that kept her friends sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLunch?\u201d Rachel asked, and Monica began to rise to her feet, reaching for a final cream puff, as a brief news flash appeared on the screen, the results of the State Lottery. The first two numbers sounded familiar, and she snatched into her pocket for the ticket she'd bought before, eyes growing wider as the newscaster read out the numbers. As the others watched, she carefully put the ticket back, then reached for a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake out OK?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort?\u201d Phoebe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything,\u201d Monica said, with a greedy, gluttonous smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u00b4s not even close to a competition... you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait, Miss Wiseass!\" Monica yelled, left the appartment and closed the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later Monica came back... with 3 giant paper bags... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, patience, Rachel!\" You will see in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel lost interest into the matter very fast and didn\u00b4t care about Monica anymore... until the latter sat down onto the couch as well to join Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn\u00b4t the deciving issue... it were the two big trays Monica had carried carefully and that were placed on the table now... Each of the silver plates contained 50 donuts each... with the 50 ones on Rachel\u00b4s plate inlcuding a special \"present\" as Monica secretly injected soem appetite enhancers inside them as she prepared the plates with Rachel being uninteressted to everything around her... Of course Monica took a drug that would kick in with a delay of about 90 minutes, so she would easily down Rachel in that contest but Rachel\u00b4s appetite would recover much quicker than without that stimulant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you say now? We have 50 dounts each... so that\u00b4s a fair contest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to do an eating contest against you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... who finishes them all at first is the winner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I just ate 6 before!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then let\u00b4s say that you only have to finish 44 to get the victory... would that be a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fair and square!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay than.... Let\u00b4s..... EAT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women started to grab their starting donut with wild determination to win the contest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 70 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ...both of them are too stuffed to continue the contest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) ...one of them has finished her donuts but the runner-up is severely stuffed, too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So </span></div></div>",

Neither Monica nor Rachel came close to 50 donuts and ended in their early 30s... Both of them could easily disguise as heavily pregnant thanks to the aching, gurgling orbs they had developed over the past minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRivers of sweat run across their faces and bodies while the young laides tried to breathe as good as possible. Due to the heat that came into play together with the ever growing feeling of fullness first Monica and then Rachel decided to get rid of their shirts to cool down only keeping their bras on, so no piece of textile was able hide even a bit of the round guts that were displayed in perfection. Their pants didn\u00b4t help to conceal the culinary damage that was done ot the waistlines. None of them wanted to unbutton her own pants to show a bit of fullness and weakness to the other... but in the end donuts #22 did it for Rachel\u00b4s pants as the brunette only had the chance to decide whether she would unbutton her pants voluntarily or the button would pop of anyway... So Rachel made the decision to avoid a damage in the filec of textiles and unbuttoned... the expanding belly using the new room to explore it pushing the fly immediately down to the bottom of the zipper... Same happened to Monica\u00b4s pants after the dark bombshell had finished #24... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them was able to say a word anymore and the only noises one could here were the protesting sounds of two overfilled stomachs and the burps the cute women did to relieve at least a bit of the pressure they felt from inside... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of a a sudden Rachel broke the silence...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What *URP* have we done... How could we *ARP* eat so much? I\u00b4m soooo *BLORP* stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, I\u00b4m *BLERP* sorry that I talk you *RORP* into this one!

Rachel? Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was full of concern entering the appartment. Neither Monica nor Rachel had answered her phone call and knocking on the door for 5 minutes without any result didn\u00b4t help to quiet her sorrows down... Did somwthing hapen to them? A crime maybe? A urglar could had tied them up.. or even...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Phoebe could finish that horrible thought she a reason to relax... There they were but... LOOK AT THE BELLIES... THEY LOOK LIKE THEY SWALLOWED BEACHBALLS!!! Phoebe thought while something cold and positive run down her spine... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneaked to the couch where the snoring and burping women cured the effects of their \"donut pregnancies\"... Phoebe touched the belly of Monica and then the one of Rachel... it felt somehow cool to her... the bellies of her friends felt so round and tight, Phoebe couln\u00b4t even poke her finger into the flesh anymore... Phoebe tried the best to fight that tought but in the end she gave in and for a few seconds she played bongo using the packed guts as drums... The tunes sounded well in Phoebe\u00b4s ear. An album with the background music played on stuffed bellies... she had in mind.. could make a big story in the media... Hmmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing afraid that one of her overloaded friends could wake up she quit kidding around and sat into the armchair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe\u00b4s eyes found the donuts that were still left. Having skipped her afternoon meal Phoebe\u00b4s belly rumbled in hunger pain, so she grabbed a donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Among the few donuts Phoebe eats is at least one with the appetite enhancer... so Phobe will go on a binge spree herself later on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Phoebe is lcuky and only grabs 2-3 donuts from Monica\u00b4s plate so there will be no binging done by the blonde...</span></div></div>",

It was only when she opened the door to let her in that she realised that she'd got rather more of her friend back that she had expected; the buttons on her shirt were bulging slightly at the waist, and her face looked a little softer. She had a half-eaten chocolate bar in her hand, and when she went to hug her, was slightly sticky. Monica dropped her bags to the floor and took another bite of her chocolate, heading over to the fridge to pour herself some milk.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHow'd it go, Mon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fantastic. A whole month of tuition from some of the best cooks in the state. I learned a lot of great new recipes that I can't wait to try out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another bite from her chocolate bar, finishing it; she tossed the wrapper in the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you tried out a few while you were down there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked down. \u201cOh, there was a lot of taste testing. I'll shake it off in a hurry.\u201d She pulled another chocolate bar out of her pocket, tore off the top, and began to eat it. Then she picked up her bag, and walked into her room; Rachel could swear that her butt was jiggling a bit, and watched it sauntering away, hearing the occasional chomp of another bite of chocolate bar going in.</span></div></div>",

Next to her was a box of a dozen donuts; she popped open the top, grabbed one, and took a huge bite from the sugary treat. Her stomach was jiggling a bit, rising slightly, and the beginnings of a double chin were forming. The first donut was finished, so she picked up the second and started on it, turning on the television with her other hand. Rachel walked in, tired from a long day at work; she saw her housemate sitting on the couch gorging away, and shook her head in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrist, Mon, all you've done for the last month is sit around eating.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cTaste testing,\u201d she said, through a mouth of donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.

Want a donut?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica shrugged her shoulders, and started her fourth, watching her annoyed friend walk into her room and slam the door behind her. After the fourth donut, she fancied a change, so she grabbed a bag of potato chips out of her pocket and started to wolf them down, four at a time, finally tipping the back into her mouth.

It was lunchtime, and she waddled into the cafeteria, starving and ready for a meal. When she looked around, she couldn't see anyone there, but the clock definitely said that it was lunchtime, and she could certainly smell the food. She took a tray, and placed a burger and a scoop of fries onto it, grabbing a pair of chocolate desserts, then sat down fairly close to the counter. The burger tasted great, but before she had taken more than a couple of bites, she saw Rachel bounding in, wearing her cheerleader uniform, which fit her curves perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all you are going to eat? You can do better than that!\u201d Rachel called, dropping her pom-poms on the table. She picked up a tray, and loaded it with food; half a dozen burgers, scoop after scoop of french fries, three portions of fried chicken, some sausages, then dropped it down in front of Monica. \u201cEat up, piggy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica reached down into the greasy mess of food and pulled out a burger; as soon as she took the first bite, her taste buds erupted with pleasure and she began to gobble it down. In five bites it was gone, but there was another one; she grabbed a piece of fried chicken with the other hand but it turned out to be just as good. She crammed more food in, a fistful of fries in between other pieces, until she had cleared the tray, and gave out a loud belch. Her stomach was tight against her shirt; the buttons were straining, and some belly could be seen through the gaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one course? A skinny little woman like you needs to eat more than that!\u201d Rachel grabbed another tray, filled it up again, heaped and piled with fatty foods. This time an entire pizza, loaded on in slices, a dozen hot dogs, more fries, onion rings, a pair of chicken pies. The tray was dropped in front of Monica again, who realised as soon as the smell hit her that she was still hungry, and she reached in with her hands, munching on pizza, feeling the tomato sauce slide down her throat. This time, Rachel started to dance around, waving her pom-poms in the air, while Monica feasted. She looked up with a pair of hot dogs in each hand at her, taking huge bites of sausage and bread. The last french fry went into her mouth, and she felt a slight release of pressure; one of the buttons on her top had pinged off, and her belly began to push out to fill the gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for dessert, lardo!\u201d Monica shook her head, but Rachel went back to the counter, filling another tray with sweets. A pile of eclairs, cream cakes, sugared fruits, donuts, rose on top of the tray, and again she dropped them in front of her bulging friend. Her eyes were tightly closed, but somehow her hand reached down to grab one of the cream cakes, and once she had taken a bite, she was lost again. A cake in each hand, Monica alternated bites from left to right, cream and chocolate running down her face, as her belly slowly continued to swell. She felt a rip from her side, and her fattening thighs tore through her skirt. In front of her, Rachel danced around, her breasts bouncing up and down in her uniform, until she saw that the tray was emptying again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning over to the vending machines, she began pushing buttons and pulling levers, filling a huge bag full of their contents. As Monica sat back in her chair, gasping for breath, her hand on her quivering jelly belly, she danced back to the table and tipped the contents in front of her; more than a hundred chocolate bars, bags of crisps. Monica's hands frantically began to tear through packaging, gulping and swallowing chocolate as fast as she could, sticky chocolate drool now running down her triple chins onto her top. With another rip, the seat of her skirt went, and more buttons pinged off her top, allowing her belly to roll out across her lap. As she finished the snacks, she looked up, panting for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Monica, you still look so hungry!\u201d Rachel cooed. Jogging in from either side of the room was a cheerleading squad, half a dozen more busty, bouncing women jogging up and down, shaking their pom-poms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFAT \u2013 FAT \u2013 FAT \u2013 FAT,\u201d they chanted as they danced around the heavily obese Monica, struggling and failing to move. After waving their arms on the air one last time, they ran over to the food counter and started to load trays with food, holding them around Monica as she reached to grab more and more fatty treats. Burgers, chicken, cakes, jello, pies, all heaped high and full to bursting.  All she had to do was reach out, and something greasy or sweet would be in her hand for her to gobble. Her belly continued to expand, pushing the table away, and her arms grew heavy with flab. As one tray emptied, the cheerleader ran back to top it up, until finally Monica heard a loud crack, and felt herself falling to the floor, the chair giving way under her weight. She reached up with her arms for more food, cramming it into her mouth as her belly continued to rise...</span></div></div>",

Her breasts struck out on top of a mountainous belly that reached down over her flabby knees; her four chins wiggled in eager anticipation of her breakfast feast. She reached out with her fat-smothered hands to the trolley as it approached, grabbing greasy food as fast as she could, gobbling down sausages and fried bread and toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica ran back to the kitchen, listening to her friend wolf down her second meal of the day, and hurriedly began to load another trolley up with her desserts; with cakes and pies and trifles, bowls of chocolate cookie dough covered in frosting.

She slid into Rachel's room, and ever so quietly, pushed the funnel into her open mouth, and started pouring the mix in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica watched in awe as the mix slowly drained out of the gallon, and the sleeping Rachel's belly started protruding from the amount of milkshake being forced into it. The toned belly started poking outwards, until it was the size of a cantaloupe. The last of the mix dripping down Rachel's throat, Monica retracted the funnel and walked out of the room. \"I must prepare for tomorrow!\" she whispers to herself excitedly as she begins to make breakfast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about 8 in the morning, Rachel woke up to a heavenly smell. <i>\"What is that?\"</i> she thought to herself as she drifted out of bed, sniffing the air hungrily. Walking in to the kitchen, she gasped. A platter had been set out for her, covered with a 12 stack of pancakes drenched in butter and syrup, a ton of bacon, a massive glass of orange juice, a whole pan of scrambled eggs, and a bowl of cereal. Rachel's eyes flicked over the meal and noticed a tiny sticky note by her utensils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Rachel,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so happy you accepted my plan to eat what I want and screw the cost, so I stayed up all night making you this breakfast. I hope it isn't too cold.

She sat down, picked up her spoon, and dug into her bowl of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Rachel had finally finished her meal, and sat back, groaning. She rubbed her swollen, aching belly. She had barely finished the meal, and had almost stopped on more then one occasion, but the care Monica had taken to make this meal had motivated her to finish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica glanced in from her hiding place under the pantry. <i>\"Any second now...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel hunched over, suddenly very tired. A few more seconds and... boom. Rachel was out like a light from the sleeping powder Monica had put in the bacon. Grinning, Monica sauntered in to the room and rubbed Rachel's belly. Then she popped a weight gain pill into Rachel's mouth. It would lower Rachel's activity levels and metabolism, and increase her hunger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel sat down on the couch, looking greedily at a huge ice-cream sundae sitting on the table in front of her, a spoon in her hand. She dug in, taking huge scoops of the delicious food into her mouth, grinning as she made bigger and bigger inroads into the meal, occasionally getting a quick shiver from the cold dessert she was almost inhaling. As she ate, her stomach began to bulge, rolling over her waistband and pushing at her top; her breasts were jiggling slightly with each mouthful. The sundae had been larger than her head when she started, and she sat back in her chair with a contented look on her mouth as the spoon rattled around in the empty bowl, patting a hand on her jiggling belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her stomach, shook her head, and said to no-one in particular, \u201cI need to be more careful, I'm getting chubby...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of Monica piped in, interrupting her, \u201cDon't be silly, you've got to indulge yourself.\u201d Rachel turned and looked at her friend, noticing that she looked different. Her top was really tight, and her breasts were almost bulging out of it, twice as big as they had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMon, something different about you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, hon, you know you prefer me with bigger tits. Come and have your mid-afternoon snack, it's your favourite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an effort, Rachel pulled herself to her feet and walked into the kitchen, her nose assaulted by the smell of fried food. The kitchen table was so full she thought it was going to collapse, platters filled with every kind of junk food she could imagine. Pizzas, fried chicken, hot dogs, sausages, all of it seeming to ooze fat onto the plate; she could almost feel herself getting fatter just watching it. Monica dropped a huge turreen of fries onto the middle of the table, then pulled out a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour favourite. Fried stuff and cheese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked up, then back down to the food, sitting down at the table and taking a huge bite out of a cheeseburger, her eyes rolling in pleasure as she took the first taste. With another hand she reached out for a fistful of fries and stuffed them in her mouth, moving methodically from one platter to the next. First a dozen burgers jammed into her stomach, then four pizzas, all of them loaded with cheese, tomato and meat. Twenty hot dogs next, one after another, almost swallowed whole, then a fork went jabbing down onto plate after plate as she kept on stuffing, fat running down her double chins onto her food-splattered top. Her belly strained at her trousers, and with a ping, the button flew off, giving her relief as her stomach rolled out onto her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you finished?\u201d, another voice said, and Phoebe bounced in. It was a while before she stopped bouncing; her massive breasts were jiggling in her top, giving Rachel an excellent look at her cleavage. Her eyes almost popped out of her head; her friend was huge now.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my tits. Yeah, I know you fancy me. Hey, want some milkshakes? I've got chocolate, strawberry, banana, vanilla...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled. \u201cOne of each!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Phoebe put a dozen huge jugs of milkshake on the table, each a different flavour, then bounced out of the room, giving a view of her jiggling butt on her way out that made Rachel linger for a second. She grabbed the first jug, pouring it into her mouth, milk streaming out of either side of her mouth and running down her straining top. Another jug almost seemed to leap into her hands as she guzzled it down, less spilling out than before as her stomach rapidly bulged out. With a tearing noise, the side-seams on her top gave out, ripping up to the sleeve, exposing still more of her flabby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I'm a big girl now!\u201d she said, grinning as she guzzled another jug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a familiar whining laugh from behind her, and turned to see Janice walk in, her arms loaded down with bags, wearing a low-cut top that showed off every detail of her massive breasts, a deep cleavage several inches long. Looking at the empty jugs on the table, she tipped the contents of the huge backs onto it, revealing boxes upon boxes of donuts, cakes, and all sorts of other sweet treats. Without waiting, she dived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand was pushing eclair after eclair into her eager mouth, her lips straining for more chocolate and sugar, and another was snatching donuts from the boxes two at a time, the creamy dough making its way into her rapidly expanding belly. She felt herself tiring from the exertion of feeding herself more and more, as the pile of boxes slowly began to disperse, empty wrappings replacing sugary treats. As the last cream puff was tucked away, she sat back on the groaning chair trying to hug her huge belly, unable to get her hands around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStalking into the kitchen, Monica, Phoebe and Janice bounced in, their breasts even bigger than they had been before, looking admiringly at her. Each of them was pushing a trolley loaded down with yet more food \u2013 Monica was pushing an enormous roasted turkey, Phoebe a huge chocolate gateaux that must have been as wide as Rachel's immense flabby stomach, and Janice was pushing a huge jelly, five feet high, with a massive ladel next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked up, \u201cI shouldn't, I'm getting too fat...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe laughed, took a huge scoop of cake and held it under her mouth, \u201cYou know you want too...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoebe was right. She did want to, and she reached out for the cake with her chubby hands, taking huge bites out of it. Around her, the room began to change, the apartment replaced by a more opulent room. She wasn't sitting at the table now, but on a huge, golden throne, almost as big as a divan, but at the rate her figure was expanding, she was going to need something that big soon. With a huge spoon, she shovelled huge pieces of cake into her mouth, barely noticing that the girls had left. Her belly was getting huge, spreading out onto her lap, and her chins wobbled as she ate; to the side was a mirror, and she briefly paused to look at herself, the rolls of fat hanging down, her arms growing plump, ankles expanding into cankles. Then she turned back, and finished her cake. As she took the last bite, Monica bounced back up, pushing another trolley into position in front of Rachel, loaded with junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More fried stuff, and even more cheese,\" she said, and Rachel looked at her transformed friend. She was wearing a dress designed to show off her huge breasts, now sticking out a foot in front of her, and a long slit exposing her leg. For a second, her heart skipped a beat as Monica took a breath and the tops of her tits jiggled, before her attention returned to the table. A hundred cheeseburgers, fried chicken breasts loaded with cheese, a stack of pizzas with sauce and toppings dripping from them, a massive souffl\u00e9 a foot wide as a centrepiece. Her eyes widened, and she reached down for a burger, taking a huge bite as the ketchup hit her lips, stuffing it away. Desperately she reached down for more, but her hands were so slow, and she was so hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her problem, her friend clapped her hands, and from each side Phoebe appeared - or rather, Phoebe and her identical twin sister Ursula. Now transformed, they were seven-foot tall blonde goddesses, their hair a torrent down their backs with glittering tiaras above their eyes, breasts the size of melons bouncing hypnotically as they approached. Each planted a delicate kiss on one of Rachel's cheeks, then reached down and started to bring her the food, tempting morsels to her mouth, their speed rapidly increasing as they competed with Rachel's own greedy hands. The pile of food began to visibly shrink as it made her way into her expanding belly, passing by Rachel's triple chin as her waistline continued to expand. By now she was as wide as she was tall, and as Ursula brought the whole souffl\u00e9 to her waiting lips, she held her massive stomach with her arms, resting back on her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more figures emerged - the mega-busty Janice on one side of the next trolley, Emily, formerly Ross's fiance, on the other side, her breasts threatening to spill out over her ruby top, her expression nothing but awe as she looked at the gluttonous Rachel lounging on her throne, still holding her belly, her face covered in food; Phoebe and Ursula approached again, starting to plant kisses on Rachel to clean her, their tongues licking away chocolate, ketchup and cheese alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast is here,\" Janice said, following it with a grinding laugh that sent her beachball-breasts bouncing, enough that Rachel wished that she would do it again. Towers of waffles covered in fried eggs, stacks of pancakes smothered in syrup, a small mountain of bacon and sausages and a dozen loaves of toast, buried in butter and jam. This time, she didn't even try to reach for the food, and the four women surrounded her, stuffing food into her mouth as she eagerly gulped it down, savouring the sugar and the grease. Her stomach rolled down over her lap now, expanding on either side as her throne began to alarmingly creak, her thoughts limited only to the food entering her belly, bigger and bigger, more and more, a collection of sensations as she watched the four beautiful women stuffing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she paused, the food finished again, and her stomach rumbled disturbingly. She shouldn't be hungry, but she was, and she eagerly awaited the food, but as she looked in the mirror, she was horrified. Surrounded by opulence in what was obviously a palace, five elegant, busty goddesses serving her every whim, she was a huge fat slob sitting on her throne, and tears began to come to her eyes. Then, the image on the mirror faded out, and was replaced with a great and terrible figure. She'd lost none of her weight, but now was wearing a huge, perfectly-fitted golden dress, heaped with precious gems and stones, a silver crown on her head, gleaming with diamonds. Her servants looked around her, beaming, and Monica walked into the room, her breasts preceding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All hail Queen Rachel!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monica woke up the next morning on the couch, the TV blaring some early morning cookery show. She sat up and attempted to brush the crumbs off of her grey sweatshirt with one hand, hitching up the back of her pants with the other. She got up and yawned, the stretching motion causing her pale potbelly to poke out. She gave it a rub and smacked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's coming along nicely.\" She thought to herself, making her way to the bathroom. When she re-emerged, feeling a lot fresher, she saw Rachel was already up and dressed for work, and was pouring herself some cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Rach, I was just about to make some breakfast,\" she smiled, \"how do bacon and eggs sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at her roommate. Standing up, her weight gain was even more obvious, her pudgy potbelly sticking out like she had a basketball under her shirt. Her face was a little rounder too, and while she had never looked to closely before, she reckoned Monica's breasts might have gone up a cup size or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no thanks, I'll just stick with cereal.\" She considered saying something, but bit her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel continued to observe Monica as she prepared her breakfast. When she bent down to grab the frying pan from under the sink, she saw her rear had also gotten a little bigger. After generously coating the pan in butter, the sizzle and smell of bacon began to fill the apartment, and Rachel began to regret her decision of bland cereal with skimmed milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter frying three eggs, Monica transferred the food to a plate and sat down, leaving the pan to soak in the sink. Rachel watched as her friend gleefully tucked into the fatty feast, knife and fork moving like a blur as she packed it away, grease slurping down her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, letting out a small burp and wiping her mouth on her sleeve, Rachel could hold it in no longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica, sweetie, what is happening with you? Ever since you got back from that course you've been eating like a pig, and you've put on more than a few pounds in the process. What's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica felt guilty. She could see that her friend was worried about her, and decided to come clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was at the course, and it was amazing, all these great chefs, with so much experience, people who have worked in the greatest restaurants in the world. And they all have one thing in common. They are all fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was puzzled. \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Monica replied, \"Don't you see? You can't get anywhere in this business unless you're a little heavy, and all the best chefs are total lard asses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Mon, I don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Monica interrupted her. \"Think about it, why do you think I can't get a job in a decent restaurant? You've tried my food, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel hesitated, \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And its amazing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how come the only jobs I can get are in greasy diners and theme restaurants? 'Never trust a skinny chef', my Mom has that embroidered on a pillow. If I want a decent job, I have to put on weight!\" Monica sat back heavily. She had clearly been thinking a lot about this, and had made up her mind. Rachel knew better than to argue with Monica when her mind was made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mon,if you think that this,\" she placed a hand on Monica's bloated stomach, \"Is what you need to succeed, then I'm not going to stop you, at least not until you hit three hundred pounds!\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica laughed and pulled her friend into a hug. \"Thanks Rach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel got up and put her dish in the sink, and grabbed her keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey Rach, do you think I could drop by Bloomingdales later? I could uh, use some new clothes.\" Monica asked, picking at a bit of bacon rind that was caught in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel grinned. \"Maybe something with an elastic waistband?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Assuming she simply lost her balance she went on. She opened her door and walked over to the kitchen, yawning every so often. She grabbed some bowls and started to make breakfast. About half and hour later she heard Rachel grunting and groaning in her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok Rach?\" She called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Her roomate growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get these damn pants to button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try just wearing a belt.

Each stepped caused her butt to bounce. She hated every second of it. Near the end she just grabbed the cheeks to stop them from moving, but that only reminded her of how big they were. She left the building and tried her best to keep her ass from bouncing. Walking on a flat surface introduced her to another effect of her enlarged behind. Is forced her to take on a sway of her hips. Rachel had her hips sway when she walked before, but usually it was a choice she made to get a guys attention. This was not her doing and she didn't like the severity of the swing. She made it to the coffee house and started to work, hoping the job would take her mind off her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked she would bump into tables, brush her butt against customers, and even lost balance and fell. The fall didn't hurt much but only because she fell on her ass. As she worked she could hear people whispering about her. She used to like it when guys admired her body, but today all they talked about was her posterior. She felt like everyone was staring at it. When taking a tray back to the counter she dropped a mug. After a mild curse she bent over pick it up. After receiving a whistle which caused her to blush she heard a far worse noise. <b><i>RIP!!!</i></b> She went pale as she felt a breeze on her backside. Faster than you could blink Rachel was in the bathroom with the door locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!\" She squealed. Her face was red as a tomato and tears were welling in her eyes. She looked at the mirror and slowly rotated. \"Oh my god!\" It wasn't a small tear. Her shorts were torn almost completely down the middle. She stared at the hole as a few tears fell. Was her ass even bigger!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel are you ok?\" A coworker asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she wept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want you can borrow my jacket to wrap around your waist,\" the barista offered. Rachel opened the door enough to take the jacket and used to cover her same. \"Gunther said you can go home if you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Rachel responded. She left the bathroom and went to collect her tips. She took the money and swiftly left. She practically ran to the apartment. Once home she collapsed onto the coach and buried her face. She sulked for hours. She hardly moved for hours. Eventually she shifted and her tips fell out of her pocket. She picked them up and counted the amount. $42.63. Rachel was astounded. She normally only made $30 and that was after a full shift. She looked at her ass and wondered. However, before much thought could be had the door opened.</span></div></div>",

I had to use a bra that was too small for me so the entire day I was uncomfortable. Not to mention they got in the way all the time at work. I almost burnt myself 5 times and got several stains all over my front. And, to top things off, my bra broke half way through my shift. I might as well have not bothered. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with irritated skin. But, the worst part has to be all the staring and whistling. That or the back pain,\" Monica ranted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bad huh?\" Rachel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you? How was your day?\" The busty brunette inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I broke more cups than usual, I nearly knocked over multiple tables, and the piece to resistance...\" Rachel stood and showed Monica the giant rip in her pants. Monica covered her mouth with both hands and gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. That must have been so embarrassing,\" the chef sympathized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the bright side I made $42 in tips,\" The blonde reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In two hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica stopped and stared \"You made $42 in two hours!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, all thanks to this,\" she said and pointed at her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you like it now, or do you still hate it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. We'll see, but if you or I are gonna go to work tomorrow we will need new clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went out and shopped for a few hours receiving many passing comments and whistles. It took them forever to find a size that would fit them. It was very difficult as nothing seemed to want to fit. However, after much effort they both got clothes that fit and were relatively nice looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing we both need to loose weight because after that we won't be able to afford food,\" Monica half joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I can bend over now without have to worry about <i>RIP</i>,\" Rachel said mimicking the sound. She sat on the couch and sighed. \"I'll tell you what, this thing is great for subway and bus seats,\" she bragged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well these, are great for discounts,\" Monica said and lifted them slightly. \"I think I still picked a size to small though,\" she complained as she adjusted her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can that be? They measured you three times,\" Rachel questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They got three different answers each time. I knew I should have gone for the bigger ones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls went to bed with mixed feeling about today, but had hope the next day would be better.</span></div></div>",

If Elizabeth hadn't been quite so naive she may have realized What Rachel was trying to do to her, but alas this wasn't the case. Rachel had formulated her plan to force Elizabeth to get fat, her logic being that Ross wouldn't want to be with a girl who was not only questioningly younger than him but also overweight. The night before Rachel had gone across the hall and told Monica about her plan, asking her to prepare the most fattening foods that she could for the cause. It had been a gamble on Rachel's behalf, but to her relief Monica shared her intense dislike for Elizabeth and was only too happy to help. Rachel smiled evilly as Elizabeth dug into the gigantic greasy breakfast, already thoroughly enjoying herself. Elizabeth forced herself to eat, feeling extremely uncomfortable in her ridiculous attire under Rachel's inscrutable stare. At the half way point she felt incredibly full and had no choice but too halt, almost falling out of her chair due to her fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhr...\" She groaned miserably, looking a little green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Asked Rachel, sounding extremely unappeased \"That's seriously the best you can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hic!...

So... Whats your view on your brothers girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... Elizabeth?\" Monica said, sounding a little bewildered at the random question \"She's ok... I guess... Perhaps a little young for Ross though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Monica\" Said Rachel putting her hands on her hips \"I know you can't stand her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay!\" Said Monica \"I don't like her...

Rachel turned to Monica and grinned as she turned the handle on the door to her own apartment, allowing the door to swing open. Elizabeth froze where she stood like a rabbit in headlights, her cheeks flushing from embarrassment as Monica stared at her in complete amazement. There was a long uncomfortable silence as Monica stared at her brothers girlfriend dressed in her cute little maids outfit, too bewildered to speak. A smile then played across Monica's face, which was a mirror image of the smile Rachel had had on her face all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!\" Monica roared, finally cracking up \"Oh my God! You look ridiculous little Lizzybeth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right!\" Said Rachel, squeezing Elizabeth's glowing cheek, who stood there looking mortified \"And things get even better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then explained her whole dastardly plan involving fattening Elizabeth up against her will so that Ross would lose interest in her (She made no attempt to lower her voice either, so Elizabeth heard everything). Elizabeth was wide eyed in horror at what she was hearing and her mouth hung agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a very good idea\" Said Monica thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right\" Said Rachel, sounding pleased with herself \"Don't you agree Elizabeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeths lip quivered as she struggled to find words, the sudden revelation that she was being forced to become fat leaving her dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Elizabeth\" Said Monica, clearly enjoying herself as much as Rachel was \"You want us to fatten you up don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I...\" Stammered Elizabeth desperately before finally realizing it was hopeless \"I'd like that very much... I'd love for you both to fatten me up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Rachel in a business like tone \"Get back to work then... Monica please join me in the kitchen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day Elizabeth dusted the apartment with her feather duster while Monica baked a huge variety of cakes and desserts. While Elizabeth worked Rachel approached her with a large tray of ginger bread looking positively gleeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide!\" Said Rachel happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth gloomily complied and Rachel began cramming the ginger bread roughly into her mouth. The one and only bright point for Elizabeth (though it was a very minor one due to the situation she found herself in) was how delicious the fattening cakes were and she savoured the taste as she was forced to eat them. When Rachel had forced her to eat the entire tray she brushed the crumbs off her maids outfit as Elizabeth let out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk\" Said Rachel looking stern \"Where are your manners piggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhr... Pardon me ma'am\" Said Elizabeth quietly, feeling rather full again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better... Now back to work my piggy maid\" Said Rachel patting Elizabeth patronizingly on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process went on all day, with Monica preparing the food and Elizabeth being stuffed with it as she worked by Rachel. Elizabeth could feel her bloated belly pushing against the fabric of her silly outfit as she was forced to consume more and more cakes and confectionaries. Towards the end of the day Elizabeth was so full that she could barely stand, and she staggered around the apartment groaning as she dusted half heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh Elizabethhh\" Sang Monica and Rachel in unison from the kitchen \"Come hereee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed miserably and let out a little burp as she complied and staggered over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wiiide!\" They both sang together and Elizabeth groaned, the fatigue showing in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth opened her mouth groggily and Rachel and Monica immediately grabbed a freshly backed danish each and stuffed it in. Elizabeth chewed and swallowed with some difficulty, as her stomach felt so full and heavy already with food but she wasn't given the option to stop as Rachel and Monica were already cramming in the next piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Monica\" Said Rachel with mock concern as she stuffed another danish into Elizabeths mouth \"You forgot to put the icing on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness your right Rachel!\" Replied Monica in the same tone \"We can't have Elizabeth missing out on the icing goodness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeths eyes were half closed as she swallowed the mouth full of cake that she'd been force fed, when suddenly Monica stuffed the nozzle end of a pastry bag into her mouth. Elizabeths glazed expression was quickly replaced by that of wide eyed shock as Monica squeezed the bag and warm liquid icing was forced into her mouth making her cheeks bulge stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murrffshh?!\" Elizabeth squealed as Monica gleefully squeezed more and more icing down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeths swollen stomach groaned and the fabric on the front of her maid outfit creaked as it tightened over it while Monica squeezed more and more of the fattening mixture into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She attracted many funny looks on her way home due to the fact that she was still dressed in her ridiculous maids outfit, but she tried not to think about it and hurried back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Elizabeth awoke and rubbed the sleep from her eyes. When her head had cleared she instinctively felt her stomach which had been stuffed to the seams the day before to see if she could feel any obvious signs of weight gain. She frowned as she stroked the silky smooth flesh of her stomach, trying to decide if it did actually feel softer than it had done before Rachel and Monica had had their way with her yesterday but she couldn't be sure. She knew she had to be back at Rachel's apartment soon so she hurried to the bathroom and gulped before she stood on the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... these scales are wrong... They have to be wrong\" She thought to herself as she saw the needle land on '130 lbs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday she had been just over 120 pounds, which was admittedly below her ideal weight for her height... but to gain ten pounds in one day truly horrified her. She examined her stomach again in the mirror, trying a side on view and noticing that there was in fact the very slightest bump of a belly there. She moaned mournfully at the sight of the weight she'd been forced to gain before once again donning her stupid maid uniform and leaving the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel opened the door and regarded the defeated looking maid standing before her with a beaming smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there\" She said \"Come on in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good ma'am...\" Elizabeth mumbled miserably and stepped over the threshold into the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she saw Monica stood in the kitchen, exhibiting the same beaming smile as Rachel and next to her was a huge stack of buttered pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in\" Said Monica handing Elizabeth a fork which Elizabeth took gulping nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica pulled out the stool for Elizabeth to sit on and Elizabeth rearranged the dress of her maids outfit as she sat in. Elizabeth sighed as she took her first bite of the gigantic stack and as she ate Rachel placed a large glass of what appeared to be orange juice in front of her. Elizabeth sipped the suspicious beverage through a curly straw, which was in fact a very powerful weight gain mixture as she worked her way through her fattening breakfast. Elizabeth could feel Rachel and Monica standing behind her, and this inspired her to keep eating past the feeling of fullness because she knew what would happen if she stopped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Open wide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? ULP!!?\" Exclaimed Elizabeth, caught completely off guard as Monica crammed a large donut into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth still felt incredibly full from breakfast, but never the less was forced to consume a box of donuts Monica had been hiding. After five donuts had been forced past her lips, Elizabeth uttered a small burp and collapsed onto the sofa breathing heavily and holding her taut, gurgling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think your doing?\" Said Rachel severely, glaring at the panting Elizabeth \"Get to work you lazy idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith considerable effort Elizabeth pulled herself back up to her feet, groaning miserably as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhr... Hic!... Very good ma'am... Urp!\" She mumbled quietly before she picked up her pink feather duster and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter yesterday Elizabeth was a little more used to working whilst feeling unbearably full, but even so she wasn't particularity graceful as she stumbled around the apartment in a vague attempt to clean it. Just as she suspected Monica was already in the kitchen busying herself in preparing a large feast consisting of a large variety baked confections, which she miserably tried to ignore as she worked. It wasn't long however (or certainly not long enough) before she found herself accosted by Rachel and Monica, who roughly shoved her onto the couch when her back was turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch timeeeee!!\" They both sang gleefully and Elizabeth gulped in fear as she rearranged the skirt of her maids outfit to hide her exposed underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next could only be described as a food bombardment as Rachel and Monica crammed as much food into the poor young beautys mouth as humanly possible. Elizabeth groaned as Rachel forced a huge homemade Danish into her mouth, followed by a generous swig of orange flavoured weight gain mixture, her stomach still having not completely digested her sizeable breakfast from earlier. She felt full pretty quickly, her stomach bloated and uncomfortably pushing against the tight bow around the midsection of her maids outfit but she was not given the option to stop eating. Elizabeth was obviously starting to fade as she was force fed, as her eyes drooped and her head lolled weakly. It reached the point that Monica had to hold her head steady as Rachel crammed in whatever homemade confectionery she happened to be holding, as Elizabeth let out the occasional burp or groan to show she was still conscious. After every pastry, cake or pudding that Elizabeth swallowed a funnel was put in her mouth and a large mouthful of the weight gain drink was poured down it into her helpless mouth. When the feeding whirlwind had finally finished Elizabeth's eyes were fully closed and her head rested on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhr... Urrrpp!\" She exclaimed weakly as she slowly succumbed to her food coma and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy moly\" Said Monica in awe as her finger traced around Elizabeth's full belly, causing her to squirm in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's belly was very obviously bulging outward against her outfit, to the point that the bow around her waist looked very close to ripping off entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pregnant you greedy pig\" Rachel whispered in Elizabeths ear as she stroked her groaning stomach tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The way the door to the apartment was only half open blocked Elizabeth from view for Phoebe, as she was currently groggily stumbling around dusting with her feather duster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Rachel finally, as a strange awkward silence was growing between them \"Here's the thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel explained the whole situation to Phoebe, whose expression was looking rather shocked and bewildered. When she had finished her explanation she pulled the door open fully to reveal Elizabeth as she busied herself with cleaning, her obviously bloated belly growling unhappily under her sexy French maids outfit. Phoebe couldn't quite believe what she had heard, believing that her friends were somehow playing a bizarre and elaborate joke on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?

Phoebe had pulled a box of oreo cookies from the top cupboard and was lofting them meaningfully, and Elizabeth groaned before obediently opening her mouth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day was hard going, especially with three tormentors rather than two. What made it worse about her third tormentor was her general scatter brain approach to feeding. Monica and Rachel were regimented, feeding her at certain intervals but then allowing her to go about her maid duties, Phoebe on the other hand just would not leave her alone. As Elizabeth stumbled around trying to dust and clean, already unbearably full, Phoebe was right behind her cramming whatever food she could find into her exhausted mouth. While cleaning the bath tub, Phoebe had shoved her roughly into it leaving her sitting in it too tired to get back up. Phoebe had then emptied two cans of calorific squirty cream into her mouth, which Elizabeth had somehow managed to swallow with great difficulty. By the end of it, Elizabeth looked like she was approaching the end of pregnancy, so incredibly huge her swollen belly now was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow\" Commented Monica in awe as probed the substantial bulge at Elizabeth's mid section, which was pressing tightly against her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Phoebe\" Said Rachel \"You really fed this cow to the limit... Isn't that right Elizabeth? I think you should tell Phoebe how good a job she's done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhrrrraaaaarppppp!!\" Exclaimed Elizabeth, far to weak to suppress it \"Yes... Hiccoughhhhh... you've fattened me up nicely, thank you ma'am... urhhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was breathing heavily, her eyes closed as she groaned miserably where she lay on the coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\" Said Phoebe, looking at Elizabeth's cell phone \"Look what we have here... The little piggie just got a message from Ross!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica and Rachel crowded round the phone in interest, as Elizabeth blearily half opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, have made reservations to that fancy new restaurant downtown. See you at 8 love Ross\" Read Monica \"Now this is an interesting development, don't you think girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Phoebe clearly agreed and Elizabeth look afraid at what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's worked hard the past few days\" Said Rachel, taking Elizabeth by surprise \"Despite her disgusting gluttony and weight gain... Maybe she deserves a night to let her hair down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was nonplussed as Monica and Phoebe nodded in agreement at this, and she began to think maybe there was still hope for her though she still expected a horrible catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first things first\" Said Phoebe \"Shall we see how much she's gained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a murmur of agreement Elizabeth was hoisted back to her feet and shoved into the bathroom and onto the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"137\" Announced Monica \"Seven pounds... Not too bad, but I'd really like to get it to an even 140 before her date... Don't you agree girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed sadly to herself as Rachel and Phoebe left, only to return a few minutes later with trays of sweet pastries, cans of whipped cream and a few protein shakes. Elizabeth was made to stand on the scales, the weight read out of which Monica kept a close eye on as Rachel and Phoebe gleefully stuffed her silly. Elizabeth could already feel her insanely full tummy pushing tightly against the fabric of her maid outfit, but as even more fattening foods was forced into it the material really began to strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrpp... Please...\" Came Elizabeth's weary, barely audible voice as she swallowed a huge mouthful of cake and whipped cream \"Shoo full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lil Lizzybeth\" Crooned Monica \"I'm going to really need you to stop slacking off and hit your gluttony into high gear here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeths response was muffled by a hiccough, and Rachel and Phoebe offered no respite at all. Monica watched as the needle on the scale slowly rose, from 137 to 138 to 139 and finally (with commendable effort on Elizabeth's part) to 140. Almost on cue of Elizabeth reaching this unwanted goal, a slow ripping and popping sound was heard which indicated several of the seams of her outfit giving up their battle of the bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl!\" Said Monica, giving Elizabeth a hearty pat on her sore belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth instinctively pulled away from the touch as her full tummy was a rather tender area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw is your tummy a little sore?\" Crooned Phoebe \"I hope you've saved room for dinner\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was beyond communicating in any way other than moaning miserably at the moment so the girls helped her from the scale back to the living room. As she walked she could feel her maid outfit pinch uncomfortably at the key areas where she knew the extra weight from her daily feedings was settling (that apparently being her belly and breasts), and she wondered mournfully if Ross would notice the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you have a little nap baby?\" Said Rachel, as they lowered her onto the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth obliged and fell asleep almost instantly, her stomach groaning as it digested the incredible amount of food she had consumed that day. As she slumbered peacefully her three tormentors gazed over her happily, seemingly pleased with her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan for her date?\" Asked Phoebe with excitement \"I've got a few ideas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica and Rachel looked at each other, smiling darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a few ourselves\" Said Monica \"Firstly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, Monica and Phoebe now discussed their plans in great detail as Elizabeth slumbered, the poor girl having no idea what was in store for her next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The bloated, tautness of her overstuffed belly was gone, replaced (to her dismay) by the bulge of a soft pot belly which was accentuated by her tight uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez\" Said Rachel \"Someones looking a little fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah look at that chubby belly haha!\" Exclaimed Phoebe happily, prodding the soft flesh and feeling her finger sink into it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed, looking down at her lap completely mortified.

'Attempted' was the key word, as no matter how Elizabeth pulled and tugged and twisted she just could not get the elegant sexy dress on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk\" Said Monica \"I think somebody needs to lay off the pies a little of they expect to fit into something like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barb stung, as before this awful ordeal Elizabeth knew the dress who have fit like a sexy glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw can't you get it on?\" Crooned Phoebe, seeing the morose expression on Elizabeths face \"Why do you think that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm too fat ma'am\" She answered dejectedly \"I'm just a fat mess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very true\" Said Monica \"But have no fear, I have just the answer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a corset from the closet and brandished it at her, before beginning to pull it over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now suck it in and think skinny thoughts tubby\" Said Phoebe, as all three of them grabbed at the lace ties at the back and yanked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sucked her tummy in as far as it would go and as she did she felt the corset constrict her, pulling her in even further. The girls were not gentle, as they were using all their might to pull the corset in as much as possible and once they had they tied it tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better\" Said Rachel \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't... Huff... Breath\" Answered Elizabeth, wincing at how tight the corset was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's any conciliation\" Said Phoebe \"Its given you a nice rack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was referring to Elizabeths glorious bosom, which bulged above the corset as more weight was forced into her breasts. The dress was now pulled on over the corset, and despite how much she'd been pulled in it still sat a little snug over her belly (And incredibly snug over her tits).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's about as good as it's going to get for you\" Said Rachel, rather sadistically \"Put this on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the ear piece in Elizabeths palm, who looked at it quizzically between winces of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be speaking to you throughout your date\" Said Rachel, her tone rather dangerous \"And whatever we tell you to do, you will do without question. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Under different circumstances Elizabeth would have loved being here with Ross, wearing her sexy black dress which showed off her amazing figure to all. She blushed self consciously as she entered, feeling the uncomfortable girdle sucking her belly in as she was lead to her table where Ross was sat waiting. His eyes noticeably widened at the sight of her as she looked incredible in her dress, especially with her large heaving cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Said Elizabeth, giving as convincing a smile as she could as Ross stood and kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the chair out for her and Elizabeth sat, though she was careful as her girdle creaked. A waiter then joined them, asking politely if they would like anything to drink at which point a familiar voice sounded through her ear piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask for a chocolate milkshake\" Said Monica \"Ah heck, make it two hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a glass of your best red\" Said Ross semi showing off, before seeing the price of it \"Actually make that the 2nd best...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice sir\" Said the waiter \"And for you madam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Um... I'll have\" Said Elizabeth nervously, very aware at how stupid she'd look ordering two chocolate milkshakes in this fancy restaurant \"Two... Chocolate milkshakes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And make them extra large\" Said Monica gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And can I get those um... Extra large\" Said Elizabeth, going red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm yes of course\" Said the waiter confused \"If that is what you want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's quite a drink order there\" Said Ross in equal confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I'm just... Y'know... Thirsty i guess\" Explained Elizabeth rather lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss decided it best not to pursue the issue and soon the waiter brought their drink order to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now drink both of them before the waiter returns for your food order\" Said Rachel, gleefully joining the fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed, but nevertheless put both of the straws of the very large chocolate milkshakes into her mouth and started slurping away. She tried to ignore Ross's judging looks and focused on finishing both of the fattening shakes before the waiter returned. When the waiter did return he was dumbfounded to find that this petite (the girdle was hiding her extra chub) young lady had already finished both milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp\" She exclaimed, unable to stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order two more\" Said Phoebe \"And for your starter... Hmm... Ask your waiter which is the most fattening\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled awkwardly at the waiter, trying to find a better way to phrase the question but failing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have, um, another two of those please hicc\" She said quietly, clearly embarrassed \"And... What is the... Um... Most fattening starter you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter raised an eyebrow, wondering where this beautiful, though very greedy young lady was going with this. He told her the dish, which was a selection of fried finger foods but explained it was meant for two people rather than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's for Two people?\" Said Phoebe \"Well you'd better only get four of them... You should watch your figure fatass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sounds of her tormentors laughing in her ear, Elizabeth gulped as she turned back to the wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will have... Four of those please\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss looked flabbergasted at this as the waiter gave him a confused look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Elizabeth?\" He said carefully \"That's a lot of food... I'm not sure we can eat all that and have another two courses...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth heard Phoebe in her ear again, and knew she was telling her what to say in response word for word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its all for me Ross\" She said, struggling to make eye contact \"I'm... A greedy piggie who needs to be fed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part she said under her breath so Ross heard just little enough for there to be reasonable doubt that she had just referred to herself as 'a greedy piggie'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" He said awkwardly \"I'll just have the goat cheese tartlet... And maybe another glass... A large glass of the red\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth knew the awkward atmosphere that was developing between her and her boyfriend was because of her actions, and she really hoped she didn't drive him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pair sat in an awkward silence as Elizabeth slurped away greedily on her second large double milk shake order. When they were done, Elizabeths huge starters arrived and her eyes widened in horror at the sight of the mountains of fried food. Ross looked dumbstruck also as, desperately avoiding his judging gaze, Elizabeth dug in. Rachel, Monica and Phoebe now left her to it, while they decided where the evening should go from this point. Elizabeth groaned as she felt her expanding belly struggling against the tight, ungiving embrace of her girdle. The pair ate in silence, which was punctuated only by the odd hiccup or stifled burp from Elizabeth as she made her way through her titanic starters. Ross had finished his meager tartlett just before Elizabeth had finished her first starter, at which point he cleared his throat to finally say something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Do you need some help with... All that?\" He asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to this Elizabeth listened to more orders from her oppressors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks\" She Whispered dejectedly \"I need to eat it all if I want to become a big fat cow\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss couldn't believe his ears as Elizabeth went back to her monstrous meal. The silence grew again, much more uncomfortable than last time as she ate and ate, finished her second plateful and moving onto the final one. She could feel her girdle reaching breaking point as it struggled with all its might to contain her growing proportions, and with her first bite of starter number three a low creaking groan could be heard from the material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what was that?\" Asked Ross, having heard the miserable groan from her girdle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its my girdle\" Replied Elizabeth, repeating the words being said to her \"I'm such a fat loser i need it to keep by disgusting flab sucked in... But it sounds like I'm becoming too fat to be contained!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Elizabeth took another bite which caused the low creaking to grow more audible until... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap!! Pop!! Snapp!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bindings on her girdle could contain her no longer and they each popped open allowing her belly to surge out a few inches. As she was sat close to the table, her belly collided with it causing it to shake and Ross's glass of wine to spill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops sorry Ross\" Stammered Elizabeth, crimson with embarrassment as she heard voices in her ear again \"... I'm sorry I'm such a fat piggie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Don't worry it's fine\" Replied Ross unconvincingly as he dabbed at the wine on his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth wanted this to end, it was like a bad dream, she really liked Ross but felt powerless over the situation. Meekly she carried on with her starter, somehow managing to finish it after a few minutes dogged determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\"I think you should show off your new body to Ross\"* Said Rachel evilly into her eat *\"Give him a good show off what a fatass his girlfriend has become\"*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed, stifling a weary burp as she slowly struggled to her feet, having to pull her exposed cute belly free from the table as she went. When she stood she took a deep breath, trying to sum up the energy necessary to humiliate herself even more in front of Ross. She put her hand on her hip and tried to strike a sexy pose for him, making sure her belly was the main focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What do you think of me now Ross?\" She said timely, as she posed for a side on view of her bloated belly \"Doesn't my fat disgust you? Look at my dis... Disgusting fat belt... I'm such a pathetic fat piglet... How could you possibly have feelings for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss watched the insane display in complete disbelief, as Elizabeth flaunted her buddha belly in his face. As he did  he felt himself becoming rather aroused by the display, as this was a secret kink which aligned very closely with the current situation. However, he didn't want to play his cards too soon, or at least not until he could determine what 'this' was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Um... He said, struggling with words \"Of course i have feelings for you... Your a very beautiful woman... Who cares if you put on a few pounds? It looks very good on you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked completely shocked by Ross's reaction, expecting a highly negative one. For the first time in what felt like a very long time Elizabeth felt a flutter of hope. She wasn't the only one who was shocked by this, as Rachel, Monica and Phoebe were now sat in a furious silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

In her ear piece she heard her three tormentors break their silence, and she gulped fearfully at their grim words on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK bitch\" Said Phoebe dangerously \"I guess it's game in then... let's show dear Ross just how much of a disgusting fast loser his girlfriend really is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom\" Ordered Monica \"We have a surprise waiting for you there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ermm.. please excuse me...\" Said the bloated young beauty, rising from her chair just as the next portion of her meal arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrible trio clearly heard this as they saw the opportunity to further humiliate the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recall telling you stop eating you fat bitch\" Said Phoebe cruelly \"Tell them to feed you as you go get your present\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeths lip quivered but she knew better than to argue or disobey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... could you guys like... erm... feed me...\" Elizabeth said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder\" Ordered Rachel \"Make sure Ross hears you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem... I'd like you guys to feed me!\" She said much louder, causing other patrons to turn and look at her \"Stuff my fat ugly face please! I'm a greedy fat pig loser! And I want to become a big obese cow!! Feed meee!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff all looked at Ross who merely returned their look of confusion, leading them to shrug and comply with the strange request. Elizabeth began to walk towards the rest rooms so the staff turned to follow her. The beautiful blonde tried to walk with as much dignity as possible, just as the first forkfuls of the gigantic course of food made its way into her mouth. They began quite slowly, even delicately, but clearly the speed of Elizabeths munching and swallowing was not enough for her listening tormentors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat faster you fat bitch\" Demanded Phoebe, who was definitely proving herself to be the harshest and most relentless of the 3 \"Tell them to feed you faster, all that food needs to be gone before you get to the restroom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed at the complete lack of any reprieve, knowing this would likely be her life for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me faster\" She Demanded,  so that the watching customers could hear her \"You've got to stuff my fat face faster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff shrugged again before bombarding her with food, practically shoving it down her throat. Any dignity she had attempted to hang onto completely vanished as she staggered vaguely in the direction of the restroom, a constant avalanche of food knocking her off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Munch munch urrrp ulppp!!\" She exclaimed as the force of the feeding intensified \"Hiccurrrp!!! Ulppp!!! Mrrrffff!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProgress was understandbly slow as she chewed and swallowed whatever was forced past her lips, her bloated tummy becoming more prominent as it swelled with food, causing stress lines on the tight fabric of her sexy dress. Ross watched on in disbelief, wondering how far Elizabeth was going to take this... though not knowing she had no say in the matter. He could see her sexy short dress spread tightly over and riding up her decidedly more pert and meaty looking rear end, revealing tight panties beneath which he couldn't drag his gaze from. Eventually the poor girl reached the rest rooms on the other side of the restaurant, but it had been an arduous journey and several seams on her skin tight dressed had ripped (mainly alongside her bountiful bloated belly). As she stumbled through the doorway and out of sight Ross suddenly felt self conscious, and decided to reflect the other patrons looks of shocked disgust, rather than looking quite so excited by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhrrr braawrrp!!\" Exclaimed Elizabeth, so stuffed that standing under her own (increased) weight was difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shambled past the open cubicles until she saw one containing a bag, with her name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was inside?</span></div></div>",

Ross, and his fellow diners, now watched as Elizabeth slowly stumbled back towards his table as the restaurant staff continued to feed her relentlessly. A few more seams gave up their ghost on her journey back, her expanding body becoming to large to be contained by such a sexy little dress. Of course Ross's cruel sister couldnt resist but press the button on the sex pantie remote, and as Ross watched his stunning young girlfriends slow approach (the unrelenting feeding from the waiters making it very slow indeed), she suddenly jolted and squealed which caused a tear across her growing rear end. A few of the less compassionate diners began to laugh quite openly at the poor girl, which caused Elizabeth to blush even deeper just as her next helping was forced down her throat. Ross watched as this same scenario played out a few more time, each time his young gorgeous ever growing girlfriend giving a louder squeal when her panties suddenly vibrated against her clit. By the time she'd made it back poor Elizabeth weighed in at an even 150 pounds. With a long lethargic burp she sat down, feeling that she was now moist, and her sexy black dress was barely maintaining its integrity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Ashley gulped, her beautiful, dark eyes widened in fear as she awaited her fate. Lauren was the school bully, she stood about 6 feet tall with rather hairy bulky forearms and extremely mean countenance. Despite the fact that Lauren was a girl, it wasn't just girls who feared her as she had proven many times that she would target anybody, regardless of gender. Recently her and Ashley had become 'acquainted' when Lauren overheard Ashley making some very choice comments about Laurens rather ogre-ish looks, something which Ashley really had been made to regret the past few weeks. She had been stuffed in her locker, and completely humiliated in front of her friends on numerous occasions and her friends were beginning to give Ashley a wide berth, just to protect themselves from the retribution of Lauren. Worst of all Ashley couldn't even tell anybody with authority about it, because Laurens father was very well connected in the penal system and she had made it very clear that if Ashley were to tell she would make sure that her fathers (Uncle Phil) career would suffer. Lauren advanced on poor little Ashley and she cowered expecting some kind of physical retribution, but to her surprise none came. Instead Lauren just smiled at her, something which Ashley found even more terrifying that the prospect of physical pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ashley\" Said Lauren, her gravelly voice sounding all the more sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... hi\" Said Ashley meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose your wondering why I haven't beat your sniveling ass into the ground yet?\" Said Lauren conversationally as if she were discussing the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't respond and simply stared timidly at her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me tell you...\" Said Lauren, \"I've decided a better way to get back at you for what you said about me... Would you like to know what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Ashley said nothing and Lauren smiled widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhats Laurens plan?</span></div></div>",

You have pretty much every guy in the school slavering after you, and every girl wanting to be you!\" Lauren said triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was looking very scared now, not knowing where Lauren was going with this and Lauren noticed and looked even more \ttriumphant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" She said in a matter of fact tone, \"I plan to take that away from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...?\" Came Ashleys pitifully weak response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's simple\" Said Lauren, \"You know my father don't you? You know what I could get him to do if I asked? Your fathers career would be finished, and I wonder how much longer you'd stay at that lovely home of yours without his paycheck, hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren laughed when she saw Ashley once more look meekly at her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the ultimatum is simple\" Said Lauren, \"If you want to save your fathers career you will gain weight on purpose! Every day at school I will meet you before your first lesson, and I will weigh you on the scales in the gymnasium. Your goal is to gain at the very least a pound a day, failure to do so will result in a punishment. You will always do whatever I tell you to do and you will also not breath a word of this to anybody... Oh and I don't want to see you wearing loose clothes to try and hide your weight either, you will wear what you usually do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren spoke Ashley could feel her eyes brimming with tears at what was going to happen to her, but still she said nothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say Ashley?\" Mocked Lauren, \"Are we in agreement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't speak for awhile as she desperately tried to think of a way out of the situation but none came to her. In order to protect her fathers and familys livelihood should would have to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Came the weak shaky voice of Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Said Lauren beaming, \"I shall meet you at lunch then! I'm sure you've got quite an appetite today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Lauren patted Ashley on the head and strolled off down the hall looking thoroughly pleased with herself, leaving poor Ashley standing alone with the thoughts of her predicament hanging heavily over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She kept examining her amazing body and imagining what it would be like once Lauren had had her way with her.. It didn't bare thinking about. Ashley got up gloomily from her desk and walked from the classroom with her head hanging. As soon as she entered the hallway she saw Lauren leaning against a nearby locker; waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello Ashley\" She said evilly, \"Would you like to get some lunch with me? I bet your starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley grit her teeth as she responded, \"Yes Lauren I'd love to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren put her arm around Ashley and led her away to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw don't worry Ashley\" Said Lauren squeezing Ashleys dainty cheek, \"I'm sure you'll feel much better after something to eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 entered the cafeteria and found that they were first in line. Lauren grabbed 2 trays and told Ashley to do the same so she obeyed and they approached the food counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Lauren thoughtfully, examining the food options \"What shall we have I wonder... ah here we go\" She said, and began piling donuts and muffins onto one of the trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleys eyes widened at the amount of food Lauren expected her to consume and as she did Lauren glanced over at her reading her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only the beginning my dear\" She said darkly, \"Start filling your trays now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to test Laurens patience (which was notoriously short) Ashley meekly obeyed and started grabbing food from the counter and adding it to her tray. When each girl had one tray full of pastries and cakes, Lauren approached the woman behind the counter dragging Ashley with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Said the perplexed woman as she eyed up all the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no my dear woman\" Said Lauren, \"I would also like one of those, one of those, five of those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was pointing to things on the blackboard menu behind the very confused lady, while Ashley stared into space looking forlorn. By the end of it the 2 trays were stacked with extremely fattening foods. There were 8 huge slices of pizza, 5 burgers, mountains of chips, 2 huge milkshakes, and a whole lot of other assorted fattening items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Said the lady, in some state of shock due to the amount of food that she had been asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Said Lauren, \"I think that will do for now.. Ashley pay the woman, I'll get us some seats\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley groaned as she looked at the mountains of food. So not only was Lauren going to fatten her up, but she also had to pay for it? Ashley thought angrily to herself, but said nothing and paid the woman. She then grabbed her own mountainous trays of food and gloomily joined Lauren at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then fatty\" Said Lauren playfully, \"Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley glared at Lauren, but picked up a donut and began to eat. As she ate heads were turning when people began to notice the strange scene, as Ashley wasn't exactly known for having a big appetite. Ashley finished the first donut with as much dignity as she could and picked up a slice of pizza while Lauren watched in glee. The slice of pizza was huge and was piled high with toppings but Ashley ate on regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to eat faster than that piggy\" Crooned Lauren, \"Lunch is only an hour, and you have a lot of food to get through\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley grunted a response through a mouthful of pizza, but obeyed and began to eat quicker. People were watching in amazement now as Ashley finished the huge slice of pizza and Lauren handed her a large burger which Ashley obligingly took and wolfed down in seconds. Nobody approached however due to a collective fear of Lauren but they began to whisper to each other as they watched the gluttonous beauty. Ashley next tackled the two huge milkshakes, which she gulped on greedily and within ten minutes both had disapeared into her stomach without much trouble (although due to the speed she had consumed them, Ashley got the hiccups). After devouring another huge burger Ashley was definitely starting to feel very full indeed as she groaned and rubbed her tummy which looked a little bloated and was pushing uncomfortably against her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be getting full yet piggy\" Lauren said, \"Just look at all this!\" And indicated all the food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stifled a burp, still trying to maintain what little dignity she had and gloomily grabbed another burger and forced herself to eat it. After that Lauren pushed the remaining three burgers toward Ashley grinning evilly. Ashley groaned as she picked up yet another burger and bit into it, getting sauce around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on pick up the pace\" Said Lauren impatiently as Ashley visibly slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Hic!&gt; It's really hard &lt;uhhh&gt;\" Moaned Ashley, who was starting to breath heavily as she let out a burp that she didn't have the strength to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning Lauren snatched the remains of the burger from Ashley limp hand and roughly rammed it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MFFFFF\" Moaned Ashley as she was forced to consume the rest of the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what I said about doing as I say?\" Said Lauren in a very sinister tone, \"I meant it.. Now eat you little bitch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley swallowed the burger and burped again as she forced herself to reach for another burger. She ate it as fast as she could, but she felt close to bursting now and she rubbed her bloated stomach as even more food was forced into it. After that burger she was really breathing heavily and she shifted uncomfortably in her seat as Lauren pushed the final burger toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this one, i'll let you stop\" Said Lauren, \"But you will take the rest of this home with you and will finish it before tomorrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Huff puff&gt; thank you &lt;Uhhhh... URPPP!&gt;\" Came Ashleys weak response, as she forced herself into a sitting position (which really made her realize how tight her skirt and t-shirt top were against her bloated tummy) and grabbed the final burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned wearily as she raised it to her mouth and took a bite. It took her ten minutes to finally finish the immense burger and after she had she collapsed back into the chair with relief and exhaustion. Lauren lent forward and rubbed Ashleys very full looking tummy and Ashley moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good indeed piggy\" Said Lauren, \"I must admit, I'm amazed you managed so much..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley burped again and Lauren laughed as she began the process of wrapping up the remaining food and putting it in Ashleys bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to see you before you go home tonight, and I want you to have eaten all of this food by then\" She said as Ashley slouched uncomfortably in her seat, her eyes closed and her stomach emitting gurgling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The cafeteria slowly emptied around Ashley as she sat there groaning and rubbing her full tummy, and despite the fact numerous people had been watching Ashley pig out earlier, nobody came over to her due to their collective fear of Lauren. The cafeteria was now empty and Ashley realized she was going to be late to her lesson if she stayed here much longer. With some difficulty she pulled herself to her feet, letting out a large unladylike *BELCH!* as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh &lt;Hic&gt;\" She moaned as she grabbed her rucksack (which was full of the left over food Ashley didn't consume) and weakly shuffled from the cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Ashley's class was fairly close so she wasn't late, and as she entered the class a few classmates stared at her bloated stomach which pushed out against her top and skirt. Ashley slumped in her chair and managed to stifle another burp as she did so. She groggily opened her bag in front of her to see how much Lauren expected her to eat and her eyes widened in horror. Her bag was stuffed to the brim with donuts and other pastries, as well as large slices of pizza and chips, and Ashley couldn't see how it would be possible for her to finish half of it.. Let alone without anybody else noticing in class. Ashley's teacher then entered the classroom which drew the rest of the classes attention. Ashley forced herself to take advantage of the brief distraction and grabbed a couple of donuts from her bag. The food from earlier had gone done a bit by now, but even so her body moaned in protest as she hurriedly wolfed down the two sticky treats. As she finished the 2nd and rubbed her taut groaning stomach (which stuck out a good few inches now) the lesson began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Whenever the coast was clear she'd hurriedly cram as much food as possible into her mouth, groaning quietly as she did so due to the discomfort she was feeling. By the 4th donut she was feeling incredibly full again, and her speed of consumption had dropped dramatically. This didn't stop her however because she was terrified about what Lauren would do if Ashley failed to meet her outrageous food quota. Ashley nibbled groggily on a large danish she had just taken from her rucksack and as she did so she undid the button on the top of her skirt as it was digging uncomfortably into her cute bloated belly. She breathed a sigh of relief as her tummy expanded another inch outward, thankful for the new space. Ashley finally finished the huge danish and lay back in her chair feeling exhausted. As she did so she was unable to prevent herself letting out a large *BURRRRRP!!* and suddenly all eyes in the class turned to her at once. A few students began to laugh at the young beauty that had made the impressive noise and Ashley flushed with deep embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Banks\" Said the rather haughty teacher, her eyes narrowed at the groaning form of Ashley, \"Can you leave your piggish exclamations till after my lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blushed deeply and replied timidly and groggily \"&lt;Uhh&gt; Yes ma'am &lt;Hic&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher glared at her in mild disgust for a few more moments until returning her attention to the black board and the class room went quiet again. Ashley glanced at the clock and realized she only had about half an hour left of her lesson, which meant half an hour for her to finish the mountainous amount of food in her bad. With reckless abandon now she grabbed one of the pizza slices and forced herself to eat it quickly despite her stomachs grumbling protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her teacher fortunately didn't seem to notice however and the class was dismissed.

Either you eat all of the food now, or tomorrow you will have a forfeit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley groaned as she miserably assessed her options, there was no way in hell she could eat anymore she thought as she rubbed her gurgling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;uhhh&gt; I'll &lt;Hic&gt; take the forfeit\" She weakly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled broadly, \"Very well\" She said, \"After your weighing tomorrow I'll have a little surprise for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Lauren walked smirking away leaving Ashley huffing and puffing alone, the prospect of her 'forfeit' hanging gloomily over her.

Her thoughts immediately snapped unpleasantly back to her current predicament, and she immediately sat bolt up right and examined her stomach, which had looked so bloated yesterday (even more so after the dinner she had some how managed to eat). It looked flat now, like it normally did and she poked it nervously. It may have been her imagination but it seemed a little softer than before and she groaned miserably. She was brought unceremoniously from her thoughts by her father bellowing up the stairs to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley! Be ready in 20 minutes!\" Said Phillip Banks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Daddy\" Said Ashley, trying to hide the misery in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley changed quickly out of her cute pink pajama bottoms and top, and put on some tight jeans and a black lace crop top. After 20 minutes she slowly descended the stairs to face her fate at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye honey\" Said Phillip beaming at Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley forced herself to return the smile as she bid her father goodbye, but it wasn't very convincing. She walked gloomily up the stairs to her school, and saw the figure of Lauren almost immediately. Ashley slowly approached her and expected Lauren to gloat at her but instead she grabbed Ashleys hand and lead her through the school hallways without saying a word. They entered a store room near the gymnasium, which was empty apart from a few random pieces of sport equipment and a large scale in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the scale\" Lauren said, finally breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley meekly obeyed and stood on the scale, dreading the result. There was no winning here, if Ashley hadn't gained enough then Lauren would surely punish her harshly, but if she had gained the weight that just meant a step closer to Ashley loosing her amazing figure which she loved. Ashley watched the numbers slowly rise on the scale gloomily. The numbers finally stopped and Ashley groaned again seeing the result. Before her gluttony yesterday Ashley had weighed about 109 pounds... she now weighed 111.5 pounds, meaning she had gained 2 and a half pounds in one day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Said Lauren, genuinely taken a back, \"That's very good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren poked and squeezed Ashleys body, as Ashley stood looking forlorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Lauren \"You can't really tell you've gained yet.. but a few more days like yesterday and I'm sure everbody will notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren removed a large packet of donuts (there were 12 donuts) from her bag and handed them to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat those now\" Ordered Lauren, and after a minute of silence in which Ashley considered saying \"No\", she meekly opened the box and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\" Said Lauren, \"to your forfeit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Ashleys forfeit?</span></div></div>",

It's in your best interest to win this competition\" She added with an evil smile, \"Failure to do so will result in another forfeit tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Cried Ashley in disbelief, \"Your forcing me to eat these donuts before an eating competition, and you expect me to win?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled even broader, \"Oh and lunch as well\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I can eat that much!\" Cried Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Said Lauren with a short harsh laugh, \"Finish your donuts now, you have 5 minutes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's face was a mask of misery as she hurriedly obeyed Lauren. She had only managed 7 by the time the 5 minutes was up, which was very impressive but not good enough. Lauren gave an exaggerated sigh as Ashley let out a small burp and a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't do yourself any favours\" Said Lauren, as she slowly advanced on Ashley who looked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren used one arm to secure Ashley's arms behind her back and the other to grab a donut from the box. She crammed the donut roughly into Ashley's mouth, which Ashley was forced to chew and swallow. Ashley was already feeling full and cursed herself inwardly for wearing tight jeans today, as they were aleady beginning to feel even more snug on her slightly bloated stomach. When Ashley had been forced to consume donuts 9 and 10, she let out a large burp and tried to plead with Lauren again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't -hic- eat anymore -uhhh-\" She said wearily, and Lauren gave a mirthless laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that attitude my dear tomorrow is going to be a very bad day for you! You think todays bad? Just you wait!\" She said, obviously enjoying herself immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puh--urp--Please..\" Ashley began weakly, but was interrupted by donuts number 11 and 12 being rammed unceremoniously into her mouth, \"MMMMRFFF\" She squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lauren had done feeding the poor young girl, she let her go and Ashley slumped against the wall breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must be off piggy\" Lauren said happily, \"See you at lunch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley could only offer a feeble burp in response and with that Lauren turned happily on her heel and left poor Ashley groaning and rubbing her full tummy which was straining the top button of her tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ashley sat through her morning lessons, looking extremely glum with the top button of her jeans unbuttoned, she contemplated bolting for the door several times. Her fear of Lauren prevented her from doing so however, so Ashley sat and awaited the horrors that would come. When the bell finally rang, indicating lunch, Ashley glumly rose to her feet rebuttoning her jeans as she did. Her bloated stomach had receded again thankfully, but she still felt a little full from earlier. Lauren was waiting right outside Ashleys classroom, and upon seeing Ashley she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" She said gleefully, \"Shall we do lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley muttered a non committal response and Lauren grabbed her by the hand and pulled her quickly to the lunch hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the drill\" Lauren said happily to the miserable looking Ashley, and handed her a tray whilst grabbing her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please\" Murmured Ashley, \"I beg you, don't make me do this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren considered her request for a moment, \"Hmmm okay\" She said and Ashley looked hopeful for the first time in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you sooo much Lauren..\" Ashley began, but Lauren held up her hand to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I meant was, perhaps two trays is a bit much...\" She said, and Ashleys face dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh hahaha! Did you actually think I wasn't going to make you compete today?\" Said Lauren, sounding genuinely amused, \"No my dear, your definitely doing that.. I wouldn't deprive the school of that entertainment.. I just thought, because I'm feeling so generous today, i'd give you a little more of a chance..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren then filled up her tray and handed it to Ashley who mournfully took it to a table and sat down. There were a pile of 7 burgers, a large side of fries and 5 large pizza slices, along with a large milkshake to wash it all down.. Ashley knew she still didn't stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then my pretty little glutton.. make a pig of yourself\" Said Lauren cheerfully, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lauren\" Said Ashley unhappily and grabbed a burger, taking a large bite out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. from now on call me ma'am, as I am your better\" Said Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Said Ashley meekly when she had swallowed her first bite, and proceeded to take another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren sat back happily and watched as Ashley stuffed her face against her will. Ashley ate as fast as she could, knowing that was probably the only way of finishing the insane amount of food Lauren had demanded. It was admittedly less than last time, but this time she had to take part in an eating \tcompetition immediatly afterward which was just unthinkable. Ashley finished 3 of the burgers and half of the fries in quick succession but she soon hit a wall and groaned. She forced burger 4 down, but it took much longer than the before and Lauren frowned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me your getting full already!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhh.. Soo full ma'am... urp\" Came Ashleys weak response, as she undid the top button of her tight jeans to give her bloated stomach more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight the burn! Come on!\" Lauren ordered, and Ashley moaned unhappily and picked up burger number 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe somehow managed to cram burgers 5, 6 and 7 down in fairly quick succession (as well as the remaining fries), using the milkshake to help her swallow, and when she had she sat back in her chair panting. She was unable to stop herself letting out a large BURP! which caused everybody in the cafeteria to stare at her and laugh between themselves. Ashley shifted uncomfortably in her chair, and undid the zip on her jeans as her taut tummy demanded more space. She eyed up the remaining pizza slices, and almost cried at the thought of eating anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-huff puff- Please ma'am.. uhhh.. Can't -urp- eat anymore -puff-\" She said, sounding exhausted from all the eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren pulled her chair closer to Ashley so that she was eye level with her, and softly swept her dark hair away from her delicate face. She then grabbed a pizza slice and rammed it into her mouth, which Ashley had no choice but to force herself to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleas-- ooof! MRRFFF\" Wailed Ashley weakly, between mouthfuls, but each time she tried to plead her mouth was once again full of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't\" is not a word which should be in your vocabulary anymore\" Said Lauren without emotion, \"You will obey without question\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes Ashley had been forced to consume all 5 pizza slices, and now she was slumped in her chair breathing very heavily. Her stomach was very bloated looking and stuck out a good 6 inches, looking like she was in the early stages of pregnancy. Lauren pushed the remainder of Ashleys milkshake towards her, her expression cold and unsympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish that now\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great difficulty Ashley pushed herself, fearful of being forced to finish it and feebly grabbed the milkshake. Her eyes were glazed and watery from having consumed so much, and she forced herself to suck down the large milkshake. When she had finished she allowed the cup to drop from her hand and she slumped back into her chair, holding her bloated stomach and groaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren consulted her watch, \"Wow\" She said, \"You've got a good 20 minutes of lunch left, so why don't you take this time to prepare yourself for the contest, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley merely offered a few groans and a small burp in response and Lauren smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in 20 minutes to get you\" She said happily and with that she got to her feet and left the miserable figure of Ashley behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She zipped up her jeans with some difficulty but was unable to button them because of her bloated stomach. She breathed in, withdrawing her taut tummy as far as it would go, and managed to fight the button closed but it was terribly strained once she exhaled, threatening to pop off completely. Ashley slowly made her way from the cafeteria, her mind working feverishly to a solution for her current problem. Lauren wanted her to lose the contest she thought, that was obvious, she wanted Ashley to lose so that she'd have an excuse to humiliate her again tomorrow and then probably do the same thing then. Ashley needed to win the contest, but the thought of eating anymore made her stomach groan. Suddenly a memory flashed into her brain which made her stop in her tracks. She recalled a rather brilliant, if nerdy student by the name of Elisa, had managed to create a very potent appetite increaser. Ashley set off at a brisk walk (or as brisk as her very tight jeans would allow), heading for the science lab where Elisa would no doubt be as she ran a science club at lunch times. Ashley reached the science lab and knocked on the door, and within a few moments the familiar bespeckled face of Elisa appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Said Elisa, in her annoyingly nasal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Elisa\" Said Ashley, simultaneously stifling a small burp, \"I was wondering if you could help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...?\" Said Elisa, raising her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..\" Began Ashley, \"This may seem crazy.. but I don't suppose you had any of that 'Appetite increaser' stuff on you, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisas eyes dropped to Ashleys bloated midsection, her stomach still sticking out a good 4 - 5 inches and making her jeans obviously tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to eat more?\" She inquired, poking Ashleys stomach with her finger which made Ashley wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Said Ashley, fighting the annoyance she was feeling for being poked like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats in it for me?\" Said Elisa, her face still showing no emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley withdrew a wad of notes from her pocket, \"I can pay you\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa looked at the money for the moment and finally conceded, \"Very well\" She said, rudely grabbing the notes from Ashleys hand and handing her 2 large red pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa then shut the door in Ashleys face, leaving her staring angrily at the closed door. Ashley stared at the strange pills in her hand, feeling torn whether to actually take them or not. She had paid enough for them, she thought to herself angrily, still seething from how rude Elisa had been. After a short hesitation Ashley put both pills in her mouth and felt them immediately dissolve into a pleasant tasting paste on her tongue. She swallowed this, and prayed they would aid her in the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It felt like the food she had previously eaten was disappearing from her full stomach, which left behind a slowly growing feeling of hunger. Little did Ashley know however, Lauren had second guessed her and had already approached Elisa. She had convinced Elisa to create a different kind of appetite increaser, and Elisa out of fear had complied. The effects of the new pill were now permanent, meaning that the consumer would always have an increased appetite. On top of this it also converted food to fat within minutes which, unknown to Ashley, was what was happening to her now. As Ashleys taut stomach slowly shrank, the rest of her body slowly expanded with the new weight. It was a very slight gain, which was why Ashley didn't notice, perhaps only adding an extra pound to her frame but even so it made her jeans a little more snug. Ashley saw Lauren leaning against the wall waiting for her, and upon seeing Ashley she tapped the watch on her wrist in irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where have you been, hmm?\" Asked Lauren, although she knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked shifty for a moment before answering, \"Erm.. just the bathroom ma'am\" She stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren stared at her for another few moments, and Ashley stared at her feet not wanting to make eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then..

She could see Will, Carlton and Hilary sitting near the front, but thankfully her father and mother were absent (although their presence were just as bad). Lauren seemed to notice Ashleys dilemma and grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know... I knew you'd try and cheat me\" She said quietly into Ashleys ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleys eyes widened in shock and fear, \"Err.. What do you mean?\" She asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elisa?\" Said Lauren triumphantly, \"Lets just say I beat you to the punch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley face was a mask of horror, \"What did you do?!\" she cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren glared at her until Ashley timidly added, \"... Ma'am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets just say I convinced her to..  change her product\" She said grimly, \"The effects are now permanent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was too shocked to respond, and it was all she could do to not burst into tears. Lauren patted her on the back and pushed her into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun\" She said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley miserably shuffled toward the stage, all eyes in the hall now focused on her, including Will, Carlton and Hilary who looked perplexed at seeing her. She walked up to the stage, her face flushed with embarrassment and saw the other contestants she'd be competing against. There were 2 guys and a girl, who were all very large and Ashley suspected had probably competed in similar events before. Ashley was brought out of her miserable trance by a loud voice announcing her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And our final contestant! Please put your hands together for.. Ashley Banks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked like a deer in headlights as she looked up at the immense audience who all clapped. She saw Will, Carlton and Hilary at the front looking amazed at what they were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take your seat Ashley\" Said the voice of the host, who had now walked onto stage with a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley meekly obeyed and sat inbetween one the big guys and the large girl, who each glanced at her in confusion. Infront of her was a huge plate of hotdogs that was so high it almost blocked the audience from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Said the host, \"You have 40 minutes to finish as many hotdogs as you can! The contestant who finishes the most at the end of the 40 minutes will be the winner! Now.. On your marks... get set... GOO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other contestants tore into the hotdogs with reckless abandon, and after a small pause, Ashley reluctantly followed. She could feel the hunger rising in her, courtesy of Laurens double cross, and looked mournful as she gave in to it. She crammed the first hotdog into her mouth and chewed, slowly speeding up as she felt hungrier and hungrier. Once she'd swallowed that she grabbed the next, finishing it even faster. Her speed gradually grew as she ate, and pretty soon she was stuffing her face at a lightning speed. She could feel her stomach expanding outward from the food, pushing against her jeans once more, but strangely it didn't seem to grow that much, almost as if the food she ate was evaporating after a few moments. Little did Ashley know that all the food she consumed was being redistributed around her body as fat, and she was currently expanding very slowly. By the time she had finished hotdogs 7 and 8, she stopped and readjusted her bra, which for some reason seemed a little tighter than it had earlier. Ashley thought nothing of it and continued stuffing her face, but she couldn't help notice that her jeans were also feeling a little more snug than they had earlier. Ashley ate with reckless abandon, now a slave to the hunger building inside of her, and her siblings watched with their mouths agape, speechless at the sight of their younger sisters gluttony. After hot dogs 11 and 12 had disappeared into Ashleys bottomless stomach she stifled a burp and glanced over at the competitions progress, discovering that she was still somewhat behind them. She kicked her eating into high gear now, desperate to win, grabbing a hot dog in each hand and devouring both with only a couple of bites. She repeated this over and over again and soon caught up with the competition who were beginning to slow down noticeably. Ashley could feel her jeans getting subtly tighter and tighter as each hotdog disappeared into her stomach, and if somebody were to watch her body closely it was actually possible to see it expand very slowly with the extra weight she was gaining. After 20 minutes of eating Ashley had consumed almost 30 hotdogs, a fact which astounded the audience due to how small and delicate her frame was. Her jeans were feeling very tight now, but Ashley tried to ignore and forced herself to consume her 31st hotdog. Upon swallowing the dog the button popped off the top her jeans and landed on the stage infront of her, and the audience laughed, causing Ashley to blush. She had perhaps gained about 5 pounds now (including the weight from lunch), and it was most obvious in her stomach as she now had the slight bump of a small pot belly. Her ass and breasts had also received some weight, although not as much as her stomach, it still caused her bra and panties to feel a little tight. Ashley felt completely humiliated as she heard the audience making jokes on her behalf, but the hunger she felt didn't allow her to slow down and so she continued stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She still ate at a fast pace due to her hunger however, but reverted to using one hand again. As she ate she was still gaining weight on the spot, and if you looked closely it was visible to her see her slight pot belly become softer. By the time the 20 minutes were up Ashley had consumed a further 15 hotdogs and she stifled a large burp. She rearranged her tight jeans, which seemed even tighter than before, and pulled her panties down slightly as she was currently receiving a bit of a wedgie. It was clear that Ashley had won the competition by at least ten dogs, and despite her embarrassment Ashley felt relieved that there would be no further forfeits from Lauren. Ashley shifted in her chair again, the extra weight to her frame had made her jeans almost skin tight (they were tight jeans before she had even began eating) and her widening hips had pushed her zip down a little. She felt her stomach and frowned as she felt her fingers sink into the flesh slightly, but couldn't decide if it was just her imagination making it seem like it was softer than earlier. Ashley looked up and saw the host at the corner of the stage conversing with Lauren and her heart froze, suddenly afraid that she was up to something again. A few moments later the announcer approached the centre of the stage, looking grim and Ashley knew something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen\" He said grimly, \"Ashley Banks is disqualified for using performance enhancing drugs.. Meaning our winner is...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't even hear who the winner was, as the revelation to what Lauren had done hit her. She could see Lauren grinning evilly on the side of the stage and she knew then what she had done. She had got her disqualified so that she would still have to have a forfeit tomorrow! Ashleys face was a mask of horror and misery as the crowd cheered the actual winner of the contest. Lauren made a 'come hither' motion and Ashley glumly rose from her chair, trying to force the zip up on her jeans as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tisk tisk\" Said Lauren as Ashley reached her, \"Real winners don't take drugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still won\" Ashley said, her voice trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't!\" Said Lauren sounding annoyed, \"and if you speak to me with defiance again you'll regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry ma'am...\" Said Ashley mournfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren removed a box of donuts from her bag, sighing as she did \"Eat these\" She said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Said Ashley submissively, removing a donut and proceeding to bite into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" Continued Lauren, \"You failed to win the contest.. and you know what that means don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded miserably as she finished her donut, and grabbed a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" Said Lauren grinning, \"tomorrow i'll have another forfeit ready for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at Ashley for another few moments, and Ashley lowered her eyes not wanting to look her in the eye as she unhappily ate her 3rd donut. Lauren probed Ashleys midsection, prodding her tummy and laughing outloud as she felt her finger sink into her small pot belly slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" She said, more to herself than to Ashley, \"Your fattening up nicely.. don't you think piggy? Come on, admit to what you are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Said Ashley, as she swallowed the 4th donut, her cheeks flushed with humiliation \"I am a piggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren laughed harshly, thoroughly enjoying the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eut those last 2 donuts like the pig you are!\" She said evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Replied Ashley robotically, and proceeded to cram both donuts into her face simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink piggy!\" Shouted Lauren<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Uhhh- OINK OINK -urp!-\" Replied Ashley as she wolfed down the donuts much to the gloating Laurens delight.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

At first she completely forgot about the whole situation with Lauren, and it wasn't until she had gotten out of bed to do her hair in the mirror that she finally remembered. The grim realization set in like a lead weight of despair and she quickly lifted up her pajama top to examine her midsection and survey the damages from yesterday. Ashley let out a mournful moan as she noticed that there was a slight bump to her once flat and perfect stomach. She prodded it and felt her finger sink into the flesh more than it had yesterday, and a lone tear ran down her beautiful cheek. She then remembered that she had yet another forfeit today and her heart sank even further. She recalled returning home yesterday and having to answer her siblings frenzied questions about what happened that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" Will had exclaimed, \"Why'd you want people to see you like that Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was for charity\" Ashley had replied, rather unconvincingly, \"Just trying to do my part\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to appease her siblings, but Ashley didn't know how she could explain away another public gorging like that (if that was indeed what Lauren had planned), let alone her steady weight gain when it became more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an all too brief drive to school, Ashley miserably got out of her fathers car and \timmediately saw the familiar, burly figure of Lauren standing at the entrance. Lauren grinned and waved cheerfully at Ashley as she glumly approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning tubby\" Said Lauren gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning ma'am\" Replied Ashley quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren grabbed Ashleys hand and hurriedly marched her through the school to the closet they were at yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the scale\" Ordered Lauren, and Ashley obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley watched the numbers rise on the scale with her heart in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-105... 110... 117.5-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness!\" Said Lauren, seemingly overjoyed, \"A gain of 6 pounds! I'm proud of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stared at her feet, completed mortified at how quickly she was gaining weight. As she did Lauren took a box of donuts, which was much larger than yesterdays, and handed it to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the drill.. Eat these piggy\" Commanded Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Replied Ashley and took the donuts without protest, sighing sadly before biting into her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\" Began Lauren in a matter of fact tone, \"I'm sure your wondering what todays forfeit will be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't answer, instead she swallowed the first donut and began her 2nd, eating it quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to love this one\" Lauren said with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

You will be secured in these stocks, and will be used as an example of why junk food is bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slow look of horror slowly spread over her confused countenance as Lauren spoke and Lauren laughed at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha! I think you're starting to understand what I'm talking about! Yes my dear, you will be fed by each year of the school! For you see, in the spirit of the day they will be getting rid of their junk food in order to lead a healthier life! And what better way to get rid of it, than feeding it too a pig? Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious?\" Ashley spluttered, before adding \"... Ma'am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I am! Very serious indeed! Don't you think it's a good idea?\" Said Lauren, her expression was dangerous, seemingly daring Ashley to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Ashley said miserably, \"An excellent idea ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I thought you'd like it\" Said Lauren, \"Now finish up your donuts tubby\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was currently on donut 7 of 18, and had already hit the food wall but pressed on regardless, fearful of being force fed them. Ashley crammed them in with no regards to how this looked to Lauren, who was obviously enjoying the sight of it, because she figured the faster she ate them the quicker it would be over. Ashley had had the fore thought to wear a cute little flowery dress today, with long white stockings which would benefit her because it allowed a lot more room for her bloated stomach to grow. This didn't stop Ashley from feeling full however, and on her 12th donut she stopped eating and Lauren frowned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me that hunger increaser has worn off already?\" Inquired Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Ashley could actually feel her bloated stomach (which was showing through her dress) retract as the food was digested and the fat distributed, and she felt hungry again. Ashley tore into the remaining donuts with reckless abandon and finished them all in 5 minutes flat, and letting out a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Very good my little glutton!\" Said Lauren, patting Ashleys taut stomach causing Ashley to hiccup and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Patrick regarded her curiously, obviously unsure as to why this amazingly beautiful young woman wanted to demean herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried about eating so much?\" Said Miss.

Patrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, lets begin shall we?\" Said Miss. Patrick, and the 3 of them approached the stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blushed deeply as Lauren opened the stocks and shoved her in, before locking them and securing her inside. Lauren bent down to Ashleys ear to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet your very excited aren't you?\" Crooned Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Ashley said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell everybody to begin then piggy... And sell it well, remember your supposed to be enjoying this\" Said Lauren with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley slowly looked up at the expectant faces of the kindergarten class, and groaned at the sight of how much junk food they had brought with them. It seemed like the entire class had been shopping especially for this moment, as there was no way they could eat all of the food they had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello kids... Please come feed me, i'm ever so hungry!\" Said Ashley, her face glowing red as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids laughed at her, before forming an orderly queue at the right of Ashley, their junk food held ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kids, before you feed the piggy, let me just add that after each feeding our volunteer will be weighed\" Said Lauren, \"The class that causes her to gain the most weight will be rewarded with a prize! Now you may feed when ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the first child stepped up, who was a young boy with a triumphant expression on his face. The boy wasted no time and roughly crammed a very large chocolate eclair into Ashleys mouth, which Ashley quickly ate and swallowed. This was only the first eclair, as the boy seemed to have brought several boxes of them, and pretty soon 2 more were being stuffed roughly into her mouth. All the children were laughing at the sight of Ashley being fed, and if it were possible Ashley was going even redder from embarrassment. The boy seemed to be enjoying himself immensely and made a big show of feeding the poor young beauty. Ashley was forced to eat very quickly as the boy crammed large eclairs into her mouth without much of a pause between each one, and Lauren couldn't stop smiling at the sight. After a few more minutes all the eclairs were gone and the boy walked away as Ashley hiccuped. Lauren bent down and wiped Ashleys face with a tissue, as it had a fair amount of cream on it, and pretty soon the next child approached. This child had brought 5 Mcdonalds meals, and Ashleys eyes widened in horror. The child opened one of the bags and removed two cheeseburgers, which were unwrapped and one after the other forced into Ashleys mouth. Ashley was forced to consume each in only a couple of bites and she let out a small burp as she swallowed the second. Next two boxes of french fries were removed from the same bag and Ashley wondered just how much food was in each of these bags. The fries went down quickly and were followed by 2 Mcflurrys and 2 large strawberry milkshakes. As she hurriedly slurped down the two milkshakes, Ashley could feel her stomach bloat outwards and push against her dress. After another 2 of these similarly stuffed bags Ashley was really beginning to feel full, and a small bump could be seen in her dress where her bloated stomach pushed against the fabric. She was being forced to drink another milkshake now but found herself unable to do it quickly, which obviously displeased the child who looked at Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go kid\" Said Lauren, handing the child a funnel with a hose attached, \"She's not full really, she'd just playing aren't you Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh -urp- yes ma'am -hic-\" Came Ashleys groggy response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child happily put the end of the hose in Ashleys mouth and poured down the milkshake which Ashley swallowed quickly. This milkshake was followed by the childs 4 remaining milkshakes, and Ashleys eyes lolled in her head as she was forced to swallow the extremeing fattening mixtures. Ashleys stomach was really noticable now as it stretched the front of her skirt and made gurgling noises. Ashley felt incredibly full but just then the drug she has taken the previous day kicked in, and her stomach slowly receded back as the food she had consumed was digested. If you looked very closely at her you could see the fat distribute itself around her body, as she became very slightly softer all over. It wasn't a huge gain, but it made the bump of her pot belly a little more noticeable and made her bra feel a little more snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anybody else has any milkshakes they'd like to deposit, nows the time\" Said Lauren smiling, and Ashley moaned as she saw some 12 children detach themselves from the crowd looking fiendishly excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m a hungry piggy!\u201d She said, forcing an unconvincing smile and she was soon approached by the first child who carried 2 milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child roughly crammed the end of the funnel into Ashley\u2019s waiting mouth and without a word began to pour in the first milkshake. Ashley swallowed the mixture miserably, knowing that her fate was sealed and any semblance of a social life was over. The child poured the milkshakes down the funnel quickly, which meant it was quite exhausting for Ashley as she had to swallow it extremely quickly so that she could catch her breath. It didn\u2019t take long for her to finish both milkshakes and then the next child stepped forward, this one carrying 4 milkshakes. Ashley\u2019s groan was muffled by the funnel in her mouth and the child grinned maliciously as he lifted 2 of his milkshakes simultaneously towards the peak of the funnel. Ashley\u2019s eyes widened in horror as the child poured both of the milkshakes down at the same time, and she was forced to consume them even quicker than before. When she had finished Ashley coughed and spluttered, gasping for air but the process was soon repeated again as the child poured his remaining two down the funnel. The rest of the children followed this same method, and Ashley was force fed at a truly relentless speed, hardly having time to breath between each mouthful. As she was fed her stomach bloated out more and more, once again pressing against the fabric of her dress which was becoming gradually tighter. As the final child poured down their milkshake, Ashley let out a feeble burp and the funnel fell from her exhausted mouth. It was plain to see that if the stocks weren\u2019t present, Ashley wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand at all due to the exertion from the feeding she had just endured. Her stomach (which was gradually receding once more) looked rotund and taut, obviously visible through her dress and was emitting sounds of protest. Lauren approached Ashley, who could barely lift her head, and prodded Ashley\u2019s swollen tummy (which stuck out some 8 inches). Ashley moaned feebly from the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cuhh \u2013hic- no more \u2013urp- ma\u2019am.. oohh\u201d Mumbled Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this kids\u201d Lauren said, ignoring Ashley\u2019s pleas and lifting up her skirt so that everybody could see her swollen abdomen, \u201cAs you can see, junk food is very bad for you! Our test piggy is starting to fatten up already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 -urp-\u201d Came Ashley\u2019s feeble response, and everybody laughed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026 everybody step forward and feed the piggy the rest of your junk food\u201d Ordered Lauren, and the kids obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 No\u2026 please\u2026\u201d Whined Ashley but Lauren ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon however the drug Ashley had previously taken once again worked its magic, and the incredibly uncomfortable feeling of fullness she felt gradually lessoned. She could feel her swollen stomach reduce back to normal, though once it was back to normal it seemed a little bit larger and softer than it had originally been, not to mention wider. The feeding now continued at earnest, and Ashley was once again stuffed with every fattening food stuff known to man. After some twenty minutes of feeding, Ashley finally chewed and swallowed the last of the food and let out a large \u2013BURP!- which caused everybody to laugh at her. She once again looked exhausted, as she groaned weakly from how full she felt and how uncomfortable her snug underwear now was. Her stomach was once again large and swollen, sticking out about ten inches and gurgling miserably. The extra weight from the milkshakes had now circulated around her body, though it seemed to have localized mostly around her breasts and butt which were both feeling rather squashed by underwear that was now becoming too small to house them. Lauren patted Ashley on the headed fondly, and the children giggled at the sight of the stuffed young beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026 Is somebody a little full?\u201d Crooned Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Yes ma\u2019am\u2026 -urp-\u2026 very full indeed ma\u2019am\u201d Replied Ashley quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren undid Ashley's restraints and guided her from the stocks to a scale which had been set up nearby. The children watched in excitement to see how much weight they had forced the poor young beauty to gain, and as they waited with baited breath Ashley stumbled onto the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-110... 117... 121-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"121 pounds!\" Called out Lauren \"that is a gain of about 4 pounds! Very well done kids, congratulate the kids Ashley\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Ashley mumbled, still feeling the fatigue from her feeding, \"uhh- Well done kids -urp!- you've fattened me up nicely! -hic-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the children cheered happily and Lauren smiled at Ashley as she took her by the arm and led her back to the stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She had never fully appreciated just how many grades her school actually had, but now she was being force fed by all of them there seemed to be no end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the final child from the first grade had crammed the last of their junk food into Ashley\u2019s mouth, Lauren approached examining her captive thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d Exclaimed Lauren as she poked Ashley protruding bloated midsection which caused Ashley to moan in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Moaned Ashley feebly, \u201cPlease\u2026 don\u2019t touch\u2026 ma\u2019am\u2026 &lt;hic!&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u201d Crooned Lauren, \u201cIs somebody a little full? Well lets get you weighed piggy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren had to pretty much drag the poor girl from the stocks to the scales as the children looked on with distinct unhidden amusement. Ashley watched the numbers on the scale miserably as they rose, and a small tear rolled down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t118\u2026 121\u2026 123.5 \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a gain of 2 and a half pounds\u201d Announced Lauren so that everybody could hear, \u201cNot as much as the last class, but very good nonetheless!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids looked a little disappointed but nevertheless appeased that they had forced a further 2 and a half pounds onto Ashley\u2019s frame. Ashley was led back to the stocks just as teachers from the second grade led their kids to where the first grade had been standing. Once Ashley had been secured into her restraints she feebly raised her head to look at the new kids. The faces of these kids seemed even more malicious than the last bunch and Ashley grimly wondered whether the day was only going to get worse as it continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t117\u2026 122\u2026 128 \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stared forlornly at the numbers on the scale while Lauren looked positively gleeful. The second grade had been particularly merciless and Ashley had had a hard time keeping up with the feeding. The kids had seemed to get a lot of enjoyment out of tormenting the poor young beauty, and each child had taken their time to humiliate her as much as possible. They kept grabbing her small soft pot belly and making oinking noises and to Ashley\u2019s dismay she could feel that her belly had grown even softer as the children\u2019s fingers sunk into the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a gain of 4 and a half pounds!\u201d Announced Lauren happily, \u201cWell done kids, that\u2019s the best so far!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children cheered at their accomplishment and Lauren beamed at them. Ashley attempted to angle her body a little as she could feel the bump of her small pot belly pushing against the fabric of her dress. Her bra was also getting uncomfortably snug, and she could feel how the strap of her bra was sinking into the flesh on her back slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrades 3 to 6 were a complete blur for poor Ashley, and all she really remembered of each was the read out on the scales after each feeding. The 3rd grade had made her gain 2 pounds, the 4th 3 pounds, the 5th 2 and a half and pounds and the 6th grade 4 pounds. This brought her current weight up to 139 and a half pounds and she was really starting to notice the new weight around her body. Though she couldn\u2019t see herself (as the stocks obscured her view) she could feel her clothing and underwear get snugger and snugger, a sensation that filled her with misery. The weight seemed to be distributed fairly evenly around her body, though it wasn\u2019t at all evident in her face yet. Her stomach was the most obvious, as before all the constant feedings it had been perfectly flat. Now however it pooched over the waistband of her panties by about 4 inches and stretched the fabric of her forever tightening dress. Her butt was getting thicker and was beginning to make her underwear feel uncomfortably tight, as were her breasts which bulged over the cups of her tight bra. After each weighing Ashley was forced to act like she was enjoying herself and much to her forever increasing humiliation Lauren forced her to congratulate the kids for fattening her up before beckoning on her next feeders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was approached the 7th grade Ashley groaned because amongst the class she saw a girl she recognized. Thus far Ashley hadn\u2019t seen anybody she knew and up until this point she had completely forgotten that the time would come when she would be fed by an acquaintance (or even a friend). The girl in question was named Krystal, who was the younger sister of one of her close friends and when she spotted Ashley her mouth hung agape. Lauren seemed to notice the moment of horror that the two shared and she smiled an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarting to see people we know are we piggy?\u201d She crooned into Ashley\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d Grumbled Ashley, her face maroon with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust imagine how it\u2019ll be when we reach the twelfth grade\u201d She said with a grin and Ashley shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the seventh grade lined up, their bags of junk food held eagerly, Krystal continued to stand and stare in complete and utter bemusement. With a nudge from Lauren Ashley sighed before she once again forced a fake smile and raised her head to address the eagerly awaiting kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on then kids, come and feed me like the greedy pig that I am!\u201d She announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeding then began with vigor; each kid taking it in turns to empty their bags full of junk food by stuffing it all into Ashley\u2019s waiting mouth. It took about 20 minutes for the line of kids to be reduced to just one. Krystal was gob smacked at what she had just witnessed and she now approached Ashley with a look of both confusement and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing Ashley?\u201d She managed to stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley let out a feeble burp and Lauren grinned broadly, stroking her captives head with mock fondness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Ashley, why are you doing this?\u201d Said Lauren, her voice slightly stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was panting weakly from the stuffing she had just endured, moaning in discomfort as her taut stomach (which was pushing against her dress so much that stress lines had appeared over its bulbous form) grumbled in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cuhh.. &lt;hic!&gt;\u2026 Because I\u2019m a hungry\u2026 &lt;URRRRP!!!&gt; gluttonous pig of course\u2026\u201d She responded weakly, \u201cI want to\u2026 &lt;Hic!&gt; be fattened up\u2026 uhhh\u2026 like the disgusting glutton that I am\u2026 &lt;urp!&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Said Krystal, \u201cUm\u2026 Do you want me to feed you then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley longed to say \u201cNo!\u201d as she was absolutely exhausted from the days feeding, but she knew that would only make matters worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 &lt;urp!&gt; Yes please, please fatten me up Krystal\u201d Said Ashley brightly, which took some effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal still looked unsure but nevertheless she opened her brown paper bag and produced a large cinnamon roll from it, which she then deposited into Ashley\u2019s panting mouth. Krystal was a lot gentler than the kids that had previously fed Ashley, as unlike them she genuinely didn\u2019t seem to be enjoying it. She fed Ashley slowly, allowing Ashley to finish each bite before feeding her the next thing from the bag. This allowed Ashley to digest the food from earlier, which caused her large taut stomach to slowly shrink again and the weight to distribute itself. She could feel her dress and underwear slightly tighten as the weight was distributed, and she had to fight back tears of fierce embarrassment from what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is that alright?\" asked Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Urp&gt; Just get me out of here...\" said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal suddenly ran off the platform and returned a second later with a large tub of liquid. Attaching a hose to a small spout, then running the hose into Ashley's mouth, Krystal opened the spout. At first, Ashley felt nothing.Then a massive amount of pressure started building up as her stomach swelled up. The liquid was lukewarm, but really bland. Ashley couldn't quite place it's taste-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lard.\" whispered Krystal. \"It's the easiest thing I could think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley's stomach bloated out more and more, the supports creaked ominously, but held firm. Meanwhile, Ashley's stomach continued to get bigger and hurt more and more... until the pill effect activated. The lard going into her body was being transferred into fat at almost the same rate, creating a strange equilibrium. Slowly, Ashley grew with fat, her breasts growing, her stomach getting chubbier, and even her face began getting a little pudgy. Then a *SNAP* filled the air as... Ashley's panties snapped and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, and newly re-interested Lauren, broke into laughter. Shrieks and cries filled the air as the 7th graders laughed so hard they cried. Meanwhile, the tub of lard finally emptied. Ashley, desperate for escape, went totally limp, putting her full weight on the stocks... but nothing happened except for a small creaking. Krystal mouthed a dismayed sorry as she was pulled away. Lauren pulled Ashley out of the stocks and put her on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-111... 123... 139... 151-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at the scale, and a single tear trickled down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW!\" roared Lauren. \"That's a whopping 11.5 pounds! You have the lead, 7th grade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for disciplining a fat, greedy pig like me. Thank you for helping put me in my place.\" said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the 7th grade departed, Ashley did a quick once-over of her body. Her breasts strained her bra, and her potbelly had really expanded into a full out gut. Her ass had turned into 2 globular fat deposits, and was stretching the fabric of the back of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the 8th grade arrives...</span></div></div>",

Lauren, being the bully that she was, tried to figure out what was going on so they could get a move on feeding Ashley. So she went down the hall. Ashley heaved herself up and waddled out. She was walking towards the exits and she was crying. This was the ultimate humiliation for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt disgusted with herself. Surely she could've found some way to handle this than to follow Lauren's orders. Then it hit her. She got in her car and drove out of town. A gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 Months Later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day Ashley left, she phoned home and told Will everything. He, for once, was understanding and caring enough not to laugh. He told her he'd cover for her until she got back. He also took it into his power to tell Uncle Phil to tell Lauren's father. Lauren was upset with her punishments and then Ashley came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was back to her pretty, normal self but now Lauren was going to fear her. During her time off, she worked out....a lot. And now she was going to hurt Lauren like she hurt her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren?\" Ashley said entering the school to see the fat girl. Lauren froze. \"A-A-Ashley?\" she asked. Ashley walked over to Lauren and pinned her against the wall. \"You are now <i></i> my slave<i></i> . And I don't want to hear anything or I'll have my father tell your father that you've been trying to bully me again. Is that clear?\" Ashley snarled. \"Y-Yeah.\" Lauren stammered. \"Now carry this and follow me to my class.\" Ashley ordered. \"B-But I'll be l-\" Lauren started. Ashley laughed and then waved over to some boys. \"Lauren, I could care less if you're late.\"  she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week, Ashley was tired of Lauren and let her go.

Krystal half considered attempting to help Ashley, perhaps trying to free her even, but she soon decided against it as the hulking form of Lauren cast an intimidating shadow over her. Lauren looked cheerful as she undid Ashley\u2019s restraints and allowed Ashley to collapse onto her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez Ashley\u201d Lauren said loudly for all to hear, \u201cYour becoming a right heavy cow\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley offered no response and simply allowed herself to be led to the scales once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-114\u2026 125\u2026 135\u2026 145-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo 145 pounds!\u201d Called out Lauren, \u201cThat\u2019s a gain of 6 and a half pounds\u2026 which means you\u2019re the new front runners! Well done kids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nudged Ashley and she knew the drill, immediately forcing a smile at the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c&lt;hic&gt;\u2026 Ohh yes, well done kids! You\u2019ve certainly fattened me up nicely; I\u2019ll be a big tubby dough ball in no time at this rate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re already a tubby dough ball!\u201d Shouted one of the seventh graders and everybody laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure are, aren\u2019t you tubby?\u201d Said Lauren, joining in on the fun, \u201cShow them all your new flab\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, blushing deeply from embarrassment, obeyed and lifted up her skirt exposing her pot belly which had more than doubled in size since the morning. Everybody roared with laughter as Ashley showed off her new belly, forcing an unconvincing smile. The seventh graders were then led away to be replaced by the 8th grade and Ashley was once more marched back to the stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had recognized a few more faces in the crowd this time round, and was expecting them to approach their task much like Krystal had. Surprisingly though, these familiar faces seemed to extremely enjoy their task of stuffing her silly and the feeding itself was over in record time. Ashley was incredibly weak as she was lead to the scales once more and weighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-119\u2026 125\u2026 135\u2026 150-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was now no mistaking the bulge at Ashley\u2019s midriff as it was beginning to become too large to be hidden by her dress, and was now becoming accentuated by the tightening fabric. Her breasts and ass were having the same the problem also, though she couldn\u2019t really be described as \u2018fat\u2019 yet (certainly not by the level of \u2018fat\u2019 that Lauren had planned for her).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 9th grade didn\u2019t offer much more in the way of mercy or compassion as once again Ashley found herself being stuffed at a frantic speed. The teens who fed her were positively reveling in the opportunity to humiliate her, and some were even snapping photos as they crammed food into her face and wobbled her chubby belly and breasts. Unsurprisingly Lauren approved of their efforts and she even offered to snap a picture of the whole grade as each one of them stuffed something into poor Ashley\u2019s mouth. As she was fed Ashley wondered gloomily how long it would take before all these pictures appeared on the internet for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-119\u2026 125\u2026 139\u2026 154-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCame the reading from the scale as Ashley was weighed, and she let out a mournful moan at just how quickly she was gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo what\u2019s this I see?\u201d Said Lauren, stroking Ashley\u2019s delicate chin where the faint overhang of a slight double chin was becoming to form, \u201cIs somebody getting a double chin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, it would be appear so\u201d Said Ashley robotically, though the observation stung and everybody laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley walked gloomily back to the stocks, adjusting her tightening underwear as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-125\u2026 139\u2026 158-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley could feel the waistband of her panties digging into her softer midriff as she watched the numbers on the scale rise. Her new weight was obvious to all present (the fact that she had never been a pound over weight in her entire life added to this) as her dress was now clinging quite closely to her body, accentuating her curves and causing obvious stress lines to form over her belly and breasts. It was safe to say that Lauren was obviously very happy at the results she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour definitely getting porky aren\u2019t we slave?\u201d Commented Lauren as she squeezed her love handles thoughtfully, checking their softness,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d Replied Ashley gloomily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour not even close to how fat I plan on making you though\u2026\u201d Said Lauren and Ashley looked at her fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how fat is that?\u201d Said Ashley, her voice rising slightly before she remembered her position and meekly added \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 well you\u2019ll just have to wait and see\u201d Replied Lauren cryptically, and led Ashley back to the stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She soon heard excited chatter approaching from the other side of the building and Ashley groaned as she shifted awkwardly in her stocks. She closed her eyes in misery as the voices came closer and she waited for the first of them to notice her. She could pinpoint the exact moment her grade had noticed her as all of a sudden all the chatter stopped simultaneously. She heard a few gasps, a few soft whispers and even a few uncontrolled laughs as she felt the eyes of her friends and acquaintances upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everybody\" Said Lauren while Ashley kept her eyes completely closed \"I trust you've all been told why you are here. It's time to feed this little piggy, whom I'm sure you all recognise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley opened her eyes as she suddenly felt a cold hand on her belly, lifting up her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see\" Said Lauren, who was the owner of the hand \"She's already been fattened up quite nicely, so now it's your job to make her gain more weight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stared out mournfully at the crowd and saw to her dismay that the vast majority were staring back in amusement. She shivered as a cold breeze touched her skin, which caused her chubby tummy to jiggle slightly and a few people laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then\" Said Lauren sounding businesslike \"Let's get started shall we... Ashley, please welcome our new guests\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stared at Lauren, desperately wanting her to reconsider this order but only received a pitiless cold stare in return. She gulped nervously before she spoke and she could see people were smirking already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen\" She began \"As you can see I'm a greedy, fat pig that needs to be fed. Please come and stuff my gluttonous chubby face with your fattening treats. Please fatten me up until I'm too fat to fit through the doors of this school! Hurry up now, I'm ever so hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was actually surprised how much Ashley had got into her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good piggy\" She said, patting Ashleys head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ma'am\" Replied Ashley, looking mortified at what she'd just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA line began to form in front of Ashley and she groaned when she saw that they seemed to be carrying much more food than the previous grades. The first person to approach was a large guy, who Ashley recognised from the football team though she didn't know him properly. He smiled broadly as he removed his backpack and Ashley gulped at his sinister expression wondering fearfully what he had in store for her. The large jock removed a series of what appeared to be milkshakes, though Ashley could tell that they were no ordinary milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach makes us drink these when he wants us to move up a weight class\" He announced finally grinning \"Lets see what they do to you, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley opened her mouth obediently and a large funnel was placed into it. Ashley could feel the eyes of the people she knew so well upon her as the first milkshake was poured into the funnel which she was forced to swallow. The mixture wasn't particular pleasant, tasting quite bitter and Ashley grimaced as she swallowed it. The jocks friends were cheering loudly and Ashley flushed with embarrassment as they began chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed the pig! Feed the pig!\" They yelled in unison, with even some of the cheerleading squad joining in gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley was forced to consume each incredibly fattening milkshake she could feel the familiar feeling of her belly bloating outward against her tightening skirt, a fact which was visually obvious to all present. Ashley was forced to consume ten of the massive weight gain shakes before she was finally given a chance to rest and digest. Her belly had noticeably grown and was causing stress lines along the stretched fabric, though it was slowly receding once again as the drug did its work and the added weight distributed itself around her body. Ashley offered a weary burp as she raised her head and saw the next member of the football team approaching her. Ashley almost cried when she saw who approached her, though she managed to hide her emotion. Carl was a new addition to the team, and Ashley had had a crush on him for a long while. Ashley was sure he felt the same way about her, but could never build up the courage to act on her feelings. Not that it mattered now she thought gloomily to herself, the idea of him feeling anything for her after seeing her so utterly humiliated was very unlikely indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Gloomily Ashley allowed the donut to be pushed into her mouth and she began to chew. Little did Ashley know however that Carl did in fact have feelings for her, even regarding the current situation he found her in. As he fed her he examined her new curves with interest and poorly hidden arousal, enjoying the sight of the uncharacteristic bulge of her belly under her skirt. Ashley realized something was a bit odd mainly due to the gentle care Carl used when feeding her, which she'd only experienced once today when Krystal had fed her earlier. The feeding was slow and deliberate allowing Ashley time to chew and swallow normally, and despite herself Ashley actually felt some enjoyment from it. After about ten minutes the feeding was over and Ashley was actually a little disappointed. She looked up at Carl and their eyes met for a moment, though Carl quickly looked away in obvious embarrassment and returned to the rest of the football team.

Leading the pack was a girl that Ashley knew all too well, and she groaned miserably for being in such a humiliating position. Her name was Kate Rogers, and from the first day they'd met (way back in the first grade) they had been enemies and rivals. Ashley had never fully understood why Kate had instantly took a dislike to her, but she figured it was probably due to jealousy. Kate smiled broadly as she approached, and Ashley stared back fearfully wondering what was in store for her. Kate came to a stop in front of the helpless form of her rival, a triumphant look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Ashley\" Said Kate, bending down so their faces were level \"How are we feeling?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get on with it\" Mumbled Ashley angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Asked Lauren dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...

Eat Ashley!!\" They chanted, \"You big fat cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMembers of the squad now danced forward and began stuffing food into her mouth, one after the other. The feeding itself was integrated into the whole routine, and the whole squad did everything they could to humiliate their captive. Ashley was fed at an alarming speed as each member of the squad crammed whatever fattening food stuff they had into her mouth as they danced around her. Finally, after about ten minutes of the spectacle, a slow tearing noise was heard as Ashleys severely bloated belly tore the seams of her dress. Everybody present roared with laughter as they all saw her exposed, bloated midriff and Kate took the opportunity to give it a good wobble. She also slapped Ashleys ass as it was sticking out behind her noticeably, causing stress lines at the back of the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that sure is a fat ass you've got, isn't it Ashley?\" Said Kate loudly squeezing the chubby flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kate it sure is\" Replied Ashley robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you enjoy having such a disgustingly fat ass?\" Said Kate, obviously enjoying herself \"And such a fat belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, I love being a big fat pathetic cow\" Ashley replied with an extremely fake smile \"No man will ever want me again... I deserve to be fattened up like the greedy pig that I am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do honey\" Crooned Kate as she pinched Ashleys cheek whilst using her other hand to cram a donut into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley let out a long burp as she finally swallowed the last bite of food. Ashley looked absolutely exhausted and it was quite obvious if she wasn't in stocks right now she would probably collapse. Her large belly, which was completely visible due to her ripped dress, was grumbling loudly and was obviously very full indeed. Lauren approached her defeated form looking genuinely impressed at the feat Ashley had managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done piggy\" Said Lauren as she unlocked the stocks \"Now lets see how fat you are shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley merely groaned in response, burping weakly as she was led to the scales under the gaze of her whole grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-115... 135... 150... 170-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked dumbfounded as she read the numbers on the scale, not believing she could of gained so much weight in such a short period of time. To her dismay she could obviously see the new added fat on her body, and she could feel that her clothes were tighter than before. Ashleys belly had grown wider, with love handles that bulged noticeably above the waistband of her tight panties. She had grown a nice bubble butt, which was too large to be completely contained by her panties and pushed tightly against the fabric of her dress. Her breasts bulged over the cups of her bra much more now, so much so that her nipples were no longer completely covered. Her face was now fuller, with a slight yet obvious double chin and puffier cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well done people!\" Announced Lauren \"You've made tubby here gain the most weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She groaned miserably as she struggled to do up the buttons, sucking her belly in so she could force them through their corresponding button holes. When she had managed the buttons looked in severe danger of popping right off but at least it hid her bare belly from her family. It was with great effort that Ashley hid her gloomy countenance as she approached the familiar Bentley parked outside the school gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hunnie\" Said Uncle Phil brightly as Ashley climbed in, giving her a fond peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi daddy\" She responded with a robotic smile, sucking her belly in as she sat down as it pushed tightly against her tight overcoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was school?\" He asked as Ashley clipped in her seat belt, noticing how it too was much more snug than it had once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah fine\" She lied, forcing the fake smile which was becoming routine for her \"Just tired\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Phil frowned slightly at her tone, noticing an uncharacteristic hollowness to it but said nothing. He couldn't tell if he was seeing things but he could swear his daughter had gained a bit of weight. Although her body was hidden by her coat her face looked a little fuller than it had once done, with what appeared to be the beginnings of a small double chin though he knew better than to comment on it of course. Upon returning home to her luxurious Bel Air mansion Ashley was careful to dodge any of the houses occupants, as she was not in the mood for small talk. She hated herself for it but she couldn't stop herself heading quickly into the kitchen to grab something rather substantial to eat to satisfy the growing hunger inside of her. She grabbed a loaf of bread, a block of cheese and a large salami sausage before hurrying up to her room and locking the door. She couldn't believe how hungry she felt considering the day she'd had and she cursed herself for trusting Elisa and her stupid eating drug. Ashley gloomily munched away on the food, taking a bite of each of the foods in turn speeding up the process as her stomach demanded to be fed. When she had taken the last bite of each there was a sudden *Ping!* which indicated a few of the buttons popping off the tight black overcoat she was stuffed into. Ashley moaned sadly as she saw the unwelcome image of her bare bloated belly once more and she took off her coat to examine it further. She found to her dismay that she could  actually grab her new love handles and belly, and she was worried that she would soon have no clothes left that could hide it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

There was a lot to choose from so she decided to just work her way through it as best she could. She began by picking up a gallon of chocolate milk, removing the lid and proceeding to pour it down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, your supposed to use a glass\" Commented Carlton in his usual know it all tone but Ashley ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of frenzied gulping now became audible as Ashley consumed the huge bottle of chocolate milk and after a couple of minutes Carlton was getting rather alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody's thirsty...\" He commented, unable to hide his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell to the backside of his sister, and he could see that it was definitely larger than it had once been. He could see how it stretched the silk fabric of her nightie bottoms (which he knew were usually loose fit on his slim sister) and how her hips were wider, with love handles that bulged over the waistband. He thought about bringing up the issue but her strange behaviour made him uncertain as Ashley was still gulping away at the huge bottle without showing any sign of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Is everything okay Ashley?\" Asked Carlton nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stopped gulping the gallon of milk for a moment to respond to Carlton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'm fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind strained more than the buttons on her overally tight nightie to tell Carlton the truth but she knew things would only get worse if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Asked Carlton not sounding convinced \"I didn't want to say anything... But you seem to have put on a few pounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah...

I knew that\" Said Carlton very unconvincingly \"Anyway... I'll leave you to it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Carlton hastily left the room, leaving Ashley alone. Ashley sighed to herself miserably before she once again picked up the chocolate milk again (There was still just over half left) and continued to drink it. After a further five minutes of frenzied gulping Ashley dropped the empty bottle, let out a large burp and one of the buttons popped off her nightie as her full belly pushed against it even more. Ashley was very aware of the time frame she had to meet her new weight quota so she wasted no time in grabbing the next part of her gluttonous breakfast. Rustling through the cupboards Ashley grabbed several boxes of pop tarts, a box of muffins and a huge box of lucky charms which she basically began to cram into her mouth all at once as she continued her search (Which wasn't exactly easy due to her hands already being full of food). She barely gave herself enough time to taste what she was eating as she stuffed herself at an insane pace, feeling her silk bed clothes getting tighter still as she did. Ashley emptied the last of the box of lucky charms into her mouth, tapping the bottom of the box as she did to make sure she got all the fragments before tossing it carelessly over her shoulder and stifling a burp. Ashley hated the fact that she still felt hungry, perhaps even hungrier than she had felt before she had begun eating which indicated the hunger drug she had previously taken doing its thing. When she had finished the pop tarts and muffins another button popped off her nightie (this time her bulging breasts causing its demise, which were very obviously too large for her tight bra) but her grumbling tummy wouldn't allow her to stop. She grabbed a can of whipped cream and sprayed the entire contents into her mouth, without stopping once. She then ate started munching on several packs of ham and other deli meats as she had a sudden brain wave. She grabbed a whole stick of butter, lard, a large pot of double cream, cookie dough, ice cream and basically anything else that was edible and fattening and dropped it into the blender as she continued to stuff her face with pastrami. She turned on the blender which mixed the concoction as Ashley finished the last of the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp! Hic! Uhhh...\" She exclaimed as she frantically picked up the blender and began pouring the mixture into her greedy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pop!* *Pop!* *Pop!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the buttons, which had done amazingly well to hang on until this point finally popped off her nighie leaving her bare body exposed. Unabated Ashley continued to drink the incredibly fattening mixture, completely lost in her own gluttony as her body slowly swelled with more added flab. When she had finally finished Ashley let out a fatigued burp and slumped to floor, which caused a rip to appear on her tight silk bottoms as her belly pushed against the fabric as it rested on her meaty thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrr... Hic!\" Ashley groaned groggily, as the feeling of ravenous hunger was replaced by a severe food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat slumped against the fridge Ashley could feel the overwhelming feeling of fullness deplete slowly as the calories she had consumed began to turn to fat. She sat panting as she felt the weight go to her breasts (her nipples were visible above the cups of her bra which was becoming a couple of sizes too small) and a slow tearing sound could be heard as they bulged against the insanely tight fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She successfully made it back to her bedroom with out being seen and locked her door. She tried to ignore her reflection in her bedroom mirror in which she could see the obvious bulge of her unwanted muffin top and opened her wardrobe looking in semi desperation for something that would fit her. After trying on several outfits she found to her growing dismay that indeed nothing she owned would fit her anymore, and she cursed herself for choosing so many items of clothing that were designed to show off her body. Ashley selected a pair of denim shorts and law down on her bed in preparation or the titanic struggle which was soon to follow. After a few minutes of frantic tugging she managed to squeeze the pair of denim shorts over her thicker thighs, and she then held her breath in an effort to suck her belly. Ashley tugged and tugged the zipper, going red in the face from the exertion and finally she managed to force it up. Next Ashley performed seemingly impossible task of forcing the top button through the button hole, using one hand to force her flab down like she was trying to close an over stuffed suitcase. Eventually, and to her surprise she finally managed to force the button through the hole and lay there red faced and panting. As soon as Ashley sat up however her soft belly bulged out, popped the button off her shorts and forced her zipper back down.<br>\r\n\"Oh crap\" She said miserably to herself as she checked her watch and realized time was running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some difficulty Ashley pulled the skin tight jean shorts back down her thick thighs and returned to her wardrobe. She noticed a pair of dungarees near the back of her wardrobe that she didn't recognise, so she instinctively pulled them out to have a look. Due to the fact that they were a larger size than everything else she owned Ashley sermised that Jeffrey must of put them there accidentally (it was logical as he often paid little attention to his duties). She put on a white t-shirt which was once loose fit to her but she now felt cling tightly to her body and then pulled on the dungarees that belonged to her mother. Ashley breathed a sigh of relief as she stood in front of the mirror once more in her mothers dungarees, which actually fit quite well (Though was still a little snug on her). She saw that it did a much better job of hiding her new girth than everything else she had, but she couldn't help thinking grimly how long that would be the case after a whole weekend at Laurens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

And remember to be entertaining for those who are going to see it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded glumly before turning her attention the camera<br>\r\nLens, her cheeks glowing red with humiliation at what she was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hi...\" She started meekly \"I'm going to get fed like pig... Again... Oink oink I'm a fat greedy piggy, come feed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice\" Said Lauren approvingly \"She's all yours Mandy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Said Mandy happily \"Dinner time piggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren filmed the proceedings gleefully, happy at how happy her young sister was enjoying to stuff poor Ashley silly.  Mandy fed Ashley in earnest, gleefully stuffing handfuls into her miserable mouth. By now Ashley was used to this sort of treatment, for the most part anyway, so she just tried not to think about it as she was humiliated and force fed. The drug she had taken previously was losing its effectiveness, but after all the extreme stuffings she'd experienced throughout the week her stomach capacity and appetite had been irreversibly changed. It wasn't long before she felt her mothers dungarees, which had been quite loose fitting when she had arrived (in comparison to her own clothes at least) begin to feel decidedly tighter. Mandy was extremely vigorous with her feeding, using both hands to stuff as much food as possible into Ashleys mouth, and Ashley wondered how long the young girl had been waiting to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should start acting more like a piggy\" Advised Lauren from behind her camera \"Lets give your friends a good show\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, crawl on the ground and make pig sounds\" Demanded Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed, swallowing the mouthful of food she was currently working her way through before slinking down to the ground onto all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink oink oink!\" Said Ashley as she crawled around on her hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy jumped roughly onto Ashleys back, shouting and squealing in insane excitement as she rode around on her. She was clearly having a whale of a time as Lauren recorded the spectacle and Ashley crawled around on all fours oinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaayyy\" Cried Mandy \"This way piggy, this way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crawled Ashley had to constantly keep pulling at her dungerees over her growing behind, as they and her underwear kept riding up it uncomfortably. Ashley was rode from the living room to a very large dining room, where she was ordered to stop. Ashley looked up, wondering what new spectacle for her own humiliation had been set up in this room and she saw it immediately and groaned. There was a large trough set up in the middle of the room and didn't take a genius to figure out what its purpose was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is so perfect\" Said Lauren, crouching down to get a good shot of the action \"Ashley the pig is about to pig out... Any last words for your viewers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked up at the camera, pitiful in the pig snout she'd been forced to where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" She began but felt a rough kick in her side from Mandy and stopped, realizing she was expected to stay in 'character' \"Oink oink oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what I thought\" Said Lauren darkly \"Now... gorge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed sadly before crawling over to the trough and sticking her face in. It appeared to be filled with chocolate pudding, though Ashley knew that Lauren would have made sure to make it is calorific as humanly possible. Tentatively, Ashley lowered her head into the trough, and began to eat the pudding within. As she ate Mandy climbed up her back and forced her face further into the chocolate, seemingly displeased with how quickly Ashley was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat faster piggy!\" She demanded in a brattish tone and Lauren laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley offered only a muffled grunt in response as her face was pushed deeper into the pudding and she was forced to gorge herself silly. Every now and then Ashley had to come up for breath, and Lauren took special care to record her miserable, pudding covered face each time. She could feel her belly was packed tightly into the dungarees, an uncomfortable feeling which only grew with each mouthful of pudding that found its way into it. It seemed like eternity for poor Ashley, as she ate and ate feeling her mothers dungarees getting tighter and tighter while Mandy the devil child jumped up and down on her back in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The devil child on her back certainly didn't help matters, as her constant jumping up and down made her fat jiggle and shake against her tightening clothes. When she was finally done Lauren whistled, clearly impressed despite this being far from the first time Ashley had been a victim of forced gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well Ashley my little piglet\" Said Lauren \"That'll do for now methinks.. Tonight we are stepping out! So if you can stop stuffing your face for five seconds we'll get you ready for a night on the town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley only offered a weary burp in response as Lauren pulled Mandy off her back. Mandy looked sullen that she wasn't allowed to play with Ashley anymore, and she folded her arms and glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw don't worry sourpuss\" Lauren crooned to her bratty little sister, in a tone Ashley recognised as it was the same patronising one she usually heard when Lauren spoke to her \"There will be plenty of time for you to play with your new pet, I promise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy beamed at this and skipped happily from the room. Ashley would have been worried at this remark, but she truly couldn't see how much worse things could get... If only she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley noted that Laurens bedroom was much more girly than she had thought it would be, given her rather butch nature. The wardrobe was jam packed with all manner of outfits, and she wondered what she was going to be forced to wear that night. She knew that, whatever it was she could be sure it would be designed to show of her weight gain rather than hide it. Ashleys fears were confirmed when Lauren removed a rack, and laid it on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of outfit?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The outfit was essentially a school uniform, though it was by far the sluttiest one that Ashley had ever seen. The shirt component of the outfit was barely more than a white boob tube, though it had very short sleeves and a collar with a tartan bow tie. There was also a pair of tartan hot pants attached to braces and long white stockings with shiny buckled shoes, and that was it, every other part of Ashleys chubby body would be on show to all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" Asked Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... It's....\" Stammered Ashley miserably \"Prefect ma'am... Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your very welcome\" Said Lauren \"Go on then, why don't you try it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded meekly and self consciously unchanged from her tighter dungarees and stripped to her underwear as Lauren watched her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow your coming along nicely\" Said Lauren in awe at Ashleys ever growing physique \"Your days of being every boys wet dream are truly over aren't they fatass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Replied Ashley as she began changing into the very slutty school uniform \"I'm a fat disgusting mess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are\" Agreed Lauren, grabbing a handful of flab from her chubby gut \"And we are no where near done yet... Just be grateful that your currently still mobile, because when I'm done with you you'll look back on this with fond memories\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gulped at this miserable insight into her future but nevertheless continued to get changed, huffing as she struggled to pull up her tartan hot pants. Lauren giggled as Ashley struggled to pull the pants past her chunky thighs, her flab noticeably bulging above the waistband as she hoisted them up. When, by some miracle, she'd managed to pull them to the was clearly no chance that she was going to be able to close the zipper let alone button them up. She tried sucking her belly in but now weighing in at 180lbs, even when she sucked it in as far as it would go it still bulged out noticeably which kept her pants forced open. She could feel that the back of the hot pants were disappearing up her bulky rear giving her an uncomfortable wedgie, but she sighed to herself and continued to put on the 'school shirt' part of the outfit. The top barely covered her bountiful bosom, as her tits bulged above and below it, but the braces at least kept her hot pants from falling down. Lauren was now in fits of laughter at the sight of the once so slim gorgeous girl (the fact that not long ago this outfit would have looked amazing on her only adding to her sick amusement), especially at how large her gut looked as it bulged over the waistband of her skin tight tartan hot pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" She managed to say as she caught her breath \"You look... Absolutely ridiculous! I can't wait to show you off to everybody! Here, let's add some finishing touches\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren tied the bow tie around Ashleys been before platting her hair into two pigtails, each tied with a tartan bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\" Said Lauren beaming widely \"Now, let's head out... We've got a long night ahead of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at their destination in a style befitting the daughter of such a powerful man ; via limo. This of course drew more attention to them, something that Ashley was hoping to avoid. They were at the most popular club in the area, a place that was frequented by everybody who was anybody at Ashleys school, and when the stepped out of the limo she immediately saw faces she knew quite well (though she reasoned her embarrassment was a moot point after the whole 'Junk Food Day' incident at her school). Lauren led Ashley past the whispering crowds to the entrance, where the door man (after giving her a look which clearly said \"You're too fat to wear that\") let them in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking a little anxious fatty\" Said Lauren giving Ashleys soft gut a poke \"Lets get a drink and loosen up shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded a mute agreement while tugging at her tight hot pants to relieve her wedgie. At the bar Lauren ordered four large pina colada cocktails which Ashley realized were for her because when she received them she removed some weight gain sachets from her bag and dumped a substantial amount into each drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up\" Said Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley took her first drink and took a slurp through her straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow\" Said Lauren immediately, before turning back to the bar \"Beer bong please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender passed over a large pipe and funnel, which was a very popular party starter for a lot of the college frat boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Laure-mrrrf?!\" Ashley attempted to object as she was very aware of all the other club goers staring at her, but Lauren had shoved the end of the hose into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, hush now fatso\" Whispered Lauren soothingly \"We need to get you in a party mood\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren then poured the first large cocktail down the funnel and Ashleys cheeks bulged comically as it entered her mouth before she was forced to swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glublublublubblubbb\" Exclaimed Ashley as she was forced to down the fattening cocktail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren cruelly made poor Ashley consume all four cocktails the same way, with very little break inbetween each as the crowd around them grew in size and volume as they cheered her on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uurrpp... Hiccc...\" Exclaimed Ashley when she'd swallowed the last drop of cocktail, her eyes looking unfocused and bleary from the alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley swayed drunkily from side to side, each sudden movement threatening to pop a seam on her ridiculously tight slutty school uniform. Her unfocused gaze travelled across the dance floor and suddenly her heat sank even further (if that were even possible). Through the crowds of happy, dancing youngsters she spotted a familiar face; her big sister Hilary. She quickly looked away from her, as Hilary almost made eye contact with her. She was now in complete panic mode, she couldnt let her big sister see her like this! Nor could she let Lauren meet her! She decided to quickly slink away (or at least as quickly as her bulky frame would allow in her skin tight outfit) and edged away from Lauren and the dancefloor. In between the dancefloor and the bar area was a series of steel bars, reaching from the floor to ceiling which essentially separated the two areas. The gaps between them seemed large enough to squeeze through however, and as the dancefloor was densely populated by people who were clearly unfriendly towards her and her appearance she realised this was her only option. Poor Ashley was still getting used to the limitations of her rapidly expanding waistline however, and she tried to shimmy her way through the gap in the bars she was soon brought to an abrupt halt. Her bare, glorious belly was pressed tightly against the cold metal bar infront of her, so much so in fact that her flab had practically engulfed it completely from the sides. On top of this the bar behind her was wedged tightly inbetween her big flabby butt cheeks, and was pressed into her back fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnnrgh!!\u201d She grunted as she desperately tried to pull herself free \u201cNo... Please... Nrrrgh!! Come on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use, the gorgeous fat girl was stuck fast, her flab bulging into and around the bars, completely imprisoning her. Ashley went maroon in the face as she struggled to free herself, and soon people began to notice her humiliating predicament. It didnt take long for people to begin pointing and laughing at the poor girl, and soon she felt hands poking, slapping and groping her impressive fat gut and shelf butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Ashley\u201d Said Lauren, the commotion drawing her attention \u201cJust look at you... Cant you go 5 minutes without humiliating yourself you fat loser?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody present laughed and laughed while poor Ashleys lip quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I...\u201d She whimpered, welling up \u201cI appear to be stuck ma\u2019am... my disgusting fat body wouldnt fit through the gap...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell duhh!\u201d Replied Lauren brutally \u201cEverybody here can see that fatass! You know, i would have helped you... if it didnt look suspiciously like you were trying to run away from me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP... Please Lauren... I mean ma\u2019am!\u201d Stammered Ashley, clearly and justifiably afraid \u201cI wasnt... I didnt mean tooglurmph!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh shh\u201d Crooned Lauren, stroking Ashleys pig tailed head as she stuffed the business end of the beer bong into her mouth \u201cStop your pathetic excuses...  i have to discipline you, otherwise you\u2019ll never learn\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passage of time meant nothing to poor Ashley, as all she could only focus on was sucking down whatever Lauren and her other tormentors dumped down the funnel. Fattening cartons of double cream, chocolate and other flavours of full fat milk, along with alcohol and who knew what else was poured down the tube to be glugged down by Ashley. The more she drank, the more she could feel the cold steel of the bars pushing more tightly into her soft flesh, wedging her in place even more so. Any form of decorum or decency was ignored, as during her feeding she could feel hands all over her body, groping her belly, ass and even her big juicy breasts (which were almost completely exposed as her school shirt could barely cover them). As the alcohol flooded her system, Ashley began to lose her inhibitions, and though she hated it she could feel her nipples becoming erect as her mammoth titties were played with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlublublubbglerrrpp\u201d Ashley babbled as she sucked down what seemed to be a chocolate milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a hand caress her thunder thighs, brushing higher until it disappeared under her tartan mini skirt and tickled her clitoris through her panties. She went wet almost immediately at the touched, her moans muffled by the never ending cocktail of calories being forced down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever run from me again you fat bitch\u201d Growled Lauren in her ear, and Ashley knew the finger playing with her privates was hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gurgled and groaned as she felt a few seams pop in her shirt under her armpits, and a few others on her mini skirt as her body swelled with fat. When a further 4 pounds had been forced onto her (putting her at 184lbs) she felt the hand pull away from her crotch, much to her disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley?\u201d Said Hilary \u201cIs that you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look disgusting... especially in that ridiculous outfit... your a whale!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words might have stung Ashley if she weren't so full and drunk, and she merely stared back with a vacant yet sexual lying aroused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HICCURRRRP!!!\" She bellowed suddenly, and everybody present laughed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA button then pinged off the top of her insanely tight school shirt, allowing her glorious rack to bulge even further outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous!\" Said Hillary,  not even trying to hide her disgust now \"I'm ashamed to be your sister...

Im sorry\" Stammered Hilary, her confidence leaving her as she withered under Laurens gaze \"I didn't mean any disrespect at all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder\" Mused Lauren cutting Hilarys grovelling short \"How such a stuck up Princess like you will fare on the breadline once your father's career is in ruins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't tell my parents anything.. I... I promise\" Said Hilary, her fear palpable at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I believe you, but the question is... is that enough?\" Said Lauren darkly, clearly enjoying the sight of the stunning girl trembling under her gaze \"You see Hilary, I have been getting a little bored of tormenting this worthless, disgusting fat whale. She's my fat slave, I own every ounce of her disgusting flab...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke she poked, slapped and squeezed at Ashleys numerous fat rolls, making her jiggle and moan softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now I have you as well\" She continued before smirking \"It'll be fun to feed a new face... ruin a new perfect body... you can be my brand new slave... what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. erm thanks... for the offer\" Said Hilary, clearly horrified at the prespect \"But Im ok... in fact I'd better go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, shouldn't have phrased that as a question\" Said Lauren blocking Hilarys path \"You either do as I say, or your father's career is done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't... hurrrrppp... have come here sis...\" Mumbled the fat form of Ashley, still wedged tightly in place next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up fatass\" Said Lauren before stuffing a donut into her mouth which she lathargically chewed and swallowed \"But your fat cow of a sister does have a point... oh well, now you belong to me like she does\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilary looked truly horrified at the statement and shrunk under the intimating stare of the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... please Lauren..  please don't make me fat like her...\" Hilary begged backing away \"you can have my sister, do whatever you want with her... I won't tell anyone I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha though I am amused by how quickly you betrayed this fat idiot, I'm afraid not\" Said Lauren before grabbing the cowering beauty by the wrist \"Come with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being younger, Laurens strength far outmatched Hilarys, and poor dark skinned beauty was practically dragged across the dance floor and shoved into a chair. While she continued to argue against this new proposition, Hilary was tied to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just going to be an introduction to your new life, so you know what to expect going forward\" Explained Lauren \"It might seem hard, but you can ask your fat disgusting whale of a sister that you'll get used to it... in time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd funnel was then attached to the stunning girls mouth, muffling any further complaints or pleas she might have, leaving her to mull over the full horror of her fate... and the prospect of becoming a big fat cow like her not so little sister. Meanwhile the \"NOT so little sister\" in question was still surrounded by strangers and school friends alike. Thankfully for her the feeding had stopped while they pondered her current predicament; that being her fat body wedged inbetween the metal poles between the dance floor and bar. After a few minutes of having her fat rolls poked, squeezed and generally felt up, a jock she knew from school called out to the bar staff for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need some butter over here, stat!\" He yelled and the barstaff came running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lucky at least that Ashley was far past tipsy at this point, because she would have truly Mortified at what came next, despite how low she had sunk since this whole process had begun. Soon her tormentors were rubbing the butter around the fat folds of her now 185 pound body, taking special care to poke, grope and squeeze them as much as possible as if to remind Ashley how fat she had gotten. She had gained so much so quickly that it still felt strange having her fat rubbed, as she had been so used to being perfectly slim all her life. The hands made their way up and down her body, the state of her poorly fitting school uniform (which was barely covering her at all at this point) allowing them to explore her bare flesh a lot easier. She felt their fingers inbetween her ebony fat bulges and the metal bars of her prison, but it seemed that special attention was being paid to glorious titties. In her drunken haze this made a kind of sense as the metal bar was wedged between her titanic cleavage, but it made less sense how much attention her nipples were getting. As her nipples became erect and covered in butter, she felt fingers exploring her impressive ghetto booty, her thunder thighs and then her nether regions. She gasped at the touch, opening her eyes for just long enough to see Hilarys force feeding begin, and somehow the thought of her and her sisters fate turned her on. She tried to ignore it, but was quite hard to do so with so many hands exploring her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She found herself face to face with Lauren, her head spinning with alcohol and self deprecating sadistic sexual pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting fat slut\" She growled causing Ashley to bite her lip, what little self control she still had being used to keep her fingers from her nether regions from the blunt insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unpleasant smile spread across Laurens face as she watched the humiliated fat beauty, who was basically naked at this point with her flesh glistening in the strobe lights from the butter.

Have you actually started to enjoy your own humiliation and disgusting weight gain you fat cow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshleys lip trembled which gave Lauren the confirmation she needed. She grabbed her hand and slowly pushed it down towards her nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you want it you fat bitch\" Crooned Lauren as Ashley could hold back no longer \"Look at your proud beautiful sister... this is your life from now on, your only purpose is to amuse me and become immobile whales that no man will ever want again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley moaned at the words and the sight of Hilary receiving the feeding of a life time and Lauren embraced her in an open mouth kiss. For the rest of the night both of the Banks girls were thoroughly humiliated, though one was clearly quite into it at this point. Ashley was shoved around the dancefloor, enduring yet more heavy handed feedings, while being groped with no shame. Hilary sat truly miserable, feeling her once so perfectly slim tummy expand outward against her sexy dress, the uncomfortable feeling of fullness she felt not resulting in any mercy from her feeders. The rest of the night was a complete blur of humiliation and forced fattening from complete strangers from the once so proud Banks sisters. At 3am the two were finally led from the club, each needing help to walk (Ashley needing more helpers due to the sheer amount of weight she had gained at the hands of her sadistic school bully). Ashley was basically naked at this point, as the torn remnants of her insanely tight slutty school uniform barely covered any of her voluptuous fat rolls. The two were bundled into a taxi by Lauren and her friends, where they were driven back to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

So just try one pastry per box, one bite should be enough to define quality. I'll be out front if you need me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie then smiled and left the room as Hilary snapped out of her trance and nodded back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess I'd better get started\" Said Hilary, obviously looking forward to taste the sweet smelling confectionaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a box at random, opening it and finding about 8, heavily sprinkled and frosted donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, these look great\" She exclaimed \"I wonder if they taste as good as they look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit into the first donut, and her eyes widened as she tasted the delicious light pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ma godd\" She said through the mouthful of donut, before swallowing and cramming the rest into her mouth in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to anybody else that would have signaled the end of the tasting for this particular box, as Hilary had clearly confirmed the quality. But of course Hilary lacked the common sense possessed by most, and as her mind had wondered when Angie had explained this simple point she thought nothing of it as she grabbed her second donut from the box. This donut disappeared even quicker than the first, and it wasn't long until she was holding an empty box populated by a couple of crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well those certainly passed the taste test!\" She said, stifling a cute hiccough before her eyes fell on another box on the shelf \"Now, what's next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis box housed a number of attractive looking bear claws, which she now dug into with vigour. Flakes of pastry stuck around the edges of her mouth as she munched her way through the box, which she licked off upon swallowing the last bite. Already Hilary had consumed way more than her body was used to, as her usual meals her were very light and small in order to keep the figure she was so proud of and every guy lusted after. She felt the confectionaries lump in her stomach, making her feel bloated and tired as she looked up at the heavily populated shelves, knowing her job had only just begun. She groaned as she stood, approaching the next box on the shelf. Already she wanted to quit, as the thought of eating another bite made her feel slightly queasy, but something stopped her. She knew that her almost diva-esque life of leisure was somewhat of a running joke in the Banks household, so more than anything she wanted to prove that she was capable of holding down a job and not merely giving up at the first hurdle. She grabbed the next box and found 8 large chocolate muffins staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Though the dress had always been pretty tight (which was part of its charm she felt) she couldn't shake the feeling that it now felt ever so slightly tighter than it had done earlier. She pulled the dress out from her bosom a little (as much as the tight fabric would allow) and readjusted her bra underneath, which also felt a little snug.

Her hand unconsciously dropped to the bottom of her short dress as she spoke, tugging it downward as now that area was beginning to feel strangely snug. Little did poor (and rather clueless) Hilary know but now her ass and hips were beginning to grow outward, which was slowly making her dress tighter and tighter. Hilary frowned as she looked out into the audience, as she heard hushed talking which was gradually spreading among them. She looked around her as the hushed whispers even spread to the film crew and finally her guests, who she turned around to address in annoyance. Hilarys growing rear end was now being broadcast to every viewer watching at home (including her own family), and the exact moment was caught when Hilary finally became aware of her expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell?!?\" Hilary screamed, her hands clasping the bulging flesh of her butt cheeks in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt how her ass now stuck out noticeably behind her, and was still obviously growing. The fabric of her dress was creaking from the growing pressure and was becoming so tight it was beginning to look like it was merely painted over her booty. Her hands then rose to her hips, which she suddenly noticed were also growing outward against the tightening confines of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no\" She said to herself in disbelief, her face going red from embarrassment under the shocked stares of everybody in the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer widening hips were becoming almost child bearing, and this coupled with how top heavy she was was giving her a gorgeous hour glass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo...

Luckily she had managed to locate a long trench coat which, despite her new diameters, covered her quite well. This didn't stop the fact however that by the time she'd reached home her sexy dress was nothing more than torn rags. She hurried inside the Banks mansion, running straight to her room to avoid seeing any of her family in her current condition. When she had closed and locked her bedroom door Hilary stood in front of her bedroom mirror and carefully undid the large overcoat that hid her body. When she had last checked her watch a couple of minutes ago she had about twenty minutes to wait until the formula Amy had given her took effect and turned her back to normal, so in the mean time she was curious as to how she looked. Her eyes almost bulged out of her head as she examined her new extreme curves that had completely decimated her dress. Her tits were absolutely insane, and it was a wonder how her bra remained in tact (as it barely contained them at all and creaked ominously) as they were at least a size D and bulged above and below the straining cups. Though he breasts were truly amazing it was Hilarys new booty that would no doubt catch everybodys eye, as its diameters seemed impossible, almost cartoon like in their extremeties. If Hilary had been a large woman her new giant ass would have seemed almost feasible, but due to how slim she was her new hourglass figure was even more exaggerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" She said in a mixture of horror and something almost akin to amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands down her abdomen, feeling how dramatically her hips widened after that. As she did get watch timed down to the hour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoosebumps rose on her dark perfect skin from her touch, a feeling which slowly reverberated deep inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" She moaned softly as she groped her bulging body, her pupils dilating as the pleasurable feelings grew within her loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments Hilary was lost. Any sudden realizations that Amy had in fact betrayed her were buried deep within her subconscious by the new feelings that were growing in her by the second. She explored her new body more and more vigorously, loving the feeling of her new enlarged assets. She groped her large, soft breasts playing with her nipples that had become obviously erect against the fabric of her tight bra. It didn't take long for one hand to find its way past her torn garments and panties to her tingling privates, and she bit her lip when she reached there. She could feel that her lips were also becoming larger, growing into luscious blow job lips, which only turned her on more. For about ten minutes Hilary explored her bulging body while simultaneously touching herself until there was a sudden, huge explosion of pleasure in her nether regions. The orgasm took her off guard and was among the most powerful she'd ever experienced, so much so she feel backwards landing on her large cushioned derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UHNNNNNN!! OHHHHH!! YUUU... YESSSSSS!! OOO!!\" She practically screamed, unable to control the volume of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay panting on the floor, her back at an angle due to her booty lifting her from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

As she stood she couldn't help but touch herself, the feeling of her hands feeling her cartoonishly hour glass figure making her go moist again and moan. Before she could get too lost in her own growing dark desires she heard the knock at the front door that she was waiting for. She bit her plump lip when she struggled a little getting through the doorway, her expanded booty brushing the frame as she squeezed through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my my my\" Said Amy after giggling at the sight of Hilarys bloated and exaggerated new figure \"Well look at you! What a bloated bimbo you've become!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess so\" Said Hilary suddenly feeling self conscious and ashamed of herself \"Um... So do you have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here baby\" Said Amy, reading Hilarys mind \"I got what you need right here... But first, how badly do you want this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....

She walks over to the table and grabs a few handfuls of the fat cakes and starts cramming them into Sam's mouth. Sam looks too weak to stop her and so allows Carly to force feed her and she closes her eyes as she eats. Sam's belly is looking very bloated as it pokes out from under her top against the tight button on her jeans.

Sam was beginning to think that Carly was getting way too into this whole gaining weight thing, as throughout the feeding she had been shouting at her like a drill sergeant. Carly was even dressed like a drill sergeant today, as she wore a light brown shirt with military patches on it, a brown sergeants hat and short skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Sam\" Came a familiar voice \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked up groggily though still managing a look of anger as she saw Freddie standing there.

Ms. Briggs was droning on and on about punctuation or something or other but Sam wasn't really listening, instead she was slumped untidelly in her chair completely zoned out in thought. She was thinking of the connotations of her decision to gain weight, and her idea to involve Carly in the process. Truth be told she wanted to call the whole thing off, as not only did she not really want to be fat but the thought of a month of Carly's constant beratements and feedings made her feel miserable and queasy. The only thing stopping her backing out was her pride, as the thought to losing to Freddie turned her stomach completely upside down. Suddenly a voice spoke over the intercom which made her jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam Puckett, please come to the Principles office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam groaned wondering what she had done now, completely unaware that it was actually Freddie (who had managed to hack into the com feed) putting on a deeper voice. Sam got up moodily from her seat and excited the room moodily as Ms. Briggs gave her a disapproving look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid school...\" She mumbled gloomily, dragging her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!!!\" Yelled Carly who was hiding behind a locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam almost jumped out of her skin as Carly practically tackled her, shoving her into an empty classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ca...

As she was fed Freddie entered the room, closing the door carefully behind him. He was carrying a huge, industrial sized pot of custard which he had taken from the cafeteria. He raised his eyebrows at her, pulling an 'uh oh' face as she merely stared back in weary misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ohhh\" Said Carly, pushing the final pastry into her mouth \"Come on private, stuff this greedy buns silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir yes sir!\" Said Freddie with a salute grabbing a funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam whimpered, her fatigued gaze showing fear as the funnel was inserted into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I been told\" Chanted Carly as Freddie lifted the huge pot toward the funnel \"But Sammy being thin is gettin mighty old! How old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mighty old!\" Freddie chimed in, feeling a bulge downstairs as he hefted the thick fattening custard down the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of frenzied gulping now filled the room, as Freddies manhood throbbed in his pants. He couldn't believe how perfectly things were going, as lived out his fantasy. He couldn't resist eyeing up Sams belly, which was bulging against her tightening belt as it filled up its confines being tested. Carly decided that this wasn't enough, and proceeded to tip down her own mixture (the special one which she had told Sam she would consume every hour) and Sams eyes widened at the sheer amount being forced into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Carly...\" Said Freddie, almost in awe at the bloated belly dome stretching Sams clothing \"That is one stuffed belly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly stroked it softly, feeling how taut it was and Sam groaned between gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...

This was incredibly difficult, as Sam was way past full and didn't have the strength to walk so Carly and Freddie practically had to carry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girl\" Said Carly, getting back into character \"Lets get you back to class\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Uhhhraaaappp...\" Mumbled Sam, her belly groaning with each step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie was trying his best to stop his erection from poking Sams exhausted form as they approached the doorway of Ms. Briggs classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look lively Sam\" Whispered Freddie as he and Carly let go of her, allowing her to stand under her own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam merely groaned in response shooting each of them, a weary look which still managed to house the message \"I hate you all\". She staggered into the classroom like a deer on a frozen lake, vaguely pulling down her top which had ridden up her bloated belly displaying her pale flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay there Sam?\" Said Ms. Briggs, her eyebrow raised as Sam stumbled toward her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea-uuurrrrpppp\" Exclaimed Sam, catching herself off guard and everybody laughed \"Everythings-hiccc-fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down heavily, resting her head wearily on the table and groaned miserably. Ms. Briggs would have pursued the issue, but the fact was she didn't like Sam at all and honestly didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day Carly,Freddie and Sam wee filming another episode of iCarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright iCarly fans, as you may remember last week, Sam here got a very special challenge off you guys!\"Said Carly at the camera with her usual chirpy enthusiasm, indicating to Sam who was stood next to her \"Isn't that right Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah that's right\" Replied Sam, seemingly having trouble matching Carlys enthusiasm \"The viewers set me with the task of gaining 210lbs in one month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly and Freddie exchanged amused glances at Sams tone, obviously not enjoying the challenge as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a daring challenge i think you'll agree!\" Said Carly, clearly enjoying herself \"And since then Sam here has really been stuffing her greedy face silly to reach that goal weight! Isn't that right Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Said Sam, shifting uncomfortably as Freddie wheeled over a large set of scales that you might find at a fun fayre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets see how much that extreme gluttony has paid off!\" Said Carly \"Climb up onto the scales Sammy my girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed but obeyed, stepping up onto the scale and watching the needle on the readout climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now before all this extreme gluttony Sam here weighed a meger 115lbs\" Said Carly as she watched the needle climb with interest \"And now she weighs... 123lbs! That's a gain of eight pounds! Not bad for a days work... However if you want to reach your goal weight Sammy, your going to have to do better than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam mumbled a none committal response, miserable that not only was she being forced to get fatter but even then she might still lose the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please step off the scale\" Ordered Carly \"Lets get a look at you... Show the viewers your weight gain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again Sam stepped off the scale, and lifted up her tip to expose her midriff to the cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it\" Said Carly examining her friends stomach for any signs of the weight gain \"Now stand side on to the camera... As you may be able to see iCarly fans, there is a subtle bulge to Sams belly that I can tell you was not there before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly patted her friends belly, proceeding to grab and jiggle the small amount of fat that had accumulated there. Freddie looked on from behind the camera, completely entranced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. Not hugely obvious yet\" Said Carly thoughtfully \"But notice how I say 'yet' iCarly fans, as I predict big changes over the coming weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

We had a good show, now it's time to hit the sack for me.\" Sam headed for the exit when Carly slammed the door in front of her, \"What's going-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, maggot!

Suddenly an ad popped up on his screen, \"I thought this virus-scanner got rid of them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was milliseconds from clicking out of it, when he released it was an ad for a weight gain enhancer, \"And it's cheap too.

Eat!\" Carly barked at Sam to eat the Spaghetti tacos faster and faster even while shoving more into Sam's mouth. \"You need to gain as much as possible. Remember, I'm doing this outta love, Sam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrph.\" Sam chewed through more tacos and slowly felt her stomach reaching the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you wanna prove the fans wrong you little sissy? Don't you wanna be right? The you have to be at the right weight! Get eating more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam reluctantly scarfed down the last few spaghetti tacos, \"Urp, I'm, ugh, finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly smirked, \"You saved room for desert, didn't you?\" From behind the counter, she produced a whole factory box sizes of Fat Cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not done until I say you're done, maggot.\"</span></div></div>",

For poor Sam it felt like there was barely a ten minute gap before another relentless stream of fattening goodies were being forced into her belly. Her weight grew at a much faster rate to match the relentless feedings she endured, and pretty soon her appetite grew as well. Carly took full advantage of this, as the feedings themselves got larger as Sams endurance improved. Freddie was in heaven, as he was able to witness his deepest fantasy numerous times a day. In between feedings he could see Sam staggering down the school hallways, groaning and clutching her very full stomach, and he couldn't help teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking chubby there Puckett\" Her mocked, poking her belly which made her wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrrrrppp\" Was the only response she offered before shuffling away to her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now Friday, three days later from her first weighing live on the show. Each day had shown a phenomenal five pound rise in weight each day until now and it was really beginning to show. She felt every pound of the 133 that now padded her body, as she was having a hard time fitting into her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on damn you!\" She said, grimacing as she pulled and struggled with her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried sucking in the small flesh dome that was her new belly but try as she might she could not force the button through the hole (the button itself incidently had had to be sewn back on the other day, as one particularly gluttonous day had popped it off). Truth be told her belly wasn't huge, but to Sam it felt that way as she wasn't used to carrying an ounce of fat on her body. Now she was softer all over and her clothes clung to her uncomfortably... She didn't like it. Finally she managed to get the button in the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeahhh!\" She yelled in triumph, throwing her arms in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was short lived triumph however as the animated gesture pushed her tummy outward and off popped the button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" She said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end she had to use a drawing pin to connect the flaps of her trousers, which would do she thought until she bought more clothes in a larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

By this point Carly had gotten so into her role that it seemed like she never left it, as if she wasn't stuffing poor Sam silly she was yelling at her and poking fun at her weight. Sam was getting really tired of it and as she endured her breakfast feeding she vowed she would somehow turn the tables on her so called friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on blubber butt Puckett!\" Yelled Carly as she forced her to eat quicker and quicker \"Pick up the pace! Lets get you bigger and fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrpp! Yeah we'll see... Mrrrff\" Sam said darkly to herself, as her growing belly popped open her pants yet again, breaking the safety pin which had kept them closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went in a way that Sam was now accustomed to, with every few hours being met with a large feeding session. Sam just zoned out during these sessions now, just focusing on chewing and swallowing and just ignoring the constant fat jokes from Carly and Freddie. When the day was over Sam once again found herself stuffed to her limits, and she staggered to the set of iCarly weakly holding her buttonless pants so that they didn't fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now i Carly fans its that moment you've all been waiting for! How fat is Sam?\" Said Carly excitedly to the camera \"On the scales Sam you chubber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam offered a resigned sigh before stepping on the scales and the numbers began to rise. Carly gave a low whistle at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"140 pounds! That's a gain of seven pounds my Puckett piglet!\" Yelled Carly \"Now lets show that off shall we? Please step behind the screen and put on what you find there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gloomily obeyed, walking behind the screen which had been set up to block her from the camera. Her eyes widened with horror when she found a skimpy bikini there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to pay for this Carly\" Growled Sam, before stripping naked and donning the sexy black bikini \"Mark my frickin words!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sam emerged from behind the screen Freddie's jaw nearly hit the ground, and he had to cross his legs to hide his excitement at what he saw. Now Sam could no longer hide behind clothes (tight though they may have been) her gain was way more obvious and Carly grinned like a Cheshire cat at the sight of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, that's quite a belly you got there Puckett\" Said Carly as Freddie salivated \"Why don't you flaunt it for the fans? Go on, pose and give it a jiggle fatty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam scowled at her but nevertheless began preforming sexy poses, allowing the viewers to get a good look at her new body from every possible angle her face glowing red with embarrassment as she did. She could feel that the bikini was too small as she posed, as it pinched her body uncomfortably squashing her breasts and riding up her butt. The majority of the weight was definitely sitting around her belly, as it was now an unmistakable pot belly which stuck out a little even when she sucked it in. Apart from this however her breasts, ass and thighs were also filling out nicely, each of them having a nice wobble each time she moved. It was around the point of Carly grabbing Sams belly and giving it a good jiggle for the camera that Sam finally snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Yelled Sam suddenly, which caused a slight ripple over her chunky body \"This has gone on long enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Sam do?</span></div></div>",

But i don't think the iCarly fans would want to see that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Freddie cleared his throat to get the girls attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Carly\" He said, an ear piece in his ear for answering phonecalls \"The calls are going crazy right now... Seems that your fans really want to see you take this challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly gulped as Sam smiled widely, knowing that there was now no way out for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening...\" Muttered Carly, suddenly scowling at Freddie when she noticed a ghost of a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew this was a dream come true for him, and she hated the fact that her fortunes had changed so dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your answer is?\" Demanded Sam, looking surprisingly cocky considering that she was stood in a bikini showing off her growing body to everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Carly finally said through gritted teeth \"Ill do the stupid challenge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooo!\" Cheered Sam, jumping up and down causing her full breasts to jiggle and bounce (much to Freddies delight) \"You heard her folks!

Normally she would have gone for the healthy option like perhaps a few slices of wholemeal toast, or a half grapefruit but after yesterday she knew her eating habits had to change. Laid out in front of her was a hearty stack of pancakes dripping with butter and maple syrup, along with a plate of pop tarts of varying flavors. With a sigh she dug in, figuring that her best bet to finish it all would be to eat as quickly as possible. Even using this method was difficult however, as her body was just simply not used to eating such large quantities of food. She forced herself on pay the halfway point but then had to stop. She sat back in her chair panting, holding her full tummy and moaning softly at the amount she'd just eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goohood morning\" Said Spencer cheerfully as he entered the kitchen \"How are you today? Ready to take on the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrrppp\" Replied Carly, her eyes half shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, that's very unladylike young lady\" Said Spencer frowning, \"Had somebody been a bit of a piggy this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc... Sam... Challenged... Weight gain... Urrrrp\" Said Carly, her voice weak and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh yes I saw the show\" Said Spencer gravely \"And I saw her on it... Looks like the little porker is a little ahead of you... But fear not! I will help you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Hiccc... Spencer no... Mrrrfff!!\" Stammered Carly before her well meaning brother forced a chocolate pop tart into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly sat back in her chair, a miserable expression on her face as Spencer force fed her the rest of her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly arrived at school, only just on time as it had been hard going being forced to finish her breakfast. She staggered down the hall, her very full belly emitting rather unhappy noises as she went. On the way she saw the familiar form of her friend turned rival Sam, who was also sporting a noticeably (decidedly larger) bloated belly. She didn't appear to be in as much discomfort as Carly was however and she smiled when she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw hey Carly, having trouble there?\" She said with a grin \"I guess that teeny tiny belly of yours can't hold much yet... But don't worry, it gets easier over time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly muttered something under her breath before staggering off for her first lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Sam was actually enjoying herself for the first time all week, as though she didn't particularly enjoy the prospect of putting on weight and getting fat she really enjoyed how miserable Carly was to be in the same position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovin the new bloated belly look\" Teased Sam and Carly glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bite me\" Replied Carly and Sam smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were walking along until they were stopped by two other girls. Sam and Carly exchanged worried glances at the look of purpose the girls possessed, as they opened their backpacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go team Carly!\" They said before they began shovelling food from their bags into poor Carlys unsuspecting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed, part relief and amusement as she watched the two girls give Carly the feeding of a lifetime. Carly didn't resist though she clearly didn't appreciate the girls being on her 'team'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo! Team Carly!\" Yelled Sam with deliberately exaggerated enthusiasm while Carly gave her a miserable look as fattening pastries were forced past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched on happily as the girls emptied their food bags into Carlys ever inflating belly, before yelling \"Yay Team Carly!\" and leaving. Carly groaned and leant against a nearby locker as belly made similar noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so good being on the other end is it?\" Gloated Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Team Sam!\" Came a group of voices from behind Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?... Oh crap...\" Said Sam as she saw a group of five school goers each baring the same expression as the girls who fed Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Carlys exhausted incapacitated state she raised an eyebrow, giving Sam an amused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... Hiccc.. Turn\" She said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was fed twice as hard as Carly had just been, though luckily she had more experience in it. The group chanted Sams name as Carly laughed, every now and then giving a weak hiccup as a result of her own feeding. Even by the standard that had been set over the week the feeding Sam endured was intense, and she struggled to keep up with each fat cake, donut or whatever else the group stuffed into her mouth. Sam groaned, already feeling full after a morning spent stuffing her face as more was crammed into her bloated belly.<br>\r\n..............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since starting iCarly, Carly and Sam really began to regret how large their fan base actually was throughout the school. It seemed as though almost everybody was either on Team Carly or Team Sam respectively, and they each wanted their girl to win the challenge. This was being achieved by groups of their classmates giving each of them a serious feeding, sometimes even doing so simultaneously as though they couldn't actually decide which girl they wanted to win. Frendie wondered along in the girls wake in a state of almost complete delirium, watching as their walk turned into more of a zig zagging stagger as they were stuffed more and more. When the rang signalling the end of lunch both girls were sat slumped against some lockers, having only been able to make it to the end of the hall due to the constant feedings. The girls exchanged weary looks, a half eaten fat cake protruding from each of their mouths as their last group of fans left for their next class. Freddie now approached the defeated forms of his friends, a gleeful expression on his face as he ducked down to their eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\" He said \"Let me help you with that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully pushed the two protruding cakes into the girls exhausted mouths, making them chew and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ullp! Uhhhraaapp!!\" They both exclaimed after swallowing and their inflated bellies caused the top buttons to be fired off their pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww!\" Yelled Freddie as the buttons bounced off his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Both girls were now wearing bikinis to show off any new weight that had been gained, just as Sam had the night before and they were each stood on a large set of scales. The day had been a very hard one for both girls (perhaps even harder for Carly as she was not used to being force fed so much) and they both still looked a little weary from all the 'fan support' they had experienced at school. Freddie gave the signal that they were now broadcasting live and the girls both sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. Hi ICarly fans!\" Said Carly, doing her best to seem happy and positive \"Welcome to the show... As you can see we're just going to get stuck in to this... Um, very popular challenge you have set us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thanks for that\" Said Sam glumly \"Not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" Said Carly \"My scale reads... 119... So that's a gain of about 8 pounds... What does yours say Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man are you friggin kiddin me?!\" Exclaimed Sam in horror \"147 pounds!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly sniggered at this, happy that Sam was so far ahead of her weight wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you can see guys\" Began Carly, already sounding more positive \"The gain isn't particularly obvious on me... However my good friend Sam Puckett here is beginning to get a nice lil belly... Why don't you model it for them, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam particularly growled at this suggestion, her eyes full of animosity before she reluctantly obeyed. She stood side on to the camera so the viewers (and a rather excited Freddie) could see the bulge of her tummy more clearly. It wasn't gigantic but it was definitely becoming more prominent and noticeable as it bulged the waistband of her bikini bottoms. This wasn't get only prominent feature however, as their legion of fans were discovering as Sam preformed different model stances to show off her curves. She was also developing a rather meaty pair of thighs and booty, as well as a juicy pair of tits that seemed a little too large for the bikini top that covered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, happy now?\" Said Sam grumpily, \"Congratulations I'm getting fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly giggled to herself, but was stopped as she saw Freddie waving his hands to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh guys?\" He said, his excitement barely under wraps \"The phones are going crazy... The fans have proposed a bit of a game for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Said Carly, her positive mood dwindling \"What game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Replied Freddie delicately \"It seems like they want to feed each other... while stood on the scales. The first one to make the other gain ten extra pounds... Um... Wins\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly frowned, giving Freddie a scrutinous look as she had heard no phone calls at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have no food here...\" She began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah we do\" Said Freddie pulling a sheet from a nearby table, revealing a monstrous buffet of fattening foods \"I figured, you know... Just in case\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that\" Said Carly narrowing her eyes \"Very quick thinking Freddie... But i don't think that we should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, what's the matter Carly?\" Chimed in Sam suddenly \"Are you chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nno.. No.. Im.. I just..\" Stammered Carly, clearly looking for a way out \"Oh fine! Lets do this! I'm going to stuff your stupid face Puckett!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on\" Said Sam as Freddie pushed the table over to them and she grabbed a large Danish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was clearly scared of Sams fiery attitude, but she wasn't given long to you'll about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready set go!\" Offered Freddie very quickly, catching Carly completely off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait I'm not-Mrrrfff!\" Carly attempted to complain but was cut off by Sam vigorously stuffing the Danish into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shuddup! We'll see who the fatass is around here when I'm done with you!\" Roared Sam, forcing as much food as physically possible into her friends mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly vaguely tried to fight Sam off her but it was no use, Sam had clearly been aching to do this for some time. Freddie was awe struck at what he was witnessing, wondering what everybody watching would make of seeing the two gorgeous bikini clad girls feed each other. Carly desperately reached her hand around blindly as she was stuffed silly, finally grasping at a fat cake which she shoved into Sams mouth giving herself a moments break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't let me stop you Puckett!\" Growled Carly \"Eat up lard butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly began her own feeding attack as Sam was taken aback, using two hands to stuff as much into her mouth as possible. For awhile Carly now had the upper hand, as she fed her friend relentlessly preventing any retaliation. Freddie continued filming as the numbers on Sams scale rose from 147 to 148, signalling an extra pound being added to her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Carlys in the lead!\" Announced Freddie, practically licking his lips as one of his deepest darkest fantasies played out before him \"Sam has gained an extra pound! Only nine to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sams ability to fight became less and less effective as Carly roughly stuffed more and more food into her friends mouth, clearly relishing the moment of doing so live on air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it blubberbutt Pucket\" Carly whispered into her bloated, bikini clad friends ear as she stuffed another handful of fat cake past her lips \"Just accept your new life as a big fat glutton\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scales rose from 149 to an even 150 as Sam ate and ate, now longer fighting back at all. Carly was thoroughly enjoying herself, as much as Freddie was enjoying the sight of Sams belly growing. Her stuffed belly obviously bulged out onto her naked thighs and her breasts bulged above her bikini top, which was clearly a little too small. Carly was paying less attention to what she was actually doing, as she began show boating to the audience watching the show. She grabbed Sams belly and squeezed and shook it, causing it to jiggle and wobble for the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as you can see iCarly fans!\" Said Carly, proceeding her feeding operation without even looking at poor Sam \"Yours truly is teaching poor little Sam here a lesson... Never try and fatten me-Ulppp!?-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly had taken her eyes off Sam for too long, and just as Sam swallowed her current mouthful of cake sending the scales to 151 she launched her counter attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying? Urrrp\" Said Sam, her voice weary but her expression angry and determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had just been weathering the storm, confident in the food capacity of her growing belly to take the feeding and wait for her moment to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ohhh\" Freddie jeered from behind the camera and Carly stared back looking distraught with half a fat cake poking from her lips which was promptly pushed into her mouth by Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam used her new girth to overpower Carly and before long she shared the same fate that Sam had only moments ago. Freddie loved the back and forth feeding action, the opportunity to watch the two gorgeous girls definitely causing sexual excitement he was currently failing to hide. He crossed his leg to block his crotch as Carlys scale hit 120 when she swallowed a particularly large mouthful of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nrrrff! Please stop Sammmrrfff!\" Carly attempted to wail as she struggled in vain against her surprisingly strong friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now\" Scolded Sam \"Don't talk with your mouthful... Soon we will have to call this show iFatty hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we could probably call it that right now Sam\" Said Freddie, obviously hinting at her own weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that butt brain?\" Said Sam hotly, obviously feeling self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...\" Said Freddie obviously losing his confidence \"Nothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wiiiide my soon to be chubby little friend\" Crooned Sam, turning her attention back to Carly \"Lets get you nice and fat for school tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly pouted (a look which was much more cute than she intended due to her cheeks bulging with food) as Sam continued to stuff her silly. The scales creaked below Carly as the arrow moved from 121, to 122, to 123 as Carly was fed at a relentless pace. At the 124 lbs mark Sam was showboating, just as Carly had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Carly\" Said Sam gleefully, playing with the slight paunch of her friends belly \"What happened to your slim tummy? Looks like its been replaced with this chubby belly! What a greedy girl you've been!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Carly was reaching her hands around frantically until she finally gripped two handfuls of the cakes, which with extreme effort she forced into Sams mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh counter attack!\" Whooped Freddie \"What a back and forth battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie had no doubt that the audience was on the edge of their seats, and he could see that their viewing figures were increasing steadily by the second. Carly was now back in the force feeding fight, but Sam was far from finished and she continued to stuff Carly silly as Carly returned the favour with renewed vigour. In unison Carly and Sam packed on another pound each, putting Carly at 125 and Sam at 152.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam is in the lead!\" Said Freddie \"Come on Carly! Is that best you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut-urrrrp!- Up Freddie... Mrrrf\" Mumbled Carly as the feeding continued and she felt the cakes lumping in her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie couldn't take his eyes off the gorgeous girls bellies, the fact that so many people could also see them (the viewing figures were still rising) seemed only to add to his arousal. Freddie's jibe seemed to give Carly more energy, as through the haze of cakes she roughly began piling more into Sams mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmrrruupp! Shtopp feeding me you goob!\" Wailed Sam, really beginning to feel full at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neverrr! Mrrrfff!\" Cried Carly as she received a mouthful of fat cake herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Carlys relentless feeding Sam soon hit 153 and then 154 on the scales, putting her in the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhoooah!\" Cried Freddie, his excitement adding to his commentary \"Carlys in the lead! Only 3 pounds to go! Have you got anymore room in that chubby belly Puckett?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'chubby belly' he was referring to was really becoming a thing of beauty. It was quickly moving past the slight pot belly stage to a gut stage, as it spilled out onto her chunky naked thighs, the waistband of her panties clearly cutting into her pale soft flesh. Freddie wanted so badly to touch it, to squeeze it... Perhaps even lick her navel... He was finding it harder and harder to hide his true intentions. While he had zoned out Sam had fired back, and had began stuffing food into poor Carlys mouth so quickly that she barely had time to chew and swallow before the next mouthful was forced in. Freddies gaze flitted to Carlys bloated belly just as she reached 126 on the scales. It was really only the amount she had eaten today that made her belly seem so large and perfect (almost pregnant) but Freddie knew it wouldn't be long before her beginner belly became as large as Sams... And he couldn't wait to witness that happening. The girls were now neck and neck as Carly hit 126 and Sam hit 155, and the pace was beginning to slow due to fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its neck and neck!\" Said Freddie \"Only two pounds to go! Come on girls, dig deep! Fight the burn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gave Freddie a rather lethargic look, each one with a comically large mouthful of fat cake, which still managed to say \"Shut up Freddie\". Clearly neither girl had any intention of losing, as though no prize or punishment had been stated for the winner or loser they could only assume based on the way things were going that there would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I urppp! Am not losing to you fatass! Mrrrfff!\" Said Sam doggedly, between mouthfuls as she dumped two heaping handfuls of her own past Carlys lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you are! Hicc!\" Cried Carly, and with surprising determination she began feeding Sam faster again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were basically collapsed onto each other at this point, their huge amount of food consumption meaning that the only way they could stay standing was by leaning on each other. The girls swayed unsteadily as each of them built up the strength to feed the other, trying not to topple to the floor in the process. Carly groaned as she lifted her head from Sams shoulder only to have another handful of cake crammed into her mouth which, upon swallowing, caused her scale to rise to 127. The viewing figures were through the roof (they had reached double their highest rating to that date) as the two exhausted girls, each too determined to give up continued to groggily feed each other. Freddie could imagine this video being played back over and over, the whole school cheering and jeering along... Maybe it would even go viral, and be a hit all over the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is it!\" Cheered Freddie, as each girl reached their final pound before the end \"One pound left to go! Who will win? Carly or Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls glared at each other, though their eyes were half closed from complete exhaustion the flame of determination was clearly visible. With the whole school (and countless others) on the edge of their seats the incredibly full and bloated bikini clad beauties did not disappoint, putting on a back and forth feeding battle right until the final pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"157\" Came the readout from Sams scale, signalling the end of the contest and Carlys victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Carlys the winnerrrr!\" Yelled Freddie, holding Carlys weak arm aloft as she merely groaned softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She groaned, her stomach churning from the piles of fat cakes that had been forced into it gloomily wondering what could possibly be in store for her next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Carly!\" Said Freddie jovially, who was practically holding Carly up at this point by her raised arm \"That was a very hard fought battle and a well deserved victory against a seasoned glutton, how are you feeling right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ulp! Urrrraaap!\" Carly swallowed the mouthful of fat cake that had remained in her mouth, and upon doing so her scale rose to 129lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh my!\" Exclaimed Freddie, his delight obvious \"It looks like our winner just couldn't help herself and packed on another pound of flab just for the enjoyment and amusement of all you viewers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh..\" Groaned Carly \"Shut up Freddie -Hiccuuurpp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Carly... Surely you have some words for your fans?\" Continued Freddie unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uhm\" Stammered Carly, apparently just becoming aware that this had all been a live episode of her show \"Well... As you can so... I won the, um, stuffing battle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without paying a price though right?\" Gloated Freddie \"Could you give everybody watching from home a nice profile shot to show off that impressive belly your sporting right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly glared at him but Freddie's smile didn't budge so she sighed and obeyed. From a side on glance Carlys belly was a thing of beauty, a beautiful dome that bloated outward almost as though she were pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very impressive\" Freddie continued, taking the opportunity to pat the sexy belly dome she now sported \"How do you feel now? Weighing 129 pounds which i know for a fact is by far the heaviest you've ever been\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your quite right\" Said Carly through gritted teeth \"But the important thing is I won... As you can clearly see from my vanquished -Hiccc- foe over here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that Carly was deflecting attention from herself, but Freddie couldn't blame her as the camera was turned into the completely defeated form of Sam. Sam was lying down, breathing heavily her amazing belly rising and falling with each laboured breath. It took an incredible amount of composure on Freddies behalf to prevent himself from, tongue slavering from his mouth, hurling himself at Sam. His blonde friend looked utterly glorious, every new pound of extra weight now looking quite obvious on her formally slim frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, up you get Puckett\" Said Freddie, taking her hand and helping her unsteadily to her feet \"Show all the viewers at home what a big, growing girl you are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam merely groaned, too lethargic and miserable to even offer a retort. Freddie positioned her side on to the camera, just how Carly had been so that the iCarly fans could  scrutinize her body. Sam blushed as Carly and Freddie took a look at her stunning new figure, and even tried to suck in her gut to make it less obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try Sam\" Said Carly shrewdly \"But your not fooling anyone here... Let that beautiful gut of yours out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly tickled her friends naked belly, causing Sam to give a cute giggle and exhale which exposed her bellys true girth to all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Said Freddie, his jaw practically hitting the floor at what he saw \"That's... Um... Quite a... Belly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she's gettin fat all right\" Said Carly, as Freddie drooled \"Ain't that right porky Puckett?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrp... Yes...\" Said Sam blearily, still blushing \"I sure am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly grabbed her friends belly, feeling the soft pale flesh squish between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can literally grab a handful of your fat rolls Sam\" Said Carly in amazement, continuing to squeeze and squash her friends flab \"I can't believe how much you've let yourself go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie couldn't pass up the chance and jumped right in, grabbing a one of her luscious love handles and playing with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right Carly...\" Said Freddie, trying to hide his arousal for the camera \"I just... Um... Had to check myself... For the viewers you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure you did dweeb\" Said Sam coldly as her belly was fondled by her friends \"I think they get the idea now anyway. I'm fat, I get it, I'm big and chubby and gross... Lets move on please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly smiled at her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw sorry Sam\" Carly crooned condescendingly \"Is someone a little embarrassed by their new flabby belly? Well okay, lets move on... To your forfeit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Sams forfeit?</span></div></div>",

I won't be allowed in school like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think that'll be a problem Porky Puckett\" Said Carly \"Principal Franklin is a big fan remember? I think he'll be just fine with it, hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Sam lamented the fact that the Principal of their school was such a fan of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" She said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Sam gloomily walked toward the school, drawing a lot of glances and funny looks as she did. For those who didn't watch the show, it appeared that an overweight teen girl was wearing a bikini that she really didn't have the figure to pull off. Sam blushed deeply under the scrutiny of her fellow students, though she was thankful that it was at least sunny today. She narrowed her eyes when she spied Carly and Freddie standing near the schools entrance, both of them bearing smirks that Sam would have loved to slap off their faces. To Sams amusement however Carlys smirk was short lived as she was suddenly surrounded by a group of boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Carlyyy!!\" They yelled enthusiastically and began stuffing her face with junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked a lot less cheerful at this, but Freddie looked positively joyful as he usual did. Sam now smirked, but alas it wasn't long until she was spotted by other enthusiastic fans of the show who, following a battle cry of \"Team Sam!\" began force feeding her to. Sam slumped against the wall right next to her friend as she had her face stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went very much as the previous day had, the one difference being that Sam was scantly clad in a sexy bikini. This outfit, or lack thereof, did exactly what Carly and Freddie had wanted... That being it showed off every new bulge of her forced weight gain. Principal Franklin had seemingly informed the other teachers the reason for Sams appearance, so apart from more than a few funny looks they didn't question her much over it. That was until the girls attended Gym, which was their second period after a morning of enthusiastic feeding from their fans. Their teacher, Mr. Burrows (our Coach Burrows as he preferred), was somewhat of a sadist (which Sam had always thought somewhat if a cliche for gym teachers), and had a rather strong dislike for anybody even remotely out of shape, let alone over weight. The class lined up in the sports hall, all dressed in their gym attire (apart from Sam of course) and Mr. Burrows stood in front giving them a scrutinizing look up and down. He stopped dead in his tracks as his gaze fell on Carly and Sam who, up until this point had been extremely slim and in shape. This was clearly no longer the case (especially Sam, her stomach currently on the mid stage of its metamorphosis into a full blown gut) and Mr. Burrows let out a low whistle at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, Miss. Shay and Miss. Puckett\" He said finally \"Of course this has already been mentioned to me by Principal Franklin, but he completely undersold it. Look at yourselves girls! Your becoming a pair of real butter balls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class sniggered to themselves at this blunt and embarrassing put down, and Sam and Carly stared at their feet (which only made them feel worse, as they were now staring at their chubby domes of bellies). Sam especially blushed deeply as she felt her sexy bikini tightly gripping her body (after the morning feedings the clasps at the back of the bikini top was particularly strained, indicating her breasts receiving some extra weight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ridiculous quite frankly... You should be ashamed\" He continued \"If I were Principal I would never tolerate such disgusting public gluttony in my school! In fact, as I'm the one in charge in this room I think I will teach you two a well needed lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat punishment does he choose?</span></div></div>",

Shay and Miss. Pucket, please step forward\" Ordered Coach Burrows \"The rest of you, please organise yourselves into two teams, one for each\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Burrows didn't know about the whole Team Sam and Team Carly dynamic, so this choice of words was a happy accident that the class clearly enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two!\" He yelled suddenly, making the girls jump and Sams bare belly jiggle slightly \"Sit up positions, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Carly reluctantly obeyed, their faces glowing red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now girls, as I said I know all about the weight gain challenge\" Coach Burrows continued \"So you won't be losing any weight, that's not the point. The point is to teach you a valuable lesson.. Class please grab a bag from the corner and stand facing your girls of choice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class obeyed, and opened bags concealing countless fat cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time you sit up you will take a bite of cake, understood?\"Asked Coach Burrows in an authorititive manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Coach\" Answered the girls miserably, again exchanging miserable glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Go!\" Yelled Coach Burrows, blowing a piecing note from his whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sports hall became full of the encouraging yells of the class, as each girl performed their first sit up and had a whole fat cake stuffed into their mouths. Sam especially could feel that the simple task of sitting up was more difficult than it had been, and to her annoyance she could feel her stomach form into a small, yet noticeable gut each time she rose to a seating position. Seeing her friends luscious new belly on display to all made Carly thankful she was fully dressed, but as she had another fat cake stuffed into her mouth she was also fearful that it wouldn't be too long until her weight caught up with and even surpassed Sams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you butter balls!\" Roared Coach Burrows as the poor girls struggled with the exercise \"You can do better than that surely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sadistic Coach clearly was not accounting for the fact that the girls were being liberally force fed during the exercise, but even so he yelled and blew his whistle each time the pace slowed. Cally and Sams classmates were a little too eager to feed them, so before long they were being throughout the entire exercise with handful after handful of fat cakes being forced down their weary throats. The girls were breathing heavily when they were finally allowed to stop, and each one of them lay prone on their backs, their forever growing breasts rising and falling with each laboured breath and a fat cake protruding from their lips as they were too exhausted to sit upright. Coach Burrows loomed over them and pushed the protruding fat cakes into their mouths forcing them to chew and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Push ups time!\" He yelled \"Assume the position\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Burrows had the class place a huge, heavily frosted triple chocolate cake under each girls face when they had groggily gotten on their hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop doing push ups when the cake is finished\" Snarled Coach Burrows before blowing his whistle \"Go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls groaned wearily before lowering themselves down to the cake, taking a bite (getting frosting all over their faces in the process) and pushing themselves back up. Sam noted how belly touched the floor before her face reached the cake, and she wondered how long it would be before she was completely obese. By the forth push up the girls arms were shaking from the exertion of holding up their own (forever ballooning) weight, and to their dismay they had barely made a dent in the cake. Finally by the tenth push up, the inevitable happened... Both girls collapsed face first into their cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was truly pathetic\" Said Coach Burrows \"Just finish your punishment cakes and we'll move on to the next exercise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sound coming from Carly and Sam was muffled groans and munching as they gorged on their huge cakes. Before the start of the ill fated weight gain competition neither girl could ever have consumed anything close to this, which was a testament to their growing appetites. When they were finally finished both girls sported large spherical domes for bellies, which were gurgling with the amount of cake they had consumed. Carly could feel that her usually loose during gym kit was rather snug, particularly over her belly and breasts so she had to keep adjusting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh\" They groaned, as their class mates pulled them back to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a round of jumping jacks, while being fed. The exercise was perfect at showing off the girls new girth, as each movement caused jiggling all over their bodies (Sams breasts bounced impressively in her forever tightening bikini). Carlys t shirt rode up her impressive, very uncharacteristic belly and stress lines were visible over her squashed tits. After what seemed like an eternity to the girls they were finally permitted to stop, as all the food had been stuffed into their huge taut bellies. The girls slunk back to the floor, completely exhausted and stuffed to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Said Coach Burrows \"I think this is the first time anybody has ever gained weight while working out. Congratulations you fat idiots. I hope you've learnt a valuable lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody laughed as the girls only offered weary burps and groans in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Carly and Sam looked extremely lethargic and disheartened as they stood on their respective scales and watched the numbers rise. By all accounts it had been a very hard day, as both girls had seen a steep increase in members for both \"Team Sam\" and \"Team Carly\", which in turn meant a steep increase in the amount of feedings they had to endure. What made things worse (if that were even possible) was that now the feedings were not even solely confined to the school hallways, as they now occurred in the girls lessons to the enjoyment of a much larger audience. Their teachers had clearly all been briefed by Principle Franklin about the competition, so they either turned a blind eye to it or actively participated in it (as their gym teacher had, much to their embarrassment). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read em out then girls\" Said Freddie with a grin, clearly reveling in his increased participation in the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh 137! Are you kidding me?\" Said Carly sullenly \"I gained 8 pounds in one day!... I mean, yeah thanks for that guys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show the viewers then\" Demanded Freddie \"Lets see your new chub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly growled an unintelligible response, her cheeks pink as she lifted up her top to show a side on view of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" Said Freddie, licking his lips as he reached out a lustful hand to feel his friends protruding belly \"I can certainly feel a change here... It's nice and soft now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie poked and jiggled the extra pounds of flab that had accumulated around Carlys mid section, clearly getting lost in his lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok!\" Yelled Carly finally \"I think they get the point Freddie; I'm getting fat, can you please move on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie turned his amused gaze on Sam clad in her tight bikini, who merely stared at the scales she stood on in mute horror. He couldn't help chuckling to himself at the fact the Sam was clearly sucking in her belly, just so she could see the numbers on the scale better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on blubber butt Puckett\" Said Freddie mercilessly \"Read it out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"165\" Responded Sam, rather robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie spluttered and began laughing, a laugh even Carly joined in with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it definitely shows!\" Carly gloated \"Just look at that gut hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was not exaggerating, as Sam was clearly passing through the 'chubby' demographic to the fat. Her belly was gorgeous, as it and her luscious love handles bulged over the waistband of her skimpy bikini. Her ass and boobs had also received some extra weight, as they also looked glorious bulging against her skin tight bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

What about the show? We didn't do anything except show off how fat we're getting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie shrugged. \"That is the show.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's this stuff about the Groovy Smoothie? When did you set that up?\" Sam asked, angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie smiled. \"Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he slapped them both lightly on the ass, eliciting a surprised squeak from Carly and a decent jiggle from Sam's expanded rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned and socked Freddie right in the jaw, her powerful right hook knocking him to the ground. She stepped towards him a stood over him, looking down over her protruding stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you think is happening here Benson, but no matter what else is going on, Carly and me are still in charge.\" She said forcefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly nodded, equally sick of Freddie's wandering eyes and busy hands. Sam took another step forward, smacking Freddie with her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just watch yourself, or we'll get some other tech dork to run the camera, and you can just go back to stealing Carly's panties from the laundry room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Carly said. \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuitably chastised and cradling his aching jaw, Freddie clambered to his feet and scuttled out of the studio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll teach the little skunkbag.\" Sam said with her hands on her hips. She felt better than she had since they started this stupid weight gain contest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did deserve it.\" Carly agreed. \"Were you serious about him stealing my underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust downstairs, Freddie was wrestling with his emotions. He wanted to get back at Sam and Carly, but at the same time, seeing them both standing over him all fat and angry had been hotter than he could have believed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to make sure they kept getting fatter, while also making them think they were still in control. It would be difficult, but so far he had already achieved more than he had ever dreamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to remember the sensation of Sam's jiggling belly smacking his face, wishing he'd kept the camera running. He'd have to hurry home, and jimmy up the loose floorboard under his bed. He didn't know how Sam knew about them, but he decided he'd better have one last hurrah in case Carly asked for them back. </span></div></div>",

Drastic action had to be taken to nip this rebellious behaviour in the bud, and he thought grimly about what he would have to do; tattle on his friends. Freddie walked to Principal Franklins office and rapped on the door briskly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Mr.Benson\" Said Principal Franklin \"Shouldn't you be in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is more important than class!\" Said Freddie, very over excited \"Carly and Sam are lying about being sick! They are cutting class just to get out of their weight gain challenge! It's an outrage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your quite right Mr. Benson\" Said Principal Franklin, after a rather long pause \"What kind of message are they going to send their viewers if they just go against their word like this? That is not something I will promote in my school. Be assured Mr.Benson this will be dealt with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie was actually surprised that his outburst had been met with such sa response, thinking that he'd be in trouble for crossing a line. He could only watch as Principle Franklin took to the schools PA system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning everybody\" He said \"As you may or may not have noticed, we are absent two very important students today, they being one Carly Shay and Sama Puckett. I have been given information that suggests these students have skipped school to avoid their obligations to their iCarly fans. So today, classes will be postponed as I urge the whole school to put an end to this unacceptable behaviour as a deterrent for any future repeat behaviour\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie stood in awe at Principle Franklins swift response at the news, and smiled as he imagined the schools reception of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly and Sam were sat in Carlys apartment, obviously enjoying a day off from constant feedings and humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really needed this\" Said Carly, stretching out on the comfortable sofa \"Its nice to have a day off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah definitely\" Said Sam as she slurped on a soda \"I think I'm done with this whole weight gain thing... Maybe if we lay low a while people will just forget about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she felt her belly flab, the absence of the near constant feeding haze she'd been in from the beginning allowing her appreciate the damage that had already been done to her figure. Suddenly the was a knock at the door, and Carly and Sam exchanged glances as they were not expecting company. After a shrug, Carly stood and walked to the door to answer it. As she swung the door open, Carly was swarmed by what appeared to be the entire school, teachers and students alike. Sam jumped to her feet in shock as she watched the rabble of familiar faces enter the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doooinn-mrrrrf!!\" Squealed Carly just before a fat cake was stuffed into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Carly!! Team Carly!!\" They yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam backed away as she watched the group begin to force feed Carly at a faster and faster, obviously afraid that she would be next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammmrrrfff!!! Urrrp!!! Hellppp meee uurrrfff!!\" Wailed Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, every girl for themselves\" Said Sam, hastily heading for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah\" Said Freddie, standing in her path with a mischievous smile wagging his finger \"And just where are you off to Puckett?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my way you butt faced dork!\" She Growled dangerously \"Before I do something that I'll regret, for maybe five seconds after which I'll be ok with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not Sam\" Said Freddie, sounding determined though not without a hint of fear in his voice \"Hey guys! Team Sam! Team Sam!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chant was taken up by about half the people in the room, who now pounced on Sam who backed away in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait... Please guysmrrrff\" She stammered before sharing the same fate as Carly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie gleefully flitted back and forth between each girl, giving each a good feeding in between the feedings they were already receiving from their classmates. Sam glared daggers at him as he merely smiled happily back, as he stuffed fat cake after fat cake into her indignant mouth. After awhile of this Principal Franklin, who had been standing in the doorway with the other tutors, spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get them back to school\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few teachers eagerly wheeled in two dolleys, which would previously have been used for transporting crates. The students now, while still feeding the girls, stood them on the metal platforms and bound them tightly to the backing of the dolleys so they couldn't move. The poor girls were now wheeled from Carlys apartment, through town and back in the direction of Ridgeway High School, as the students fed them relentlessly. Onlookers stared in surprise and confusion as the entire school marched down the street, with Sam and Carly being stuffed silly. By the time they reached the steps of the high school both girls looked exhausted from their feedings, and they exchanged weary glances each with a fat cake protruding from their lips which was swiftly pushed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurrppp!!\" Exclaimed Sam \"So much for a day off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly merely groaned in response as the girls were wheeled inside the school. By now the belts that had been used over their midsections to fasten them to theirv dolleys were feeling rather uncomfortable as their full bellys pushed tightly against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrppp... Principal Franklin... Hiccc!!\" Moaned Carly \"Please... We're sorry for cutting hiccc!!! Class\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Franklin seemingly considered this apology and turned to Sam expectantly, obviously expecting her to reciprocate Carlys words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its true -urrppp-\" Said Sam after swallowing a mouthful of cake \"She is sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Franklin sighed as Carly shared an exasperated look with her over her inability to apologise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Said Sam at the look, as though she had no idea what she'd done wrong \"Mrrrfff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief feeding free interlude came to an end, as following a nod from Principal Franklin the students began piling food into the girls mouths once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>School resumed as normal, the difference being the two gorgeous girls being force fed at the back of the classroom. Quiet chants of \"Team Carly\" and \"Team Sam\" continued as each respective team kept the flow of food consistent into each girls groaning belly. <br>\r\n\"So, would one of you girls please tell me what 28 divided by 3 is?\" Asked The teacher suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls had to swallow the mouthful of fat cake they'd been forced to eat before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhrpp\" Exclaimed Sam and Carly in unison, jolting forward from the sudden exertion which stained the belts over the their bloated tummys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class laughed but the teacher looked at the defeated pair with a stern expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" She said \"That's completely wrong you fat morons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stalked forward slowly as the class waited in excitement at what was to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you two blubber butts not listen to a single word I say in this class?\" She spat \"You can't even solve a simple math problem, you pair of bloated dunces. In fact maybe your class mates can give you a helping hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeding teams hadn't missed a beat during the teachers speech, and the constant stream of fattening foods continued at a fast pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok class, if you look in the cupboard over there you'll find something that will help these dullards to learn something for once\" She said as a few students went to the cupboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cupboard the gleeful class found what appeared to be two super soakers, labelled 'lard', and a large accompanying back pack capable of containing four or so litres of liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo\" Said the teacher jovially, as if the bizarre scene were just a normal lesson \"Teams please man your girl... And if could get two volunteers to man our lard guns\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly one of the volunteers was Freddie who upon donning the super soaker back pack full of lard grinned at Sam, who glared back. The second volunteer was Nevel, who's grin was perhaps even wider and more malicious than Freddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MrrrfffNevelllurrfff\" Carly grumbled through a mouthful of fat cake at the sight of her nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so the first question goes to Sam\" Said the teacher, adopting the manner of a gameshow host \"Sam, what is 12 divided by 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Err...\" Struggled Sam, as math was not exactly her fortay and the the food coma wasn't exactly helping either \"Hicc... Abraham Lincoln?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. No\" Said the teacher \"The correct answer is in fact six, so class please force Miss. Pucketts mouth open and count down from six... Freddie, ready aim and fireee!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??! Waiii-glulugluglugg\" Exclaimed Sam, suddenly cut off by a powerful burst of lard into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six... Five... Four...\" Counted down the members of Team Sam, as Freddie kept the trigger of his super soaker held down and the blast of lard down Sams throat steady \"Three... Two... One!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gluglugluggg... Uhhh -Hiccc-\" Groaned Sam as the steam of pure fat finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this one's for you Miss. Shay\" Said the teacher, warey that Carly wasn't quite as stupid as Sam \"What is the square root of 150?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Umm\" Said Carly, taking advantage of the feeding free time to think \"About 12?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close but no cigar, I need an exact answer\" Said the teacher ruthlessly \"Team Carly count down from 13... Yes i rounded it up heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo wait!!\" Cried Carly in fear as her mouth was forced open \"That's not fairrrrgluglugluglugg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Carly began their countdown from 13, which for poor Carly seemed like an eternity. As the lard rushed down her throat and into her belly she could actually feel herself getting fatter from it, as it felt like the belt around her middle which strapped her to the dolly was really starting to dig into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this you'd better change the name of your show to 'iFatso'\" Giggled Nevel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, real clever dweeb\" Mumbled Sam grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two times twelve, go!\" Demanded the teacher, making Sam jump slightly and her belly to jiggle rather violently as it bulged above and below her restraint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I... Don't know...\" Said Sam, almost pleasingly \"Don't you have a TV trivia round or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Said the teacher shortly \"And that's 24...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crud... Thats quite alooooluglugluglugg\" Said Sam before her mouth was forced open, and both Freddie and Neville aimed their super soakers full of lard down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belt around her midsection had already began to disappear into the soft flesh of her gut, but as she was forced to drink the lard it began to tighten and strain even more. Sam knew that no matter what happened now she was already a fat girl, and the journey back to her once fit and slim physique (which she now regretted taking for granted) would be a very long and hard one. She could feel even more unwanted weight pile onto her as she drank and drank, until suddenly there was a loud *snap!* which indicated her belt harness breaking in two from her surging belly flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff... Urrrp\" She said weakly, obviously only kept standing by her arm and leg restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\" Said Neville, pleased with his handiwork \"I guess iFatso has a new star!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not wrong, nor was Freddie and the rest of the class who let out a low whistle at the sight of her. Sam was now 170lbs and every single pound was evident for all to see. Sams belly could no longer be covered by her top, as the pale flesh of her gut protruded beneath it. She also had a rather blatent double chin whenever she brought her face a little way down, and an ample set of tits and nice thick ass. Safe to say Freddie was more than a little aroused at the sight and it was all he could do to stop himself groping at his friends ample fat rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everybody else ignore that fat idiot and listen to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly the class slowly returned to their seats leaving Freddie and Neville to feed Carly while Sam watched with amusement (despite her chubby pale gut on display to all her classmates). The lesson continued as though nothing out of the ordinary were happening, just as Neville and Freddie reached the end of their super soaker packs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reload\" Said Neville and Freddie nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two returned to the closet to refill, giving Carly a chance to recover. Her fellow captive turned her head to her to give a few snide comments now the attention had shifted from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going there Cupcake?\" She asked, using a tone of mock concern \"Pretty soon your going to be just as big and fat as me... Maybe even more so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. Hiccc\" Was the only response poor Carly could offer just as Freddie and Neville returned with their refilled super soakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide my kitty\" Said Freddie maliciously as he and Neville levelled their super soakers at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasemfff\" Carly attempted to say but as soon as her mouth opened the novels of the super soakers were pushed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asta La Vista Baby\" Said Freddie and they both hit the trigger again sending another burst of lard down her weary throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile class was going on like everything was normal, despite the moans and sounds of frenzied gulping coming from Carly at the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the school bell rang indicating the end of the lesson, Carly was slumped on her dolley, her restraints the only thing keeping her standing. Her belly had forced the zipper down completely on her buttonless pants, which showed off her frilly pink ribboned panties to the class and her belly that bulged above. Freddie and Neville unashamedly ogled Carlys glorious stuffed belly, both fighting the urge to fondle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class\" Said the teacher \"Before you go, let's weigh Miss. Shay and see if she's successfully caught up with her portly friend here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScales were brought forward and Carly was unstrapped from her dolley, several students having to support her to stop her slumping to the ground and her belly bounced with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cmon girl\" Said Sam as Carly was stood on the scale \"Read it out for mama\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hundred and hiccc! Forty seven\" Said Carly weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, well done Freddie and Neville\" Said the teacher \"Very impressive indeed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your catching up kid\" Whispered Sam with a grin \"That's a damn impressive belly you've got there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrp\" Was the only response poor Carly could offer as her buttonless pants slowly fell down her legs completely exposing her panties to everybody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the school day was a blur for Carly and Sam. Despite the ordeal of the first class, each girls respective 'team' still fed them relentlessly on sight. The girls were constantly having to pull up their trousers, as both had popped their buttons, but the more they were fed the less they had the energy to do so so a lot of the time they were walking around with their panties on show to everyone. By the end of the day Carly weighed 154 pounds while Sam had reached a very impressive 175, each pound of which was incredibly obvious by their tight clothing. Sam in particular was bulging out all over the place and both girls were maroon in the face from furious embarrassment as their bellies and juicy rears were felt up and pinched. Freddie was given several dead arms by Sam each time he lost control and grabbed at her pudge, but this didn't stop his shameless lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you her your sweaty hands off me you creep?\" Growled Sam, slapping his hand away from her jiggling belly fat before offering a weary burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were on their way to the Groovie Smoothie challenge and both girls were clearly concerned about what it may entail (though it could scarcely be worse than what had followed it the thought). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw what's the matter mama?\" Asked Freddie mockingly \"Are you feeling a little self conscious of your chubby gut?\" <br>\r\nBefore Sam could offer a heated response Carly jumped in to stop their bickering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two please stop it?\" She said in exasperation \"I've got bigger worries on my mind right now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh yeah\" Said Freddie smirking \"You've both got bigger problems now hehe... I wonder what will happen now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly gulped nervously at the thought and Sam sighed, knowing that pretty soon her weight would reach the point of no return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie entered the Groovy Smoothie, opening the door for Carly and Sam to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck it in girls, can you make it through the doorway?\" He asked cruelly and the girls flushed angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freddie I will hospitalise you\" Growled Sam but Freddie was too excited at what was to come to fear her threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girls entered there was a loud roar causing them to jump and their bellies to jiggle. The Groovy Smoothie was busier than they'd ever seen it, with seemingly everyone from their school somehow crammed inside. To the far left of the cash register there were two huge smoothie cups (each about the size of the girls) suspended from the ceiling with tubes leading down to recliner chairs. It didn't take a genius to figure out what the Groovy Smoothie challenge would consist of, and both girls exchanged forlorn looks and sighed miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladels and jelly spoons\" Announced T-Bo into a microphone \"Our two contestants have arrived for the first ever Groovy Smoothie challenge! Give them some encouragement folks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd responded with a deafening mix of cheers and weight bashing jeers,which did nothing to make Carly and Sam feel any better. They were lead to their seats in the recliners and tied down with belts over the wrists, ankles and middles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay contestants\" Announced T-Bo, fully immersed in his role as a Presenter \"Suspended above your heads is around 4 gallons of a new and exclusive Groovy Smoothie, named the Big Belly Grower! It contains more calories than anybody, even my highly mathematical self, could possibly count! The winner will simply be who can finish the most of it... Now Freddie, could you please attach the feeding tubes, and we'll get this show on the road!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie, with his face displaying the same gleeful expression that it had done since the beginning of his friends weight gain process, obliged T-Bo's request and put the feeding tubes into their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up my piggies\" He said with a wink and both Carly and Sam glared daggers at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3, 2, 1!!\" T-Bo counted down and the audience joined in \"Chug!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swith was pulled which sent the calorific smoothies down the tubes and into the girls miserable mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gluglugluglugluglugg\" Came the sound of frenzied gulping from Carly and Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls had no choice but to slurp away at the gigantic extra fattening smoothies as the crowd cheered. Both Carly and Sam had their eyes closed, as the focused on nothing but swallowing, trying their best to ignore the building uncomfortable pressure in their bloated bellies. Their zippers on their buttonless pants were soon pushed down by their growing girth displaying their frilly underwear to the whole audience (much to Freddies obvious delight). For a while it was quite competitive, as both girls gulped down the mixture at the same rate. However after about twenty minutes it was clear that Sam had the advantage, due to extra room she had in her ever growing gut compared to Carly. It started with Carly beginning to shift uncomfortably in her seat, her cheeks slowly flushing pink as she murmured something intelligible through the tube. She was clearly struggling while Sam remained still, just accepting the constant flow of calories down her throat into her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" Announced T-Bo \"It looks as if Miss. Shay is having some trouble!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-Bo put his microphone closer to Carlys bloated belly, so that it's rather unhappy grumbles could be heard by all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhluglugluglugluggg\" Was her only response, as the fattening smoothie cascaded unabated down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten minutes of watching her struggle, T-Bo decided to take action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Carly I'm going to give you a count to make sure your still in this\" He said, taking Carly by the hand and lifting her arm above her weary head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\" He Counted and let go, causing her hand to flop back to her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-Bo counted to three, each time letting Carlys hand drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding ding ding!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-Bo rang a bell signalling the end of the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Shay has been counted out!\" He announced \"Sam is the winner!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Carly, the loss didn't mean that she'd saved herself from too many extra unwanted calories, as the Smoothie was almost finished. In fact Freddie made a point to stop T-Bo from turning off the feeding tube, so Carly did actually finish the Smoothie anyway, but was still pronounced the loser! The feeding tubes were removed from the exhausted girls mouths, and they turned a weary, miserable look to reach other before feebly burping in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about your victory?\" Asked Freddie, holding the mic to Sams weary mouth \"Blubberbutt Puckett\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff... Piece of..  Urrrp... Cake\" She replied weakly, though showing arrogant confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow really?\" Asked Freddie \"Well... If you're sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded to T-Bo, who shrugged and wandered off back behind the counter of the Groovy Smoothie, as Sam raised a concerned eyebrow. T-Bo soon returned holding several large slices of cake; on sticks (predictably). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc! You and your... Urrrp... Big mouth hehe\" Mocked Carly weakly from next to Sam, who was clearly thinking the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know your awfully cocky for such a fat butted beached whale\" Mocked Freddie to Sam, who looked genuinely concerned as the cake was brought over. <br>\r\nOf course as he mocked her Freddie was pinching her chunky derriere, while trying to hide is obvious arousal (He had been in an almost constant state of arousal since the whole fattening up process had begun). Sam was getting further from the monicker \"chubby\" as each unwanted calorie she was forced to consume put her ever further into the \"fat\" camp. None of her clothes even came close to fitting her anymore, and rather exaggerated every bulge and curve of her thick frame. She'd grown to accept that her breasts now bulged out over the cups of all her bras, and that she was developing a shelf like ghetto booty that she could feel bounce and jiggle with each step she took, but the one thing she truly hated was her big, soft and wide gut which was currently spilled out onto her chunky thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff.. No...waitmmrrrf\" Sam stammered, vaguely trying to move her head away as the cake kebab was stuffed past her exhausted lips by T-Bo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to our loser!\" Said Freddie moving over to the defeated form of Carly as Sam was stuffed even more, but not at all feeling like the victor \"My Oh my are things going to get interesting for your my kitty\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you...\" Muttered Carly \"So... Urrrp<br>\r\n..much\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" He said grinning widely, running his hand over his friends bulging belly \"and i know how much you hate this ever growing belly of yours, but take it from me its truly glorious... Now, lets get you weighed for everyone shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlys restraints were unfastened, but she was so weak Freddie had to basically take her whole weight on his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God\" He said, almost tumbling over from the sudden weight \"You weigh a ton fatso! Jeez!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut urrrrp!\" Carly attempted to retort, but was unable to stifle a burp and Freddie laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was plonked on the scale, where she stood swaying unsteadily. She had to grab at her buttonless trousers as they were slowly inching their way down her legs, exposing her pink panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then kitty\" Demanded Freddie \"Read it out for everyone\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the mic in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc!\" She replied weakly \"One hundred and hiccc! Sixty six... Oh my God... I'm getting so fat... Urrrp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's great isn't it?\" Said Freddie into the mic as the crowd cheered at Carlys embarrassment \"Your getting so fat so fast... So fat and juicy... But don't fret, Miss. Puckett is going to make you feel skinny in comparison!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss. Puckett was currently having cake stuffed down her throat by T-Bo, but at the announcement be quickly finished the feeding and undid her restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this could be a two... Maybe three man job\" Said T-Bo as Sam burped and popped a seam on her skin tight top underneath her arm pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your probably right\" Said Feddie \"Could we get some help with this fat cow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last question was directed at the crowd, and there were a fair few eager volunteers, mostly male who clearly wanted to help the same reason Freddie did. As she was lifted to her feet, Sams taut, full belly was groped and rubbed, her plump ass was pinched and even her stacked tits were felt up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerr off! Hiccc\" Said Sam, vaguely slapping at the groping hands \"How many pervs go to this damn school anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was then plonked on the scale just as Carly had been (the latter now sitting in a nearby chair groaning), the sudden jerk of movement causing a body wide jiggle of flab and a few more seams popping open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then blubber butt Puckett\" Said Freddie, giving her gut a slap which made it jiggle despite its tautness \"Read it out\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had to suck in her belly as far as it would go, and even then her breasts obscured her view a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hundred and eighty six\" She said miserably, after a comically large exhalation of breath which caused her gut to bulge outward again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow\" Said Freddie in awe, his eyes widening as they fell on Sams glorious distended gut \"Not far off the big two oh oh ay fatso?... Lucky for you you won this, it's earnt you much deserved break.... As for you Carly, this weekend is going to be a tough one indeed hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Carlys punishment for losing? </span></div></div>",

You will be spending the weekend at Fat Camp.... Though this particular Camp is the exact opposite of what you'd expect, as weight gain is very much encouraged...

Noo! Stop!! Help!!!\" She wailed, kicking her feet as she was dragged which had the unfortunate result of making her buttonless pants fall down and exposing her pink panties to all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long cupcake\" Sam called after her, blowing her a kiss \"Don't forget to write! Can't wait to see how fat you become! Hehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as poor Carly was dragged outside and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to watch the show folks!\" Announced Freddie \"We will be keeping you updated on her progress every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Carly was being bundled into what resembled a prison van and locked inside.

She lounged on the soft sofa at Carly's apartment, thinking happily about her friend having a truly miserable time while she relaxed. She still found that she was constantly stuffing her face with junk food however, mainly due to her appetite having increased significantly, but was fairly unconcerned with gaining a couple extra pounds at this point. She tugged at her skin tight t shirt absent mindlessly, as it rode up on her glorious soft gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really let yourself go mama\" She mumbled to herself as she felt and squeezed the smooth soft flesh on her new flabby spare tire at her midriff \"I mean sheesh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock at the door which snapped Sam out of her self deprecating assessment. With a grunt of effort she pulled herself up from the sofa, brushing away the rogue which had accumulated on her person as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's you\" She said without molecule of enthusiasm when she opened the door and found Freddie standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you to lard-o\" Said Freddie, cheekily poking her gut which her t shirt couldn't properly cover before dodging a punch from Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" Said Sam grumpily, yanking her t shirt down to try and hide her belly \"Is it time for the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes indeedy\" Replied Freddie happily as he entered \"And I think your going to enjoy seeing how our dear Carly is getting on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't help but smile at this, though she felt she shouldn't take quite so much pleasure in her friends misery she knew that Carly deserved it. Her smile disappeared almost as quickly as it had appeared however as Freddie handed her a large box of Krispy kream donuts and a pink spotted bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Said Sam haughtily \"It's my weekend off, remember? I won the damn challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... No I'm afraid not\" Said Freddie gravely \"Outside of the show your exactly right, you can do whatever you wish... However come show time you've got to keep up appearances... For the fans heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stared at Freddie for a few moments, for some reason expecting a \"just kidding\" to follow, but when it didn't she snatched the items from his hands angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God!\" She said in exasperation \"it's you that wants this not the fans! You perv!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I resent that implication!\" Said Freddie, sounding deeply offended though obviously just playing the part \"In fact I demand satisfaction! Eat that whole box of donuts right now and then we're even\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis followed another long state from Sam before she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddd...\" She mumbled grumpily before opening the box and tucking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie watched with satisfaction as the gorgeous chunky blonde munched her way through the substantial box of fattening confectionaries per his request. Sam looked sullen as she stuffed her face, looking like a child being punished which only added to Freddie's amusement. When she'd finished, in a very impressive time, she stifled a burp and Freddie handed her another identical box of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start again shall we?\" He said in a deeply patronising tone \"Go and get dressed and we can start the show\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam fixed Freddie with a glare intended to wither his  very soul before stalking off to get changed. When she returned Freddie was all set to film the show and when he saw her squeezed into her ill fitted bikini his jaw hit the floor and his manhood sprung to attention. At a might 188.5 pounds Sam looked simply stunning in her bikini, which was more than a little too small for her. The straps of both her bikini top and bottoms were barely visible as they were almost completely engulfed by the thickening layer of fat all over her once so perfect young body. The cups of bikini just barely covered her nipples (though they were still clearly visible against the tight fabric) as her glorious boobs bulged above them. Her bottoms were clearly giving her a serious wedgie as they disappeared up her butt and accentuated her juicy ghetto booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!\" Said Sam, clicking her fingers at Freddie who was currently on another planet as he ogled her \"Back in the room creep! Let's get this show over with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Yes of course... The show\" Said Freddie struggling to come to his senses as he took his position behind the camera and counted Sam down to action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to a Carly free episode of iCarly\" announced Sam \"Although we will be visiting with her soon enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie coughed to get Sams attention and then made an eating motion at her. Sam rolled her eyes and sighed before opening her box of donuts and digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now while this greedy pig stuffs her face\" Said Freddie walking into shot and playfully slapping his friends belly causing it to wobble \"We can see what our dear friend Carly has been up to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere now played a video, which was titled \"Carly at fat camp\". The video began with Carly arriving at the camp in the prison van she'd been transported in. She looked extremely timid and afraid as she stepped off the van and was stood in front of a very severe and intimidating female drill instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to fat camp\" She said, not sounding at all welcoming \"For the next few days i own you. You will do what I say, when I say it without hesitation, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly stared at her feet, clearly too scared to answer as she trembled where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then\" Said the instructor darkly before nodding to two other women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carly looked up she was met with a huge spoon of fattening gruel, which one of the women was holding a huge cast iron pot of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glumphhh?!\" She exclaimed in shock as she swallowed her mouthful before the next one was forced in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drill sergeant lowered her face so she and Carly were eye level while the poor girl was force fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to have a very tough time here if you don't learn this simple lesson\" Said the drill sergeant in a very deliberate tone \"i own you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video then fast forwarded as Carly was being fed, showing that the feeding lasted a long time as she was forced to consume the whole pot of gruel. When it was done the poor bloated beauty slunk to the ground and the two women who had fed her picked her up under her arms and dragged her away to her dorm where she would be sleeping. The other beds in the room looked like standard summer camp bunk beds, but the one Carly was dumped on looked more like a hospital bed. Next to it was a large metal pump with a hose and at this point Neville revealed himself to be the camera man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... But could you please explain to the viewers the purpose of this?\" Asked Neville candidly, gesturing to the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the mechanisms purpose was obvious the women obliged, lying Carly down and securing her arms and legs with leather straps to the bed. Carly was almost asleep at this point, succumbing to the intense food coma from her earlier feeding as the women attached the feeding tube to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pump will send a steady stream of a weight gain serum, which contains lard amongst other things, into Carly's mouth as she sleeps\" The woman explained \"Thus ensuring that weight gain can continue at all times\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Neville \"May i?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured to the switch which turned on the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Answered the woman and Neville gleefully flipped the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly gave a muffled groan as the lard mixture was pumped down the tube into her exhausted mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville zoomed in on Carly's face who gazed back miserably as she was pumped full of lard despite her taut bellys grumbles of protest. The footage now cut and the shot returned to the studio where Freddie was goading Sam into eating her box of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw poor Carly!\" Said Freddie as he simultaneously pushed a Krispy kream in Sams indignant mouth \"In a show of support, Sam here has very kindly volunteered to share in Carly's.. Fun heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhrrp!\" Exclaimed Sam at this bombshell after hastily swallowing the donut Freddie had wedged into her mouth \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, keep up tubby\" Said Freddie playfully slapping Sams glorious exposed gut making it wobble \"it's time to play 'Eat along with Carly'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked mortified as two women dressed as drill sergeants appeared and approached her looking very stern. They then grabbed her and shoved her into a chair, which her arms and legs were fastened to. Freddie then fixed the camera on Sams miserable gaze and the audience were treated to a split screen, so they could also see Carly's equally miserable face as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Sam hated how used to the feeling of a funnel or feeding tubes she was becoming, and wondered miserably if her entire life would just be moments waiting for the next feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou enjoying that you fat pig?\u201d Asked Freddie condescending condescendingly as he held a microphone to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMllrrglurrglugglugglugluglug!!\u201d Sam responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the first jug was done Freddie approached again, removing the blondes funnel for a moment as he grabbed yet another box of donuts. He rammed the first one into her mouth as he positioned himself, sitting on her lap so his legs were around her hefty waist and gut so he could stare into her eyes. He became lost in lust for awhile, pushing donut after donut into her miserable indignant mouth, absent mindedly grinding on her as her squeezed and fondled her pale exposed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour coming along nicely my sweet\u201d He said lustfully while giving the poor girl a heavy handed feeding \u201cYou know I can\u2019t even remember what your \u2018goal weight\u2019 was... But I just want you to know that I am never going to stop fattening you up. I\u2019m going to feed you and feed you and feed you until your too damn fat to walk. You\u2019ll be too damn obese to leave the house, and even then I won\u2019t stop! Welcome to your new life you fat cow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably Sam looked truly horrified at this new, horrible piece of news, but wasn\u2019t given the opportunity to dwell on it for long as Freddie crammed the last of the box down her throat and the feeding funnel was pushed back in.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nSam didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, as the passage of time had lost all meaning. She became aware that the feeding had mercifully stopped, and the funnel was removed allowing her head to loll weakly onto her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhblerrrpp...\u201d She exclaimed weakly, opening her heavy eyelids to look at the live stream of her former friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked equally miserable at least, as she lay spread eagled on the bed with her big dome of a belly gurgling unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as you can see Ladies and Gents, our two stars have been greedy pigs\u201d Said Freddie squeezing Sams cheek patronisingly \u201cSo I guess its up to me to sign off here, but first lets get these lard asses weighed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls feeders pulled each of them roughly to their feet, and shoved them onto sets of scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSound off maggot!\u201d Yelled one of them to Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhrrppp...\u201d Responded Carly weakly, having to be held in place as she had little strength left after her ordeal \u201c172... hiccurrrrp!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow thats very impressive my kitty\u201d Said Freddie \u201cthough your much more of a piggy than a kitty at this point heh. What about you blubber butt Pucket? You fat slob! How fat are you now hmm?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gave a lethargic, slightly vacant look which she\u2019d meant to be a withering look of pure malevolence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBraaarppp\u201d She excalimed suddenly which caused her body to start jiggling much to amusement of Freddie \u201c191... hicccc... oh my God...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked away tears at the sight of such an astronomical number, knowing that she\u2019d passed the point of no return at this point. Freddie took the opportunity to examine his friends bulging curves, almost drooling as he did so. The fact that she was clad in an ill fitting bikini only exemplified this, as it didnt even cover the nipples of her gorgeously plump breasts anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Sam... just look at you\u201d Said Freddie finally \u201cSo fat... So perfect... just look at those love handles\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie grabbed Sams love handles, feeling their large soft mass fill and squish in his hands. Next he moved his hands around to her glorious belly, a thick gut which prevented Sam from seeing her feet, even when she sucked it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The poor blonde was at a cross roads now, and the route she took would have huge ramifications. She lamented her past, perfectly slim body, and wished she would have appreciated it more at the time. She hated being a fat disgusting pig, and her so called friends for forcing her fatter and fatter. But on the other hand she had always had strong feelings for Freddie, and although she and everybody else (her own opinion) found her to be fat and gross, he actually seemed enthralled at her ever expanding figure. She felt the appendage poke around her loins, the fact she was only wearing very tight bikini bottoms making her flush as it brush her clitoris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a banana in your pocket? Or are you just pleased to see me?\u201d She said suddenly, catching herself off guard as she had not meant to say it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence followed her rather crude, yet seductive outburst, and soon she desperately looked away from embarrassment. She stared adamantly at her feet (or whatever small part of her feet were visible beyond her large pale gut) blushing deeply and feeling anxious until Freddie finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate your optimism you fat loser\u201d He said callously \u201cBut seeing as no man will ever want you again I guess I could give you some pity action\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the blunt insult Freddie lunged forward and embraced the fat blonde in an open mouth kiss. Despite her feelings and confidence still hurting she soon found herself reciprocating, a seeming indication that her spirit had truly been broken. After a makeout session, which increased in passion until Sam felt dizzy, and she felt a tingle downstairs, Freddie pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me make something quite clear\u201d He said as she stared longingly at him, unable to stop her yearning for his touch \u201cYou will always be second to Carly, but as she isn\u2019t here i guess you\u2019ll just have to do... i mean just look at yourself Blubberbutt Puckett! You look ridiculous!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam actually whimpered at the blunt tone, her self esteem taking another beating until Freddie embraced her again. She didnt realize it, but Freddie had clearly been reading up on psychological manipulation, as Sam was becoming more and more enamoured with him. Whilst kissing her Freddie moved Sam onto the table facing the television, which still showed Carly sitting at her chair, groaning from her feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both Carly and Sam had their eyes closed, as the focused on nothing but swallowing, trying their best to ignore the building uncomfortable pressure in their bloated bellies. Their zippers on their buttonless pants were soon pushed down by their growing girth displaying their frilly underwear to the whole audience (much to Freddies obvious delight). For a while it was quite competitive, as both girls gulped down the mixture at the same rate. However after about twenty minutes it was clear that Sam had bitten off more then she could chew, she was beginning to shift uncomfortably in her seat, her cheeks slowly flushing pink as she murmured something intelligible through the tube. She was clearly struggling while carly remained still, just accepting the constant flow of calories down her throat into her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n it became clear carly was the winner , Unfortunately for Carly and sam, the loss didn't mean that they'd saved herself from too many extra unwanted calories, as the Smoothie was almost finished.

Lying had never been her strong suit, and she could tell Freddie hadn't believed her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did he buy it?\" Sam asked from the other end of the couch , where she was lounging with her feet up on the coffee table.

No. What are we going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam snorted, taking a package of Fat Cakes out of the pocket of her shorts (As well as snack storage, they also provided ample room for her growing  posterior).

Most of it went to your tits anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly blushed at the crude language, but it was true. She has noticed her bra feeling tighter, and looking in the mirror it was clear she had been boosted to a respectable B cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's different for me.\" She countered, refusing to admit defeat. \"You've always been kind of, well, chunky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's eyes flashed with anger.  Carly knew she had made a mistake, but it was too late to apologise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be glad yo put some meat on your bones.\" Sam told her, slamming her feet down on the floor. \"Maybe people will stop mistaking you for a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly opened  her mouth to respond, only to have Sam shove a FatCake in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instinctively she chewed and swallowed, locking eyes with Sam as she pushed the fluffy snack into her mouth, pressing her hand against her lips. Without hesitating she grabbed the remaining two from the package and forced Carly to eat those too, her cheeks ballooning with the sweet foodstuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if these go anywhere but your boobs!\" Sam said, grabbing Carly's right breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly shuddered slightly. She slept without a bra, and hadn't bothered putting one on before coming down that morning.  Sam felt her friend's nipple harden under her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't broken eye contact.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So instead of being a famous actress in Hollywood the young woman know as Penny still waited tables at the Cheesecake Factory to be able to pay her rent and food. Stageplays with amateur actors in bowling centers or schools didn\u00b4t help either as no agents look around for talent in such dirty cheap places... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Penny could do was to search the web and newspapers to see if there might be some information about castings to find to apply... but even then the chance to get to an audition was low... There are just as many actresses around as lawyers who are working as taxi drivers so the market was overflooded with talents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny often waited to receive a mail or letter telling her she might be among the top favorites in a casting bout... but she didn\u00b4t really beleive into it herself anymore... when a certain letter arrived her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really had made it to an audition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually the info sheets didn\u00b4t tell much about the role that was to fill... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one thing that Penny noticed was that among all the actresses sitting in the waiting room she was by far the thinnest as the others had a good 20-40 pounds on her... Penny was mazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat also got her attention was the fact that all actresses walking out of the agent\u00b4s office seemed to be not amused to say it the friendly way... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was the last in line to be called into the office. She took around while closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent was a woman about 35 years old taht one could be describe as a woman that aged very well despite a small potbelly Penny saw in the midsection department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office itself was a rather small room, probably a stand-by office that wasn\u00b4t used so much. Small but still fancy and showing some autographed pictures of actors like Charlie Sheen, Jim Parsons, Kayley Cuoco and others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like that lady has had some noticeable clients in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent, a tag on her desk stating her name as Mrs. Georgina Luttony, offered Penny to take a seat and so the young blonde actress sat down. Penny grabbed her notebook and her pen to listen to the agents words and writting important things down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was told that it was about a sitcom that was planned to start soon with a big evening filling pilot and 15 episodes for the first season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all sounded pretty good to Penny but she wondered if there was hitch somewhere... Probably the money was very low she though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Penelope, the wages would be as follows: 10 000 for the pilot and 5 000 for each episode following. And there would be a bonus of 10 000 for each actor in case of a constant market share of 10 % or higher... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus 20 000 bonus each for each major award the show will get. Personal awards are granted with personal bonus of 50 000 for each award paid to the single actor resp. actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn case the season will get a constant share of 10 % or up there will be an automatic 2nd season with 15 new episodes that will see your wages going up to 50 000 per episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leading actress, which would be your role in case we decide it\u00b4s you who will get hired also gets 5 % of all merchandising income.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was a cartoon Penny\u00b4s mouth would have dropped to the floor... That was not near the payment of Charlie Sheen or Kayley Cuoco but for an actress that was eagerly waiting for her breakthough and who made a bad dime will serving customers like Sheldon Cooper it was like finding the hidden treasure of Captain Kidd... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...\" the agnet said \"Miss Penelope, there are a few more things that might turn you away from taking the role, so we need an actress that really puts all hear heart into it, you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The role you will have to play might be a very negative one, you see? Someone people would probably hate in real life so there could be bad letters or anything in the future, you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I\u00b4m no stranger to pesting stuff written on a paper.\" Penny said thinking about all the paperwork she had to sign just to quiet Sheldon down in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Penelope, I have a rather special question. Would you mind to burp in public... I mean on tv? Can you burp on command maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m a Nebraska girl and that\u00b4s how we stun the cows!\" Penny wanted to answer at first but quickly switched her mind and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that was impressive, Miss Penelope... I\u00b4ll take that as a \"YES\"!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled from one ear to another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have experiences in smoking cigarettes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmmm... Does it count that I smoke cigars here and there when having a girls night with some friends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem... so you have no problems with inhaling and exhaling smoke at all... That\u00b4s a good thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Penny\u00b4s face grew even wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m sure you are eagerly waiting to hear what kind of role we wanted to see you for, right? I interprete your nodding as a \"Yes!\"... so here we go. The sitcom we plan is called \"Queen of Trailer Park Castle\". The whole sitcome takes place in a trailer park which sees a lot of different characters the struggle in life but still find a way to turn things in a positive way in the end. Your role would actually be the one of Cora, that\u00b4s at least the name we plan for her. She\u00b4s a very bitchy character and more wealthy than the other people living in the trailer park... wealthy in comparison of course. So that\u00b4s why she is the kind of queen of the park and tosses others around, you see? She is the kinda of law of the park... she mkaes the rules and who breaks them has to pay....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like an interesting character! May I offer a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to do so, Miss Penelope!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to get tattooed or so to look more impressive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you can anticipate... that\u00b4s great. But you can relax. Cora is a character with some tattoos, that\u00b4s right, but they will be done by our make-up artists, you no need to get tattooed, you see?\" the agent laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will the sitcom be produced?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found a small facility over here in Pasadena. So you don\u00b4t need to move or so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Miss Penelope. You really seem to fit into the whole thing. You ask the right questions, you seem to be curious about the character, you can burp and smoke... To be honest, you are the top player of all the ladies we have casted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I mean, if it was up to me I\u00b4d sign the contract right here... right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, Miss Penelope. But there is one detail I haven\u00b4t told you about Cora. The script describes Cora as a woman... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ...that is 9-months pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) with a beer belly!\"</span></div></div>",

Just then there was a knock at the door and Sheldon frowned, annoyed at whoever was interrupting his beloved solitude. He opened the door and with a pang of even more annoyance he saw his very attractive blonde neighbour standing there. It had been several years since Leonard had first befriended their beautiful neighbour Penny, and Sheldon had had nothing but misgivings ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sheldon\" She said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Penny\" Sheldon replied a little less jovially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am, or was, very well thank you\" Said Sheldon \"Could I ask we forgo the usual meaningless small talk so we can arrive quicker at the reason your here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always a pleasure speaking with you Sheldon\" Said Penny sarcastically, realizing Sheldon probably didn't register it \"Is Leanord here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, he is at the lab\" Said Sheldon \"No doubt performing some meaningless experiment or other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Ok\" Said Penny awkwardly \"Well, are you doing anything? I'm bored... Maybe i could come in and wait for Leanord with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...\" Began Sheldon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sweetie\" Said Penny, cutting him off and walking through the open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheldon glared after her as she took a seat next to his on the sofa. He was sure that since she and Leonard had gotten back together (if he didn't have an idetic memory he would have no idea how many times this had happened), Penny had been both over at the apartment more frequently and twice as annoying as she'd ever been. Now that she was even turning up without Leonard being there, completely ruining Sheldons alone time, Sheldon was determined to find a solution to solve his problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got anything to eat in this place?\" Asked Penny, snapping Sheldon from his thoughts \"My refrigerator is a little bare... I mean there's something in there wrapped in tin foil but I'm pretty sure that was there when I moved in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheldon was about to respond when a flicker of an idea illuminated inside his head.

I have had a few offers\" Replied the gorgeous blonde from inside the fridge \"But they were of the.... pornographic variety... so its not been going that great admittedly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...\" Said Sheldon, not exactly nailing believable sympathy \"I'm so sorry to hear that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny closed the fridge and regarded Sheldon with a skeptical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to say sweetie?\" She said, her tone not as friendly as her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just imagine that, judging by your regular reliance on our food to stay alive, that money is somewhat of an issue for you at present\" Explained Sheldon \"Amy raised something with me recently which I believe may be able to help you both obtain the fame and wealth your clearly desire\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" Said Penny still skeptical but becoming interested despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she was telling me about a failed actress, like yourself\" He said, clearly unaware of the blunt insult \"Who, in a rather depressed and miserable state, ended on gaining a rather substantial amount of weight... before losing all of said weight and releasing a work out plan, diet plans etc which were hugely successful... she is now incredibly successful and worth a lot of money\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... okay...\" Said Penny slowly, trying to come to terms with the rather strange and extreme suggestion \"Let me get this straight... your saying I should get fat on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Said Sheldon as usual not comprehending her tone, instead believing her to understand and be completely onboard \"And then lose it afterwards, solving your financial problems in the process!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Sheldon...\" She said with understandble uncertainty \"I don't really want to... you know... become a fatass... I like my regular hot ass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But think of the money and fame\" Said Sheldon targeting her known weaknesses \"We'd help and fund you every step of the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny looked rather torn, as she weighed up the concept of losing her figure temporarily against the prospect of fame and riches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She said, before nodding her head slowly \"... I guess it's worth a shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh excellent\" Said Sheldon clapping his hands together \"No time like the present as they say... Why don't you take a seat and I'll rustle you up something with the required calorie levels...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny nodded, clearly still unsure about the rather odd plan, and took a seat on the sofa... before realising she was any Sheldons 'spot' and hastily moved over one. After a bit of rummaging around Sheldon emerged from the kitchen, wealding a large dinner tray piled high with a plethora of fattening foods, snacks and confectionarys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Sheldon... I literally just wanted a snack...\" She said looking shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now\" He replied dismissively \"If your going to do this Penny your going to have serious quota to meet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But...\" She said clearly trying to think of an argument against it but failing \"... Well ok I guess... I mean I'll do my best but this is a lot of good Sheldon... I'm only little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do your best\" He said before adding under his breath  \"Your not going to be little for much longer so enjoy it while you can\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her complaints and excuses the stunning blonde bombshell did an admirable job at putting a dent in the intimidating pile, definitely proving she had a bigger stomach capacity than her figure let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think this may be the first time I've ever said this...\" Said Sheldon looking impressed \"But Penny you did yourself a disservice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was spread out of the sofa, clearly very full indeed, but even so gave Sheldon a lathargic scowl at the barb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raj, Sheldon and Howard were at Leonard and Sheldons apartment playing a vigorous game of Wii tennis. Leonard had retired to his bedroom with Pria, to do things that made Rajs stomach lurch at the very thought of. As Sheldon and Howard were engaged in a very close and intense game, Raj thought again about his problem and how he was going to solve it. It was clear that the obvious idea was to somehow make Pria less physically attractive to Leonard, so he pondered the best way to achieve this. From his long stay in the country he had noticed that fat girls were considered undesirable (Even though this often did not dissuade Howard, even he had his limit) so he now realized that the best course of action would be to fatten her up until Leonard didn't want her anymore. It was at that point that Penny barged in, as she often did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, what you... Erm... Doing?\" She said brightly, her tone changing as she watched the two grown men dancing around and flinging their arms around wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not glaringly obvious?\" Replied Sheldon without looking at her, as he employed a back hand racket technique \"We are locked into an intense game of Wii Tennis, a game which so closely resembles its real life counterpart that it should be entirely obvious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right\" Said Penny with sarcasm that Sheldon didn't register at all \"Well I'll leave you two athletes to it then. Where's Leonard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was directed at Raj, who due to not having consumed any alcoholic beverages was unable to answer verbally, so instead gestured toward the bedroom. Almost on cue the sounds of Pria giggling could be heard and Penny grimaced at the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can hear Leonard is otherwise engaged in a game of erotic Star Trek\" Commented Howard which afforded him a grim glare from Raj at the mental image he had conjured \"But you can stay if you like... Have you ever played erotic tennis...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Penny offered her heated response which showed her disdain for Howard and his offer, Raj had a sudden brain wave. It was no secret that Penny (along with Bernadette and Amy also) did not get along with his sister, so she could provide valuable help in pursuing his dastardly plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was in her apartment when there was a knock at the door. When she opened it she found Raj there, who was drinking a bottle of beer which she knew meant he could speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Raj\" She said in a more friendly tone than she often did with Sheldon or Howard \"I'm guessing your open to talk to me now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, i was a little nervous so I had a fewer beers\" He replied \"You know how it goes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this long yeah I do\" Said Penny smiling \"Come in sweetie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj walked into the young blondes messy apartment and found Amy and Bernette sat drinking wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Raj\" They said in unison, though Amy's voice had more of a slurred edge owing to her rookie drinking ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\" Replied Raj, taking a swig of beer for the next part of his sentence \"I'm going to cut right to the chase, I need your help..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernette and Penny exchanged a look of confusion at this statement, but Amy seemed instantly committed in her slightly drunken haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proceed\" She said making a unbalanced hand gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Amy\" He said \"I am... Getting sick of my sister and Leonard! Leonard is bringing shame to my family and i won't stand for it any longer! I need your help to break them up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" Said Penny, surprised at the outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Raj.. Pria is a grown woman, she can make her own decisions\" Said Bernette diplomatically \"What right do you have to tell who she can and can't date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am her brother!\" He exclaimed \"And therefore in charge of her while she lives here! And at any rate, don't pretend like you're not curious... I know none of you like her, because she sure as hell don't like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a point\" Chimed in Amy, taking another gulp of wine \"What did you have in mind Raj?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj smiled at Amy, happy for her support. He could tell Penny and Bernadette's interest had also been spiked, so he continued to win them over completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've been living in America along time now\" He begun \"And there's one thing I've noticed about the average American mans tastes that differs from India... Fat chicks are not desired. In India larger women are viewed as very privileged and are often desired, but here in America the average man finds them revolting... Even mocks them for their girth. If i can secretly fatten Pria up,I know Leonard, and all American men along with him, will lose interest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to help you forcefully fatten up your sister?\" Said Penny in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a nut shell, yes\" Said Raj \"I imagine she'll be much less cocky when her clothes don't fit her right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea!\" Exclaimed Amy suddenly \"Come on guys! We've got to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Penny before taking a gulp of wine \"Oh what the hell, I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me to\" Said Bernette, smiling mischievously \"This could be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Said Raj happily \"We'll begin straight away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Raj had seemingly had a change of heart with regards to their relationship, and now wanted to celebrate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\" Said Raj as he opened the door \"Please come in, i have such a lovely evening planned\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about Rajs manner that warranted an exchange of glances between Leonard and Pria, but then they both shrugged and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for having us\" Said Pria \"I'm so happy you've changed your mind about me and Leonard, it means a lot to us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course\" Said Raj, his smile seaming suddenly strained \"I'm so happy for you both...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj led the couple to the dining table, where they were sat with a plate and cutlery laid out in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill be right back\" Said Raj, his manner still suspiciously dark as he went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj approached the worktop where the meals were laid out and removed the vile Amy had given him from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetit sister\" He said darkly as he poured a few drops from the vial into his sisters dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought the plates to the table, making sure Pria got the tainted one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like it\" He said \"There's plenty more where that came from...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe directed this at Pria meaningful who merely stared back in confusion at her brothers suspicious behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh thanks Raj\" She said \"It looks lovely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Rajs gaze Pria tentatively took her first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm wow Raj\" She said seemingly genuinely impressed \"That's very good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah good job\" Said Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your very welcome\" Said Raj \"I put a lot of effort in to sow you both that I'm ready to celebrate your... Relationship\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gap between \"your\" and \"relationship\" betrayed Rajs true feelings for a moment, but Leonard and Pria thought nothing of it. As they ate Raj kept an eye on his sister, to look for any signs of Amys serum having an effect. He didn't have to wait long however as he soon noticed her gradually speed up her eating, her expression becoming more and more manic. It wasn't until she was practically shovelling it in that Leonard noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... You hungry baby?\" He asked uncertainly as his gorgeous girlfriend crammed more and more food into her ravenous mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria merely grunted a response as she polished off the plate, even proceeding to lick it clean when she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More\" She demanded to Raj, an almost animalistic look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" He said, beside himself with glee as he reentered the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Asked Leonard nervously \"You really wolfed that down... I thought you were going to eat the plate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed awkwardly as Pria stared back at him, the look of a Bengal Tiger in her eyes as they feel upon Leonards plate. Without a word she snatched it from him and ploughed into it with vigour. Raj reentered the room, just as Pria finished the last of Leonards dinner, with a huge platter of food that he'd clearly made with the Prias new uncharacteristic appetite in mind. He had also added even more from the vial, so the calories in the platter had been increased by ten times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of food\" Said Leonard, clearly trying to hide his nerves from witnessing his girlfriends bizarre behaviour \"I'm going to have to roll you home in a wheelbarrow after this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj laughed a little louder than he meant to at this, picturing the image of his bloated sister being wheeled around unable to walk from her own gluttony. Pria paid no attention at all, and merely piled as much food onto her plate as she could and proceeded to demolish the extra fattening pile. Somewhere deep within her food crazed brain Pria acknowledged that her silk shirt was beginning to feel tighter over her belly, but she was far too focused on stuffing as much food as possible into her mouth to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nobody spoke a word as the gorgeous Indian girl demolished the heaping stacks of food laid out in front of them. Raj was barely able to hide a smirk as he watched his sister make a complete pig of herself in front of Leonard, wondering if he was already finding her less attractive. He knew it would take much more than this for Leonard to leave her however, as he had shown numerous times before that once he had successfully snagged a mate it was incredibly hard for him to let go. If things carried on like this he knew his sneaky plan would soon see results, he just wondered how much fat he had to force onto his sisters slim frame before Leonard finally dumped her. Within minutes Pria was licking the remaining crumbs from the plates, desperate to get every last scrap of food into her bulging belly. Leonard looked very awkward at what he had just witnessed and he couldn't help but notice how strained the buttons on her silk shirt now were over her severally stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrraaaap!!\" Bellowed Pria, before the enormity of what she had just eaten hit her full force \"Uhhhh... Hiccough!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria slumped into her chair groaning, her eyes unfocused as she held her bloated, churning belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Um... This was nice Raj...\" Said Leonard, finally finding his voice \"Thanks... But I think I'd better get her back to my apartment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time\" Raj replied with an evil grin \"But how do you plan to do that? I think my dear sis is a little food comatosed at present\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true of course, Pria was certainly in no state to move anywhere as she sat breathing heavily on her chair only just able to avoid slumping to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Wheelbarrow?\" Suggested Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have one\" Answered Raj \"I have a toboggan though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's going to work\" Said Leonard frowning at Raj before turning to his super stuffed girlfriend \"Baby? Um... Are you ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccuuurrppp\" She exclaimed weakly, turning her head to try to focus her weary eyes on him \"Too... Hiccc... Full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished speaking she closed her eyes completely and was soon snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that tears it\" Said Raj \"She's staying here tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Said Leonard rather reluctantly \"Ill drop by tomorrow then probably...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj agreed, smiling the same unpleasant smile as he ushered Leonard from his apartment while he stared longingly at the unconscious, bloated form of Pria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye now\" Said Raj \"Ill call you when she's up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Said Leonard \"And thanks again for a... Um... Good evening\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj closed the door and slowly turned to his slumbering sister. This had been completely unplanned but he simply couldn't pass up on it. This unsupervised alone time with Pria would be put to good use, and he was determined to force her to gain as much weight as possible before Leonard returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his next plan of action, Raj took the time to carefully weigh Pria so that he could get an idea of progress. This was achieved by carefully lifted her unconscious form up via her armpits, and verily placing her on a set of electronic scales, before moving her back to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm 118\" He said thoughtfully \"That's got to be at least five pounds extra... Not bad sis, not bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Pria slept off the food coma Raj took the opportunity to run to the store and stock up on food for when she woke up. When the fridge and cupboards were full of unhealthy snack foods he decided to spur her on a little, in case the hunger drug had worn off. Using a catheter like straw, he put one end in Pria's mouth and another in a plastic bag which he had filled with more of the drug. He now squeezed the bag which forced the drug down the straw into his sleeping sisters mouth, who unwittingly swallowed it. When the bag was empty Raj grinned to himself and sat down on the sofa, switching on an episode of the original Star Trek at full volume. Pria started st the sudden noise and looked around in bleary confusion clearly having no concept of what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... Where's Leonard? Hicc\" She mumbled, stifling a hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he left\" Said Raj casually, deliberately sowing seeds of doubt \"You were too busy making a complete pig of yourself to notice though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... I what?\" She said in disbelief \"I did? Oh my God, i don't know what came over me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaj could tell by the look in her eyes and her voice trailing off that the drug was beginning to work on her yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh is somebody feeling a little hungry?\" Teased Raj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nn.. No... I am not\" Said Pria defiantly \"Not in the slightest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes and drooling mouth say different dear sister\" Said Raj, clearly thoroughly enjoying his power trip \"Lucky for you though your dear brother predicted your gluttonous behaviour, so there is plenty for you to eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria groaned as her stomach (which was still a little bloated from her previous meal) grumbled loudly and she felt the hunger slowly take over her mental facilities. She glared at Raj before her eyes flitted to the kitchen cupboards which she now reluctantly edged toward. Raj returned to his show with a wry smile as his sister fell upon his kitchen with an animalistic hunger. Numerous wrappers and emptied boxes were tossed carelessly over Pria's shoulder as she munched her way through Rajs substantial selection of snacks. The sounds of munching and swallowing almost drowned out the TV, but Raj didn't turn up the volume as he enjoyed the sounds even more than the episode of Star Trek episode he was watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The young Indian beauty was eating at a truly remarkable speed, but no matter how much she ate she never seemed satisfied. When the cupboards were bear Pria returned to the couch, groaning as her belly churned from the incredible amount she had eaten that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your not watching your figure anymor sis? Not judging by that gluttonous display\" Said Raj casually as his sister groaned next to him \"I mean look at your belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. Don't know what came over me.. Hiccc\" Said Pria in a weary, over fed delirium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons on her silk shirt were even more strained than last time, and Raj could tell that they would not be able to maintain their integrity for much longer. Soon Pria was sound asleep again, her large dome of a bloated belly gurgling as she slumbered. Raj couldn't help himself, he simply had to see her pop at least one button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, its nothing personal\" Said Raj, grabbing a protein shake from the coffee table \"Its just business... Oh and fun, like really really fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the end of a funnel past his sisters lips gently, before beginning to carefully poor the shake down it into her slumbering mouth. Even unconscious Pria couldn't control her greed, as she accepted and began swallowing the shake without help from Raj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes that's it sister\" Said Raj softly \"Lets get you big and fat for your dear Leonard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Raj to get what he wanted, as after two of the shakes a button finally popped off her silk shirt, her taut belly finally winning its freedom. Pria groaned softly to herself as her belly sank and rose with each laboured breath and soon there was a shower of buttons, as each one shared the fate of its brethren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Said Raj in awe \"That was amazing... We'll definitely have to get you pop some buttons again... Though maybe with a bigger audience next time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pria woke up again she had the morning sun shining onto her face from Rajs apartment window, which she immediately tried to block with her hand as she squinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\" Sang Raj with a brightness that Pria did not share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh whuh happened?\" She asked blearily \"Why was I asleep on your couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you don't remember?\" Said Raj, clearly relishing the fact that he had to remind her \"You don't remember what a gluttonous fool you made of yourself last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. What?\" Said Pria clearly confused as her mind slowly focused \"... Oh God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria had glanced down and seen her near buttonless shirt (the only buttons remaining were over her bosom) with her belly protruding slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I know\" Said Raj \"You ate until you popped all the buttons off your shirt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria looked justifiably horrified at this concerning news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard!\" She said suddenly \"I've got to go and see Leonard... I can't believe this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria stood, trying to hide her naked belly by pulling her shirt back together and tucking it in to her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving so soon?\" Enquired Raj \"Wouldn't you like this breakfast I prepared first? Surely gorging is more important than your relationship with Leonard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Said Pria hotly \"How can you say... Um... Are those pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes they are\" Said Raj \"You want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... No, I have to...\" She stammered, her rising drool levels signalling her beginning to lose control \"Leonard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria was already sitting down at this point and Raj was gleefully placing the heaping plate of pancakes in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria rose from her seat again, leaving a plate of crumbs behind. The pancakes (and accompanying jug of syrup, which she had glugged down separately) didn't even touch the sides, lasting merely minutes at the mercy of the Indian beauty with the hunger of a bengal tiger. Raj grinned as he walked his sister the door, who was glowing red with embarrassment as she grabbed her coat and pulled it closed over her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon sis\" Said Raj, smiling like the Cheshire cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Said Pria not meeting his gaze \"Just.. Um... Keep this to yourself okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Said Raj, closing the door still smiling broadly \"Just between us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

How are things with you?\" Asked Penny, before adding rather suddenly \"And her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah, things are good... Or okay... I think\" Replied Leonard rather awkwardly, clearly unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound very sure\" Said Penny \"Everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Yeah\" Said Leonard, trying to find the words to describe the bizarre events that had happened at Rajs apartment \"Its just, Pria seems a little off... At Rajs place she, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off and Penny could feel the sides of her mouth twitching into a smile, knowing exactly what Leonard was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she's fine\" Said Penny reassuringly \"I was thinking it may be nice if she came over my place tonight. We could all bond and have a girls night... Maybe that would help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard considered this for a moment, as he had actually made plans to play Halo that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah... That would be nice actually\" He said \"I know she doesn't really have any girl friends here... I'll ask her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Said Penny, smiling \"I think it would do her good... We'll have some wine, talk about boyfriends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard shared a concerned look at this last statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kidding\" Said Penny \"We have way more interesting things to talk about than you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... Yeah sure...\" Said Leonard, actually seeming disappointed that he wasn't going to be their topic of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard and Pria were walking back in the direction of Leonards apartment, having just made out for a considerable amount of time. He hadn't seen her since her bizarre display at Rajs, and though she seemed to be back to her usual self he still couldn't shake Pennys advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... How've you been?\" He asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know... Fine\" She answered carefully \"Just busy with work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence while Leonard struggled with the best way to approach the sensitive subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking...\" He said \"I know you don't really have any female friends around here, and I know it can't be easy to always be hanging around with a group of guys... And Sheldon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess\" Said Pria, raising an eye brow slightly at the random statement \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now ascending the stairs to Leonards floor, so he knew he had to reach his point now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually, now you ask\" He stumbled on awkwardly \"Penny thought it would be nice if you came over hers tonight... You know for some girl time. Get your girl time on... As it, um, were\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Asked Pria, genuinely surprised \"Penny said that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" Said Leonard \"She was saying how much she'd love you to be friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet\" Replied Pria, rather hollowly \"But I'm not really prepared...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey guys\" Said Penny, who 'just happened' to be stepping out of her apartment \"Did Leonard mention about tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I told her\" Said Leonard \"Pria said she'd love to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool\" Said Penny, hiding a smirk as she saw the look Pria now shot Leonard \"I see you've got a bag, hope you brought sleeping stuff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um...

It had taken considerable coercing from the other girls to get Pria to change into her bedroom attire, but finally she relented despite how uncomfortable she felt. Seeing Pria in her fancy silk pajamas made the girls loath her even more, and they were itching to bring her down a peg. The girls exchanged meaningful glances which indicated that their plan was about to spring into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what shall we do girls?\" Asked Penny \"A whole evening worth of no guys... Or Sheldons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo ooo I know!\" Said Amy eagerly \"We should watch chick flicks, eat ice cream and tease each other for being fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria raised an eyebrow at the rather specific suggestion, and Amy realized perhaps she'd been a little hasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw it in a movie\" She explained \"I've never actually been to a slumber party, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it wouldn't be a slumber party without ice cream and chick flicks\" Said Penny \"Lets crack open the Ben and Jerrys girls\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay actually, thank you\" Said Pria, awkwardly raising her hand for attention \"I'm watching my figure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had to try hard not to grin at this, knowing that Pria was probably referring to what had happened at Rajs apartment. If she and the other girls had their way, tonight would surpass even that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... Like me to\" Said Penny dismissively \"This is all totally fat free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Said Bernadette \"Its fat free but still really good! Give it a try Pria, I bet you won't be able to tell the difference\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny handed a carton of cookies and cream Ben and Jerrys to Pria with the spoon dug into the ice cream and Pria tentatively took it. The girls watched eagerly as Pria raised the spoon to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" She exclaimed, her eyes suddenly wide \"This is really good! It doesnt taste fat free at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason for that dumbass\" Bernadette whispered and Amy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched as Pria ate another spoonful, and then another and another, all the time her countenance changing from calm to an animalistic frenzy just as it had done at with Raj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand she's gone\" Announced Bernadette much to the amusement of Penny and Amy \"Look at her go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria was shoveling ice cream down her throat at an astonishing speed, clearly unaffected by any form of brain freeze. Penny lined up all of their ice cream cartons in front of Pria, and it wasn't long before she'd wolfed down her own and moved on to the next. The girls watched on silent awe as the gorgeous Indian ate faster and faster, the only noises being moans and groans of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Penny, at this rate Pria is going to run out of food\" Said Amy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I got that covered, don't you worry\" Penny opened the fridge revealing an insane amount of fattening foods \"Plus all my cupboards are full to the brim... Like seriously I've never had so much food in here, it's crazy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that means you won't be using Leonard for free meals anymore then\" Said Bernadette with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Penny \"... Unlikely, there won't be anything left after this Indian piglet is done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yayy!\" Said Amy happily \"Can we poke fun at the glutton now?? I've been looking forward to this! It's not often I get to be the barer of hurtful jokes rather than the brunt of them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock yourself out\" Said Penny, gesturing at Pria who had not stopped stuffing her face \"But I don't think she's even aware of our existence at this point... All she sees is food and nothing else\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem\" Said Amy, clearing her throat and brimming with eagerness \"Pria... You are getting fat! You fat pig! Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy seemed very proud of her witty insult, though Penny and Bernadette were not as impressed. Pria gave no sign she had heard as she finished her ice cream tub, gave a burp and started her next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I think your right Penny\" Said Bernadette, waving her hand in front of Prias face to get some kind of reaction \"She really has no awareness of what's going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Agreed Penny \"How about we have a bit of fun, hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How are we going to get her attention?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n\u201cOh thats easy\u201d Said Penny and quickly snatched the tub of ice cream from Pria\u2019s grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria snarled like a feral animal and desperately reached for the ice cream which Penny held just out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah ah\u201d Said Penny as though she were addressing a child \u201cEasy girl... if you want to continue stuffing your greedy fat face you\u2019ve got to do what we say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria sat down on the ground and pouted, which was both cute and amusing. The overwhelming food craving she felt had reduced her once MENSA level IQ to that of a prehistoric beast, but even so she understood what she needed to do to continue her gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Bernie, make this fat slob earn her gluttony\u201d Said Penny sadistically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOo... Lets see\u201d Said Bernadette, taking a hearty swig of wine \u201cLets start slowly... Pria give us a nice sexy dance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPria glared at the group for a moment before grumpily getting to her feet. Penny turned on her Hi Fi and soon \u201cBabys Got Back\u201d was blasting through the speakers. Driven by the whoops and jeers from the girls, Pria began to shuck and jive for their amusement. Her belly was noticeably bloated underneath her silk pajamas, and the trio laughed uproariously at the sight. Her belly gurgled as she performed a slut drop, before twerking in a very sexual manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan she\u2019s really getting into it\u201d Commented Bernadette as Pria basically began dancing like a stripper, biting her lip as she ran her hands over her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the song finally ended Pria was panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was quite a show haha\u201d Said Penny \u201cI guess you earnt this\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Pria the tub of ice cream who grunted as she took it and emptied its slightly melted contents down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smirked as, upon being able to tip anymore ice cream from the tub, greedily stuffed her face in there and licked it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh\u201d Said Amy as she watched Pria staring forlornly at the empty tub \u201cHas the piggie run out of food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all giggled as Pria looked quite distraught, each of them rather tipsy at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Bernie\u201d Said Penny \u201cLets see who gets to make the fat cow earn her next meal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette spun the bottle again, and after a few rotations it stopped on Amy who clapped her hands with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God oh my God!\u201d She cried with excitement \u201cMy very first hazing! Well... my first time of being the hazer rather than a hazeie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood and walked over to Pria, who was knelt down.<br>\r\n\u201cNow what shall I do with you?\u201d Said Amy, in a rather slurry tone from all the wine \u201cI bet your hungry again already arent you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked Prias head as though she were a dog and as if on cue her tummy rumbled and Pria nodded sadly. Penny and Bernie both giggled at this and clinked their wine glasses together. Amy glanced around Pennys rather messy apartment, seemingly looking for inspiration. Her gaze fell on something in the corner of the room which she knew to be Pennys beer bong and an unpleasant smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d She said \u201cMaybe we should get Pria onto our level!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoo! Yeahh!!\u201d Cried Penny, clearly on a level all of her own as she rushed to her kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned with a 6 pack of beer, more tubs of ice cream and other fattening food stuffs. Pria was not much of a drinker, but she was starving and so allowed the tube of the beer bong to be pushed into her mouth without complaint. Soon she was chugging down her first beer while the girls chanted \u201cChug! Chug! Chug!\u201d as though they were in a sorority. Beers were followed by ooey gooey melted ice cream, cartons of double cream, chocolate milk and any other fattening liquids the girls could get their hands on. Pria closed her eyes as she greedily slurped down whatever was poured down the tube, feeling her belly swell and begin to press tightly against the buttons on her silk nightie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, opening up the bar, she took a whiff of it, commenting about it smelling pretty good...  So with that, Maddie took a cautious bite of it...  Maddie commented, \"Hmm, not bad actually!\"  A few minutes later, Maddie started to feel like she was sick.  \"Oh, man...  What was in that...\"  Maddie's words was cut short by a weird feeling...  Her butt was starting to become too tight for her skirt!  As she ran her hands on her newly enhanced figure, all she could get out was, \"What in blazes...\"  Her chest was soon the next victim...  Her cups slowly growing, her bra was straining to contain the bigger figure, which was better than her shirt was doing...  It lost the battle, popping a few buttons...  Maddie started to grunt, like she was having a huge gas pain, and gasped when she seen her belly slowly swell up!  And this time, she tried to unbutton her shirt before it popped anymore buttons, but it was too late!  Like a balloon, Maddie's belly steadily bulged outward, stopping finally when it looked like a beachball!  Not knowing what to do,  Maddie poked her new bulbous belly, and shrieked at the lack of give her belly had...  Maddie worriedly said, \"I can't be pregnant, can I?!?\"</span></div></div>",

Her arrogance showed in every movement she made and in her facial expressions as each channel failed to interest her. To many people, especially those in the trailer park, Joy was the most beautiful woman they had ever seen... the only problem was she was well aware of this. Her hair (when it wasn't tied up in bunches) cascaded down her delicate features and silky smooth skin like a golden waterfall and her baby blue eyes often took mens breath away. She had a body that most women would kill for (another fact she was well aware of), and it seemed almost impossible to believe that she had already had multiple kids. Her stomach very subtly displayed abs, but despite her slightly toned body her breasts were still incredibly generous for her body type as they were a decently sized C (they looked much larger due to her small frame).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, all these channels and not one good thing on any of em\" She said to herself, \"What the hell am I supposed to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She was fully looking forward to her day of pampering and drunkenness at the expense of her dumb ex husband. She took a pen knife out of her pocket as she approached her neighbours pick up truck, looking around cautiously as she slid out the knife attachment. She stuck the knife in the door lock when she was sure she wasn't being watched, and with a few wiggles the door opened. This was a regular occurrence when she needed to get around town, and she figured her neighbour didn't mind and if they did she didn't care. After a few minutes fumbling with wires she managed to get the truck going and accelerated out of the trailer park as fast as her rather haggard vehicle would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at Earls residence about 10 minutes later and parked the stolen truck. She got out cautiously and looked up at Earls room; it seemed vacant.

Catalina and Joy had been bitter enemies ever since the day they met. The reason for their constant clashes was simple; Catalina was a very kind hearted person, though ruthless when she needed to be, and Joy was just a terrible person plane and simple. Catalina especially hated Joy for how much she had hurt, and continued to hurt, her beloved friend Earl and she had thought for awhile that there should be some retribution exacted for it. But Catalina being how she was had first come to Earl with her idea of retribution and Earl had\timmediately said that he didn't want any sort of actions taken because of him so Catalina had obeyed out of respect for him. But now Joy had gone too far! Thought Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awkward silence, where the hostility could of been cut with a knife, Catalina finally spoke. \"So your back to stealing off Earl I see?\" She said angrily and Joy sneered at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I am?

After 10 minutes of drinking, Catalina managed to finish hers before Joy and as she slammed down the glass she was met with a riot of cheers and applause. Catalina noticed that despite her victory Joy had still finished all of her shots and the serum each contained and she smiled broadly at the thought of it bubbling in her stomach. Catalina was also receiving all of the mens attention now due to her incredible drinking ability, and this made Joy look incredibly angry which only made Catalina smile wider. Joy got unsteadily to her feet looking disheartened at the sudden shift of attention she had just experienced, and as she did Catalina looked gleefully at her stomach, which looked as though it was slowly bloating outwards.

Ahm better then all of yaa anyways!\" She said, trying to stand straight but failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke her stomach began to strain her daisy dukes slightly, much as it had earlier but this time it was fat that was creating the strain rather than bloating. Also, Catalina noticed that it wasn't just Joys stomach which was receiving a little extra padding.. Joys hips were also getting subtly wider and were starting to pudge over her jean shorts, giving her a slight muffin top. The gain wasn't incredibly huge or anything, probably only 4-5 pounds (which is a lot in one sitting) but it was enough for her jean shorts and top to look a little tight on her new bloated mid section (she had a rather cute little pot belly now).

You look very hungry after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these words Joy felt a strange intense feeling of hunger inside of her, that had certainly not been there moments ago. The shock showed on her face as her eyes widened at the feeling and Catalina smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not 'ungry\" Said Joy, rather quietly and unconvincingly, but as she said it the feelings of hunger intensified and Joys hands moved unconsciously to her rumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned as she felt her once flat stomach, which was now feeling a little softer allowing her fingers to sink slightly into the new layer of fat there. She was too drunk to really pay much attention to it as it wasn't that obvious of a gain, but Catalina still took pleasure in the fact that she had noticed that she'd put on a few pounds already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I come in then?\" Asked Catalina casually, stepping into the trailer before Joy could protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was visibly seething at the intrusion, but knew that Catalina held the upper hand so she had to obey her. Plus, although she hated herself for feeling it, Joy was really feeling hungry now and was unable to hide it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! If your gonna be here you may as well make me somefin' good to eat\" She said, trying to at least retain her defiant tone although it was getting less and less convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, so we are hungry hmm?\" Cooed Catalina, and Joys cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina rummaged through the cupboards and looked very happy at what she found; there was a lot of junk food here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Joy\" Said Catalina, throwing Joy a big bag of doritos, \"For such a slim woman you sure do have a lot of junk food here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy caught the bag, opening it roughly before cramming a handful of crisps into her mouth, \"I got kids, it ain't fer me\" She said when she had swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is now my dear\" Said Catalina smiling, \"You munch your crisps while I whip you up something else\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was furious with herself for pigging out infront of Catalina, but she couldn't help it as her body forced her to eat as fast as possible. Catalina watched her happily for a few more moments as she crammed handful after handful of doritos into her mouth, getting fragments of them all over herself, before turning back to the cupboards to decide what to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When Joy had finished her crisps (which didn't take long at all), Catalina threw a big pack of chocolate bars over which Joy caught, unwrapped and began to munch on. Once again this didn't take Joy long to finish so Catalina gave her 2 big boxes of assorted pastries, thinking that this would keep her occupied until her feast was ready. As Joy ate she had keep readjusting her Daisy Dukes, which were beginning to feel strangely snug, as well as her bra which was slowly beginning to strain from her growing breasts. As Joy crammed the 5th fattening pastry into her mouth, she burped loudly and Catalina looked over tutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your such a pig\" She said scaldingly, \"And pretty soon you'll be as fat as one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-uhh- Shut up -urp-\" Said Joy as crammed another donut into her mouth, and Catalina smiled as she looked at Joys stomach which was slowly developing into a pot belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top button of Joys tight jean shorts was really being strained now, and stress lines had appeared around it as her tummy bloated outward. When Joy had stuffed in her 10th pastry the button could not hold on any longer and popped off her shorts. Joy looked horrified and immediately examined her once toned midsection, noticing for the first time that she had gained weight there. She now had the small bump of a pot belly, as well as very slight love handles which bulged ever so slightly over the edge of her tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!?\" Cried Joy, horrified at her discovery, \"I never had this before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina chuckled, \"I wouldn't worry about it dear\" She said soothingly, \"Just carry on pigging out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was flabbergasted, knowing that somehow this was Catalinas doing. But after a short while her stomach rumbled loudly and she groaned, feeling the familiar hunger pains and immediately giving into them. She crammed the remaining pastries into her mouth, chewing frantically and causing crumbs and fragments to land in her cleavage which had subtly grown, further tightening her bra. Catalina finally walked over carrying a huge tray of food and Joys eyes widened at how much she was expected to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to finish all tha'?\" Cried Joy, as she brushed the fragments of food from her cleavage that had landed there earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a growing girl aren't you? I don't think you'll have a problem with it!\" Answered Catalina happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wan' to be a growin' girl\" Joy said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, unfortunately, isn't your choice to make tubby\" Answered Catalina, poking Joys slight pot belly upon saying \"tubby\" which caused Joy to wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina laid down the food on the table infront of Joy and Joy glared angrily at her, her cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.. dig in!\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

She was about to defy Catalina and say \"NO!\" to her request to further give in to her gluttony, but as soon as the thought entered her head her stomach rumbled loudly. Catalina smiled as Joy held her belly uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you hungry baby?\" She said condescendingly, stroking Joys head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off!!\" Bellowed Joy, her face contorted with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile vanished from Catalinas face, but Joy refused to be intimidated and continued to glare at her. As quick as a flash Catalina grabbed a slice of pizza and rammed it into Joys mouth, which caught her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just eat your food you fat fucking cow\" Catalina said dangerously as Joy frantically chewed and swallowed the slice of pizza that had been rammed into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the slice had been swallowed Joy completely lost herself to her gluttony, even more so than before, and grabbed two more slices which were devoured very quickly and noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ommshhhh Ommshh URP!! Errrfff!\" Came Joys piggish noises, which cracked a smile on Catalinas face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoys hands were a blur as she shoveled the unhealthy food stuffs into her gluttonous mouth, each morsel seemingly making her even more hungry than before. After each mouthful Joy would take in a deep breath, usually followed by a small burp or hiccup, before she plouged on. Catalina could actually see Joy slowly filling out as the fat from the extremely unhealthy food circulated around her body, which was something that pleased her. Joys pink frilly top was beginning to ride up her stomach, which stuck out beneath it and created a very cute muffin top over her tight jean shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

At first Catalina was getting great enjoyment from seeing the blond beauty humiliate herself, offering snide comments about her growing form and poking her cute muffin top which spilled onto her lap slightly. Joy however offered no response at all to her tormentor, ignoring all of Catalinas barbed comments and focusing only on stuffing her face, so Catalina slowly grew bored. She eventually grabbed a magazine out of boredom and began to read as Joy continued eating like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHMMSHH OMSSSHH -urp- -hic-\" Came Joys loud eating sounds as Catalina ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's it darling\" Said Catalina without looking, \"Your a growing girl, so get your fill\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy could actually feel her stomach expand outward with the new weight that was being added to it, as it was slowly forcing the zip down on her jean shorts and exposing her pink spotted panties. She could also feel her bra slowly becoming more and more snug as her breasts also received new weight, and it was becoming possible to see small strain lines forming on the front of her frilly pink top as her breasts pushed against the fabric (which only increased her glorious cleavage). Joy didn't care about any of these sensations however and merely plouged on, eating like she thought the food would be taken from her at any minute. By the time Joy was wolfing down the last burger into her mouth, Catalina was dozing off. Upon finishing the burger Joy let out a thunderous burp which made Catalina jump, and look around confused for a few moments while she got her bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" She said, with genuine disbelief as she saw the empty table in front of Joy, \"Good work piggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as Joy was fondling her own stomach that her senses came back to her, violently jarring her back to reality. Joy could feel her fingers sinking into the flesh of her stomach as she rubbed, which caused her to frown slightly before the full horror of what had just transpired came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA' THE HELL?!?\" She screamed, as she examined her stomach, which now formed a rather obvious soft pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your new belly my dear\" Said Catalina happily, \"You've worked very hard to get it.. Aren't you proud of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO I AHM NOT PROUD OF IT!\" Yelled Joy angrily, \"LOOK AT DIS FLABBY THING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounting the 5 pounds Joy had gained at the bar earlier, she had perhaps gained about 10 pounds altogether. The weight was most obvious around her waistline, as she had a very cute pot belly, with small pudgy love handles which were both enhanced by her tight jean shorts, as they spilled over the top of them. Joy could also feel that her breasts and butt had received some extra weight as her bra/ top and panties/ jean shorts were feeling noticeably more snug and uncomfortable, so she had to adjust them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think you've done very well tubby\" Said Catalina, poking Joys exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dohn't call me dat!\" Said Joy through gritted teeth as she slapped Catalinas hand away angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but that's what you are my dear!\" Said Catalina in a matter of fact tone, \"You are tubby.. and pretty soon you're going to be a hideously fat cow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was red in the face from the anger and hatred she felt towards Catalina, but she managed to contain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get some sleep\" Said Catalina, \"Your husband will be home tomorrow, and I wonder what he'll think of his fatter wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina stood up and left Joy sat there, turning around to smirk at her once more before letting herself out of the trailer. Joy felt furious and humiliated as she glared at the closed door, knowing that Catalina had the upper hand and she could do nothing about it. After a while Joy grumpily rose to her feet, which caused her jean shorts to fall down showing her tight pink spotted panties to the world. She had forgotten that her pot belly had popped the button off and forced the zip down and she cursed angrily to herself. She pulled the tight shorts back up, sucking in her stomach as she forced the zip back up. When she exhaled, she could feel the zip slowly being pushed back down again by her chubby belly, and she almost wanted to cry, but refused to let herself as her will was too strong. Joy collapsed angrily onto her bed, thoughts of what her husband would think of her new weight causing her to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She awoke the next morning, awoken by gurgling sounds which her stomach was emitting and at first she didn't remember about the events of last night. She stretched, the joints in her arms clicking and she let out a large prolonged yawn as she got her bearings. Unconsciously her hands slowly made their way down her body, finally coming to rest on her stomach. She frowned to herself as she felt it, noticing an obvious bulge to it which had been created by her binge from the night before. Her look of confusion soon become that of shock and horror as it slowly dawned on her what had transpired the previous night. She looked down slowly, fearful of what she may find and let out a long mournful moan as she saw her stomach poke out noticeably from underneath her top (which certainly felt more snug than usual, and she had to keep rearranging under her armpits in a feeble attempt to cover her stomach). She prodded her new pot belly and felt her fingers sink into the soft, doughy flesh which had accumulated there and her thoughts become that of hatred toward Catalina. Before she could dwell too much on her anger however her stomach rumbled loudly, and she realized with intense shame that she was actually feeling extremely hungry. Joy got slowly out of bed, removing her top and jean shorts as she did. She stood in her bright pink bra and panties and examined herself in her bedroom mirror, standing to the side so she could see how far her belly stuck out. She noticed that her belly not only stuck out about 3 inches, but she had also developed some nice small love handles which hung over the waistband of her panties (her abdomen itself was also slightly wider). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god damnit\" Joy said to herself, angered by her gain, \"I look like a god damn fatty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour Joy finally emerged from her bedroom. She had platted her hair into pig tails (a process which she found relaxing), put on a rather tight looking white sleeveless top and had managed to squeeze into a rather tight pair of jeans, which she buttoned up by sucking her stomach in as far as it would go (it now looked in danger of popping off). Suddenly she heard a knock at the door and frowned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's knockin' mah door at this time?\" She mumbled to herself and approached the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Inside the bag Joy discovered a number of Mcdonalds breakfast items (including several burgers) and a large number of donuts, as Catalina eyed her up and smiled to herself when she noticed the obvious bump of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to eat all dis?!\" Said Joy, though she knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Said Catalina smiling broadly, \"And if I were you i'd do so before your husband returns home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy practically growled at Catalina, but after a few moments she begrudgingly walked back into her trailer and Catalina followed. As much as Joy hated to admit it she genuinely was extremely hungry, and as she walked she grabbed a large Sausage and egg mcmuffin and took a large bite from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it tubby!\" Said Catalina, \"No time like the present!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmsh..Shuddup!\" Joy responded, her mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy sat down on her sofa where she had only the night before stuffed herself silly. She chose to ignore Catalina, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of showing her anger and slowly worked her way through the bag of food without a word. She finished each Mcmuffin with 3 bites, using a large milkshake which was also in the bag to aide with her swallowing. As she ate she could feel her stomach slowly bloat out more, and she cursed herself for picking such tight jeans as they were feeling even tighter now. At the half way point Joy grunted uncomfortably, and undid the top button on her jeans (which somehow had not popped off already) which allowed room for her growing belly. There were obvious stretch marks across her tight white top, particularly over her breasts and it was possible to see how her breasts were bulging above her tightening bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your getting good at this\" Commented Catalina, as Joy crammed donut after donut into her greedy mouth, \"You'll be a big fat heifer in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later Joy had successfully finished everything in the bag, and Catalina applauded her. Joy stifled a burp and rubbed her full tummy, which had expanded outward an extra couple of inches from the large breakfast she had consumed. The weight gain drug she had consumed the day before was already doing it's thing and her stomach slowly shrank as the fat was distributed around her body. Joy had to rearrange her underwear because she could actually feel her ass slowly expand outward with extra fat which caused her to receive a wedgie from her snug panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm very impressed piggy\" Said Catalina, \"Your filling out very nicely, and it's nice to see your appetite is through the roof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop callin' me piggy!\" Said Joy through gritted teeth, unable to hide her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's exactly what you are my dear\" Said Catalina condescendingly, \"Your a tubby, flabby, ugly piggy and your only going to get bigger from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy went scarlet in the face and Catalina smiled, pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd best be off anyway\" Said Catalina in an offhand tone, walking towards the door, \"I'll see you for lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina closed the door behind her, giggling to herself as she did so leaving Joy alone glaring after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She examined her midsection again, regarding the extra padding she found there with a sigh (there was now slightly more than when she had first awoke) and remembering how proud she used to be of her amazing body. She wondered with a feeling of fear and dread how fat Catalina actually planned to make her, and how long it would take for all of her friends to notice. After a few minutes Joy fell asleep, the amount of food she had consumed making her feel drowsy and she lay snoring on the sofa. She was soon awoken however by the sound of the trailer door opening which indicated the return of Darnell and her sons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby\" Said Darnell with a smile, as Joy hurriedly sat up and rearranged her tight clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Said Joy, with a lot less enthusiasm than Darnell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarnell was clutching a brown paper bag which he now handed to Joy with a smile. Joy already knew what it was, and upon opening the bag her suspicions were confirmed; more food! The bag was full with pancakes from the nearby pancake shack, and Joys eyes widened in shock and dread as she saw how many there were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and the kids figured you'd be hungry\" Explained Darnell happily, \"And I know you love pancakes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy gulped nervously, forcing a rather unconvincing smile as she looked from the bag of pancakes to her husband. The worst thing was now that she'd smelled the amazing aroma that was coming from the pancakes she felt hungry yet again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't.. I already ate...\" Said Joy, in turmoil as she tried to fight the feeling of hunger that was growing inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. Okay then..:\" Said Darnell, looking genuinely hurt that he'd failed to please Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her tough attitude, Joys heart was not made of stone and she felt bad as it was sweet of Darnell to get her her favourite breakfast. With a sigh she conceded to the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spose one can't hurt..\" She said, forcing a smile which Darnell and kids returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy grabbed a pancake from the bag and proceeded to take a tentative bite from it; it tasted heavenly. Despite the fact that she had already eaten a rather substantial breakfast some 30 minutes ago it wasn't long before she was greedily cramming the pancakes into her mouth. Darnell and the kids watched her in surprise as she finished all 7 pancakes in under a minute and let out a small burp. Darnells eyes traveled down Joys body and came to rest at her midsection were the obvious bump of a small pot belly was easily visible sticking out from under her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The silence stretched for longer than was comfortable as Joy desperately tried to think of a way out of spending yet more time in the company of her nemesis. Her nemesis who would stop at nothing to ruin her once perfect figure Joy thought bitterly to herself as she once again examined her softer midriff with a degree of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\" Said Darnell, which snapped Joy out of her thoughtful trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked up and saw Catalina poking her head around the corner of the doorway fixing her with a meaningful stare, and so Joy conceded miserably knowing there was nothing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" Said Joy through gritted teeth, but trying her best to show enthusiasm, \"Ah can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then slowpoke\" Catalina said playfully and Darnell smiled, happy that the two had seemingly buried the hatchet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy rose unhappily to her feet, kissed Darnell goodbye and left with Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a journey where Joy refused to speak a word to Catalina, the two arrived at their destination. Joy was unsurprised at Catalinas choice, as it was a restaurant which served the largest burgers in town. Also on top of this it boasted the largest ice cream sundae in the state, which was so gigantic that nobody had ever finished it. Catalina smiled happily at the look of misery on Joys face and patted her small protruding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look hungry piggy\" She said, \"Lets get you something to stuff your face with shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy muttered something unintelligible and the two entered the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________________________________________________________&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two were seated, Catalina ordered for Joy and within a short period of time the food was brought over to them. There were two gigantic milkshakes, and two enormous burgers with fries which were placed infront of each of them. Joy almost thought that Catalina only expected her to eat one of the meals, but once again her hopes were crushed when Catalina pushed her burger and milkshake toward Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw.. did you only expect to eat one of them?\" Said Catalina with mock fondness when she saw Joys expression, \"I wouldn't want to deprive you.. Now, tuck in tubby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy glared at her before she silently conceded and grabbed the burger infront of her. The burger was almost the size of her head, and Joys eyes widened at the shere weight of the thing wondering how she was supposed to eat one of them, let alone two. As Joy stared in disbelief at the monstrous burger, Catalina removed a large tub from her bag which caught Joys attention. The tub was inscribed \"Bulk Up\" and Joy looked at it quizzically, though she knew it could only be something bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't getting fat quick enough\" Catalina explained in an off-hand tone as she opened the tub, \"So from now on i'll be adding this to everything that you drink... you'll be nearing obesity in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina grabbed a large spoon from her bag and proceeded to dip it into the tub. She then removed a heaping spoonful of white powder from the tub which she added to one of the milkshakes in front of Joy, before adding another spoonful to the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then fatty... stuff your fat face!\" Commanded Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked forlornly at Catalina, almost wanting to beg for mercy to escape her fate but she knew it would do no good and would probably only please Catalina more so she silently took a bite from her burger. Joy could feel that the top button of her jeans was already extremely tight, so she lowered her hand to unbutton it but Catalina wagged her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah\" She said, \"I like seeing you pop buttons, so that button will remain buttoned until your unsightly blubber pops it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy groaned miserably, but didn't argue and continued to eat the gigantic burger. It took Joy ten minutes to finish the burger, after which Catalina got her wish and the top button popped off Joys tight jeans as her growing abdomen swelled outward. Catalina laughed uproariously as she saw the button fly across the restaurant, but Joy ignored her and proceeded to wolf down the remaining fries on the plate by grabbing handful after handful of them. Joy stifled a burp and wiped her mouth with a napkin, trying to show at least some dignity before she ploughed on with the next burger. Though she didn't want to, Joy also felt the need to drink the extremely fattening milkshakes (made even more so by the substantial amount of weight gain powder Catalina had added to them) as they aided with her swallowing, and she dreaded how much weight she would gain after this. Joy could feel her soft pot belly expand further outward and push down the zip on her jeans. Her jeans were becoming tighter and tighter, and were digging into her softening flesh. After a further 30 minutes Joy had both finished the other burger meal, and both milkshakes and Catalina clapped her efforts as Joy rubbed her full stomach and stifled another burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good tubby, very good indeed\" Said Catalina, and Joy grit her teeth at the constant fat jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ta hell!\" Said Joy, but Catalina only smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up\" Ordered Catalina, \"Let me see your fat belly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ah stand up, ma jeans will fall down!\" Said Joy hotly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Do as your told!\" Said Catalina venomously, and Joy reluctantly obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy held her jeans in place as she stood up to prevent them falling down and Catalina laughed at the sight, as it was possible to see Joys panties through her open jean zip. Joys pot belly was easily visible (as her white top rode above it) and had seemingly doubled in size due to the amount of food that it now contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step to the side\" Said Catalina, so Joy did so to offer a side view of her new girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice\" Said Catalina, as she grabbed Joys stomach and jiggled it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we done now?\" Said Joy, blushing deeply from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Catalina do?</span></div></div>",

No I don't think so piggy\" Said Catalina, \"I think you'll have room for a little dessert\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked flabbergasted, \"Ah've just ate two damn meals already.. You can't be serious\" She said in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your done when I say your done fatso\" Said Catalina, and motioned at a nearby waiter who came over to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy sat down moodily and folded her arms in a huff as Catalina spoke to waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please bring us this ultimate sundae i've been hearing so much about, my friend here would like to take the challenge\" Said Catalina as she motioned towards the sulking figure of Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter looked a little confused, as he had already seen this small blond beauty finish two very large meals but he chose not to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" He said and walked off in the direction of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't sulk baby\" Said Catalina soothingly, \"Your a growing girl after all, this will do you good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it won't!\" Snapped Joy, \"Ah don't wanna be fat, this is goin too far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well pretty soon your going to be fat, so you may as well come to terms with it\" Said Catalina simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome ten minutes later the sundae was ready, and was pushed towards the table on a large cart by two waiters. Joys eyes widened and her mouth hung agape in horror as she saw the sundae approach her, the size of it casting a shadow over the table. It looked truly intimidating, as it was at least 3 foot high and about the same wide, and seemingly contained pretty much every ingredient it was possible to put in a sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta be kiddin me...\" Said Joy more to herself than anybody else, the horror clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen!\" Announced one of the waiters loudly, getting the attention of everybody else in the restaurant, \"This brave young woman is about to attempt the largest sundae in the state... A feat which nobody has ever accomplished before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man spoke Catalina stood next to Joy, who was still wide eyed in disbelief, and stroked her pigtails with mock sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I would really hate to be you right now\" She crooned into Joys ear, \"But after this i'll let you leave... Now show everybody what a greedy little piggy you really are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while the waiter finished his dramatic speech, none of which Joy had paid any attention to as her mind was fixed on her current predicament. Her mind was working feverishly as she tried to think of a way out of the situation but none came to her. The waiter handed her a large spoon, which she took with an unenthusiastic grunt and as she stared at the monstrous sundae a familiar feeling of hunger began to grow inside of her. The waiter then fastened a bib around Joy\u2019s neck which road over her slightly squashed breasts, and had the moniker \u201cSticky Piggy\u201d written on it with a cartoon picture of a pigs face. She groaned mournfully, took a deep breath and took her first bite of the titanic dessert. Most of the patrons of the restaurant were rather shocked to see such a small, beautiful lady attempt such a gluttonous challenge and Joy tried her best to ignore their stares. Joy ate and ate, but after about 5 minutes she was forced to stop due to a rather severe case of brain freeze. She surveyed her handiwork but discovered to her misery that she\u2019d barely dented the gargantuan sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on tubby\u201d Whispered Catalina across the table, \u201cYou can do better than that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ta hell!\u201d Joy said through gritted teeth as she massaged her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSticky Piggy! Sticky Piggy!\u2026\u201d Catalina began to chant, and pretty soon the whole restaurant had joined in, believing they were helping give support to Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoys face flushed, her cheeks turning almost a maroon colour from a combination of humiliation and anger, but instead of dwelling on it she powered on and ate another heaping spoonful of the sundae. No matter how much Joy ate, the sundae never seemed to diminish at all but she forced herself to continue regardless rather than getting discouraged knowing that her suffering was only pleasing Catalina further. Joy ate at a blistering speed, getting ice cream all around her mouth and on her bib, but because she was so focused on the task at hand she didn\u2019t notice Catalina. Catalina was leaning over the table sprinkling the \u201cBulk Up\u201d powder all over the sundae as Joy continued to demolish it. After about 10 minutes of gorging Joy was beginning to feel rather full indeed and if anybody had looked underneath the table they would have seen her bloated stomach stick out a good 9 inches. As she ate the drug Catalina had given Joy a few days previously was slowly doing its thing, digesting everything she consumed and turning it to fat around her body. Her stomach slowly shrank and softened, before it became bloated once more from her relentless stuffing. Her button less jeans, which were tight before she had even come to the restaurant, were really becoming tight now and were beginning to feel like a boa constrictor that was slowly squeezing her soft midsection. Her top was also feeling rather tight and was pinching the small amounts of flab she had accumilated underneath her armpits as more weight was added to her breasts. Stress lines were appearing across her swelling bosom, as the combination of fattening dessert and weight gain powder added extra padding all around her body. Joy ate on regardless of the uncomfortable and unsettling feeling of her tightening clothes, and pretty soon she had reached the half way point of the challenge. She sat back in her chair for a moment, her tight white top riding above her swollen stomach, and let out a small burp and a hiccup. She groaned and rubbed her sore stomach, and Catalina lent across the table and wiped the ice cream from around her mouth with her bib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour such a messy eater\u201d She commented, tutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo.. &lt;Hic&gt;.. Ta hell &lt;Urp!&gt; &lt;Uhhh&gt;\u201d Came Joys retort, her fatigue showing in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With admirable determination, Joy grunted with effort as she leaned forward and jammed the spoon once more into the towering sundae. She now stuffed herself at a steady pace, aware that even though Catalina\u2019s drug was doing its thing, it was possible to get full if she ate too much too quickly. Joy noticed that some of the restaurants clientele were filming the spectacle on their mobile phones and she flushed angrily, not wanting records made of this less than proud moment. After about 20 minutes Joy had consumed about half of the remaining dessert and was beginning to feel rather full again. She had a break from eating and with a groan pushed her chair away from the table slightly so she could stretch. She rearranged her tightening jeans and panties, which were uncomfortable squashing her bloated stomach and fattening rear end. She groggily wiped the ice cream from around her mouth with her bib and rubbed her swollen, groaning belly. To her dismay she could actually feel her stomach slowly soften as the drug transferred all the fat around her body (both from the food and the weight gain powder Catalina had been adding to it), and she sighed as she saw how her love handles had grown and were spilling over her tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Joy!\u201d Said Catalina encouragingly, \u201cEye of the tiger... Ass of a hippo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy glared at her as best she could, but due to her exhaustion from eating it looked more like a groggy look of confusion than an angry stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-hic- Shuddup \u2013urp-\u201c She mumbled as she grabbed the spoon yet again and forced herself to plough on with the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling a bit full, Joy ate at a reduced pace than before, though the size of the mouthfuls she was consuming were gigantic. After a further ten minutes, there was a standing ovation in the restaurant as Joy successfully finished the last bite of the sundae and collapsed back into her chair groggily. Joy groaned as she rubbed her stomach, which was emitting mournful gurgling sounds and panted as Catalina clapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done fatso!\u201d She said, giving Joy a congratulatory pat on her swollen stomach which made Joy wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do dat.. \u2013hic-\u201c She whispered quietly through pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the good news is, that you may now leave\u201d Said Catalina smiling, \u201cThough there is one more thing I need you to do\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy\u2019s eyes widened slightly, though she was too tired to express her worries. Catalina placed her mobile phone in front of Joy, all the time smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha?\u201d Joy managed to stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to call your husband...\u201d Said Catalina as Joy eyed the phone with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Asked Joy, the nervousness she was feeling showing in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to tell him that our lunch was cancelled\u2026 So you can eat with him when you get home\u201d Catalina said, smiling sadistically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta be crazy!\u201d Spluttered Joy, \u201cI can\u2019t eat no more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I think you can my dear\u2026\u201d Catalina said, with a sinister edge to her voice \u201cIf your going to get as fat as I intend you to get, your going to have eat at every opportunity you get! So call him now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy stared at Catalina in horror for a few moments, before finally conceding miserably and grumpily snatching the phone off the table. She angrily typed in Darnell\u2019s number and rang it, and after a short while Darnell answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, hi\u201d Joy said grumpily, \u201cLunch was cancelled so will eat with you guys after all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure he makes you a biiig lunch!\u201d Said Catalina with a smile, \u201cBecause your very hungry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy glared at Catalina and gritted her teeth before doing as she was told, \u201cYeah, um, I\u2019m real hungry\u2026 So make mine a big one\u2026 See you later\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a long, lonely and miserable walk home for Joy. The main reason being because she knew what awaited her upon her return home; i.e. yet another huge meal! Although it didn\u2019t help matters that she had to constantly keep stopping and pulling up her button less jeans. Joys mind was awash with thoughts of her revenge against Catalina, which cheered her up slightly but it didn\u2019t offer any solutions as to how she could turn the tables. The immense meal she had just eaten had mostly been digested (thanks to the drug) and the fat had been distributed around her body. Joy could actually feel this process slowly happen as she had began her walk home, as she had began her journey feeling incredibly full and bloated but as she walked this had gradually lessoned. She could feel her already rather snug clothes getting even snugger, and she groaned miserably at the sensation, knowing that her perfect body was being gradually ruined. The small pot belly she had sported on her arrival to the restaurant had now more than doubled in size and was now very noticeable as it poked underneath Joy\u2019s tight white top some 8 inches. It had also widened, with rather substantial love handles which bulged noticeably over the waist band of her tight jeans and jiggled slightly as she walked. Her breasts, butt and thighs had also received some extra padding, which meant she had to constantly rearrange her bra and panties which were squashing her assets (It was possible to see how much her breasts were being squashed by her bra through her top).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a journey that was over all too quickly, Joy arrived back at her trailer. She stared at the door for a few moments before sighing and pushing it open. Joy found Darnell and the kids already sat at the table, apparently awaiting her return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey honey\u201d Said Darnell brightly, smiling at his wife and Joy forced an unconvincing smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d She said without enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were hungry, so I hope this is enough\u201d Said Darnell, gesturing toward Joys place at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoys face dropped at the sight of the meal Darnell had made her, her mouth hung slightly agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta be kiddin me\u2026\u201d Joy said quietly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it wasn\u2019t anywhere near the quantity of food she had previously consumed, Darnell had still prepared a rather large meal for Joy. There were 2 large burgers, 2 large hot dogs and a mountain of fries\u2026 Plus a large cheese cake for dessert. Darnell seemed to notice the expression of horror on his wife\u2019s face and as he did his eyes slowly dropped to her abdomen, and widened in shock. Before Joy had left earlier Darnell had noticed that she had seemingly put on a little weight around the stomach area, though it wasn\u2019t extremely obvious back then, but now in the space of a couple of hours she seemed to have doubled her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm\u2026\u201d Said Darnell, at a loss, \u201cDid you... erm\u2026 not want it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy misunderstood Darnell\u2019s intentions, thinking that he was hurt she wasn\u2019t grateful for his efforts at preparing the meal (rather than his concerns for her ballooning weight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, erm, of course\u201d She said with a smile, not wanting to hurt her husbands feelings, and parked herself down at the table which caused her belly to force down the zip on her ridiculously tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarnell looked troubled for a few moments, but eventually decided to keep his thoughts to himself thinking that it would be better that way. Joy stared at the substantial feast her husband had laid out for her and sighed as she slowly picked up the first burger and took a bite. After the first laborious bite Joy powered through the rather substantial meal almost on auto pilot as her family watched in amazement. After about 5 minutes Joy was cramming in the last of the French fries and she let out a burp, which she didn\u2019t even bother to hide. Joy grunted as she leant forward to grab her dessert, which gave Darnell a nice view of his wife\u2019s bulging, squashed cleavage. Darnell and the kids hadn\u2019t even got half way through their meals, which were smaller than Joys, as Joy destroyed the large portion of cheese cake in under a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrrp! Thanks Hun, think ahm gonna head to bed now anyways\u201d Said Joy, yawning and wiping the remains of the cheesecake from around her face, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarnell merely stared at her, speechless before he finally said \u201cUm\u2026 Okay\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy grunted again as she rose to her feet with some difficulty, trying and failing to force the zip up on her jeans as she did. Darnell could see pretty severe stretch lines over her white top which was now almost skin tight and failed to hide her bloated stomach whatsoever. Joy waddled to the bedroom, the combination of incredibly tight clothing and how full she felt restricting her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She groggily rubbed the sleep from her eyes as she got her bearings, turning over to face her husband who had also been woken by the sound. Darnell hugged his beautiful wife, but frowned slightly as his hands reached her rumbling stomach. As little as a few days ago his wife\u2019s stomach had been perfectly flat, even subtly toned, but now he could feel the obvious bump of a soft pot belly. Joy blushed and moved Darnell\u2019s hands from her chubby midriff, not wanting to draw attention to her obvious gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhm gonna get some breakfast\u201d She announced, unable to fight the growing hunger she felt any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay honey\u201d Said Darnell, trying to force a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy unfolded herself from the sheets and stood up, and Darnell\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of his wife. Joy was dressed in her pink pajama bottoms and pink vest top, which did nothing to hide her recently added weight. Joy\u2019s stomach was even larger than it had been yesterday and stuck out obviously underneath her vest top, the waistband of her pajamas accentuating her love handles. Her breasts had also grown, as they now bulged a little over the top of her bra giving her an even better cleavage than before, which incidently was beginning to obscure her view slightly. Her butt had also received some extra padding, as it stuck out a good couple of inches more than it had done previously (which was especially obvious when she stood side on), and Joy had to constantly keep rearranging her underwear. Joy went red in the face, feeling embarrassed and miserable that she had gained so much weight already but was brought back to earth by the sound of the door bell ringing. Joy let out a mournful sigh, knowing at once who it was but went to answer it anyway. Joy could feel her breasts and belly jiggle slightly as she walked, a fact which only added to her misery. Sure enough, her suspicions were confirmed upon opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you wa\u2014MRFFF?!?!\u201d Joy attempted to say, but was cut off as Catalina crammed a funnel into her mouth without a word of warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fight it\u201d Ordered Catalina and Joy miserably obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Joy went scarlet in the face from a combination of humiliation and extreme anger as Catalina also attached a dog\u2019s collar around her neck complete with lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you look so precious my pet\u201d Cooed Catalina as she patted Joy\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMRRRFF!\u201d Exclaimed Joy, her colorful language completely muffled by the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on then slave\u201d Catalina said, tugging on the lead and dragging Joy out of her trailer, \u201cYou have a long day ahead of you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was still dressed in her pajamas as Catalina lead her away from the trailer park, and it wasn\u2019t long until they came across their first person. The man, who was carrying two large shopping bags, looked at the bizarre pair confused for a few moments before he realized who they were. His name was Bernie, and like so many residents Camden he had had a run in with Joy before when she had managed to con him out of all of his money. As such the two weren\u2019t on friendly terms and Joy groaned to herself when she saw him and hastily tried to avoid eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello sir\u201d Said Catalina happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Hello\u201d Replied Bernie, looking from Joy to Catalina with a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoy here has been a very naughty girl indeed\u201d Said Catalina, patting Joy on the head as she spoke, \u201cSo today I\u2019m teaching her a lesson\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time somebody did\u201d Said Bernie, seemingly getting into the swing of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you agree\u201d Said Catalina smiling as Joy\u2019s cheeks reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you plan to punish her?\u201d Enquired Bernie as he and Joy caught eyes for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d Said Catalina, \u201cI aim to turn Joy into a very fat girl indeed! For someone as vain and arrogant as she is I think this would be the best possible punishment\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I agree\u201d Said Bernie smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see\u201d Said Catalina, lifting up Joy\u2019s pajama top to reveal her soft pot belly, \u201cI\u2019ve already had some success\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie smiled at the sight of the small, soft, protruding belly, happy to see that her once perfect body was being forcefully taken away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u201d He said, as he poked the soft flesh and his finger sunk in almost to his first knuckle, \u201cYou have been a greedy pig haven\u2019t you Joy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes she certainly has\u201d Agreed Catalina, \u201cNow, would you like to donate anything to the cause? All you have to do is pour it down this funnel here and Joy will be forced to consume it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d Said Bernie, a malicious smile spreading over his face as he reached into one of his plastic shopping bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy\u2019s eyes widened in horror as Bernie pulled out a huge bottle of what appeared to be chocolate milkshake and Catalina grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice\u201d Said Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well I was going to drink it myself\u2026\u201d Explained Bernie, \u201cBut this seems like a much better use for it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMRRRFFF!!\u201d Exclaimed Joy as Bernie advanced on her with the bottle held aloft, ready to pour down the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBottoms up!\u201d Said Bernie with a smile, and began to pour the milkshake down the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy\u2019s cheeks bulged stupidly as her mouth filled up from the sheer amount of milkshake that was being poured down the tube, but pretty soon she had no choice but to swallow it. Joy drank and drank, but as she did so she could see that the gigantic bottle was barely emptying. At the half way point Joy\u2019s eyes were half closed due to the exertion from the nonstop stream of liquid she was being forced to consume, and as she drank she could feel her stomach slowly bloat out from underneath her pink pajama top. Finally, after a couple of minutes Joy swallowed the last of the milkshake and slumped down to the floor, rubbing her full belly and letting out muffled moans and groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done baby\u201d Said Catalina, stroking Joys head fondly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bernie laughed openly at the sight of Joy\u2019s body, which had once been so toned but now looked doughy and out of shape. The fat that had accumulated on her stomach had certainly never been there before, not even after childbirth and it was a lot more obvious because of this. The weight she was gaining was slightly being focused on the lower half of her body, meaning her stomach, hips and ass were growing ever so slightly faster than the rest of her. Because of this her body had a slight pear shape to it, with her butt sticking out obviously behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw you\u2019re such a pretty little pear\u201d Crooned Catalina as she pinched Joys cheek condescendingly, and Joy jerked her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was still examining Joy\u2019s body with interest as Bernie approached again, this time with a multipack of high fat yoghurt. Catalina nodded to him, and he proceeded to dump the lot down the funnel in one swift movement which Joy was forced to swallow, as Catalina squeezed and probed Joy\u2019s new curves and bulges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you could do with some new clothes\u201d Catalina announced finally, as Joy swallowed the last of the yoghurt letting out an extremely muffled burp, \u201cYou need to show off your new figure to the world\u2026 You\u2019ve worked very hard on it after all\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy grunted something aggressive, but thankfully it was completely obscured by the funnel and Catalina grinned. She thanked Bernie for his help, who assured her that the pleasure was all his and proceeded to march towards town towing Joy helplessly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shop do they go to?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The journey to the costume shop was long and arduous, with numerous stops being made as they came across other members of the public. Much to Joys dismay and anger a lot of people who approached the odd couple didn\u2019t even require an explanation from Catalina, as they merely just crammed whatever food they had on them down the funnel which Joy was forced to consume. Joy was certain that word must have been getting around town, as every few feet she seemed to be approached by more eager feeders, each sporting large bags of food. As the day progressed Joy could feel her pajamas getting tighter and more snug (which was concerning because they were loose fit) and she dreaded to think how much weight she was putting on. She had to constantly keep pulling down her pajama top and tuck it into her bottoms, as it kept riding up and exposing her chubby belly. With it down it clung to her flesh so that her love handles were obvious and there was even a groove which showed where her deepening belly button was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny isn\u2019t it piggy?\u201d Said Catalina casually as she dragged Joy along after another feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMRRFF\u201d Mumbled Joy, who had been scarlet in the face since leaving her trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fact that nobody has questioned this at all, nor come to your aid\u201d She said thoughtfully, \u201cWhat does that tell you about yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Joy hated to admit it, she\u2019d been thinking the exact same thing herself. Joy had always known she wasn\u2019t exactly popular around town (even she wasn\u2019t oblivious as to why that was), but up until this point she had never much cared what people thought or said behind her back. Today had been a real eye opener for her however, as she was desperate for help but not a single person had offered anything but more humiliation for her. As the two finally arrived at their destination Joy was audibly panting from how much she had consumed on the journey. Catalina could see that Joy\u2019s pear shape had already become more prominent and she stuck two fingers under the waistband of her pajamas to examine how much tighter they had become. She nodded showing her satisfaction as she found it was rather difficult to get her fingers in between Joys flesh and the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery nice\u201d She said, \u201cI think this costume change couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, tubby\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy didn\u2019t bother to show a response and Catalina led her happily into the costume shop. There were several people in here, browsing the racks of costumes that the store had to offer and as they bell on the door chimed the store owner looked up and frowned slightly at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I\u2026 Help you?\u201d He said slowly, unsure to what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes actually you can\u201d Said Catalina, \u201cAre you familiar with my good friend Joy here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store owner (who\u2019s name was Miguel) looked at Joy and slowly nodded, a memory returning to him along with his dislike for the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d He said shortly and Catalina smiled at his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I decided enough was enough from this bitch\u201d Said Catalina, and Joy glared at her, \u201cSo I have been systemically destroying her once, oh so perfect body\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel looked Joy up and down, taking in the new uncharactistic bulges he saw on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my\u2026 You certainly have\u2026\u201d He said thoughtfully, \u201cHow much weight has she gained?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u201d Said Catalina, suddenly aware that she\u2019d never actually checked, \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel grinned at this and pointed to a scale over by the stores changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Let\u2019s see shall we?\u201d He said, grabbing Joys hand and leading her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked over the other patrons of the store joined them, curious to what they were witnessing. Joy was still rather tired from the feeding she\u2019d endured on her journey the shop, so she didn\u2019t fight it as she was stood on the scale and the numbers began to climb. Before her run in with Catalina, Joy had only been 110 pounds and roughly a size 5 (though it would have been much smaller if it weren\u2019t for her bust, which was quite generous for her height and frame), but as the numbers climbed it was immediately apparent that it was substantially more than that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018110\u2026 115\u2026 126\u2026 145\u2026 160\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy\u2019s eyes almost popped out of her head when she saw the numbers on the scale, and Catalina let out a long whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy word\u2026\u201d Said Catalina, removing Joys funnel so that she could respond, \u201cWhat were you like 110 pounds before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy\u2019s mouth continued to hang agape, even after the funnel had been removed as she was still in complete and abject shock. She always knew she was gaining weight as Catalina had her way with her, but to see the cold hard evidence on the scale was too much for her to take in. As Joy stood motionless, Miguel lifted up her pajama top to reveal her chubby midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, a lot of the weight has gone here\u201d He announced, squeezing one of the soft love handles that bulged out on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, I\u2019ve got a fun idea\u201d Said Catalina mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Joy was barely paying attention to anything that was happening, her usual rebellion and cockiness completely absent as Miguel called over several staff members who were all examining her like a piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet those ugly pj\u2019s off her\u201d Said Miguel snootily, as a small, curious crowd slowly formed around them to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis staff complied, grabbing at Joy\u2019s garments getting ready to remove them. It was at this point, as her pajama top was being lifted over her head that Joy\u2019s mind suddenly rebooted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell ya\u2019ll doin?!\u201d She demanded furiously, scowling at the group around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut up tubby\u201d Said Catalina, cramming a donut into her mouth which had been craftily passed to her by somebody in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pajama top and bottoms were removed while she chewed and swallowed the large donut and soon Joy was stood before everyone in her underwear. Now everybody present could see first hand the newly added weight to Joy\u2019s body and if it were possible for her to go redder in the face she would have done so now. Her belly was large and wide, no longer a mere pot belly as its generous love handles bulged above the waistband of her panties. Her breasts bulged obviously over the cups of her much too small bra, and the strap was cutting into the fat on her back giving her a small back cleavage. Her butt stuck out obviously behind her and her thighs looked thick and juicy the tops of them touching unless she widened her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you perverts starin at, huh?!\u201d She demanded hotly, whilst trying in vain to cover her chubby belly with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now porky\u201d Said Miguel, \u201cPut this on\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a costume that he had hidden behind his back and Joy immediately saw the \u2018size 5\u2019 label emblazoned on it. It was a mock school uniform; white shirt/ small tartan skirt, complete with tie and white stockings which each had a black bow on the tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy eyed the costume miserably; fully aware that it was probably the kind of thing she may have once worn to show off her amazing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d She mumbled, more to herself than anybody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Said Catalina, cupping her ear mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t put it on cuz you\u2019ve made me too fat!\u201d Joy bellowed, her rage causing her body to jiggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can help with that\u201d Said Miguel, as he clicked his fingers which set his staff into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy stammered in anger as the staff members circled around her and attempted to force the costume onto her. One team worked on pulling on the stockings and mini skirt (the mini skirt proving especially difficult, as her thick thighs fought to prevent it rising to her waist), whilst the other focused on the shirt. After a few minutes of extremely hard work the staff managed to get the costume onto Joy, though buttoning it up was a different problem all together. Even without it being buttoned the costume was obviously incredibly tight as it clung to her body like a second skin, and even the stockings looked incredibly tight over her meaty calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! See?!\u201d Shouted Joy, demonstrating how impossible it was to even get the buttons close to their prospective holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh suck it in Joy\u201d Said Miguel impatiently, and after a particularly dangerous glare she obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff strained with great effort in an attempt to close the buttons shut on the costume, and everybody present roared with laughter at the sight. Astonishingly the staff actually succeeded in doing up a few of the buttons on the shirt (one under her breasts and a couple over her belly), as well as the button on the mini skirt (though the zip refused to be zipped up) and they stepped back to admire their handy work. Joy looked ridiculous, she resembled a sausage bursting out of its skin as every bulge of her body fought desperately for freedom against their forced imprisonment (and Joy was sucking in her gut as far as she could). The outfit was audibly creaking and was covered in stress lines at every pressure point with the buttons straining insanely. Suddenly Joy was unable to hold her breath in any longer and with a sharp exhale her stomach came bulging outward. The effect was immediate as her doughy midriff sent buttons flying in all directions, and tore the fabric of the shirt underneath her armpits. The button of her mini skirt struck somebody in the crowd with such force that they fell to the floor, though her meaty thighs prevented the tiny skirt from falling down. Everybody roared in laughter at the sight, some people doubling over as Joy stood there maroon in the face, trying in vain to hide her naked fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The top of the outfit was covered in large polka dots, it had large puffy shoulders though the neckline was quite low which was designed to show cleavage. This and the arms (which were also short) had a frilly, ruffled trim and there were large red buttons leading down from the chest area and a large multi coloured bow tie. There was then what appeared to be a bright red corset which was tied with ribbons and connected to a frilly, pink, almost ballarina style skirt. The back of the top had a tail akin to that of a circus ring masters blazer which had a large bow on both of the tails. Underneath this were stupidly large, baggy trousers (also polka dotted) which could only stay on due to braces which hooked over the wearers shoulders. There were also big red clown shoes and big white gloves, along with a colourful hat (like a sleeping cap) and large red nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" Said Joy vehemently shaking her head \"I'd rather be naked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your choice to make\" Said Catalina, cramming a donut into Joy's protesting mouth \"Dress her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguels staff once again busied themselves on Joy, as Catalina continued to force feed her donuts to keep her busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrff?!

Joy groaned as the corset was forced tighter and tighter, which had the added effect of greatly increasing her cleavage which noticeably bulged over the top.

As Joy was paraded around she could feel the corset of her clown outfit get tighter as she fed more and more, which hinted to her the unrelenting weight gain her body was experiencing. Half an hour and many force feedings later Joy (who was now pushing 165 pounds, the extra five pounds she had gained making her outfit feel slightly tighter) found herself in a largely suburban area. She looked around in confusion as she chewed and swallowed the last bite she had been forced to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell we here for? Urp!\" She asked haughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll see\" Said Catalina mysteriously \"Open wide you fat clown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy rolled her eyes and exhaled angrily, but nonetheless obeyed. Catalina emptied a box of chocolate ecclairs into Joy's mouth in quick succession and as Joy swallowed the last bite and burped Catalina dragged her through an open gate and followed a path to the houses back garden. Joy saw that the garden was full of children who were apparently in the middle of a birthday celebration and she raised one eyebrow wondering what was going to be expected of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kids! Meet Joy the chubby clown!\" Announced Catalina to the excited looking children \"She's come to entertain you all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the children cheered and Joy looked at them all in mournful embarrassment, wondering what Catalina had in store for her this time when her eyes were drawn to a huge table full of party food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lets play a game shall we?\" Said Catalina \"The first person who can get this particularly chubby clown to pop a button wins a prize! So grab as much food as you can from the table and start stuffing her face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah crap\" Said Joy as she saw the looks on the children's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The children didn't need to be told twice and they all swarmed the table full of food, grabbing whatever they could. Joy backed away from the crowd of children as they advanced on her, her nerves incredibly obvious. The first child pounced on her like a cat, knocking her backwards onto a chair behind her as the rest of the group swarmed around her. As soon as her chubby behind hit the chair she could feel her belly push out tightly against her corset and she groaned. Joy was force fed at a relentless pace by the young children who were all fighting to get to her and Catalina watched happily from behind them. Crumbs began to gather on the frilly ruffled trim around her chest (and by extension her monumental cleavage) as she chewed and swallowed as quickly as she could as she was stuffed without mercy. The noise the excited children were making was deafening and Joy was actually trying to pull herself free of them, but the bulky white clown gloves she'd been forced to wear prevented her from getting a grip on anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp! Get off me you damn little brats! Ulp! Mrrff!\" Joy yelled angrily before a large piece of cake was pushed past her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Her belly pushed tightly against her tight corset with a flabby roll bulging over the top beneath her chubby breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerr off me -Urrp!- you damn brats! -Ulp!-\" Wailed Joy, trying in vain to escape the crowd of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the more merciless kids stuffed a funnel into Joy's mouth while another two raised a gallon jug of chocolate milkshake towards it.

Finally Joy swallowed the last of the milkshake, let out a weary burp and a low ominous creaking noise became audible. This was followed by a pop which indicated one of the large red buttons popping off her outfit (it came from her burgeoning breasts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that the sound of buttons popping i heard?\" Announced Catalina, cupping her ear for effect \"Well done kids!

Joys pear body shape was gradually becoming more pronounced now, as it was now rather noticible that a lot of the weight she'd gained was settling around her middle and lower half. She could feel the corset of the outfit constricting her growing belly like a boa constrictor, and the sound of the tight string binds straining could actually be heard. Her breasts, which had been the reason for the popped button had definitely recieved a good amount of the weight also as it was obvious that the outfit and her bra beneath dug into them significantly (the chubby flesh bulged over and beneath the cups, the tightness giving an outline of her nipples on the fabric). It wasn't long before another button shared the same fate as the first, it to being popped off her tightening outfit by her bulging frame. Before a third button could follow suit the feeding mercifully began to slow as thankfully the children were beginning to lose interest in stuffing Joy silly and over the next five minutes it stopped completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God -hic!- damn...\" Said Joy weakly, her eyes extremely glazed add she slouched in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina looked very impressed with the childrens efforts as the they turned to her obviously wanting to know what the prize was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice work kids!\" She said, beaming \"For making this fat idiot pop a button you get to choose the next party activity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was far too exhausted to really pay attention to what was happening, her breathing laboured as her tight clown outfit restricted any kind of movement she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the children decide?</span></div></div>",

As it turned out there had been a special carnival game set up just on the cul de sac outside the house, and now the miserable form of Joy (Who was now tipping the scale at 168 pounds, thanks to the children's efforts) was lead the by Catalina. There was a wooden platform set up above a large pool, which appeared to be full of thick custard and now Joy was lead over to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up there lard butt\" Demanded Catalina, shoving Joy toward the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah I know the drill, quit shoving me\" Replied Joy testilly and began to climb the ladder, finding it a little difficult due to how restrictive her skin tight clown outfit was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children looked very excited as Joy to her precarious perch above the fatten custard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok guys\" Called out Catalina, also getting the attention of the other residents of the cul de sac who came over to watch the bizarre spectacle \"The aim of the game is to get this fat clown to fall into the lovely fattening custard below, which she then has to eat! By using this catapult you will be firing food into her mouth to fatten her up until her platform can now longer handle her weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me with this crap\" Snarled Joy quietly, more to herself than anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... Kids get ready to fire... Clown open your greedy mouth!\" Called Catalina \"Fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy had only just managed to obey before she was hit with several peices of high velocity birthday cake. She received two huge peices into her mouth that with some difficulty she chewed and swallowed, but was hit with several others covering her in frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice aiming kids!\" Yelled Catalina, and several of the other residents of the cul de sac began to clap and cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy attempted to wipe some of the frosting off her but was again hit with more cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glumphhh?!?\" She exclaimed as she was caught off guard with another mouthful of cake, causing her cheeks to balloon comically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd grew as the helpless, chubby female clown was force fed with fattening ballistic missiles of food. Joy vaguely blamed the children of today's love of violent video games for the surprisingly accurate force feeding she was experiencing. Catalina shouted and made jokes at Joys expense causing bigger laughs and jeers from the children and audience. It wasn't long until the platform Joy sat on began to creak ominously as yet more fat was added to her frame, and her ridiculous tight clown outfit began to slowly tear as her fat folds bulged against the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhraapp\" Joy suddenly bellowed, after a particularly accurate barrage of cake that she'd been forced to chew and swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children cheered as the last of Joys buttons popped off in a satisfying chain reaction from her growing girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more\" Pleaded Joy wearily \"No-Mrrrfff!!-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeding carried on in earnest and after a few more well placed shots the ribbon ties on her creaking corset finally popped open, allowing her ever growing belly to bulge outward onto her lap. After a further five minutes of this, which exhausted the groups food ammunition their was a sudden loud creak which echoed around the cul de sac. The crowd waited with baited breath as Joy stared on in bleary horror until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh crapppp!\" Screamed Joy as her seat was finally unable to hold anymore of her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLOOOSH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of cheering was defeaning as Joy rose from the thick custard, coughing and spluttering angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed piggy! Feed piggy!\" Catalina began to chant and was almost immediately joined by every person present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd could just about make out a poisonous look from the custard covered clown before she reluctantly dipped her head into the fattening mixture and began to guzzle it down. Catalina smiled giddily as she watched Joy slurp at despite how full she clearly already was, her features completely covered in custard and cake frosting. Having such complete control over a person she so loathed was absolutely intoxicating, though unfortunately for Joy Catalina needed more and more to sate her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! This is taking too long!\" Catalina announced, sounding more bratty then any of the children present \"Lets give our clown here a helping hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the pool was a large generator with a two tubes coming from it, it's purpose obvious to all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay clowny, say ahhh\" Demanded Catalina condescendingly,  holding out the end of one tube after dumping the other until the pool of custard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

With an insane cackle, Catalina mercilessly pulled a lever on the generator which caused the insanely fattening custard to pump through the tube. Again Joys cheeks bulged comically before she began to swallow the mixture at the insane speed it was now pumped into her mouth. Everybody present laughed and jeered at the sight as the pool of custard slowly emptied and Joys already bulging belly began to expand outward even more. Her corset, which had already popped open, was being pushed further and further apart as Joys gut poked through to rest on her thick, thunder thighs. She was angry at herself for thinking it, but she was actually thankful for the large baggy clown trousers she'd been forced to wear, as at least they were not currently constricting her growing flab. Joy closed her weary eyes, basically falling into a food coma as the never ending stream of custard flowed down her throat into her belly. Catalina laughed and jeered herself hoarse as she watched her nemesis slowly expand with flab, the custard fattening her up before her very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at at the fat greedy clown grow!\" She exclaimed \"She looks like she's becoming a bouncy castle of flab! What a gluttonous fat loser! Haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhrrshh... Glugluglugglugluglug\" Was the only sound Joy was capable of making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy tried to ignore the fat jokes at her expense, realizing that this was now her future so she'd better get used to the ridicule. She could feel every pound being forced onto her once so perfect frame, as her insanely tight outfit became more and more constrictive by the second. Seams popped under her armpits as bulges of fat forced their way through her clown garment, and the ruffled trim over her bountiful cleavage also began to tear as her tits overflowed the cups of her bra. Even by the usual standards Joy had become to expect from Catalina, the feeding she had received today had been very excessive. Poor Joy was exhausted and could offer no more than a muffled miserable groan as she felt her body grow with unwanted fat. The minutes passed, and as they did the children posed for photos infront of the beautiful gluttonous clown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAYYY FAT CLOWWNN!\" Bellowed Catalina, snapping photos that would last a lifetime as damning proof of Joys most humiliating moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity, but finally Joy could feel the flow of custard slow before stopping completely. She could feel the hose being pulled from her mouth but had long since lost the ability to pay attention to her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhrrraaaapppp\" She bellowed before collapsing onto her back almost unconscious from the insane feeding she'd ensured \"Uhhh... Hiccc...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh guys\" Said Catalina \"It looks like our clowny mass of blubber has over done it! But just look at her! I never imagined she'd get so huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was not exaggerating, as Joy looked like she was in her final trimester with triplets, her huge bare bloated belly rising and falling with each labored breath. The huge dome of a tummy was imitating rather angry sounding gurgling noises, which indicated the drug in her blood stream immediately coverting every last (doubled) calorie into fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this has been great guys\" Said Catalina, wheeling a large wheelbarrow over to the empty pool \"But I should really get this fat idiot home, could somebody give me a hand? i think she could be a two... Perhaps three or four person job, hehehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour neighbours approached, and together with Catalina they heaved the poor defeated form of Joy to her unsteady feet. With a grunt of effort they managed to transfer the stuffed young humiliated beauty into her 'ride home'. There was also an electronic scale in there which Catalina now examined with interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness you guys\" Said Catalina in genuine awe \"Shes now 176lbs!! I can't believe it! Well done everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as Joy groaned softly, giving the odd hiccup or burp. Catalina began pushing the wheelbarrow away from the group, back the way they'd came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And remember everyone... Make sure you upload all your photos and videos onto the Internet!\" Said Catalina \"And if you'd like to see what's next for our bloated beauty here, please feel free to stop by the trailor park!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joy blinked wearily as she watched Catalina speak happily to them like they were old friends in her native tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God -hicc- damn\" Said Joy, her lethargy evident though her usual sass was coming back to her \"Will you wrap it up already, speaking all your Mexicanese or whatever -Urrp!- You've had your messed up fun, now id like to get off the street\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina turned to Joy incredulously, unable to believe that no matter what humiliating thing she did to her her cocky attitude never completely left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, I'm speaking Spanish...  There's no such language as whatever you just said\" She said slowly, trying to keep her cool \"And secondly, yes I agree you should get off the street... In fact come with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina wheeled Joy over to entrance of the car wash, and once again Joy realized her quick tongue had gotten her in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh.. Wait\" Joy stammered \"Don't shove me through there you damn psycho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to get you all cleaned up for home\" Said Catalina as though she were addressing a child \"Off you go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina shoved Joys wheelbarrow onto the track which pulled her inside in the carwash as Joy spluttered a furious response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole crew laughed as the sopping wet form of Joy came out of the other side of the carwash, makeup streaming down her furious features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch\" She said simply, pulling her soaking fringe from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you weren't such a messy eater that wouldn't have been necessary piggy\" Said Catalina \"Now your clothes... I have to say you really have no fashion sense dear, you look like a complete moron\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know\" Spat Joy \"Thanks again for that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well luckily for you, I saw this eventuality and came prepared\" Said Catalina \"Here, there's a rest room in there so go get changed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina handed Joy a duffle bag, who scowled up at her from her wet perch in the wheelbarrow. Joy snatched the bag, and with some difficulty clambered to her feet. It was a very comical sight as Joy waddled over to the changing room, and once again the carwash staff shared a laugh at her expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later the restroom door opened and Joy reappeared. She was dressed in an outfit much more befitting of her usual style, that being a pair of daisy dukes and a pink leopard print vest top with low neckline. Despite this however Joy looked less than impressed, which was probably due to the fact that her garments were at least two sizes too small for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how was I supposed to know you'd get so frigging fat?!\" Said Catalina incredulously before Joy could voice her complaints \"Maybe you shouldn't of pigged out so much today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy rolled her eyes and sighed as she looked down and saw only bulging breasts and the pudge of her belly muffintopped over the waistband of her jean shorts. She could feel every unwanted pound on her body, as every bulge was being uncomfortably squeezed and accentuated by her tight clothes. She didn't even know how she'd managed to button up the jean shorts, as the button looked like it would explode off with the slightest wrong move and the zipper had already forced its way down revealing a small image of her pink panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on moody guts, let's get you home\" Said Catalina \"There will be plenty more fun tomorrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't you done enough?\" Said Joy sounding exasperated \"Look at me God damn it! Look what you've done to me, I'm fat as hell! When is this going to end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Pondered Catalina \"Honestly, i don't think it ever will... I mean I just cannot imagine getting bored of seeing you get fatter and fatter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about Darnell?!\" Said Joy \"He's gonna notice that his damn wife is getting chunky! He's gonna start asking questions, which I don't exactly know how to answer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, yeah\" Said Catalina, poking Joys squidgy muffin top \"There's no way he can miss that jiggling mass of blubber is there tubby? Oh well, he married you for your sparkling personality rather than your hot bod right? Heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy flushed knowing exactly what Catalina meant, and actually not sure of the answer herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" Said Catalina, noticing Joy looking despondent \"I'm sure he'll stick with you through thick and thin... Or thick and thicker hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bite me\" Growled Joy, rearranging her uncomfortably tight jean shorts as she did before the pair began their walk back to the trailer park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina blew Joy a kiss goodbye when they reached her trailer, signalling the awful day finally coming to an end. Joy breathed an exhausted sigh of relief, a feeling which left her pretty quickly when she again noticed her very obvious new chubby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joy let out a deep breath as her hand held the door handle to her trailer, her head spinning with thoughts of what her husband would think of her new appearance. Joy had always been as vain and shallow as it got, using her beauty to get what ever she wanted from whomever she wanted it from. That beauty was fading by the day she felt, and she wondered grimly if Darnel would have much interest in a fat wife. She gulped and opened the door to the trailer, finding Darnel with his back turned busying himself in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe\" He said, turning to face her \"How are... Um... Are you ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on his face said everything, a look of shock, of horror and a tinge of disgust at the sight of his now not so slim pretty wife standing before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?!\" Replied Joy, suddenly defensive and annoyed \"Don't ah look ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah\" Said Darnel suddenly submissive \"I think so\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then\" Said Joy \"I'm ok, your ok, we're all ok so maybe yall should just drop it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear\" Said Darnel \"Sorry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy suddenly felt a pang of guilt at snapping at him, and even more anger towards Catalina for causing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... Darnel...\" She began, but was interrupted by a sudden explosion of noise and activity as her two sons burst into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!!\" Cried Dodge and Earl Jr in excitement and jumped at Joy to hug her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoys bad mood left her as she embraced her sons in a big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi boys\" She said happily, but added \"What yall doin?\" when she felt their hands feeling her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommys soft and squishy hehe!\" Said Earl Jr, grabbing a handful of his mother's new belly flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy?\" Asked Dodge, prodding Joys muffin top \"Why is Mommy so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy flushed with embarrassment as her chubby belly was wobbled, squeezed and poked by her two sons and after a particularly violent jiggle the top button popped off her extremely tight daisy duke shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys stop playing with your moms fat...\" Said Darnel, before he realized what he was saying \"I mean... No your not really honey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh save it\" Growled Joy moodily, having to hold up the waistband of her shorts to hide her underwear \"Imma go get changed... God damn it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy continued mumbling moodily to herself as she left the room. As she pulled off her skin tight shorts (With some difficulty as her thick thighs were particularly hard to get past) Darnel poked his head into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I've made dinner honey\" He said awkwardly, truly not knowing what to say at this point \"If your... Hungry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy shot him a withering look, but just as she did her stomach betrayed her and began to rumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you've got to be kiddin me\" She said to herself incredulously \"Okay... Yeah I'm hungry, so what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, come and get it\" Said Darnel smiling and leaving the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy pulled on a pair of sweat pants and grumpily followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite still being in a mood with Darnel and her sons over their comments on her weight, Joy inhaled her dinner with no decorum or dignity whatsoever. The sad thing was, she had tried to eat slower to save any extra embarrassment but she found that she just couldn't control her greed. She could feel her families shocked and, a little disgusted, looks, but she just couldn't stop herself as she helped herself to seconds, thirds... Fourths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, honey...\" Said Darnel as gently as he could as Joy emptied her plate for the fourth time \"Aren't you full?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicccurrrp\" Exclaimed Joy who, after seeing that all dinner had been finished, made her way groggily to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's Mommy a greedy pig daddy?\" Asked Earl Jr as his chubby Mother raided the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard -mrrrrfff- dat\" Said Joy angrily as she began to pile slices of American cheese into her mouth \"urrrrp!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening Joy was laid out in bed, spread out on her back groaning with her huge bloated stomach rising and falling with each labored breath. Darnel had had to carry her here, after hiding whatever remaining food they had left from her gluttony, so she didn't consume their entire food supply in one sitting. The stretch pants she'd put on to replace her buttonless daisy dukes had run out of stretch, and the waistband clung to her belly so it bulged above and below it. As there was no room in the bed for anybody else (due to Joy lying down like a chubby star fish), Darnel had opted for the coach. He lay awake that night, staring at the ceiling of the trailer as he thought of the strange few hours he'd just experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Joy climbed from her bed and instinctively placed herself on the bedroom scales to assess the damage she'd done during last night's gluttonous display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-178.5 lbs-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy hated that it was beginning to reach the point now that she had to suck her belly in to see downwards clearly. Just then, and predictably, there was a knock at the trailer door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn bitch is obsessed with me\" Joy Mumbled grumpily to herself before reluctantly going to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarnell was in the kitchen and had already answered the door by the time she'd reached it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh morning baby, look who dropped by\" He said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morningggg sleepy head\" Said Catalina brightly and Joy gritted her teeth at the sight \"Oh my you look different somehow... Did you do something with your hair?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy got fat tehe!\" Answered Earl Jr, who was sat with his brother watching cartoons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina giggled and Joy flushed bright red with anger and humiliation, knowing that there was no hiding her weight gain anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just making breakfast\" Said Darnell hastily \"Would you like to join us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'd love to\" Said Catalina, turning to Joy \"If Joy here doesn't mind sharing hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was thunderstruck as Catalina actually prodded her belly in front of Darnell and her kids, but somehow managed to control herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ain't got Mexican food I'm afraid\" She answered snidelly \"We only got normal people food\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina scowled at her, which Joy regarded with a grin despite knowing that would likely cost her later. As Darnell went to plate up the breakfast, Catalina took a seat next to Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get sassy now fatass\" She said warningly \"Say, how much do you weigh today? I'm assuming you've checked\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hundred and seventy eight\" Joy replied through gritted teeth after a long, withering scowl \"and a half\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\" Replied Catalina \"Such a greedy fat piggy you are... But we don't have time for ' halves ', and i prefer a nice round number so maybe you should get stuffing your fat face, agreed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Replied Joy grumpily as Darnell returned with their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver breakfast Joy put on another face stuffing clinic for her family, and her new audience member Catalina. Darnell looked slightly mortified at her lack of table manners and grace in front of their guest, but their guest and her kids seemed to be enjoying it quite a lot. When she'd finished her first plate she received a nudge from Catalina, who raised her eyebrows to her and subtly gestured to the kitchen where there was plenty more food sat waiting. Joy mumbled something unpleasant to Catalina, but nevertheless rose from her seat to get another helping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Are you having more?\" Asked Darnell, sounding slightly concerned \"You've already had quite a lot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Joy\" Catalina piped in behind Darnell \"Haven't you had enough... Don't be a glutton now\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke Catalina shook her head in contradiction to her words, and also made an eating gesture. Joy gritted her teeth angrily, wanting so badly to stop the humiliation, but as much as she hated it she was still peckish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've not had enough\" She said gruffly \"I'm a greedy piggie...need to stuff myself somemore...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she refilled her plate as her sons giggled and Darnell looked a bit crestfallen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'd better get ready to go to work\" He said, getting up \"Um... Try to save some food... For like dinner and stuff\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave Joy a peck on the cheek as he left, though it seemed a little half hearted. Joy returned to the table next to Catalina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok kids\" Said Catalina, suddenly addressing Joys little boys \"Who wants to feed Mommy? And make her an even fatter piggie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo oooo i do i do!!!\" Earl Jr and Dodge responded excitedly, raising their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy attempted to splutter a response, but was too taken aback by the sudden turn of events as now her own children descended on her to feed her. Her sons gleefully began stuffing her very large second helping into her exasperated mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you keep that up kids\" Said Catalina \"I'll be right back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids complied in earnest, as they crammed as much food as they could down their mouths throat. Joy had truly hated being fed by Catalina and had hated that even more when done in public... Bring fed by her own sons was a new low though. Catalina soon returned, brandishing the scales from the bathroom which she brought over to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you get blubber butt\" She said, pulling Joy to her feet while her sons continued to stuff her (they climbed onto the dinner table so they could reach) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was stood on the scales as she was fed, and just had time to scowl at Catalina before she joined in the feeding frenzy to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like fun, and i felt left out\" She explained with a grin \"Ok guys, let's get your fat mama to an even 180!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids squealed in excitement before focusing on methodically force feeding their mother. A silence spread over the kitchen as all the feeders concentrated on their task, which was only punctuated by munching sounds and the odd burp or weary hiccup from Joy. The children and Catalina watched gleefully as the number slowly rose on the scale the more they stuffed into Joys belly. When they hit 180 Joy slumped back into her seat, breathing heavily as her belly bulged out onto her lap. She could feel how even her pajamas, which were meant to be loose fit and comfortable, clung to every new bulge of her chubby body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic job guys!\" Cheered Catalina, prodding Joys protruding gut which her pajama top could no longer cover \"You've made her even fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay\" They Cried happily in unison as they to prodded and squished Joys belly fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was mortified at what had just happened, and thought there was no lower she could go from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sooo... Time for today's day of fun!\" Announced Catalina in an infuriatingly upbeat manner \"and you are gonna looove this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to reign on your parade an all\" replied Joy haughtily \"But I gotta watch the kids today, so I'm afraid whatever crap you got planned fer me is gonna have to wait a day at least\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Said Catalina, sounding disheartened \"Well that's too bad... I guess your right, maybe we should give today a miss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked relieved though a little amazed that Catalina had been so easily convinced, considering what a hard ass she'd been up to this point. Of course Joy was being naive however, as soon as her guard was down Catalina pounced on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft! As if!!\" Yelled Catalina , suddenly stuffing a heaped spoon oh high fat yogurt she had in her bag into Joys unsuspecting mouth \"Jeez you really never learn do you? You fat moron! Lucky I'm here to teach you another valuable lesson! As if I'd allow you a day off! Haha! Your kids will love today's activity as much as I will! Here let me show you... Kids, feed your silly mommy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay!!\" Cried Earl Jr and Dodge in unison as they rushed their mother, knocking her off balance and sending her back onto the sofa behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then sat her lap, which kept her down and giggled as they felt her distended soft gut which spilt out onto her thicker thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go kids!\" Said Catalina, handing each of them a large pot of the high fat yoghurt and a large spoon \"Teach your silly fat moma a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no!!\" Squealed Joy \"Not againmrrrrff!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was cut off my another heaped spoonful of yoghurt which she was forced to swallow down before another followed it. Poor Joy now underwent a frantic feeding from her children, despite still recovering from the one she'd experienced only minutes before. The boys were piling the yoghurt into their mothers weary mouth as Darnell entered the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok honey, I've got to get off to work and... Um...\" He said but was stopped in his tracks when he saw the image of his sons feeding his chunky wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrfff!!! Mrrrfff!!! Glumpphh!!\" Joy attempted to wail between mouth falls, her eyes pleading for help from her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Catalinas relief and Joys miserable horror Darnell merely sighed and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... See you later then\" He said and left the trailer, leaving his poor wife wailing behind him, almost ready to burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy felt truly deflated and miserable as she was fed by her boys, due to Darnells demeanour when he had left. She wondered grimly to herself what damage her humiliating predicament was doing to her marriage, and if there was anyway to protect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw why so glum chum?\" Asked Catalina in a deeply condescending tone \"Is it because even your husband thinks your a greedy fat hog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrr... Furr yurrggh!!\" Joy attempted to say venomously, though her threats were blocked by her mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah okay, I see the problem... Excuse me boys\" said Catalina gravely \"your poor mommy is feeling sad... Because she's not being fed fast enough!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoys eyes widened in horror as Catalina suddenly shoved a funnel past her lips, and the eager trio began dumping pot after pot of yoghurt down it which she was forced to glug down at an insane pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy sat sprawled out on the sofa, her belly gurgling and poking out under her tight pajama top where it rested as a considerable muffin top over her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, well I think we got quite sidetracked there guys\" Said Catalina to Joys sons as Joy sat lethargically panting and offering the odd weary burp \"But that's on your tubby mommy, isn't it? If she were a more subservient little piggy we could avoid these lessons, don't you agree Joy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhr... Yes... Hiccurrp!... Ma'am\" Joy mumbled quietly , eager to avoid any further 'lessons' from Catalina and her boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Said Catalina sounding satisfied \"Seems were finally getting through that thick trailer trash skull of yours hmm? Now let's get your fat butt weighed again and we'll begin our day of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the combined effort of Catalina and Joys sons (which was still a hell of a struggle) Joy was pulled to her feet and shoved, stumbling back onto the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"186!\" Exclaimed Catalina \"Good grief, and we haven't even started yet haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! Mommys fat!\" Giggled Earl Jr as he played with Joys belly overhang which was no longer completely covered by her pajama  top even when she was stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure is!\" Said Catalina gleefully \"Just look at this flab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Joys fury and intense embarrassment Catalina grabbed her impressive gut and gave it a good shake and wobble. This motion caused a chain reaction of wobbling all over her thick fat covered frame which in turn caused a rip in her tight t shirt under her armpit where her glorious tits had wobbled too vigorously against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh! Looks like Mommys bursting out of her clothes!\" Announced Catalina when she noticed the rip and purposefully gave her belly another good jiggle which popped another seam right above her deep navel \"let's get her changed and have some more fun!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!!\" Cried Dodge and Earl Jr, looking more excited than Joy had ever seen them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was pulled into the bedroom by the over eager trio before being rather roughly stripped to her undies. Catalina let out a low whistle at the sight of her without clothing to hide her new poundage. Her pear shape was becoming more prominent and defined by the day, with her belly, hips, ass and thighs receiving the lions share of the weight she was gaining from her constant forced over eating. Her breasts were not left out however as they also looked impressively large, helped by the fact her bra had long since ceased being fit for purpose. It was a true wonder how it remained on at all, as it looked ready to explode under the pressure from her bloated, bulging titties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop starin at me damnit!\" Said Joy indignantly, maroon in the face as she made a rather comedic effort to cover her bulging naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys giggled as their chubby mother tried in vain to maintain some semblance of dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok kids\" said Catalina \"go back into the other room and wait while I get your mommy ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys looked slightly disheartened but complied anyway, as they were very eager to see what Catalina had in store for Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys sat waiting, so excited that they weren't even watching the TV. When the bedroom door opened they jumped to their feet in giddy excitement and instantly howled with laughter at the sight of their fat mother being led into the room. Joy was being lead by a leash, which was connected to a pink collar around her neck. Below this was a small bow tie, which was matched with white shirt cuffs on her wrists with pig cufflinks. She wore a bubble gum pink Bikini top and thong, and in keeping with the pig theme there was curly pig tail sticking from her rear, a pigs snout over her nose and pig ears on her head where her hair had been tied into cute pig tails. Of course this risqu\u00e9 outfit left little to the imagination, giving her flab nowhere to hide. Worse still the bikini was a couple of sizes too small  for her, which exaggerated her large bosom even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coulda at least got me something that fit!\" Said Joy grumpily, tugging at her bikini top where is was cutting into her soft flesh and not completely covering her boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two things\" Said Catalina, sounding rather stern \"First, remember when I said no speaking today, only oinking? I meant it. And secondly that bikini was supposed to fit you, but how was I supposed to know you'd get this fat?! Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina grabbed Joys overhanging gut and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink oink\" Replied Joy through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, well let's get to it\" Said Catalina brightly \"Come on piggie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was pulled along by her leash as they left the trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joy was walked (or rather; dragged) through the trailer park towards a large crowd who had formed at the main entrance. Behind them she saw a large sign which read \"Meet the Trailer Park Pig Girl\" and her heart sank to her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man are you kiddin me?!\" Grumbled Joy \"You are insane girl you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina shot Joy a dangerous look to which Joy rolled her eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oink oink\" She said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the throngs of cheering and jeering trailer park folk Joy saw another sign, this one seeming to be a pricing guide for certain activities the customers were allowed to do at Joys expense. These included the obvious feeding, but also piggy back rides and photographs. Under the stares of the crowd Joys leash was tied to a large wooden stake which had a large wooden pig trough in front of it. Her leash was tied low down and tightly with no give or length, which meant Joy could not stand upright and had to remain on all fours. From this angle Joy could see inside the large trough and saw it was full of a thick porridge like mush, which she knew was going to be as fattening as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen if the trailer park, welcome to our new bi weekly event!\" Announced Catalina to the crowd, and Joys heart sank even further if that were possible at the mention of it being a 'bi weekly' occurrence \"I'm sure this fat pig next to me will need no introduction to most of you, but for those who don't know her name is Joy Farrah Darvill Hickey Turner. Just to take any weight off your mind about this, she is a complete bitch and all round nasty person, so this new life of humiliating weight gain slavery is well deserved! And besides, she loves her new life! Ain't that right piggie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina slapped Joys meaty, exposed derri\u00e8re causing it to ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink oink\" Replied Joy without enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't sound very convincing\" Said Catalina thoughtfully \"Maybe this will help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina knelt down beside Joy, who eyes her suspiciously, and began to rummage around in her handbag. After a few moments she found what she was looking for and removed a small, remote operated vibrator from her bag which Joy raised an eyebrow at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when were you kinky?\" Muttered Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say I never do anything for you fatass\" Catalina whispered back \"Don't fight this... This is going to be the only pleasure you get so I suggest you just go with it... Relish it, and if your good little pig you'll be justly rewarded\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was clearly not on board but knew there was nothing she could do to stop her humiliation at this point as Catalina lifted Joys belly flab to get to her thong. She slid the vibrator past Joys thunder thighs and into her pussy, causing Joy to gasp as it was forced into her and then held in place by the insanely tight thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ones for free\" Whispered Catalina, clicking her small remote which turned the sex toy onto its lowest setting \"You'll have to earn the rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy clenched her teeth and her eye twitched as she tried to ignore the feeling of the dildo vibrating against her clit. She fought against the feeling of pleasure, not wanting to succumb to arousal but it was too hard. She and Darnell had not been intimate for a little while, which had only been made worse by her spiralling weight problem, so even the slightest twinge in her nethers made her wet. Joy bit her lip and moaned softly, losing her battle of will as Catalina returned her attention to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok guys!\" She said \"Let's get a countdown to gluttony! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Gorgee!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina slapped Joys chunky ass, making her squeal before forcing her head down into the pig trough. She had little choice, as her face was forced into the porridge, and soon she was obediently gorging away. She found herself grunting and oinking, becoming more and more piglike as she ate, perhaps sub consciously hoping to be \"rewarded\" by Catalina. Catalina smirked at this, hearing the piggish noises coming from the gluttonous blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl\" Said Catalina \"Here's a reward... For the next level your going to have to do better than that though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina clicked her remote which increased the vibrators intensity to the next level. Joy grunted with pleasure into the slop, and began to eat even quicker. Joy gorged and gorged, gurgling with pleasure as the sex toy grinded agonist her clit, but despite the pleasure she felt she found herself yearning for more. When she received no further \"reward\" from Catalina she felt annoyed, wondering what more she could do. Annoyance turned to desperation and she found herself slyly trying to reach her hand past her gut towards her thong to aide the sex toy in pleasuring her. \"Trying\" was the operative word of course, and Catalina watched with amusement as Joy fumbled around, trying to squish past her belly fat to reach her loins. Once she finally managed to squash her gut out of the way and reach her vagina, she received a swift kick in her meaty derri\u00e8re, knocking her face first into the slop, causing her to cough and splutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show some god damn self respect\" Barked Catalina to which Joy actually snorted in derision between a sudden gasp of pleasure as surely any semblance of self respect was long gone at this point \"Either up your game, or no more rewards for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to her however a familiar face, obscured by the crowds, watched on in shock and intrigue. Randy had been watching with dumb, vacant interest to begin with, but as Joys public humiliation escalated he became more shocked and uncomfortable. He had not recognised the fat pig girl to be his brothers ex wife at first, mainly because she had been so fit and lean, never having a pound of extra fat on her for as long as he\u2019d known her. It wasn\u2019t until Catalina had announced her name that Randy had realized, and his jaw hit the floor at the sight of her. Since then he\u2019d merely watched, bug-eyed as she gorged herself silly for the pleasure of the watching, mocking crowds, her mannerisms becoming more piglike by the second. After a much longer period than was probably normal (Randy was far from normal afterall), Randy finally fumbled for his cellphone to alert Earl of the bizarre spectacle he was witnessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Earl\u201d He said when his brother answered \u201c I\u2019m just at the trailer park and... well... you might want to head over here... theres something you need to see\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked his brothers ex wife up and down, taking in every unsightly bulge of her thick frame which was squeezed into her clearly too small pig bikini. Her impressive belly, which was perfectly accentuated by her tight pink bikini, was becoming more and more of a gut the more she ate and her plump juicy cleavage and ass looking stunning. As Joy moaned and squealed through mouthfuls of food, Randy thought back to the last time he\u2019d seen his brothers ex wife. She had looked so perfect and slim back then, which couldnt have been much longer than a week ago, giving him and Earl her usual arrogant and rude demeanour.  The cockiness had been replaced with depraved gluttony, her face showing occasional flashes of intense orgasmic pleasure under her dishevelled blonde hair. The crowd around Randy grew slowly louder, their initial stunned silence evaporating as they began to jeer and laugh at the poor chunky blondes public humiliation. Randy was sure he could actually see Joy get slowly fatter as she gorged herself silly, noticing her erect nipples poked out above the cups of her skin tight pink bikini and below her double chin which was becoming more obvious. Randy turned when he heard tyres approaching and saw Earl in his truck. Just as Earl exited the vehicle Catalina leant down and whispered something to Joy, which got her immediate attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRandy what...?\u201d Began Earl, looking around in confusion but was cut off by Joys loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and Gentle... oooo... men, boys and girls Hiccurrrp!\u201d She began, clearly trying to get Catalina to turn the power of her vibrator up, desperate to satisfy her insatiable sexual desire \u201cUhnnn... ohhhh... brurrrp!!

The feeding was rough and demeaning, with mean taunts and comments which only spurred Joy further towards orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat pig bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrfff... urrrrp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filthy fat disgusting whore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhnn.. yesh I am... hiccurrpp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink for it pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink! Oink!! Oinkkkk!! I'm a worthless fat piggurrshhh!!! Munch munch munch!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she felt their hands probing, groping and squeezing her soft exposed flesh she could take now more and her vision became blurry as she peaked right in front of everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oinkkkk!!! Ohhhh goddddurrrp!!! Oink oinkkkkkkkkuhnnnnnnn!!!\" She wailed between mouthfuls of food, her eyes rolling into her head as the orgasm exploded in her nether regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so powerful that Joy went limp, but felt the mob keep her held aloft so that the rough feeding could continue. She was basically absorbed into the mob, and didn't even know who was feeding and groping her anymore as she her vision was blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear my big fat pig slut\" Said Catalina at the sight of the hefty blonde clearly struggling \"Looks like you need a little pick me up tehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the dial to her vibrating panties up even higher, which made the fat pig girl become animated once more. Her soft, gorgeously plump body which glistened with sweat began to arch and twist as she moaned and squealed between mouthfuls.<br>\r\nShe could feel hands getting lost in her fat folds, which really highlighted the tremendous amount of weight she had gained (she now weighed in at an impressive 192 pounds), a fact which would have really depressed her if it wasn't for the sex toy buzzing relentlessly against her clitorus. She could feel the layers of fat  on her gloriously plump pear shaped frame jiggle as she girated, closing in on her second orgasm of the day. Earl watched all this in complete disbelief. He had surmised that he was witnessing some kind of mob justice which, knowing his ex wife as he did, was most likely fully deserved although this didn't explain her dramatic weight gain. Joy was fat, there was no arguing against that now, and her extremely revealing and ridiculous pig bikini outfit only showed this off more. Her body had a prominent pear shape, her once slim toned figure buried under layers of flab, with thick hips, thunder thighs and a glorious belly taking centre stage. As she was jostled around by the mob as they felt her up and fed her relentlessly her large, soft, spare tire of a gut jiggled hypnotically and Earl found himself unable to look away. He'd always secretly wondered what the brash blonde bombshell would look like with a little extra meat on her bones, and now he had his answer (and then some). She carried the weight very well, and as he saw the top cup rip over her pink bikini top, as it struggled to contain her bulging tits, he had to admit he liked what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was simple, but highly effective in parting Club Chubby's patrons from their money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Catalina noticed as she bounced up and down, there was little chance of that happening today, as there were no patrons to be seen. Looking around, the entire club was empty. After a minute, she stopped jumping, the music cutting out a few seconds later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where is everybody?\" She asked, stepping down from the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChubby Jr., the club's owner, appeared from behind the bar. \"Not here. We haven't had a single customer all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Catalina frowned. \"Do I still get paid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChubby shook his head. \"No, but you can take what you want from the buffet, its just going to spoil anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina grumbled, but it was still better than nothing. She wobbled over to the food table on her precariously high heels and grabbed a paper plate. She piled it high with chicken wings, spring rolls, pasta salad and barbecued ribs. If she wasn't getting paid, she might as well eat up. Maybe she could save some money on dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChubby had returned to the bar, but looked over at Catalina when something crossed his mind. More than once he had dealt with complaints from customers who had expected a particular kind of stripper from an establishment called 'Club Chubby's\". He had always ignored them before, but maybe now was the time to try something different. People would come from miles around for niche clubs, and they were usually willing to pay extra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched, Catalina demolished the entire plate of food, eating quickly but neatly, nibbling all the meat off of the bones. By the time she was finished, her toned stomach was bloated, sticking out just a little over her waistband. She burped, covering her mouth with a napkin and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In his hands he held another plate, with even more food than the first one, including some buttery mashed potatoes and a few bread rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished already? There's still plenty left. I'm just going to throw it out otherwise.\" He said, holding up the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina smiled at her boss' unusual generosity. \"No, thanks. I'm already pretty full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now, that's some good eating.\" He cajoled her, wafting the plate under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina shrugged. It did smell good, and she had nowhere else to be, her shift at the motel didn't start until five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the plate and sat down, digging in with enthusiasm. The food was surprisingly good for a strip club buffet, probably because Chubby also owned most of Camden's restaurants and food distributors. After a few minutes of eating, Chubby even brought her a beer, and a second one when she finished that. He also topped up her plate occasionally, a few more wings, or another scoop of mashed potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally finished, refusing Chubby's offer of some more egg rolls, she was feeling overly full. Her stomach was now very bloated and uncomfortable, made worse by her tight pants. As she stood up with a quiet moan, her belly stuck out about three inches, and she patted it, a little embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChubby didn't seem to notice, and had disappeared back behind the bar. Catalina was confused by his behavior, but distracted by her grumbling stomach. She rubbed it as she went back to the dressing rooms. The green dress she changed into was less constricting, but the bulge around her midsection was still quite noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she prepared to leave, Chubby reappeared, carrying an armful of tinfoil wrapped packages, which he pressed into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, might as well take some stuff home with you, have it for dinner maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was going to protest, she felt sick at the smell of more food, but checked herself. She would be hungry later, and couldn't afford to turn down free food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled weakly and took the food, and as she left she knew Chubby was watching her ass as she left. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the twelfth time that day, Catalina bent down to clean under a motel bed, and for the twelfth time she felt the middle two buttons on her denim maid's outfit pop open. She sighed as she stood up and clicked the metal clasps back together, holding her breath as she attempted to smooth down the tight dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts, there was no disguising the noticeable bulge of her midsection. Her once toned stomach had grown into a prominent potbelly, sticking out almost as far as her breasts, supported on both sides by small love handles. It was a distressing development, but it wasn't entirely unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past week, she had been eating much more than she normally would. She had shared the food Chubby had given her with the other maids, but at their urging had still eaten more than her fair share. The next day, after a morning's work in the motel, she had returned to Club Chubby. Once again, it was empty, but the eponymous owner didn't seem that put out, telling her to stick around in case any customers turned up, and to help herself to the buffet in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut business remained slow, and without anything better to do, Catalina started eating more out of boredom than hunger. By the end of her shift, she had definitely over-indulged, her stomach once again round and taut, maybe even a little bigger than yesterday. She had politely but firmly turned down Chubby's offer of some to take home, already feeling queasy and planning to skip dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat particular plan failed when she returned to her lodgings at the motel and found all the other maids insistent on repaying her for the previous evening's dinner. She had been forced to consume a veritable smorgasbord of various South American dishes in order to avoid offending them, and when she finally stumbled to the sleeping area she felt like she was going to pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days, she didn't even wait for Chubby's permission, tucking in to the buffet as soon as she arrived at the club. He must not have had a problem with it, as he didn't say anything, and even told her to help herself to anything from the bar. And even though there were hardly any customers anymore, the amount of food on offer seemed to have increased, along with a variety of new items like chimichangas and donuts. Catalina tried them all, and as the days went by her dancing outfit kept getting tighter and tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused to examine her body in the cracked bathroom mirror she was cleaning. As well as her belly, her ass had gotten bigger too, butt cheeks almost peeking out from underneath the short dress. If she put on any more weight, she'd have to ask for a new uniform, both here and at Club Chubby's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough even if she didn't put on any more weight, she soon might not have a job at Club Chubby's anyway.  Yesterday she had actually been called on to dance, for the first time in a week, hurriedly wiping barbecue sauce from her mouth and staggering up on stage. As she 'danced', the unaccustomed extra weight almost causing her to fall over, she saw Chubby consulting with another man. They watched her for a few minutes, and when the song ended, they had shook hands, both men smiling broadly. She figured maybe he was selling the club to the other guy, since it had been doing so poorly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged as she wheeled her cart of cleaning supplies back to the main office, nibbling on a candy bar she took from her apron. She had the evening shift tonight, she could ask Chubby then. Her stomach grumbled, loudly, her appetite having increased along with her waistline. Maybe she would have some dinner at the Crab Shack first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was approaching early evening in Malibu and Charlie Harper was settling down to watch a boxing match on TV with a glass of high quality scotch in one hand, and a large cigar in the other. He settled back into the comfortable sofa and took a long sip from his scotch. Suddenly his relaxation was broken by the sounds of raised voices, coming from the direction of his spare room and Charlie groaned knowing immediately what was happening. The voices belonged to his brother and his extremely young girlfriend; Kandi, who had both been living together in the room for a few weeks. The arguing had begun almost immediately and had only worsened as the days dragged on. Charlie had told Alan from the beginning that his relationship with Kandi was a complete farce (though Alan claimed to love her), and the only reason it continued was because Alan was thinking with his penis (\u201cnot me for a change\u201d Thought Charlie humorously). It wasn\u2019t hard to see why of course; Kandi was 21 years old and though she possessed the intellect of a 3 year old she possessed the body and looks of a sex goddess. Alan was over twice her age, a fact that filled him with even more joy, though it had soon become apparent that the cost of keeping this stunning girl happy was way beyond what he could afford. Kandi loved to be pampered, and even though Alan couldn\u2019t afford it he didn\u2019t have the heart to say no because his lust for her prevented him from doing so. That was until he drove himself into even more debt than he had previously been in, and when the pampering stopped Alan had no choice but to tell Kandi that she had to live within her means\u2026 Or get a job. And thus began the arguments, which had rung throughout the house ever since. Charlie sipped his scotch bitterly; he was getting tired of these fights. It was difficult to seduce women into sleeping with him when they were constantly being interrupted by the raised voices of his annoying brother and his bimbo girlfriend. He necked the rest of his scotch as he turned up the TV as far as it would go in an attempt to drown out the loud intrusion of his relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Okay...\" Said Kandi like a sullen child, and took her first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi had no idea just how many calories Judith had managed to cram into the innocent looking meal, which included a substantial amount of lard, butter and protein powder. The powder was many years old, and had been bought on a whim by Alan when he had once decided to get \"buff\" but had ironically found the lid to hard to remove and given up. Kandi started quickly, as she was genuinely hungry but as she ate her pace began to slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do want Alan to love you, don't you Kandi?\" Asked Judith rather condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi stifled a fatigued burp before she spoke, still with a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesh of coursh\" She said still chewing her mouthful \"But itsh hard... I feel full\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith sighed as Kandi put down her knife and fork and pushed her chair away from the table, sitting back in it groggily. She could see that her usually perfectly flat tummy had a slight bump to it, but she was not happy with her giving up so readily. Judith approached the back of Kandi's chair and forced it back to the table. Kandi's head lolled back to look at her, her eyes slightly glazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-hic!- What are you doing?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping you dear\" Said Judith, rather coldly \"This is for your own good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith grabbed the fork from the plate, speared some more food onto it and stuffed it into Kandi's mouth. Kandi was too shocked and fatigued to fight so she merely chewed and swallowed. This forkful was followed by another, and another until Judith was positively shoveling it into Kandi's mouth. This continued until all the food was gone and when Judith stopped Kandi almost collapsed from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl\" Said Judith, patronizingly patting Kandi on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo\" Moaned Kandi \"So...

She had been awoken by Judith, who was poking her rudely in the stomach (which still looked a little bloated from breakfast).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch time my dear\" Judith chirped, drawing Kandi's attention to the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Judith..\" Said Kandi in shock as she saw the table once again stacked with food \"... I'm still sort of full from breakfast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh suck it up\" Said Judith impatiently \"Your a big girl after all... Remember Alan likes BIG girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi sighed heavily, returning her glance to the gigantic meal laid out before her. Under Judith's stare Kandi reluctantly took her first bite of the meal, groaning miserably as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ada girl!\" Said Judith happily, patting Kandi's head \"At this rate you'll be nice and fat in no time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi grunted a response through a mouthful of food, continuing to eat at a steady pace. The meal progressed much like her breakfast had a few hours earlier, only Kandi stopped eating much sooner this time. Once again Judith revelled in her roll as feeder when Kandi was unable to eat anymore, assuring her that she was doing it for her own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll thank me after this\" Said Judith as she shoveled food into Kandis helpless mouth \"after a few weeks of this.... Perhaps even months, you'll be as fat as a prize cow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murphh!\" Kandi mumbled miserably, as fork full after fork full was stuffed into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kandi had been forced to finish all the food Judith employed the same funnel as earlier to feed her the weight gain drink. Kandis eyes were glazed over as she gulped and gulped, the incredibly fattening mixture making her already taut belly expand more against her pajama bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats a good girl\" Said Judith as though she was talking to a baby as Kandi swallowed the last of the mixture \"My my thats a big belly you have\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!\" Replied Kandi groggily, slumping back in her chair and rubbing her sore tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a few hours\" Said Judith as she picked up the empty plates \"Then we'll get you weighed and you can have some more to eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi offered no response at all, merely groaning wearily as Judith left the room looking very pleased with herself indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Judith returned she wasn't at all surprised to find Kandi slumped in the exact same position as she'd left her.\"Wakey wakey\" Said Judith nudging Kandi awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna go to school today\" Said Kandi blearily as she opened her eyes looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you get my dear\" Said Judith, grabbing Kandi under the arms \"Lets get you weighed shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi was still half asleep as Judith led her to some scales in the middle of the room.\"Now, how much did you weigh before you started being such a greedy pig?\" Asked Judith tactlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um like 110 i guess...\" Said Kandi blearily, stifling a cute yawn as she was lead onto the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you now weigh... Duh duh da durr!\" Announced Judith dramatically as the numbers rose on the scale \"118 pounds! Not bad for a days work\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJudith looked Kandi up and down, examining her body with her hands so she could get a better idea of how the weight had been distributed. The extra 8 pounds wasn't particularly noticeable, as it had seemingly been distributed fairly evenly around her body.\"Your hands are cold\" Said Kandi giggling like a child as Judith probed her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are feeling a little softer my dear\" Said Judith finally \"If you keep this up you'll be too fat to leave the house in a month... Speaking of which, take this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith handed Kandi a very large bar of chocolate, which Kandi took without complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some candy for Kandi... From now on I want you to snack constantly between meals\" Said Judith as Kandi shrugged and took a bite of the chocolate \"I don't want there a minute to go by where you aren't stuffing your greedy mouth with junk food, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Judy\" Said Kandi as she munched on her chocolate, giving Judith a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jake was sat on the sofa as Kandi entered, playing a violent video game that Judith probably wouldn't of approved of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kandi\" Said Jake as Kandi entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey Jake!\" Kandi responded happily, swallowing the last of the chocolate bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake couldn't help eyeing up the gorgeous twenty year old in her skimpy pajamas as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you got there?\" Asked Kandi with interest, spying a bounty of junk food next to Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... I got...\" Jake then listed off everything he had, counting them on his fingers (There was so much stuff he had to use each hand twice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo... Well your mom says I'm a growing girl\" Said Kandi childishly \"Can I have some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\" Said Jake, handing Kandi a box of pop tarts and a game controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I love this game!\" Said Kandi excitedly as she took a bite out of a pop tart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours Jake and Kandi munched away on their stock pile of snacks whilst having a very heated gaming session. Kandi was so engrossed in the game that she wasn't really paying much attention to how much she was actually eating, but to any onlookers who were aware of Jake's appetite they would of been very surprised to see her eating more than him. After awhile Kandis full belly could be seen poking out from under her pajama top and she rubbed it as she stifled a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Kandi\" Said Jake sounding impressed \"You sure can put it away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks Jake -hic!-\" Said Kandi happily \"Your mom told me to eat as much as I could\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Said Jake raising his eyebrows, surprised that his mom would have that attitude \"Well i guess I could help you then if you wanted... I guess you'd eat more that way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi considered this, pulling a cute face as she looked upwards thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm... Okay then!\" She said smiling with enthusiasm \"Commence feeding stations... Three... Two... One... Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi then stuffed a doughnut into her greedy mouth, which was quickly followed by one from Jake. Kandi already felt quite full from her own gorging, but she wanted to please Alan by getting chubbier for him just like Judith had told her. As Kandi was stuffed at a very fast pace by herself and Jake neither of them noticed Judith, who stood in the doorway with a very pleased smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She had felt full before Judith had arrived on the scene but now she was quickly approaching the food wall as her tummy bloated out noticeably under her skimpy pajama top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw look at that bloated belly of yours\" Said Judith, prodding it as she stuffed a doughnut into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murrf! Ooo!\" Moaned Kandi at the touch \"I feel -Hic!- so full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense\" Said Judith dismissively, stuffing another doughnut into her mouth \"If we're going to fatten you up quickly, you've got to push yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi groaned, but nevertheless picked up the pace as she forced herself to continue. She stuffed two pop tarts into her greedy mouth before Jake followed with two twinkies and Judith with two doughnuts. After ten more minutes of this each member of the feeding team crammed their last morsel of food into Kandi's exhausted mouth and allowed her to finish it. Kandi was lying down now, breathing heavily and rubbing her insanely full tummy which poked out under her top. Her eyes were closed as she moaned and groaned and Jake looked at her obviously impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man she can put it away\" He said \"She can eat like a fat chick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she carries on like this she will be one Jake\" Said Judith with a grin as she watched Kandi's taut belly rise and fall with each laboured breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Judith brought her face close to Kandi's, so their noses were almost touching and she stared her in the eye seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fight this...\" She whispered, her voice breaking slightly from the powerful sexual attraction she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fight what Jud-mmmm?!!?-\" Replied Kandi dumbly, but was caught off guard by Judith sticking her tongue into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the compete ditzy airhead that she was (and the fact that this was far from the first time she'd experimented with another girl) Kandi just gave a shrug and went with the strange predicament she found herself in, returning Judith's passionate kiss and slowly curressing her tongue with her own. Judiths hands slowly made it's way down the youthfully soft and silky smooth skin of Kandis body until it reached her bloated stomach, which was taut and tight like a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your big belly...\" Judith whispered sensually \"I can't wait for it to get even bigger\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi opened her eyes wide in shock as Judith lowered her head away from her face and proceeded to lick her belly button. Kandi practically purred, Judiths cool moist tongue soothing her uncomfortably full tummy and she closed her eyes in ecstasy. Kandi had no idea why Judith was acting in this strange manner, but she didn't mind so much due to how nice it felt so she just decided to enjoy it. Suddenly Kandi felt something press up against her lips and she opened her eyes to see that Judith was trying to force a donut into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm really full Jud-Mrrrrphhh?!?-\" Kandi began innocently, but was cut off by Judith ignoring her and cramming it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi groaned as she chewed and swallowed, her stomach offering a similar groan in protest as it joined the rest of the food she'd already been fed. Judith continued to grope and tongue her bloated belly, seemingly entranced by it as she used her free hand to stuff more into her mouth. Judiths hand moved it's way up Kandis pajama top, reaching her breasts which she fondled, paying special attention to her nipples which were slowly becoming erect. Despite the discomfort of being forced to eat yet more fattening foods Kandi could feel herself becoming moist downstairs, which was something Judith picked up on without having to feel her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoying this my fat little hippopotomus?\" Crooned Judith, stuffing a Danish into Kandis exhausted mouth \"Just you wait and see how fat I plan on making you! You won't be able to leave this house, your disgusting fat won't even be able to squeeze through the doorway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi mumbled a response through her mouthful of food, just as Judith brought her hand down her belly towards the waistband of her pajama shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo -Ulp!-\" Kandi cooed at the touch before the next inevitable mouthful she was force fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudiths fingers inched their way down past Kandis waistband, and snuck into her panties. Judith smiled at how moist Kandi already felt, and she kissed her passionately when she'd swallowed the donut she'd stuffed into her mouth. Kandis eyes widened and unfocussed as Judith gently stroked her shaven vagina, her mouth fell open as she let out a shuddered breath of pleasure but this was soon plugged by a chocolate pop tart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

THAT\u00b4S WAY TOOO MUCH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan, wait... please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kandi had drifted off to sleep due to the big meal inside her slowing her system down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith grabbed Alan\u00b4s arm and dragged him into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you want to get away with that, Judith?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I could see how you looked at Kandi\u00b4s belly, Alan... I know that looks so well... I got that look from you back when I was pregnant with Jake... and let\u00b4s remember about that pregnant farting bimbo that gave birth to a child in Charlie\u00b4s house once... wasn\u00b4t it the same look...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Alan... I feel the same about bellies... at least about Kandi\u00b4s... At first I just wanted to fatten her up so you two break up and she is ending depressive due to all the inconviniences she has caused me already... but I started to like how her belly swelled after the big meals, how taut it fells, listing to her burps is like music as well, you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan nodded...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don\u00b4t we just kill two bird with one stone... we both seem to like Kandi getting stuffed and gaining weight... so let\u00b4s work hand in hand together on her and share her here and there... how does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Judith it sounds pretty great actually... but you haven\u00b4t been a person known for her sharing qualities in the past, you see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, Alan... And I\u00b4m sorry for it... I mean I have to be thankful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I always asked myself why I can\u00b4t pull anything off when it comes to men... and now I got the answer... thanks to you... I have something going for ladies how stuff themselves silly and grow round... Ain\u00b4t that mad... I thank you so much, Alan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith hugged Alan for a few seconds and caught him off guard... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do next with \"Project Stuffed Kandi\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judith, I have got a plan... You know Jake is over here for the weekend but Charlie is in New York because of his \"Charlie Waffels\"-tour, so we would have the big house for us... so just let me arrange something for Kandi... Just be sure you will be there at 8 pm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4ll make that sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... see you then, Judith! Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Alan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.55 PM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Alan, we are a bit early...\" Kandi stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that\u00b4s okay... I\u00b4m already done with preparations.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let the ladies pass him by and shut the door after them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith and Kandi were stunned on the spot... Alan had outdone himself... The tables and even the piano were creaking under the sheer amount of food he had cooked... Several pounds of turkey, ham, stuffing, mashed potatoes and other culinary sensations were on display... Enough to held a Thanksgiving dinner for 8-10 people... wow... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan took the coats of Judith and Kandi just throwing them on the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Kandi. It looks so yummy! Ready to dig in?\" Judith asked her companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith smiled... there was no chance Kandi could eat all of it but she had no doubt the Kandi\u00b4s belly would be rounder than ever before after that hearty dinner... Judith stroke her hands about her own slim body and really wondered how she could remain so slim during the marriage with Alan... It was such a hard work to keep oneself in shape, especially after such a big baby like Jake had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that thoughts away Judith take a seat next to Kandi who had already started to stuff her face. Judith could barely wait to the moment Kandi was too stuffed to eat by herself so she and Alan would assist her to get even more food into that soon to be overpacked belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Judith stays disciplined and Kandi does all the eating work until she is too stuffed to go on... so Judith and Alan will assist as planned. (Of course Kandi won\u00b4t be able to finish it all.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Judith gets so aroused by the situation she losts contro labout herself and digs in as well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Due to her usual obliviousness to most things, Kandi didn't notice the unsettling manner she was being watched (or leered at) by both Alan and Judith. Instead her whole attention was on eating, which she was doing as though she expected Alan to take it from her at any second. Alan was actually taken aback by his girlfriends new ferocious appetite, impressed at how his ex wife had managed to manipulate her in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at her go\" Alan whispered as Kandi practically inhaled a large portion of chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Said Judith in awe at her own handiwork \"Just imagine how big and fat she's going to get from eating like this... And our own special encouragement of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan smiled, obviously unable to believe his luck at being in this situation. After awhile the inevitable happened; Kandis relentless pace began to wane. The fact that her appetite and food capacity had gone up couldn't detract from the fact that she was still a slim young woman, so there was only so much she could stuff herself with. This is where Judith and Alan came in, and was something they'd been eagerly awaiting since Kandi started the impossible gigantic meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, is someone full?\" Crooned Judith, giving Alan a meaningful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc.. Yup...\" Said Kandi, sitting back in her seat and holding her obviously full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear\" Said Judith with a smile, turning to Alan who was basically shaking with excitement \"What a waste of good food, that will never do... Will it Alan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Alan replied \"I think the right thing to do is, um, lend a helping hand as it were\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Kandi had faced this scenario several times at Judiths house, her low IQ meant that she had no idea what they were talking about... Or what they were about to do. Judith rose from her seat and approached Kandi, having a cloth from the table as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you hadn't already figured it out... Which I'm guessing you haven't...\" Whispered Judith in Kandis ear, as she tied her hands behind the chair with the cloth \"We are about to force feed you the rest of your meal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm full Judy\" Said Kandi, as though Judith didn't realize this already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think your nearly as full as you think you are dear\" Said Judith dismissively just as Alan walled over to join them \"No shut up and eat your dinner\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-mrrrfff-\" Kandi began but was cut off as Judith stuffed a huge spoonful of creamy, buttery mashed potato into her mouth from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi looked a little surprised and indignant, but nevertheless made no attempt to stop Judith as another spoonful of the creamy mash entered her mouth. Alan was far too excited to merely watch so soon he too joined in, grabbing a fork and spearing whatever he could fit upon it which then found its way into Kandis mouth. Judith and Alan worked as an effective team, each of them getting equally turned on as they stuffed the beautiful young air head silly. Judith couldn't resist but to first give Kandis breast a sensual rub whilst stuffing more food into her mouth, and then giving it a full on grope. Kandi moaned through a big mouthful of food, her nipples becoming erect at the unexpected feel of Judiths warm grasp which indicated she wasn't exactly hating the situation. Alan met Judiths eye as she caressed his girlfriends breast, the look she gave him making him break out of his usual nervous hesitance and jump right in, grabbing a handful of tit himself. Kandi was fed and groped, her stomach going from quite full to very full as she moaned in a mixture of discomfort and giddy pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst\" Said Judith, getting Alans attention who was clearly enjoying himself very much \"Look at this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith loosened her grip and moved her hand down Kandis body, leaving it to rest on a very obvious bulge beneath her top. Kandi groaned, a half eaten piece of meat hanging from her exhausted mouth a Judith patted her glorious food stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Said Alan, pushing the meat further into Kandis mouth forcing her to finish it as he gazed upon her bountiful belly \"That is one... Ahem... Full, bloated... gorgeous belly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan carefully undid the top button on Kandis trousers, which was clearly straining and causing some discomfort, causing her to gasp in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... Urrrrp!... Full you guys...\" Said Kandi, finally finding her voice \"So... Hicccc... Full... Oooo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw I know you are honey...\" Crooned Judith, continuing to lightly massage Kandis gurgling belly \"But remember, what I say goes... So if I say eat, that's what you're going to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudiths hand slowly made its way down Kandis belly, as she crammed more food into her weary mouth. Alan watched with excitement as Judiths hand brushed Kandis crotch, causing Kandi to mumur and her body to shake slightly in arousal. The rest of the gigantic meal slowly found its way into Kandis taut belly, despite its groans of protest. Whilst feeding her Judith continued to rub her crotch, before finally dipping her hand into Kandis panties which caused Kandis drooping eyes to suddenly widen with dilated pleasure and her cheeks to go pink. Alan could take it no more at this point, feeling left out of the fun he engaged Kandi in an open mouth mouthed kiss after he'd forced her to eat a large roast potato. Kandi was now pleasured by both Judith and Alan, whilst simultaneously being fed by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The sleep has somehow filled Alan up with energy again despit his back hurt from the improper padding he rested on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his keys Alan opened the front door as quiet as possible as the ladies where probably asleep after a lot of certain sporty activites that probably helped Kandi to burn about 0.5 % of all the calories she had indulged in before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan closed the door, get out of his shoes and sneaked on his toes right into the direction of his room.

Asured it was just his mind Alan set the next foot into his direction... just to be distracted again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah, there is something... Alan tried to breathe as flat and quiet as possible. Yes, there were some sounds from the kitchen area... where Charlie had stored money... Maybe his drunkard of a brother had told someone about it while being hammered, Alan suggested. So we might have criminals in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Alan would have run to the door as quick as possible, but this time there was a difference... Judith, his son\u00b4s mother was sleeping peacefully on the first floor... not to menton Kandi. Jusith could have run away easily if Alan warned her but Kandi in all her stuffed constitution? No chance in hell! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Alan, you have to be a man and protect your family he though the himself to cheer his brave a bit more. Grabbing an umbrella from the holder next to the door, okay not the best weapon to confront a burglar but better than nothing at all, Alan tip-toed into the direction of the kitchen area,ready to go for the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw an individual in the rather dark kitchen sitting on the chair with the neck turned into his direction. It looked like that individual worked with something on the table... probably Charlie\u00b4s money! Bt what kind of burglar would take so much time in a house full of life... Alan shrugged... Maybe the criminal could take so much time because there was no life around to expect a counterattack from anymore... Might it be possible that someone just borke into the house, kurdered Judith and Kandi to count the money without any hesitation now? Was it his own fault that Judith and Kandi laid lifeless in a bloody mess in one of the rooms on the first floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold sweat and fear run down Alan\u00b4s spine. This person before him was a murderer he was sure of, so he would only have one shot with the umbrella to knock that bastard out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Alan... count down in your mind and then take your best shot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3, 2, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUUUURRRRAAAAUUUUUPPP*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was so shocked and stunned by the unexpected sound from the individual that he instinctively switched the kitchen light on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill full of fear his eyes surveyed the kitchen table quickly. What he interpreted as money or else were the leftovers Kandi couldn\u00b4t eat hours before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Alan\u00b4s look caught the \"burglar/murderer\" that just burped so unexpectedly split-seconds before.

Urrrpp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan tried to hide his shame, as this explanation only turned him on more. Kandis belly was stunning, big and bloated to the point that her pajama top did not completely cover it. Alan figured that Judith had made Kandi stuff her belly for her own sexual pleasure, and probably intended on another steamy sex session upon her return. As he watched her belly rise and fall with each laboured breath, his lust overcame him and he decided that it was his turn for some fun. He approached Kandi, and tenderly brushed her dishevelled hair from her beautiful face with his hand. He stared into her eyes as she stared back in bleary confusion before embracing her in an open mouth kiss. Kandi didn't fight it, even if she wanted to she was far too weak from her late night gorging session to do so. Without another word he took her by her hand and helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhraaaappp!\" She exclaimed at the sudden movement and groaned, while Alan was more aroused than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe practically dragged Kandi to his bedroom like a horny cave man and thrust her onto his bed, causing her taut belly to grumble miserably. Alan stroked the silky skin of her perfect belly and slowly removed her nightie top and trousers, leaving her lying there in her sexy black lace panties and bra. It was obvious that she had put on more than a couple lb's, as although her extremely swollen belly made it hard to notice the extra weight there, her breasts were clearly a little too large for her bra. Kandi merely groaned, her fatigue preventing her from moving or communicating. Alan could contain himself no more and began kissing her stunning belly, which seemed even larger now it was completely uncovered. He licked her deepening belly button and Kandi moaned, actually enjoying the feeling of his tender caress of her sore tummy. Kandi was becoming used to the constant feeling of having an uncomfortably full and bloated belly, so she was able to suck it up and get into the mood. She loved Alan dearly, and after their lovers tiff a few days previous she was just happy to be back in his bed. Of course her simple mind didn't really fully comprehend the bizarre situation she was in, that being her being fattened up and lusted after by her boyfriend and his ex wife, but she was no stranger to the kink and enjoyed the constant sex from two very different people. She helped Alan undress while he unhooked her bra, which her large squished breasts seemingly thanked him for, as they flopped out thankful for the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He knew that Judith would be in a foul mood over the fact he stole Kandi off her the night before, but he hoped she would take this out on her rather than him. Suddenly Kandi stirred and Alan smiled fondly at her as she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" He said, before tenderly kissing her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi giggled, squirming as Alan groped her which tickled. He couldn't help himself, he was finding her more intoxicating by each day that passed and each pound gained. He squeezed her stomach softly, feeling how his fingers now sunk in to the smooth flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my\" Said Alan \"What a nice flabby belly you have\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?\" Asked Kandi innocently as Alan caressed her new chub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" Said Alan \"But its not nearly big and flabby enough yet... Maybe we should fatten you up some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi looked a little confused, as she was her standard look these days and Alan grabbed her by the hand and pulled her out of bed. As he walked with her down the corridor to the stairs, Alan smelled a very inviting aroma of sizzling bacon, amongst other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" He said to himself as he saw the huge food spread on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning Alan... Kandi\" Said Judith as the two entered, looking in awe at the meal she had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Judy!\" Chirped Kandi happily, clearly not noticing Judiths rather icy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down\" Ordered Judith, and following a look with Alan Kandi shrugged and obeyed \"You've been a very naughty girl my dear, very naughty indeed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have?\" Asked Kandi dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Said Judith, shooting Alan a rather crippling look \"I won you fair and square last night... And yet you left me for Alan. That's not very nice is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it sure isn't\" Alan chimed in, wanting Judith to punish Kandi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan...\" Said Judith \"Please bind her arms and we can begin her breakfast... She looks rather hungry don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" He replied excitedly, tying his girlfriends arms behind her back as instructed \"I think she needs a little more meat on her bones\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um guys?\" Said Kandi \"I can't reach the food with my hands tied-Ullppp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh\" Said Judith as she stuffed a large sausage into her mouth \"I know your a fat little dumbass, but even you must know the drill by now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the majority of her meals over the past week or so, Kandi was fed the very hearty breakfast while both Alan and Judith lusted over her. Stacks of bacon and sausage, so substantial they were probably several whole pigs worth  found their way into Kandis ever growing belly, amidst mouthfuls of funnel fed orange juice/protein shakes to wash it down. After this came stacks upon stacks of pancakes, each drenched in butter and syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Alan as a huge forkful of pancake was pushed past Kandis lips \"I don't think there's enough syrup on there dear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your right Alan\" Replied Judith, thoroughly enjoying herself \"Bottoms up fatass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funnel was once more pushed past Kandis sticky lips and the whole jug of sweet syrup was dunked down it which Kandi had no choice but to gulp down. Once the pancakes had gone Judith moved on to waffles and by this point Kandi was truly stuffed to the brim, despite the improved food capacity of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy... Urrrpp... I've learnt my... Hiccc... Lesson-Mrrrff!-\" Stammered Kandi weakly, her belly groaning as it poked out from under her pajama top as Judith forced another forkful of waffle into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dear, but that's for me to decide\" Said Judith condescendingly \"And I think you need to be punished a little more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi turned a weary, semi pleading glance to her boyfriend Alan who merely met it with a rather creepy smile and nod of enthusiasm. She groaned as she turned back to Judith and was met with yet another mouthful of food. Alan just couldn't contain himself any longer and began groping Kandis breasts as she was fed, feeling her nipples become erect almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Charlie had gotten in late last night, after a barely memorable lurid and drunken night of love making with a woman (or possibly women) whom he'd already forgotten about. He lurched into the kitchen, still half drunk and barely aware of his surroundings as he approached the refrigerator and removed a carton of OJ and took a deep swig. Alan and Judith froze, clearly believing they were alone in the house as Kandi swallowed the last thing she'd been fed and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrpp!\" She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie jumped, also clearly believing he was alone and slowly turned his blood shot, bleary gaze onto the bizarre love triangle assembled in his kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan?\" He said, his voice husky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...\" Said Alan, him and Judith looking like deer in headlights \"Wooooo... This is alllll a dreammmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie stared at the odd scene for a few moments, seemingly considering Alans ridiculous explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this were a dream...\" Said Charlie slowly \"Then Judith and Kandi would be naked... And you wouldn't be here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith scowled at Charlie, but was horrified when Alan have her a meaningful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not getting naked Alan!\" She said indignantly \"Jesus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" Said Charlie \"I really thought that would work... Anyway, I know its not a dream you jackass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Said Alan, now looking awkward \"Well then, um... We're rehearsing a play...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up Alan\" Barked Judith, losing her patience \"Yes you've walked in on something... But I'm sure nothing worse and more perverse than your usually used to in this house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point\" Replied Charlie, eyeing the gorgeous overly stuffed form of Kandi with interest \"But even so, you want to walk me through this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Um... Judith and I...\" Alan began awkwardly, but was suddenly cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan and Judy have been -Hiccc!- fattening me up\" Said Kandi, her tone surprisingly bright despite the heavy feeding session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I see that Kandi\" Said Charlie \"But my question is why exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it turns us on, is that what you want us to say?\" Said Judith \"The process of turning this usually perfectly slim gorgeous airhead into a jiggling tub of lard turns us on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see, that makes sense\" Said Charlie and both Alan and Judith looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does?\" Asked Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I've done it once or twice\" Explained Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have??\" Asked Judith I'm disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Said Charlie simply \"I am pretty well travelled you know, if you spend as long as I have exploring, ahem, sexual relations you need to keep things interesting... The whole feedee thing is a bit time consuming though, I'm a busy man after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan and Judith stared at each other in complete amazement at what Charlie was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your fine with this?\" Asked Alan carefully, indicating his very stuffed girlfriend bound to a chair \"Me and my ex wife are forcing my new girlfriend to get fat and you have no problem with that at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Charlie, seemingly pondering for a moment \"Nope, not really. Could be interesting to see what she looks like as a fat chick... So yeah, go nuts. You have my blessing if that helps you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. Yeah... That does actually\" Said Alan still barely understanding what was happening \"Thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it\" Said Charlie, taking his leave \"Have fun kids\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith and Alan exchanged bewildered glances before continuing from where they had left off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where were we my chubby air headed piglet\" Crooned Judith, pushing another forkful of food past Kandis lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following Charlie condoning the pairs new fetish, things only got more interesting for Kandi. After being weighed (which displayed an impressive new weight of 148lb) any form of decorum was completely absent for the rest of the day. Poor Kandi merely stumbled groggily about the house between heavy feedings and steamy sex sessions with her two lustful admirers, barely able to comprehend what was happening. Alan and Judith on the other hand were in complete heaven, living out their sordid dreams at Kandis expense and wallowing in the seemingly never ending sexual fulfilment. There were teething problems at first of course; as both Alan and Judith were unwilling to share the gorgeous, slowly expanding girl, preferring to selfishly keep Kandi to themselves to fatten up and pleasure. However in time, as they learnt to share (mainly due to being able to feed the poor girl faster when working together) they slowly began to realise that this new arrangement was actually bringing them closer together, with the usual unpleasant atmosphere between them seemingly disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Tonight\" Said Alan causally, as he and Joy were busy feeding Kandi pie in the sofa \"Um... Who gets her tonight? I mean if you wanted her... I wouldn't mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan clearly did mind, and Judith was touched at his generosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Judith responded, as she pushed a slice of pie past Kandis weary lips \"I've been thinking about that actually... And i think i have an interesting solution\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...?\" Said Alan raising an eyebrow \"What solution?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... In the spirit of sharing, maybe we could share her tonight\" Said Judith, her tone seductive \"I mean she's getting big enough to share if you know what i mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo emphasise her point Judith poked and then softly squeezed the fat roll which was forming at Kandis midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrp\" Exclaimed Kandi weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan looked almost ravenous at the thought, looking Kandi up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your right\" He said, trying not to drool at the proposal \"Ahem... No time like the present... Hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith shared the same lustful look as her ex husband and so in silence they hurriedly stuffed Kandi silly with the remainder of the pie, using both hands to shovel it down her throat as quickly as possible. They then pulled Kandi to her feet without giving her a chance to digest what they'd just stuffed her with, and dragged the poor girl towards the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Kandi awoke in between Alan and Judith after a night of very passionate three way love making. Though she had been uncomfortably full, having been stuffed to the brim only moments prior, Kandi had very much enjoyed the experience as the two pleasured her and basically worshipped her ever growing belly. There had been a lot of good feelings in the room, that actually hadn't been just lust and desire. Suddenly an alarm went off causing Kandi to jump, during which she could feel a soft ripple over her body caused by the ever growing layer of fat that was accumulating all over. Alan stired, reaching out blindly for the source of the noise and instead finding one of Kandis ample breasts. He poked at it, tweaking the erect nipple sightly clearing confused that it didn't stop the penetrating noise which made Kandi giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tickles Alan\" She said, and Alan suddenly sat upright clearly having forgot with whom he was sharing a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the stunning form of his girlfriend, noticing immediately (which incidentally caused a bout of morning glory) how much thicker she was getting, especially as she was sat upright because this caused her belly to spill onto her thicker thighs. Next to her he saw his ex wife sleeping softly, and remembered how much they had been bonding over the fattening of Kandi, wanting nothing more than to continue it forever. Finally he stopped the annoying buzzing of his alarm clock, realizing grimly that its sound indicated it was time to go to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... Damn it\" He said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Aren't you happy to see me?\" Asked Kandi \"Cuz Alan Jr sure does\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. No of course I am\" Stammered Alan \"Very happy to see you, as you can see... but I have to get to stupid work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, that sucks\" She said, pouting in a way that made his heart flutter \"Well at least Judy can keep me company! She'll make sure I'll stay well fed, she's very adamant to get me big and fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Said Alan, stroking her soft belly tenderly \"I'll see you later okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan kissed her and rose reluctantly from the bed to get ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Alan had left Kandi drifted off back to sleep, snuggled up to her other lover Judith. When she awoke again she discovered she was alone in bed, and blinked in cute confusion. She also noticed this wasn't the only peculiar difference from when she'd awoken previously, as now she found that there was the end of a hose taped into her mouth. She looked up to see Judith holding a funnel which connected to the other end of the funnel, smiling evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oodee?\" Murmured Kandi quizzically through the hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepy head\" Said Judith brightly \"I figured we should start the day as we mean to go on... So, Bottoms up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh whah-glugluglug\" Kandi attempted to ask, but was cut off by the first weight gain milkshake Judith had prepared for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as poor Alan had to go to work, i thought it would be nice if we got you nice and fat for his return\" Said Judith \"Don't you agree?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gluglugluglugluglugg urpppp!\" Kandi responded \"Gluglugluggg!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith was really pushing the boat out today, as she had made ten large milkshakes for Kandi. She figured that she could handle it though, and if she kept up with this pace hopefully there would be noticeable results for when Alan returned. She was surprised how greedily Kandi gulped down the shakes, because it meant that she forced her to consume a whole one in little over a minute. In an impressively short amount of time all the milkshakes had found their way into Kandis ever growing belly, so Judith removed the funnel from her weary mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Hiccc\" Mumbled Kandi as she held her very bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that will do for now I think\" Said Judith, satisfied with her handiwork \"Your such a fat greedy girl aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp... Yes Judy I am\" Said Kandi wearily \"Can you rub my belly? Its sore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith smiled, grabbing a bottle of massage oil from the bedside table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll give you much more than a belly rub my sexy stuffed little beauty\" Judith purred, her lust showing in her eyes as she advanced on Kandi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started as a belly rub quickly lead to Kandi being stripped of her pajamas and underwear (which Judith noticed, with a spark of desire, were much more form fitting than they had one been) and being oiled up and massaged. Kandi didn't complain as Judith felt her up and down, massaging her sensitive and private areas and playing with her new body fat. It became apparent rather quickly as Judiths hands glided over Kandis perfect skin, that Kandi was enjoying this just as much as she was. Soon the two were engaged in a lustful embrace, which culminated in  cunninlingus in the 69 position. As the two Naked women lay panting there, Judith rolled over to Kandi so that her mouth was right by her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that built up your appetite my dear\" Said Judith \"Because now it's time we fed you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i only just ate Judy\" Replied Kandi in surprise \"I'm still a bit full\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's just too bad\" Replied Judith \"Just lay there and shut up... Let's see what we've got here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith opened the drawer on the bedside table, looking for hers and Alans junk food stash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, this will do for now...\" She said, removing five large packets of double stuffed chocolate Oreos from the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi sighed, sitting upright while taking a deep breath in preparation of what was to follow. The first packet was shoved into her mouth by the handful, and was followed by the funnel again and a liberal amount of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't have Oreos without milk now can you?\" Asked Judith gleefully as Kandi gulped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four packets of oreos followed the same pattern, each being emptied into her mouth before being washed down by a pint or two of full fat milk. Kandi lay spread eagled on the bed, groaning miserably again as the familiar uncomfortable feeling of fullness returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it were possible, throughout the day Judith stuffed Kandi at a relentless pace which exceeded the high standards she was already used to. Despite her increased appetite and stomach capacity Kandi had never felt so full and bloated, and most of the time all she could do was lie there moaning softly as her taut stomach gurgled away. The bright side was Judiths lust for her was seemingly insatiable, so there was plenty of sexual relief between each feeding. Kandi reached a giddy climax again and again, but still Judith just couldn't keep her hands off her and so the orgasms kept coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know if I hadn't been Charlies house keeper for so long, this stuff would really be crossing some kind of a line\" Said Berta as she walked past the two semi naked girls (since leaving the bedroom they had donned underwear at least), who were sat panting on the sofa after another heated sex session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Berta...\" Said Kandi wearily \"I guess we got carried away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I see that honey\" Said Berta \"It looks like you've got carried away in more ways than one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very obvious what Berta was referring to, as Alan and Judiths combined efforts to fatten up Kandi were really beginning to show results. Even though Kandis was very bloated, it still seemed soft and her underwear were clearly too small as her bra squished her breasts and her panties cut into her small love handles. Judith smiled happily to herself, happy that her words were not going unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little after 5.30 Alan returned home from work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooo?\" He said, finding the front room empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan is that you?\" Asked a voice he knew to be Judiths coming from the direction of his bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm yeah\" He responded \"Is everything okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you be the judge of that\" Replied Judith ominously \"Come here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan raised an eyebrow as he walked down the hallway to his bedroom and opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise\" Announced Judith happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlans jaw dropped to the ground at what he saw. Judith had dressed Kandi in a very revealing cheerleader uniform, one which prominently displayed her impressive new muffin top. The white cheerleader t-shirt just about covered her breasts, but looked extremely tight even doing that as there were stress lines and her nipples were clearly visible pressed against the fabric. She also wore an extremely skimpy tartan skirt with white stockings and her hair had been platted into pig tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" Said Alan finally, practically drooling at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you wait\" Said Judith \"Will our 156 pound cheer leader please perform the routine we practiced?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure Judith\" Answered Kandi dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a pair of pompoms from the bed and got ready to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5 6 7 8! This cheer leader is overweight!\" Kandi began shaking her pompoms and dancing around, which caused her buddha belly to bounce and jiggle hypnotically \"Ohhh Alan! I'm so fat! Bit im sure you already see that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bounced and jiggled and sang her self depricating song, Alan moved closer to Judith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Judith\" He said and they both shared a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Throughout that week Berta would seemingly walk in on a bizarre fetish tinged sex scene every other hour. Kandi was often bound and naked with the business end of a funnel in her mouth while Alan and Judith gleefully took it in turns to force feed her and feel up her expanding curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For crying out loud!\" Exclaimed Berta upon finding the three engaged in an incredibly heated sexual scene in the Laundry Room \"Is no where off limits to you freaks?! And why is she dressed like that... No actually I don't want to know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was referring to the bizarre skimpy baby outfit the perverted couple had dressed Kandi in. This included a silk bubble gum pink button up babies diaper, a pink frilly top with puffy shoulders and a bib which read \"I'm a big girl\" (this also stopped way above her navel leaving her Buddha belly visible bulging over the waistband of her diaper).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sorry Berta heh\" Said Alan nervously , trying to hide his 'excitement' \"I guess we got carried away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a big girl... Hiccurrrp\" Kandi said wearily and Judith pushed a babies pacifier into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush baby, the adults are talking\" Said Judith and Berta raised her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are really beginning to creep me out\" Said Berta \"And after working for your brother for so long is quite a statement... Just keep your sordid fetish crack in your bedroom, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh ok Berta\" Said Alan in his usual awkward tone \"Sorry about that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerta shook her head before leaving the trio in the laundry room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she's right?\" Asked Alan to Judith \"are we going too far with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alan...\" Said Judith, almost with pity \"Does this answer your question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith grabbed a baby's bottle from the side, which they had been using during this feeding rollplay, and removed the pacifier from Kandis mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink this you fat slut\" Judith ordered and Kandi let out a deep weary breath before complying and began sucking away at the fattening mixture inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kandi suckled away Judith undid the buttons on her silk diaper and pulled it open, exposing Kandis nether regions and began to perform cunninlynguss. Kandi gasped, but continued to suck away at her bottle as she felt Judith's tongue explore her clitoris while Alan watched with lustful excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... That definitely answers that\" Said Alan, more to himself than anybody else as he watched his ex wife eat out his girlfriend the chubby baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after a weighing which declared Kandi (still dressed as an adult baby) a healthy 160lbs, the trio retired to their room. Kandi lay spread eagled on the bed, sucking on her babies pacifier as her beautiful belly and ample breasts rose and fell with each layered breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you didn't lose your appetite for this\" Said Judith as she seductively kissed Alan \"Because this little piggie certainly hasn't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Urrpppp!!\" Exclaimed Kandi, almost on cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTried as he might Alan just could not control his lust, a fact which would have worried him if not for the fact he was living one of his deepest darkest fantasies. He wondered vaguely how exactly he was to live a normal adult life with this becoming a more and more central part of it, as he loosened his robe and joined his ex wife and stuffed girlfriend in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan awoke the next morning as the sound of his bedside alarm went off. He turned it off and rolled over where he found his gorgeous girlfriend snoozing, still dressed in her adult baby costume. He hugged her close, feeling her distended belly flab squish between his fingers slightly as he did so and in that moment decided to give work a miss for the day. He knew things couldn't go on this way, but he was hopelessly addicted to his new sordid life. He wondered how Charlie was able to do it, wishing that he had a hidden talent which would earn him the money needed to continue this life while simultaneously requiring little time or effort. While pondering these important issues Judith also awoke, after having slept with her head resting on Kandis ever growing bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Jud...\" Began Alan, but was shushed by his ex wife, who indicated the portly figure of their still slumbering feedee slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith slowly reached over to her bedside cabinet and removed 8 weight gain shakes and a funnel, before crawling carefully onto Kandi. She positioned herself so she was knelt with her knees either side of Kandis wide abdomen and held the funnel aloft while grinning maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssst!\" She said sharply causing Kandi to start and slowly open her eyes \"Wakey Wakey fatass, it's breakfast time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ju- Judy?\" Stammered Kandi sleepily, not really grasping the situation \"Glumphhh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh\" Responded Judith condescendingly as she pushed the business end of the funnel into the poor girls mouth \"Shut up tubby, it's feeding time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi blinked in groggy misery just as the first milkshake was tipped down the funnel and she was forced to glug it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kandi lay panting, spread eagled on the bed after she swallowed the lady mouthful of weight gain shake and giving a feeble burp. After watching he taut, gurgling belly rise and fall for a minute Alan turned his attention to Judith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of... Giving work a miss today\" He said \"But I think we need to talk about a few things... Namely how we can keep this up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Said Judith \"We need a little extra money... Our girl loves to eat and food is running a little low\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith patted Kandis belly which caused her to groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they decide to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It sounded weird. .. yet intriguing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heh yeah...\" Said Alan feeling oddly proud of his accomplishments \"it can get a little crazy sometimes... in fact thats what I wanted to talk to you about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on\" Said Charlie taking a sip of scotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... well... \" Said Alan trying to find the right words to cover his bizarre predicament \"It turns out living this lifestyle isn't as simple as I'd thought... I dont think i gave you enough credit for being able to do it so long... I need money it seems heh so I was wondering if you'd like to sponsor the cause?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well technically I've been sponsoring your cause for 3 years now\" Said Charlie \"But Im sure we could come to some sort of... arrangement\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on\" Said Alan, mimicking his brothers initial response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look at this\" Said Charlie, reaching behind his chair to grab what appeared to be a calender which he then passed to Alan \"It should be self explanatory\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan looked at it in disbelief, seeing a weekly schedule for his girlfriend already filled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you...?\" Began Alan, realising how strange this development was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know you'd come to me?\" Charlie finished \"Well three main reasons; 1) I know sex addiction when I see it 2) you haven't been to work for awhile so you must be broke as hell and 3) who else are you going to ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errm\" Said Alan, thinking over his brothers reasons \"hmm... yes that is all accurate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe examined the document more closely, seeing that Friday was marked \"Charlie time\" And Monday was marked \"Kandi Work\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I can guess what Charlie time refers to\" Said Alan \"But what's 'Kandi Work' exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just a solution to your cash flow problem\" Said Charlie \"I know a film director who works in the.... adult sector, that I briefed about your situation. He happens to think that there's a lot of money in this particular market... so one day a week she can go do some filming and boom, money problem solved\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats.... brilliant\" Said Alan slowly \"Thats the best idea I've ever heard... ill just run this by Judith but I really think this could be a game changer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak later\" Said Charlie looking satisfied and taking a swig of scotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan returned to his room and walked in on quite an interesting scene between his ex wife and girlfriend. Both were naked and Judith was desperately rubbing her bare loins against the stunning young feedee, while simultaneously stuffing her silly with doughnuts. Kandi squeaked and squealed between mouthfuls of the sugary pastries as she dry humped to an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnhhh! That's right you fat pig\" Moaned Judith as she relentlessly fed the poor girl was grinding her \"Ooooo... stupid fat bimbo... oh yeahhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan stood and watched for awhile, enjoying the sight as the room filled with the sounds of heavy breathing and squeals of sexual delight. Kandis glazed eyes fixed on his own, a donut poking from her fatigued lips which was soon pushed in to her mouth, as she panted and whimpered on the verge of orgasm. Shrill squeals of pleasure, which increased in pitch and volume, echoed around the room as the naked pair both reached a climax together. Judith lay panting on the naked stuffed bimbo beneath her, who in turn groaned and moaned softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy that?\" Asked Joy suddenly without turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... um... yes... yes I did\" Replied Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be go again in a little bit if you want a turn\" Said Judith casually,  climbing off Kandi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrarrp!\" Kandi exclaimed suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh sure... this is a celebration after all\" Said Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Said Judith with a smile \" What did your brother say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... he was all for it\" Said Alan trying to find a diplomatic approach to voicing Charlies rather sordid condition \"He'll let us stay here rent free... and um kind of fund this whole thing... sort of\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Judie (who was still naked) the new schedule for Kandi and she raised an eye brow at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie time?!\" She read out incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for one day\" Said Alan reassuringly \"The rest of the time we'll have her to ourselves... well apart from when she's filming... um... movies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filming movies?\" Asked Judith with a raised eyebrow and Alan explained the whole sordid scheme to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" She said finally \"Charlie can have his day... if we are able to be her Agents during her new.... acting... career\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Said Alan clearly happy to not have to work anymore \"Shall we share the good news with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your very welcome to try\" Replied his naked ex wife, stepping to the side to show Kandi laying spread eagled on the bed snoring softly, her bloated dome of a tummy gurgling as it rose and fell with each breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess she's had a tiring morning\" Said Alan, in awe at the sight of his ever expanding girlfriend \"Lets let her sleep awhile\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi slumbered, unaware that her fate was being decided as she did... her new interesting life awaiting her when she awoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith managed to leave Kandi alone for a little over half an hour, though during this time she just couldn't take her eyes off the slumbering beauty. The gorgeous young glutton weighed 167 at this point, and considering how perfectly slim she'd always been, it was really becoming noticeable. Judith was almost salivating as she took in her curves, her larger rear end and breasts, her pot belly which was becoming more prominent. When Alan went to the bathroom she could contain herself no longer, and pulled up the duvet to climb inside right at the foot of the bed. Kandis snores became more drawn out her breathing sounding deeper as she felt her lovers tongue and warm breath down below. She began to moan, offering the odd squeal as the feelings of pleasure built and built while she continued to sleep. Alan re-entered the room and frowned at the sight, knowing immediately what Judith was up to under the duvet and feeling a bit left out. Kandi breathed heavier and heavier, her moans and squeals of pleasure going up a few octaves as she approached on her second orgasm of the morning. Alan had intended to interject and  say something but the moment passed and he lifted up the duvet to watch his ex wife in the shameful act. Judith was so into pleasuring the slightly chunky bimbo that she didn't react in the slightest to be being uncovered. Kandi let out a long moan followed by a loud squeal, indicating a strong climax. Panting, Kandi opened her eyes, looking very aroused from her sexual wake up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lasted a whole 30 minutes\" Said Alan as Judith pulled herself away from the <br>\r\nnaked goddess's loins \" I'm impressed\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she'd earn the a bit of a treat\" Said Judith, finally daining to get dressed \"We've been pushing the poor girl quite hard lately... and thats only going to intensify now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... speaking of which\" Said Alan as Kandi stared out them both, clearly still in a sexual haze and not paying attention \"Maybe we should have a talk about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Alan watched on happily for a minute before shrugging and joining his ex wife on the bed to feed the ever expanding bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they left the pair decided to dress Kandi in an outfit which would please the sleazy director they were about to visit. They decided on one which was actually one of her own, that being a Playboy bunny outfit which had no doubt seen use in the past. The outfit consisted of black glittery bunny ears, with a matching black corset and hot pants with leather boots and white cufflinks and dickie bow. Alan and Judith laughed between themselves as they watched how much difficulty Kandi was having putting on the beyond tight outfit, which would have been unbelievably sexy on her 40 or so pounds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um guys... I think like my outfit is faulty or something\" She said dumbly as she tried to pull her corset closed with difficulty \"I just cant seem to-huff- close it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its because your too fat my pet\" Said Judith, forcing another donut into the poor girls mouth before embracing her with an open mouthed kiss once swallowed \"Let me help you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urkk! Mrrrff!\" Exclaimed Kandi as Judith managed to pull the insanely tight black corset shut whilst also stuffing another donut down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan tutted as he watched his ex wifes hand immediently dart to the chunky bunny girls crotch and using it to pull her closer as she continued to feed her donuts. He gave her enough time to cram five more Krispy Kremes into her belly while stroking her crotch before clearing his throat to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... but we have a job at hand\" He said, smirking at the look of bleary eyed arousal on the curvy bunny girls face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, just cant help myself sometimes\" Said Judith, her glee of the situation very obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know I know...\" Said Alan, clearly salivating at the sight of her \"Let's just get her to my car... I have a feeling this will be a nice day out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan drove, which left Judith to have fun with her sex slave in the back seat, something which he was abit jealous of. Kandi was laid down across the seat, while Judith lay on top dry humping and feeding the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm try not to get any... thing on the seat dear\" Alan called back awkwardly, clearly unhappy on missing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhnnn sorry... I just cant uhnnn help myself\" Replied Judith as she grinded on the chunky playboy bunny girl \"Ohhh yeahhhh uhnnn keep you eating you stupid fat slut... uhhhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhgluurrpp hiccc murrrfff uhnnnurrrp\" Burbled Kandi in between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls reached an ear splitting climax just as Alan pulled into the parking lot of the sleazy movie studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well were here\" Annouced Alan to the two panting girls \"I hope our little chubby bunny girl has more left in the tank...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi was pulled to her feet by Alan, and with some difficulty (due to how full she was, and having climaxed twice already that day) was walked over to the movie studio. Inside they met up with Charlie's director friend, a predictably sleazy looking individual by the name of Kurt Orgasm (it had to be a pseudonym thought Alan).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh so this is the aspiring actress I've been hearing so much about\" Said Kurt, turning to Kandi and learing at her thick young body squeezed into her sexy outfit \"Wow, someone's getting a little chunky aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp yes sir\" Said Kandi lathargically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get you to the set\" He said \"Waddle yourself this way fatass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi did as she was told, not reacting to the insult from a complete stranger. Her ill fitted playboy bunny costume squeaked and creaked as she walked, her ever thickening frame constantly resting its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Was that real? Why was she so attracted to Kanid\u00b4s big belly? She actually wanted to get her fat to freak Alan out but now it felt like she was going to create herself a lover... Was that maybe the reason why she had thought about fattening Kandi up? Was it about her love for big bellies right from the start? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudith was mazed in mix of questions and lust... the latter one got fired up even more by Kandi\u00b4s moans the young bimbo displayed to show her appreciation for Judith\u00b4s rubbing qualities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kandi...

Okay there was Lindsay but being totally honest it was an on-and-off-relationship that would make Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson jealous about its twists... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan\u00b4s blood boiled but all this jokes and puns Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Harper displayed weren\u00b4t the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact Alan\u00dfs time in the house of his older brother was limited and lcose to expire. Charlie had been too serious about the matter when talking to Alan and of course there was the influence of Rose as well. So in just little more than 20 days Alan would be faced to leave to house being a homeless, love-lacking guy with little success in his job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that recent discussion with Lindsay that took a bad turn Alan was sure that she would not give him a roof for severral nights this time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tight situation... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and Alan was desperate enough to play dirty this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had thought well about it and if there was one weakness in Charlie\u00b4s life that could crash his marriage to pieces it was his former fiancee Chelsea... if she could awake the feeling inside Charlie again then, Alan was sure about that, he would try to hunt her down and attract ther hate of Rose doing it... which would end in a divorce... and more important to Alan a depressed Charlie that would appreciate some mental support by his younger brother Alan... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger of the Harper brothers knew that Chelsea wasn\u00b4t into dirty games at all so he had actually lied at her telling her Rose would behave scary sometimes and that Charlie\u00b4s sanity if not life might be on the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their break-up Chelsea still had feelings for Charlie... but not in the way of a love relation. If Charlie Harper had been another type of man they might have remined friends... but the man Charlie was... that was impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan hadn\u00b4t seen Chelsea in a time since the break up... maybe they exchanged some phone-calls here and there but didn\u00b4t talk about many things or in-deep details in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the last time Alan had talked to Chelsea before making the appointment with her was about 3 months ago when Chelsea told him her relationship to the lawyer she left Charlie for was over. Not that there was any bad blood but it just didn\u00b4t work out the good way and both parted way in a friendly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh... okay... here it is... Alan thought... finding the pub Chelsea asked him to meet inside. It looked like it had seen better times before and under other circumstances Alan would never have stepped inside but like said before certain situations need dirty plays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan carefully walked into the pub... Seemed like the smoking law had not made it inside this little facility as well as Alan could see ashtrays around that looked used and several people smoked cigarettes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where\u00b4s Chelsea? Alan asked himself while looking around... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half a minute of searching for Chelsea (the smoke around didn\u00b4t help much to find her) Alan\u00b4s eyes found its target and it felt to him like his jaw would drop to the floor like in a Tom&amp;Jerry-cartoon... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan lloked another time... No, it was no Fata Morgana... it really was Chelsea and she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) she was still slim but smoked a cigarette at the bar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) has grown a beer gut that make her looks 4-5 months pregnant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The surprise came in the form of a hypnosis tape she had recorded, which she planned to make Lydia listen to as she slept. The goal was that the tape would implant ideas and compulsions into Lydia\u2019s sleeping mind without her knowledge, which in turn would allow Berta full rain to do whatever she pleased with the helpless young blond. Berta carefully crept to the bed where the sleeping pair lay, aware of where each creaky floorboard was located, and carefully placed the headphones over Lydia\u2019s ears. Berta\u2019s heart froze as Lydia stirred but breathed a sigh of relief when she merely scratched her dainty nose and rolled over. Berta smiled triumphantly as she pressed play on the tape recorder and slowly crept back out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou drove me to this you boney bitch\u201d She said to herself as she pulled Charlie\u2019s door to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon the sound of Berta\u2019s recorded message met Lydia\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Lydia\u201d Berta\u2019s voice began, \u201cFrom this moment forth you will be completely under my control. Though you will not understand why, you will henceforth be compelled to obey everything I say. For you see my dear from this point on your going to start getting fat\u2026 Really really fat as a matter of fact. You are going to gorge and gorge until you can no longer move, and what is more your not even going to realize it\u2019s happening to you. As each pound is added to your frame you will not notice, you will continue to believe that your body is perfect, regardless of what anybody else says to you. No matter what happens or what process I decide to use to fatten you up you will completely forget about it as soon as it\u2019s happened. You will not enjoy these moments but you will also be powerless to prevent them. From now on the sound of my voice will have an inescapable, dominating effect over you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message continued long into the night while Lydia slept soundly, unaware of the horrors that lay ahead for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She was wearing her bright orange realtor suit jacket and smart skirt, and she was feeling especially confident of making a sale. She was about to leave when she heard Berta speaking to her from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey slim\u201d Said Berta without a hint of friendliness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey yourself\u201d Lydia replied with a smile, \u201cI noticed you didn\u2019t wash my clothes\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if the request was a little advanced for you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerta merely smiled back without saying a word; the look on her face was rather unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this has been great\u201d Said Lydia, \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop\u201d Said Berta as Lydia was just about to exit the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Berta\u2019s voice seemed to echo through Lydia\u2019s head and reverberate around her entire body. Lydia stopped in her tracks, the usual look of condescending amusement leaving her face to be replaced by that of confusion and concern as her feet remained rooted to the spot. Lydia tried to remain calm, not wanting to show any weakness to Berta so she put her hands defiantly on her hips to make it seem like she\u2019d stopped on her own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Said Lydia, trying to sound bored and uninterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn around\u201d Ordered Berta and once again Lydia was unable to stop herself and turned around to face Berta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of concern and worry was hiding just beneath Lydia\u2019s confident front, though it could be seen in Lydia's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Said Lydia, her voice wavering very slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo the robot\u201d Ordered Berta with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia tried with all her might to fight the compulsion to obey, but was once more unable to stop herself. Berta hooted with laughter at the ridiculous sight of the once so proud Lydia making a complete fool of herself by doing a rather poor robot dance. Lydia went red in the face through embarrassment, but still tried to maintain her usual confident demeanor which was fading fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my\u2026 Alan could do better than that\u201d Said Berta, sounding tired from laughing so hard, \u201cDo jumping jacks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Said Lydia as she vigorously began doing jumping jacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was still trying to sound bored and unfazed though her voice was trembling now and Berta noticed it with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m having fun with you\u201d Said Berta, \u201cAnd believe me, the funs only just begun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next? </span></div></div>",

She was slightly red in the face and grumpily blew her fringe from her face as it had flopped over it due to her exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 going\u2026 on\u2026?\u201d Lydia managed to say through each heavy breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me to the kitchen\u201d Berta said simply and walked away from Lydia, who obediently followed in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lydia entered the kitchen her eyes widened at what she saw, for laid on the kitchen table was a breakfast buffet fit for at least 4 people. Despite the strange predicament she found herself in, Lydia couldn\u2019t help but think of a subtle barb for this latest strange occurrence in her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Berta\u201d Said Lydia, the familiar tone of condescension once again noticeable in her voice, \u201cUnless my eyes deceive me, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve actually done your job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerta merely smiled at this, knowing that soon Lydia was going to regret every sly barb she had ever uttered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I thought you were looking more like a boney bitch than ever today\u2026\u201d Said Berta, \u201c\u2026 so thought you could use a nice fattening breakfast\u2026 Eat it all up now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia once again tried to fight the compulsion to obey the order, but her body operated without her permission. She looked at the huge feast in horror as she sat down, picked up a fork and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious\u2026\u201d Lydia said incredulously, before she cut off her own speech by cramming in a large mouthful of fried bread and sausage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerta watched with satisfaction as the sharp tongued blond beauty slowly stuffed her face with the incredibly greasy breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t eat all this\u2026 MRRF\u201d Lydia complained before cramming in another fattening mouthful, the tone in her voice showing that she was definitely beginning to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Lydia spoke her hand was working completely independently to her brain and continued to shovel in forkful after forkful of the unhealthy feast. Lydia tried to keep her mouth shut to block the path of the food, but her mouth also seemed to act completely separately to her mind as it greedily chewed and swallowed each mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as you must of guessed already, that isn\u2019t your choice to make\u201d Berta said, smiling maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia looked really worried now, her calm demeanour fading as she stuffed herself with each mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... Are... You... Doing... This?\" Lydia managed to say through each mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now Lydia\" Said Berta in a condescending tone whilst stroking her head, \u201cDo you really need to ask that question? Now, eat faster and no more talking\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia miserably obeyed and began to speed up her eating considerably. Lydia was now stuffing her face at an incredible rate, using both her hands to cram as much into her greedy mouth as possible. To the impartial observer it looked like Lydia hadn\u2019t eaten for weeks, but her eyes gave away her true feelings as there was a look of miserable defeat present in them. Berta was thoroughly enjoying watching the once so proud and arrogant young woman completely humiliate herself in front of her, stuffing her face like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow slim\u201d Said Berta, \u201cYou really eat like a pig, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia grunted a response through a large mouthful of fried egg and bacon, unable to speak properly due to the speed she was eating. After about 10 minutes of furious eating, the magnitude of what she had consumed began to catch up with Lydia as she now felt rather full indeed. She could feel that her stomach had begun to bloat outward, and it was currently making the bottom buttons of her orange realtor blazer strain slightly. Despite the fact that she was definitely beginning to a hit a food wall however, her pace didn\u2019t slow at all and she continued to cram the food in at a remarkable pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After about ten minutes she finally reached the half way point of the gigantic meal (which would have been enough for two people) and was now feeling incredibly full. She groaned miserably as her hands continued to work of their own accord and shoveled even more food into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor such a boney bitch you sure can put it away\u201d Said Berta, sounding genuinely impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia groggily raised her head and glared at Berta, though due to her tiredness the look lacked the venom she had intended. Her bloated stomach was feeling painfully restricted as it pushed tightly against her orange suit and was emitting sounds of mournful protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop using your hands\u201d Ordered Berta, having immense fun in mixing up Lydia\u2019s humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia mournfully obeyed, folding her arms behind her back and proceeded to plunge her face into the meal, consuming it with the same amount of speed she had before only now minus her hands. All that could be heard were muffled snorts and grunts as Lydia gorged herself like a pig, and laughter from Berta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGadzooks\u201d Said Berta happily, \u201cThis is even more fun than I thought it would be\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOHHMSH OHHMSH MRRRFSHH \u2013Urp!-\u201d Came Lydia\u2019s piggish noises, which seemed to please Berta even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt this rate you\u2019ll be an even higher weight class than me in no time!\u201d Said Berta, \u201cHow does it make you feel?

Her eyes were watering from the exertion of eating so much, coupled with how full she now felt. Lydia had never felt so full in her entire life, but despite this she continued to stuff herself like she hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks. Her stomach had bloated out comically from the sheer amount she had consumed, and to the casual observer it looked as if she were some 8 months pregnant. Her blazer obviously had very little give (as did her skirt) as her belly was straining the buttons rather substantially. Berta seemed to notice this obvious bulge (made even more obvious due to the fact she was leant forwards) and poked it, which made Lydia moan and squirm in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck, that\u2019s a hell of a food baby you got there\u201d Commented Berta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia\u2019s only response was a few muffled grunts as she worked her way through the final part of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think it\u2019s about time I made my leave\u2026\u201d Said Berta casually, \u201cBut before I go, here\u2019s one more thing\u2026 Every time anybody mentions food, or you see anything even slightly relating to food today you will be unable to stop yourself from eating more. You won\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing it, and as soon as you\u2019ve finished eating you\u2019ll forget it\u2019s happened. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia raised her head groggily and looked at Berta, with food all over her face. She was panting from her stuffing, but even so she miserably nodded her head and then went right back to stuffing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d Said Berta, \u201cYou have a great day now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerta then left Lydia, who was still face down in her breakfast munching away. After 5 minutes Lydia finally finished the last piece of food on her plate and collapsed back into her chair, breathing heavily and groaning as she rubbed her ridiculously rotund and taut stomach. As soon as she did this however her mind suddenly reset, erasing everything that had happened for the past half an hour. Lydia looked around groggily in confusion, still rubbing her incredibly sore stomach as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026?\u201d She mumbled to herself, still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined her bloated midsection, which was still gurgling and then undid the straining buttons of her blazer which allowed it more room to breath (she let out satisfied gasp as her stomach surged into the new free space she had allowed for it). Lydia was going to continue questioning the strange situation she found herself in, but then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t understand what had happened, as she had no memory of her altercation with Berta at all. She rubbed her tummy absent mindedly, which was still rather bloated from the enormous breakfast she had eaten earlier and she frowned to herself. She redid the buttons on her blazer, as her stomach would now allow it though it still felt tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d She said as she felt it, tightly squeezed as it was by her blazer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have long to dwell on it however because as she was going through her phone she discovered she had received a text message from a number she didn\u2019t recognize, which she curiously opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was actually off Berta, who had secretly obtained her number the day before and it simply read \u201cDonuts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia frowned at the message, confused about what its actual meaning was but it wasn\u2019t long before a strange feeling came over her. She was getting a sudden craving for donuts, which gradually grew more and more uncontrollable by the second until she was almost drooling at the thought of them. Pretty soon she was desperate to satisfy the craving and any impulse of free will she had against it evaporated. She looked out the window and saw to her relief that she was actually approaching a \u2018Dunkin Donuts\u2019. She pulled into the car park and got out her car, entering the shop eagerly. The shop was empty, which appeased Lydia as she approached the counter immediately where a kind faced man stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u201d He said brightly, smiling friendlily at Lydia, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia did not return the mans friendliness and fixed him with one of her trademark patronizing looks as she looked him up and down. She was about to offer one of her usual subtle barbs about the fact he was working in a donut shop, but a sudden stab of hunger pain pulled her mind back to the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me your biggest box of donuts\u2026 Quickly!\u201d She ordered, her desperate tone causing the man to frown slightly but he complied nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handed her a large box, which contained some 25 donuts and Lydia threw her money down on the counter without another word and left the shop without even bothering to get her change. Lydia\u2019s eyes widened in greedy excitement as she opened the large box and saw the large selection of tasty treats inside it. She had already consumed 2 of the rather large donuts before she had even reached her car, cramming them in without any regard to how she looked to passers by. She then got into her car and the pig out truly began. Lydia ate like a woman possessed (which in some ways she was), her mind completely clear of anything else except the need to stuff her face as much as possible. She crammed in donut after donut, getting jam and crumbs around her mouth as she did so. By the tenth donut she had to undo the bottom buttons on her realtor blazer, as her growing stomach was causing it tighten uncomfortably. Within 20 minutes she crammed the last donut into her mouth and let out a large \u2013BURP!-, collapsing wearily into her seat. She groaned as she rubbed her incredibly full tummy, which had bloated once more to more than double its original size and was emitting mournful groaning noises. As she sat moaning in discomfort her mind once more wiped itself, leaving her confused to what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026 -urp!-\u201c She said wearily to herself, before she looked at her watch and almost jumped out of her seat at how late she now was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! Hic!\u201d She exclaimed, still feeling groggy as she hastily started her car again and sped off in the direction of down town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To Lydia\u2019s surprise the house viewing actually went pretty well, considering how late she was. Of course when she had initially arrived the prospective owners (a young couple) were obviously rather annoyed at being kept waiting, but Lydia managed to appease them by apologizing profusely. Lydia believed that it was her \u2018winning personality\u2019 that had done it, but little did she know it was actually the sight of her bloated, food stuffed belly, which the couple had mistook as the early signs of pregnancy (rather than Lydia\u2019s gluttony), that had gained their understanding. Lydia slumped on the sofa feeling very self satisfied indeed, content in the knowledge that she was definitely the best realtor in the city. As she sat there mentally congratulating herself her stomach started making low gurgling noises and she frowned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u201d She said thoughtfully, \u201cI guess I was in such a hurry I didn\u2019t eat breakfast this morning\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying the word \u201cbreakfast\u201d a familiar feeling suddenly rippled throughout Lydia\u2019s body (or it would have been a familiar feeling if she had remembered it happening). She felt a savage stab of hunger and groaned as she grabbed her stomach (which was no longer that bloated) and lent forward in discomfort. Like a woman possessed Lydia jumped to her feet and darted quickly to the kitchen (or at least as quickly as her grumbling stomach would permit). She rummaged through all the cupboards and the fridge, but too her annoyance they were all completely bare. Lydia was desperate for food and felt an almost animalistic urge to stuff herself as much as physically possible. Upon going through one of the cabinet drawers Lydia discovered a flier/ menu for a local pizza place and immediately grabbed the phone to call them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on come on!\u201d Lydia said impatiently as the phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia paced back and forth with a rather mad look on her face until finally somebody answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, hello\u201d Said Lydia haughtily, \u201cGive me 3 large pizzas with everything on them!... No wait!! Make that 5 pizzas\u2026 Extra large! With a bag of brownies, 5 milkshakes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man on the other end of the phone had his work cut out for him as Lydia, her voice high and crazy sounding, quickly listed more and more food to add to her order. When she had finally finished she gave the address of the house and hung up. After about 20 minutes of waiting, in which time turned Lydia had become an even more food crazed maniac, there was a knock at the door and Lydia sprinted to it and opened it. A small Asian man stood on the doorstep, his face completely hidden from view by the pile of pizza boxes and bags he was carrying. Lydia grabbed it off him without a word, threw a handful of notes at him and slammed the door in his face. She then rushed to the dining room table and sat down, throwing down her spoils in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh yeahh\u201d She said to herself as she opened the first huge pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a massive slice of the multi topped pizza and stuffed it greedily into her mouth, moaning happily as she wolfed it down. Despite the size of the slice Lydia disposed of it quickly, and after a couple of minutes she grabbed her next. She ate like a woman possessed, though she made a special effort to stop any food landing on her incredibly expensive blazer and skirt. After ten minutes Lydia had already finished one of the enormous pizzas and proceeded to drink an entire milkshake in one never ending slurp. Her stomach was starting to bloat out once more, and when she finished her milkshake she used her one hand to undo the tight buttons of her blazer and the other to stuff a brownie into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Upon finishing the final one she let out a large &lt;BURP!&gt; which she made no attempt to hide and the top button popped off the top of her realtor skirt. The button soared past Brads head, causing him to suddenly duck in panic as it nearly hit him. Brad continued to stare at the gluttonous beauty for a few more moments as she grabbed a large pizza box, opened it and started cramming the contents of that into her mouth as well. With an awkward cough and incline of the head he backed off through the front door without uttering another word, leaving Lydia to stuff her face. Lydia didn\u2019t even seem to notice that he\u2019d left and she continued to eat like her life depended on it. Lydia was feeling incredibly full now, but even so she found it impossible to stop herself eating and she had taken to using  milkshakes to aide her swallowing. After a few hours of none stop face stuffing Lydia forced herself to swallow the final bite of pizza and collapsed panting into the sofa, her eyes glazed from fatigue. She sat in a complete food coma, her discomfort obvious as she gently stroked her incredibly full tummy and groaned. There she sat, groaning softly for a further ten minutes as her stomach slowly worked on digesting the immense amount of food she had consumed. She finally snapped out of her coma, and let out a startled exclamation as she looked down and noticed her still bloated midsection. Though it had reduced an inch or so it still looked like Lydia was approaching almost 7 months pregnancy, and sight of it had shocked her as once again she had no memory of her incredible food binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026?\u201d She said finally, her eyes still slightly glazed from her fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith slight difficulty Lydia hauled herself unsteadily to her feet, letting a small burp as she did so. This exertion in turn caused her skirt bottom to fall down (the lack of a top bottom preventing them from staying up) which revealed Lydia\u2019s tight ass adorned in frilly pink panties to the world. It was at this exact moment that Lydia\u2019s boss decided to return to the house. He stood transfixed at the sight for a few moments, looking at Lydia\u2019s smooth, slender legs and frilly panties with some interest until his eyes came to a stop above her waistband. Lydia blushed deeply as she saw her bosses eyes fixated on her bloated belly, which bulged out over the waistband of her underwear, and attempted to hide it by re-buttoning her blazer (which of course didn\u2019t work at all).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm\u2026 So your still here then?\u201d Said Brad finally, breaking the excruciating silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Yeah\u2026 Hic!\u201d She responded, at a complete loss for words perhaps for the first moment in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped trying to rebutton her blazes over her bloated belly and the look of embarrassment left her immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you having?\" She asked, trying to keep her voice steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad swallowed nervously before he spoke, \"Mcdonalds i think\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming with you\" Lydia blurted out, unable to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was still in so much shock from all the bizarre things he had witnessed thus far that he didn't even consider denying her, and meekly agreed. Lydia followed him from the house to his black Mercedes, which was parked on the curb directly outside the house. Lydia was becoming more and more mad with hunger with each passing second, even though she still felt rather full from her last binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What food do you have on you?\" Asked Lydia, completely overpowered by her food cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... I think there may be something under your seat\" Replied Brad nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia practically dived under her seat, and retrieved a large bag of dorritos which she immediately tore into without a word of thanks. The rest of the car journey was spent in silence, which suited both passengers fine, the only sound being munching and the odd burp coming from Lydia as she greedily stuffed her face. As Brad pulled the car into the Mcdonalds car park Lydia was tipping the remaining crumbs into her mouth, tossing the scrunched up wrapper over her shoulder carelessly. The two left the vehicle and approached the restaurant, Lydia waddling as quickly as her taut tummy would allow. She hoisted up her dress as she entered as once again it had begun to slowly inch its way down her legs and expose her panties. Lydia shoved her way to the front of queue of waiting people and made her order with such desperate aggression that nobody argued. Lydia made her order with such speed that the poor girl who served her had to constantly ask her to repeat herself, which Lydia responded to with her trademark biting sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, do you even speak English?\" She asked scornfully, \"It feels like I'm talking to a primate. I want two of those, five of those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the amount Lydia had ordered her food arrived to her at different times, so she merely stood at the counter and devoured each part in turn. First she wolfed down two boxes of chicken nuggets in under a minute, barely stopping for breath before she next tore into a Big Mac. Brad was now not alone as he stood staring at the gluttonous beauty, as soon other patrons took notice of her extraordinary eating speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

His mouth hung agape at what he saw, much like the majority of the clientele in the restaurant and for a while he and Jake stood in silence. If it wasn\u2019t enough that Lydia was still stuffing her face at a furious speed, she had also neglected to keep a hold on her unbuttoned skirt. This meant that it had slowly slid down her slender legs completely exposing her black lace panties to everybody present (Jake especially couldn\u2019t help staring at this). The only sound that could be heard was a steady munching and moaning coming from Lydia as she demolished each order that was delivered to her. Her stomach was obviously swollen and rotund, tight as drum due to the sheer amount she had consumed in the day. As she made short work of the final burger Lydia let out long low burp, before staggering over to a nearby chair and collapsing (almost tripping over her skirt in the process). She looked exhausted and was breathing heavily, groaning as she rubbed her full tummy (which was about the size of a basketball). As she sat she slowly regained her senses, previous events absconded from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Lydia?\u201d Said Alan, who had now approached her, \u201cAre you\u2026 Um\u2026 Feeling alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d Said Lydia, forcing a smile, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 For one thing, your sort of half naked in a McDonalds restaurant\u201d He explained as tactfully as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia\u2019s eyes dropped to her bare legs, blushing angrily as she pulled them back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t very good at hiding how much you want me you know\u201d She said hotly to Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown crossed Lydia\u2019s brow as she attempted, but completely failed to button the top button of her skirt. She also tried her blazer buttons, but once again she found she couldn\u2019t even get the buttons close to their corresponding holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve eaten too much to button up\u201d Said Jake tactlessly, \u201cI know how that goes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh how quaint\u201d Responded Lydia condescendingly, \u201cA lesson about eating too much from this deadbeats fat, underachieving son\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The incredible amount of calories that she had ingested were being transferred around her body as newly added fat, and her underwear slowly felt tighter from the added poundage. As she unconsciously felt the tightening fabric on her body her dreams changed to incorporate this new feeling; a feeling she actually enjoyed. A dream of ruling the Malibu property market suddenly morphed into one where she was sat at a large wooden table. The table was piled high with food and she suddenly felt a pang of what could only be described as a combination of uncontrollable hunger and sexual desire. Looking down at herself she discovered to her growing sexual arousal that she was sat in her sexiest black underwear. She also noticed with a raised eyebrow that her frame was undeniably larger than it was in reality, with her large breasts barely being contained by her bra and a new pudgy gut spilling onto her thicker thighs. She stroked her new belly, feeling how real her silky flesh felt and bit her loaned as she moaned. She closed her eyes as one of her hands slowly crept its way down her belly and into her panties as her other hand reached for the pile of food. She greedily started simultaneously stuffing food into her mouth (at a speed not possible in reality) and frantically stroking her clitoris. She ate and ate and her body grew and grew. Meanwhile in the real world Lydia had risen from bed and sleep walked downstairs to the kitchen. The kitchen had been generously stocked with the most fattening treats imaginable (by Berta of course) and Lydia now tore into these with gusto. As she stuffed herself silly her other hand was down her panties furiously masturbating. She moaned and groaned in pleasure from the combined feeling of stuffing her greedy face and fingering herself. Her slight pot belly slowly ballooned as she greedily crammed more food into her gluttonous mouth and she arched her back as she slowly built to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

She looked down at the box and sighed, only a few left. On the table in front of her was a near-finished bag of donuts, next to a couple of candy bars, and she ripped the top off a Snickers and started to eat it, trying to eke it out. The soap opera she'd been watching was coming to an end, the two women finishing up their catfight as the credits began to roll. Finishing the bar, she tossed the wrapper into the bag by her feet, then looked across at her phone, wondering about ordering a pizza. She reached into her purse, and shook her head. Nothing but a lottery ticket she'd bought when she went to buy her snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, the news was next, some boring reporter talking about local district rezoning. She reached for the last donut, jam running down her chin before she could stop it with the napkin, scooping the fruity, sugary goo back into her mouth. The last of the chocolates followed, and she reached for the single remaining bag of crisps, stuffing them into her mouth as the broadcast went off to the weather. Slumping back on the couch as she finished off the last of her snacks, she could feel her eyes beginning to close, the dull, droning sound sending her to sleep, crumbs crunching down to the floor as she lay back. As she began to doze off, she distantly made out something about the lottery results, something about a maximum mega-million payout...</span></div></div>",

Instantly, she reached forward, stuffing a burger into her mouth, the ketchup dribbling down her chin, then reaching for a slice of pizza. She couldn't get enough, and her hands snatched more morsels from the table. She looked away for a second, and when she looked back, a huge bowl of fries was next to the burgers, and she started to grab handfuls, stuffing them in her mouth, gasping for breath in between bites of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she at her fifth burger, she realized that she was still hungry, just as much as when she started, but she could feel a slight pain from her stomach. She looked down, and realized that the buttons from her top were beginning to dig into her belly, soft flab trying to work its way through the gaps. She paused for a second, taking a breath, then returned to the table, snatching at the bucket of fried chicken. In front of her, the television turned on, a commercial for McDonalds, showing a woman storming up to the counter and demanding all their food. She smiled as she stuffed another burger into her mouth, the sauce dripping down her new double chin and onto her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite attacking the food, it didn't seem to be going down. She glanced to her left, and a huge box of Krispy Kremes sat waiting for her, as though inviting her to eat them. To her right, she saw bags filled with chocolate bars of a dozen varieties, all unwrapped and ready, and she reached her hand down into them, pulling out three and stuffing them into her mouth, chewing through the caramel and candy. Briefly, she was thirsty, but a huge vat of milkshake suddenly appeared on the table with a spigot, and she filled a pint glass all the way to the top, drinking it in three long glugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the table was getting bigger, as though every time she looked away, something was added. Now a bowl of onion rings had appeared next to the fries, and she snatched between the two of them, scooping out the contents with her hands. There was a loud report, and the complaining buttons at her waist gave out, dropping to the ground, allowing her heaving belly to emerge, slowly beginning to expand across her knees. Her breasts were beginning to grow, as well, putting greater pressure on her bra, but all she could think about was eating more, and more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sizes seemed to be getting bigger. Quarter-pounders had become half-pounders, then full pounds of beef, smothered in cheese and salsa, the baps drenched in grease that rolled down her triple chins. Her arms were growing heavy, her thighs growing, threatening the seams of her trousers now. Back to her right, she reached for the donuts, eating a dozen in as many bites, adding a sheen of sugar and cream to the mess on her face, and running down her expanding cleavage. Taking a gasp of breath, she looked back to the table, slapping three slices of pizza together and gulping them down, headless of the tomato sauce and cheese that was splattering everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the television was advertising cakes, huge, towering gateaux of a dozen varieties, slathered in cream and chocolate, one of them topped with eclairs. Her stomach grumbled as she stopped eating for a moment, and she reached down with one greasy hand to rub her huge belly, now large enough that it was threatening to push back the table. She turned back to the junk food, which had disappeared, and her eyes widened with panic as she looked around for the now-disappeared food. Hunger was eating away at her, and for a second, desperation reigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a series of pops, the table was filled with food once again, one of the cakes that she had seen on the television, as large as her belly now was, with a box to her side containing thirty canisters of spray cream. There were spoons on front of her of various sizes, and she snatched up the largest and began to scoop slices of the nearest cake, stuffing her face with chocolate and cream, pausing only for a second to empty one of the canisters into her mouth. A loud rip sounded, and the struggling seams of her trousers gave out, exposing her flabby thighs. Her top was pulling back to the sides as her growing, food-stained belly grow out, her breasts now huge, meaty basketballs of jiggling flab, the cleavage trapping stray morsels of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" she said. \"More. More. More!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped the spoon to the side as she took the last bite of cake, and somehow the table seemed to have become a conveyor belt of gluttony, huge platters of food rolling towards her, a pile of fried chicken large enough that some threatened to drop to the ground at its head. Dropping from the ceiling were pipes labelled with different brands of soft drink, ready for her to gulp on demand. Behind the chicken, she could see more food as far as her eyes could see, rolling off into the distance. and as she reached for the first piece of fried chicken, she gave a huge belch, and the couch collapsed under her weight, her mammoth butt absorbing the force of the impact. For only a second, she paused, before reaching for the next morsel of food.</span></div></div>",

She'd just won more than a hundred million dollars. Thoughts began to rush into her head, and she reached for the phone, calling the lottery company to make sure she was the winner. A few thrilling minutes later, and she not only had confirmed that she was the only winner of the jackpot, but that the money would be going into her own personal account. She looked around at the dingy, depressing house. The last thing she wanted to do was share this money with anyone. All of it was going to be hers, and she looked at the collection of discarded packets around her, already imagining heaping piles of food all around her. Most of the money wouldn't be in her account for a few days, but they'd advanced her a hundred thousand dollars to allow her to celebrate in style, and she knew exactly what she had to do. First, get her money where no-one else could touch it, and then spend it. All of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up at the clock, she realized that she only had a couple of hours before the others would be back. She quickly dialled for a taxi, then called the airport to book herself on the next flight out of town. It didn't matter where. She could go wherever she wanted after that. With the hoot of a horn outside, she pulled herself from the couch, tossed the phone onto the table, and walked out of the door for the last time. No point packing anything. She'd be buying new anyway...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peggy woke up, pushing the pizza boxes off the bed, and looked around the opulent hotel room she'd booked herself into the previous night. Wondering if it was all still a dream, she pulled out her new smartphone, instantly looking at her bank account, the balance well into nine figures. Looking out of the window over the unfamiliar skyline, the past day came back to her in a food-laden daze, a quick flight across the country followed by an evening devoted to gorging and gluttony. Her limousine had taken her to half-a-dozen restaurants, culminating on a massive takeaway order that she'd brought back up to her room, the debris still scattered on every surface.&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her belly, she reached across for a telephone, punching for room service. She'd already placed her order the previous night, and it would be brought up in a matter of moments. Not soon enough, though. Her stomach was already rumbling, ready for a feast. More than a hundred million dollars, all of it hers. Nobody else was going to get a cent, and she was going to indulge herself as never before. Reaching for the remote control, she stabbed a button to bring up a soap opera, then reached across to a half-finished bag of candy bars, greedy fingers unwrapping the first of them as she shoved it into her mouth.&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened as she finished the last of them, two heavily-laden trolleys pushed into the room by a pair of hunky waiters. The word had evidently got around that she was rich, and the possibilities of her new-found wealth did not escape her. The attendants pulled a tray over her bed, and loaded it with the contents of the trolleys, platters covered in waffles, pancakes, bacon and sausages, fried eggs sizzling away, jugs of syrup oozing onto the table. Heaped mountains of toast finished the feast, and as the door closed again, she dug into the mess of food, ignoring the cutlery as she greedily began to gorge.&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe syrup liberally coated all of the plates with a gleaming sheen, and she snatched tasty morsels with her hands from the plates, stuffing the contents into her mouth, headless of the sugary mess drooling from her lips, dropping into her heaving cleavage. Her gobbling began to drown out the actors on the screen, but her attention was elsewhere, stuffing herself with reckless abandon, her mouth constantly full of batter,  butter and syrup, her hands methodically sweeping every plate clean of its contents. The waffles vanished first, ten of them into her rapacious belly, a faint belch to announce their departure. Then the bacon, snatched in greedy handfuls, forced between her lips, leaving a greasy mess on her burgeoning double chin.&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore,\u201d she grunted, reaching for the pancakes. \u201cMore.\u201d&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could almost feel her belly expanding as she loaded it with greasy food, licking each plate clean as she finished it, determined to devour everything on offer. All too soon, the table was empty, but the jug of syrup was still a quarter-full, and she tipped it into her mouth, drizzling it down, eagerly lapping at the last of the repast. With a final belch, she settled it back down, her greasy hands rubbing her belly, the buttons on her nightgown threatening to explode from the mass of food hastily digesting. She felt drowsy again, the effort of her food orgy making her weary, and the last thing she did before going back to sleep was to call room service again, instructing them to have lunch ready for noon. For too long, she'd been unable to indulge. Now she had the money to do anything she wanted. And she wanted to feed.</span></div></div>",

Next to her, the hunky man she'd hired for the night methodically emptied a huge box of bonbons into her mouth, a series of periodic explosions of chocolate on her tastebuds. She looked up at the man, fluttered her eyes, and rubbed her belly again, looking out at the restaurant she'd booked for the evening's second gorge. Only the finest foods could be permitted to pass her plump lips, and she was determined to stuff and glut her way through her new-found wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo pulled up outside the opulent restaurant, the driver and her attendant hastening to help her onto the steps, her too-tight dress struggling under the weight of her growing belly as she walked sedately inside, all eyes looking at her, the flash of cameras everywhere. She'd already gained a reputation as a party queen, had stuffed on fifteen pounds of delicious flab in a single week of endless gluttony. She walked through the crowd, one of the waiters opening a door to admit her into a private room, a single, plush chair in front of a table. There was no need for a menu. She'd ordered ahead, and all that remained was waiting for the feast to begin...</span></div></div>",

She looked up at the ranch house, the last of the building crews heading off down the drive, their work completed, and grasped the handrail with a plump hand as she climbed the short staircase to her new home. The maid brought out a pair of candy bars, and Peggy snatched at them, stuffing them into her mouth, the sugar rush assaulting her tastebuds as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused at the top of the stairs, looking out at the million acres she had bought with some of her lottery winnings. At first, she\u2019d planned on living in the city, but the idea of a huge megafarm devoted entirely to her gluttony, her greed, had caught her attention. That, and she wasn\u2019t going to be disturbed. She walked inside, the smell of frying meat attacking her nostrils, and took her first look at her dining chamber. The house had been kept simple. A big room for her to eat in, smaller rooms for her clothes, jewels, bed. A dozen chefs to keep her constantly stuffed, servants to bring her food. The farm itself was enough to support her wealth, but she was going to be skimming all the cream she could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lazily reached over to a button, ringing the bell that set her servants moving. Pushing herself to sit up, she rubbed her hands over her growing belly, soft and squidgy, and reached across for a remote control, turning on the huge television on the far well, a Spanish soap opera in progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and a maid came through carrying a silver platter, loaded with breakfast. Three stacks of pancakes, eight high, dripping with syrup and with a jug of cream next to it, with a huge mug of hot chocolate buried in marshmallows on one side, and a stack of buttered toast on the other. She reached for the meal with glee, taking big scoops out of the pancakes and loading them into her mouth, the syrup running down her double chin, dripping into her heaving cleavage. With her other hand, she snatched at the toast, taking it in huge bites, buttery crumbs flying all around. As she dropped the fork to the now-empty plate, she drained the chocolate in one, leaving a brown ring around her mouth, and the maid took the finished meal away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering out of bed, she walked through the door into her shower, a tall, busty attendant waiting to help her clean up. Her husband had managed to put her off men for life, but she loved the idea of having the sort of women he lusted after tending to her every whim. Shedding her dressing gown to the floor, she stood under the warm water, the maid gently rubbing the remnants of her many midnight snacks away, as well as breakfast, before drying her off with a soft towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping another gown over her, she donned a jewelled necklace, dropping in between her heaving bosom, and stepped back into her bedroom to find her second-breakfast waiting for her, five huge cream buns, covered in sugar and chocolate, sitting on a plate. Eagerly, she walked over to them, helping herself with both hands, stuffing them in while her shower attendant waited with a napkin to remove the surplus cream and sugar from her mouth. Her stomach growled as she stuffed the food into her belly, a slight belch escaping her lips as she finished them off.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nWalking through the double doors, she stepped into her television room, and settled on a plush couch, a table in front of her loaded with snacks, boxes of chocolates, bags of chips and sweets scattered all around. Reaching absent-mindedly as she screen flickered on, she slowly started to graze on the fattening food before her, taking three chips at a time before a mouthful of Reese's Pieces, then tipping a bag of M&amp;Ms into her mouth, some of them scattering all around her. A pile of wrappers started to gather on the floor, and chocolate mounted on her lips as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gong sounded, and she rose again, her belly jiggling with the recent bounty, and she walked into her dining room, a feast of junk food spread out across the table, three huge hamburgers surrounded by a forest of fries, as well as a bucket of fried chicken and a pair of pizzas, steam rising from them. She stepped over to the table and reached down for the first burger, taking a huge bite, then a mouthful of fries to follow, swathed in ketchup. She gobbled at the food, her hands roaming across the table, her maid tipping more fries as the supply dwindled, her belly slowly rising from the feast she consumed, one immense mouthful at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDessert is waiting in the lounge, ma'am,\u201d one of her maids said as she devoured the last slice of pizza, and she rose to her feet with a belch, patting her exposed belly with greasy, food-splattered fingers as she waddled through the next set of doors, chewing the last morsel of food with a satisfied smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the other room was a huge divan, surrounded by cream buns, eclairs and cakes, with a trio of maids waiting for her. She settled down at rest, lying back, and one of the maids began to massage her soft belly as the others started to offer tasty snacks, taking them to her lips to spare her even the need to feed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner in three hours, ma'am?\u201d one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen courses,\u201d she replied in between bites. \u201cNo, twelve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had a message from your personal assistant,\u201d another added. \u201cYour holiday has been prepared. You'll be leaving in a week, first class all the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, taking a huge bite of chocolate cake. By the time she'd finished her round-the-world binge, they'd have to carry her off the plane.</span></div></div>",

However, there was one that she hadn't shared with the Doctor. It was embarrassing, a moment of weakness. During the fourth great and bountiful human empire, she'd wanted to impress Adam. After her near death experiences, she decided to live more, to do more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while the Doctor was distracted with his own confusion, she slipped away. Accepting a type-two body morphing implant, she returned to find that Adam's disappearance was worrying the Doctor. A triumphant grin on her face, when she realised the Doctor hadn't detected her implant. A mentally controlled breast expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept it secret, and when Adam's treachery was discovered, she determined never to reveal her own weakness to the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like the implant was failing, as it was activating when she was distracted.

It was refreshing to be given the rare opportunity to spend some quality time with Dexter (something which had not happened often for the years they'd been together) but being completely home alone was something she did not much care for. She was eager to make the most of the empty space, but as she paced in the kitchen on the phone to Dexter she was finding it harder than she would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well will you be much longer?\" She asked trying to not sound too pleading after Dexter had used the fabled 'working late' excuse \"The house is empty and quiet... So we could, you know, have a little fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. Yeah sure\" Replied Dexter, trying to fake interest \"I'll try and be back in the next few hours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay baby... I love you\" Said Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Love you to\" Replied Dexter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita sighed to herself when the phone went dead, staring into space sadly. Though she understood and completely respected the fact that Dexter had a very demanding job, sometimes she wished that Laguerta would cut him a little slack and give him a much deserved break. But of course unbeknownst to poor sweet Rita, Dexter was not working late at all that night, nor had he ever done. Night was a time when Dexter led the dark side of his double life, the side which was controlled by his dark passenger. Tonight it had to be satisfied, which was good news for Dexter but very bad news for one Ryan 'Tez' Tesoro, a local small time gangster who had recently escaped jail time for the murder of his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She was hoping that a few glasses of wine would kill the time before her beloved Dexter would finally show up, she was fairly used to this scenario. Suddenly she heard a noise at the other side of the house which made her start, causing her to spill her wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit\" She said quietly to herself as her fear overtook her anxiety of the red wine that was no slowly seeping its way into her white carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita grabbed the largest knife that she could find from the kitchen, trying to control her breathing as she did in an attempt to calm her nerves. She slowly crept down the dark hallway towards the direction of her bedroom, the hand the knife was gripped in shaking uncontrollably. The sound had definitely come from the bedroom, and as she approached it her heart stopped when she made out the image of the bedroom window which was clearly broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh..Who's there?\" She stammered, trying to sound assertive but realizing she was being a horror movie cliche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt a presence behind her, looming from the open door to the dark bathroom she had her back to. She felt a hand reach over her mouth with a cloth clasped in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh\"Came a darkly soothing voice \"You knew this was inevitable my dear perfect Rita...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went hazy for poor Rita as her struggle ebbed away and then she knew no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rita came to she looked around groggily as the cobwebs cleared from her mind and the full gravity of what was happening sunk in. Her surroundings were alien to her, as she appeared to be in some kind of a partially dilapidated building that was under a process of renovation. Rita then tried to move, but she found that her hands were manacled to the ground leaving her stuck in a kneeling position. She struggled frantically against her restraints but there was clearly no chance of her breaking free, so after a minute she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello Rita\" Came a voice from behind her, \"Welcome to my new studio\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was obviously female and positively British, narrowing down its owner almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing Lila?\" Demanded Rita venomously, without needing to turn to see it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very good\" Said Lila \"Aren't you just the biggest clever clogs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the only English bitch i know\" Replied Rita viciously \"And I really wish i didn't know you at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rita\" Said Lila shaking her head sadly \"That was a little harsh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita stared at the floor, her eyes burning with angry tears as Lila circled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving me the silent treatment now aye?\" Said Lila \"Well that's fine...

Just not right about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sick freak...\" Rita snarled through gritted teeth but Lila ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But finally it hit me!\" Said Lila reenacting her 'eureka' moment \"Wouldn't little Rita look so much prettier with a few more pounds on that meager frame of hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, you are not going to fatten me up!\" Rita retorted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I am my dear\" Said Lila darkly \"I'm going to make you so fat... In fact I hope for your sake that Dexter is into fat chicks... But something tells me he'll go for me over his disgustingly obese, soon to be former girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to hell...\" Was Rita's heated response, though her confidence had been undeniably shaken by Lila's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already there\" Said Lila darkly \"But when I get Dexter back, all will be right with the world once again... and then you will be the one in hell Rita my dear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila then left the room, an extremely satisfied expression on her face while Rita's was a mask of hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita had partially dozed off, so when the rusty lock of the door clicked she jumped. Her surprise turned to a scowl as Lila entered again, this time carrying a large bucket which sloshed as she carried it forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lila... What the hell are you doing?\" Said Rita, her fear obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my dear I thought I'd already explained that to you\" Responded the Brit in a condescending tone \"This is a bucket of a special mixture which will help you reach your new goal weight... I'd say, i don't know, maybe three hundred pounds? Perhaps more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you fucking dare...\" Rita began but Lila merely shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less talk more gluttony\" She said sternly and forced a bondage style mask over Ritas mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask was designed to keep the wearers mouth open so that a tube could be entered through the circular opening, which Lila now did with an evil smile. Rita shook her head frantically as the other end of the tube was connected through a rather old and rusted pumping system and dipped into the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up\" Lila crooned, pleased at the look of horror in Ritas eyes as she started pumping the mixture through the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixture was rather sickly, but not unpleasant though Rita could tell just how fattening it was just by the taste of it. As the bucket slowly emptied, its contents forced down her throat Rita thought mournfully how fat Lila intended on making her, and wondered what Dexter would think of his new flabby fiancee. By half way Rita felt full, she could feel her belly felt heavier with the sickly concoction she had been forced to consume as it was unused to storing such excessive amounts. Rita tried vaguely to give a sign that she was full, but she was feeling heavier and sleepier by the second (though admittedly it wasn't like Lila would have stopped anyway). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glugglugglugglggg\" Was the only noise coming from Rita as she approached the final stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were half closed now, and it was obvious she was really struggling to swallow each mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it Rita!\" Cried Lila in encouragement \"Just a few more gulps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitas response was unintelligible as she was forced to consume the remainder of the concoction. When she had finished Lila clapped, as though Rita were a dog who'd just been taught a trick, and removed the feeding mask from Rita's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhrraaaaappp\" Rita exclaimed before slinking slowly and miserably to the floor, her stomach stretched to its limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ada girl Rita!\" Said Lila, sounding genuinely impressed as she patted Ritas taut tummy causing her to moan \"That's a good little piggy... Don't worry, it will get much easier over time. As you get fatter and fatter your capacity will grow and grow, and before you know it you'll actually crave the feeding... Your greed will control you, as much as you'll hate it you will become addicted to your own gluttony\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

She felt groggy, looking around her with temporary amnesia as she heard the muffled growls of her belly underneath her white summer dress. Her eyes and mind focused almost instantly when she saw a familiar, hated figure looming over her once more. There was a metallic clang as Mia dropped a heavy metal bucket to the ground, a bucket who's contents Rita could guess at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I've been trying to decide what part of this process I'm going to enjoy more, and I think I've figured it out\" Said Mia, as she absent mindedly attached the feeding mask and tube to Ritas mouth \"I'm really looking forward to see where the majority of this new fat is going to attribute itself. Will you be all belly and boobs? Maybe get a big old badonkadonk booty? Will you be pear shaped, hourglass or more of an apple? So many possibilities. I can tell you Rita my dear I will be watching over that perfect body of yours like a hawk, waiting for that first bulge of new flab and cellulite with real excitement\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrhyy mrhaate ooh\" Murmered Rita, her eyes set into a dangerous glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia merely beamed at her happily before beginning to pump away on the pump, forcing the fattening mixture down the hose. The feeding was much more difficult and gruelling this time as it did not take long for Ritas belly to start feeling full. It had only been a few hours since the last feeding, but Mia clearly wanted to push Rita to her limit in order to increase her appetite and stomach capacity quicker. By half way Rita was really struggling, her eyes regaining the glazed over look they had had when she had awoken, and by the quarters they had closed completely. Mia noticed this, realising that the poor girl was probably barely conscious but she did not want to stop. Mia tied a rope to the pump handle, grabbing the other end and leading it with her as she sat with Rita, forcing her to sit up in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly there girl\" Mia whispered into Rita's ear, the warm feeling of her breath causing Rita to stir slightly and groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith impressive dexterity and strength Mia yanked on the rope, which in turn pumped more mixture down the hose. Mia used her free hand to gently massage Rita's throat, which safely allowed the calorific mixture down into her belly rather than her choking on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it that's it\" Whispered Mia fondly as she forced Rita to finish the mixture slowly \"That's a good girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rita had finally finished she was fast asleep, snoring softly through her feeding mask. Mia removed the mask carefully but remained sitting for awhile, with Rita sat in her lap resting her head on Mia's shoulder as she slept. She slowly massaged Rita's full, growling belly as she sang a soft lullaby to her... Darkness looming behind her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night the next time Rita woke, as she now found herself sat in complete darkness. She noticed that she was lying on a series of luxuriously soft and comfortable pillows, with an incredibly cosy blanket draped over her. She knew there was only one person who could have done this, and she was a bit perplexed at the seemingly uncharacteristic gesture from Mia. Rita jumped as the door to her cell was swung open, and her eyes narrowed as Mia entered carrying a familiar steel bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, your up already\" Said Mia in the thick British accent Rita had really grown to hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita glared at Mia, thinking about how much she'd like to slap the crazy Brit who had made it her mission to fatten her up against her will. Her hatred subsided slightly however as she watched Mia, noticing that something had changed in the way the cocky Brit carried herself. She was no expert in body language but it was pretty clear that something was different about Mia, and she raised a subtle eyebrow in interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm awake\" Said Rita, her voice steady \"Does me having complete clarity make this more enjoyable for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita really raised her eyebrows now as she saw a definite look of regret on Mia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no I...\" Said Mia, stumbling with her words, \"... Lets just get it over with okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita saw an opportunity, a chink in her enemies armour and she knew that probing it was her only chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Mia?\" She asked, trying to sound like she cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Though time hadn't meant much since this fattening process had begun, she could guess some time had passed as she sucked down the calorific mix quite easily. She tried to ignore that her dress was feeling a little snugger than usual, and watched her captor with increasing interest. Lila definitely seemed distracted as she pumped the feeding lever, not revelling in Ritas misery as she had before. Soon Rita slumped down the last of the mixture and the tube was mercifully pulled from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrpp\" Exclaimed Rita wearily yet still having her wits about her \"Thanks Lila.. hicc\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... sure\" Said Lila \"I'll see you at your next feeding\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila turned to leave but Rita saw a chance and took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lila wait\" She said and her tormentor stopped in her tracks, not turning at first \"This isn't you...

First up:  can a person really gain hundreds of pounds in a single sitting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scenario that we\u2019ve all seen countless times in weight gain stories,\u201d Kari said.  \u201cSomebody gorges themselves endlessly on a ridiculous amount of food and ends up becoming extremely fat in a very short amount of time, sometimes less than a day.  But cartoonish as it may seem, could it actually be possible, with the right foods, to actually gain a significant amount of weight in a single day?  Well, there\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera zoomed out to reveal Kari seated at a large table piled high with a diverse array of cakes, pies, cookies, and other high-calorie pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the next twenty-four hours, I am going to eat as much of this food as possible, and see how much weight I can gain.  Then we should have a pretty good idea of whether or not a person can become significantly fatter in the course of just one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant and Tory quickly escorted Kari over to a large scale to get her starting weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c115 pounds,\u201d Tory announced.  \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari then sat down at the table and dug in, stuffing her face with mouthful after mouthful of rich chocolate cake as fast as she could.  After the first cake was gone she moved onto another, then another.  Two hours into her feast, Kari was feeling very stuffed.  Her stomach was starting to bulge out slightly, and the button on the front of her jeans was about to pop off.  She was starting to feel tired from constantly shoveling food into her mouth and almost began to slow down, but she was determined to proceed in the name of science.  Grant and Tory teased her as she chowed down by doing things like spraying whip cream onto a slice of cake that she was about to bite into, or occasionally poking her in the belly.  \u201cGuys, cut it out,\u201d Kari attempted to say with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours and hundreds of thousands of calories later\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tory turned to Grant as they watched the gorgeous redhead hobble away to pitch an idea to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good wasn't it?\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah\" He answered enthusiastically \"That was amazing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you agree\" Tory continued \"Shame she didn't gain a few hundred pounds though... I would of liked to have have seen that... Always thought she'd look hot a few hundred pounds heavier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTory was seemingly talking to himself at this point as he stared after Kari, laying out his dark desires for Grant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've anyways thought that to\" Said Grant quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then\" Said Tory brightly \"Lets keep this gravy train moving... I think Kari needs another weight gain Myth to bust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the good of science right?\" Asked Grant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, of course for science\" Tory replied rather unconvincingly \"But how about we make this a little more interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" Asked Grant cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wager\" Said Tory simply \"Whoever can get Kari to gain the most weight from their own Myths wins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah sure\" Said Grant, shaking Torys hand \"For science!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day filming began anew, and Kari was happy to put the whole weight gain thing behind her (she wasn't too thrilled at the extra ten pounds that she could feel bulging against her clothes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have a new Myth\" Said Tory \"As yesterday's weight gain Myth was a bit of a disappointment... We have a new one for you Kari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris face dropped at this statement, though she tried to hide her emotions to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She muttered from the side of her mouth to Tory, her feelings on the subject quite clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as the last one was such a failure, we figured we'd carry on with the theme till we see good results\" Said Grant \"So todays Myth Kari revolves around another popular weight gain story clich\u00e9... The weight gain formula\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant brandished a bottle of an almost luminous green liquid which Kari regarded with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to drink that?\" Asked Kari incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" Replied Grant quite simply \"Don't worry it's perfectly safe, it has been specially designed by our science boffins\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" Said Kari still sounding reluctant and unsure \"The things I do for science\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the bottle and, after a poisonous look at Grant, drank it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the formula you just drank is designed to not only dramatically increase your appetite, it also more than doubles every calorie consumed\" Grant explained \"You'll start feeling this in a few seconds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..  I still feel pretty normal\" Said Kari \"I don't think your formula works, so Myth buste... Say, I feel a little funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Grant \"Seems that the formula is doing its stuff, Tory if you will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured toward a large table draped in a sheet, which Tory now gleefully removed. He revealed mountains of food, perhaps over twice as much as she'd consumed the day before. She could feel the formula slowly starting to work and she felt hungrier and hungrier as she stared in horror at the huge amount of fattening foods on display. She tried so hard to resist it but soon the hunger was too much and she pounced on the table like a ravenous animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're off!\" Announced Grant \"Could you please describe what the formula is doing Tory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well right now that formula is playing havoc with her feeling of hunger\" He said as Kari began to shovel handfuls of treats into her mouth like a good starved maniac \"She can't control herself as you can see, she can carry on like this for hours and never be satisfied! Plus on top of that every bite is being instantly turned into fat and stored around her body... So with any luck we should see some nice weight gain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great\" Said Grant \"Lets get a few words from the girl of the moment... Kari, how are you feeling right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant lowered a microphone to Kari's mouth that she was busy stuffing as much food as humanly possible into and the camera zoomed in on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrmmff... Can't shtopp eating... Mummfff\" She says between frantic mouthfuls of fattening foods made even more so by the formula \"Must keep uffff! Eating... Want to stop urrrpp!! But soooo hungry mrrrfff!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat follows is an eating montage as Kari furiously stuffed her face, shoving as much food into her greedy mouth as quickly as possible. There were several shots of Grant and Tory helping the process, as each of them stuffed handfuls of food into Karis drooling mouth inbetween her own. The feeding was shown to escalate in the montage, as the next scene showed Karis Co hosts each emptying two cans of squirty cream down her throat. During the feedings Kari was still stuffing her own face, so there was barely a few seconds between each mouthful, but nevertheless she didn't slow or falter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Urrrrppp... More...\" She was heard to babble in between brief food free intervals, and Tory and Grant gleefully complied by pushing even more food past her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was now a sped up shot of Karis belly which, over the space of several hours, bloated outward. It expanded against her jeans and popped off the top button while pushing the zipper down to reveal her panties, and it caused her top to ride up until it's flesh was exposed to all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So after... Wow... Five hours of eating\" Announced Grant \"Lets get our bulging beauty on the scales and see if this Myth has been confirmed or busted\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rubbed it to try and calm the gurgles erupting from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Urp.. guys... hiccup...

Like a bag of sand her stomacher plopped down and brushed her thighs, it was twice the size of her previous belly. Kari thinking on her feet grabbed her pants as they tried to fall down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright let's get.. you over to that scale.\" said Grant as he struggled to hold onto Kari. With some more effort Grant and Tori helped the stuffed red head waddle over to the scale. Even as Kari tried to keep some modesty, the editors would eventually have to blur out the bit of butt crack that stuck out from her tightened pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a huff Kari stepped onto the scale and the numbers whirled around.

Anyway, You need to take one pill before breakfast and one before dinner for three weeks,\" Tory elaborated,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three weeks? What are the side effects?\" Kari nearly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nausea, indigestion, fever, hallucinations, and a few others. But don't worry, we talked with the insurance company and they said you're covered. Also, we'll have a doctor on sight every day during testing just in case you or Jessi need them,\" Grant informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessi? Why is she doing this?\" she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's our control. While you're taking those, she'll be taking a regular hunger enhancer. Each day we'll weigh you and we'll see the difference,\" Tory responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but why Jessi?\" The redhead inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been on the show before, she has a similar height and build as you, and she said she would do it when we called her,\" Grant listed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, when do we start?\" Kari sighed as she came to grips with the whole scenario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You start the pills tomorrow, but today we need to get a base line. You need to put these on,\" Tory said picking up a white tank top and a pair of black yoga pants \"so we can eliminate clothing as a factor in your weight, and so your body isn't obscured when we take the photos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking photos?\" Kari said with panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's so we can have a visual record as well as the numbers from your weigh ins. We'll be taking them daily just before lunch to insure that the weight is yours and not from excess food in your stomach,\" Tory explained further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I mention that I hate this myth?\" Kari complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't blame us. Take it up with the producers,\" Grant defended. Kari walked off in a huff, taking the pills and the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave Jessi the same pills right?\" Grant whispered to Tory. The taller man nodded. \"You know they'll kill us if they find out this is all us right?\" Grant worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. If everything goes to plan, they won't be able to move by then,\" Tory assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari stared at herself in the bathroom mirror. She had just finishes putting on the clothes Tory gave her and was debating on weather or not she should come out. After two days of binging on the show her stomach was already huge in her mind. While it wasn't as big as yesterday, thanks to her having finished digesting, it was still quite the belly. \"Last time I was this big I was pregnant,\" she whined to herself. She had planned on dieting, but it looked like that wasn't an option anymore. \"What kind of sick perverts are the producers to make me do this?\" She wondered. \"I mean look at this,\" she huffed and shook her tummy \"who would find this attractive?\" Then Kari got an idea. If she could convince Jessi to back out, she wouldn't have to do it. No control, means no test. The redhead rushed out of the bathroom  to try and find the blonde. She finally located her in the break room playing on her phone and drinking some water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kari. Nice to see you again,\" she greeted warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jessi. Can you believe they're making us do this?\" Kari started \"how hard did they have to beg to get you to do this?\"</span></div></div>",

Dee was fed furiously by her drunken friends, boxes of donuts, a huge sub sandwich and several bags of chips were emptied into her as she struggled to keep up. When the feeding was done they led her to the back office (Dee stumbled along obviously very full indeed) and she stepped on some scales.

For your belly bump...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"500 dollars for every 5 pounds\" Said Dee, nettled by the subtle stab at her weight gain \"You can easily afford that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thousand dollars\" Said The Waitress, suddenly taking control \"For every five pounds...

She was trying to seem unfazed and cool about it but her face didn't quite match this, and The Waitress smiled to herself as she saw Dee's greed fight with her fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kinda punishments are we talking here?\" She said slowly, trying to sound casual but not succeeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's for you to learn and me to think up when i feel like it...\" Said The Waitress mysteriously \"You in or out? And please be aware I'm the one with the money, and I can enjoy it easily without you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have been that Dee saw her opportunity slipping at this point that her next response was so hasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah yeah I'm in I'm in... Whatever man you know...\" She said, her pathetic attempts at being casual bringing an unpleasant smile to The Waitress's face \"But I need a sign of good will first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee extended her hand, keeping deliberate eye contact whilst inclining her head. The Waitress smiled back, her eyes glinting maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what I thought, here you go\" Said The Waitress, the unpleasant smile remaining as she handed over a further nine hundred dollars \"When you gain your next five come back here for your next payment... And punishment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure whatever\" Said Dee as she left, happy she'd been able to con more money but also secretly fearing what the 'punishment' could possibly be<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee arrived back at the bar and found the rest of the gang in their usual positions; that being drinking beer and not selling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\" She said, still fighting between feelings of triumph and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup Sweet Dee\" Answered Mac \"How much you get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we're entitled to at least half of those Benjamins\" Said Dennis, trying to sound street as he often did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I got...\" Said Dee, before stopping herself \"Um just a hundred\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't ask for more??\" Demanded Frank \"Your turning into a fat ass for a hundred dollars a pop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mac did that for free\" Interjected Dennis \"Mac literally did that for free no more than two months ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time\" Began Mac, his voice rising \"I was cultivating mass!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee smiled to herself as the gang descended into an argument, happy that their focus had shifted from the money situation. As they argued she took the moment to examine herself, as Franks point had suddenly made her feel self conscious. To a common observer the effects probably were not as immediately obvious (Dee was a rather tall lady afterall, so she held the weight easier than a shorter girl) but to Dee they certainly were, she felt every extra unwanted pound on her body and sighed. It seemed to be accruing predominantly, at least for the time being, around her stomach, which was exactly the area she did not want it and lead to another mournful sigh. Her spirits were lifted however when her hands reached the bulge in the pocket of her jeans, and she smiled to herself as she felt the roll of notes there. The only member of the gang not fully engaged in the argument was Frank, as he was watching Dee with acute interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I am top of the food chain bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God will you morons shut the hell up!\" Yelled Frank suddenly \"Did you not just see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Asked Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dee was acting really suspicious just now, while you idiots were arguing over nothing\" Replied Frank \"She's hiding something from us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew she was holdin out on us!\" Yelled Dennis in outage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't know shit!\" Replied Frank \"But that's not important...

The riches came with a price she knew, as now not only did she have to gain more weight for her next payment but she also faced an additional 'punishment' which would be chosen at the mercy of her tormentor. As she thought there was a sudden knock at the door, so she stood and answered it. She found Mac standing there, standing close enough as to obscure Sweet Dee's view of the hallway behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dee\" He said, his tone strange and suspicious \"I just came over to... Um... Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee had no idea what was going on as she was suddenly bum rushed by her friends, who pushed her back into her apartment and forced her down into a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" She yelled as her arms were tied behind her back \"Get off me God dammit! What the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know you've been holding out on us Dee!\" Growled Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I have no idea what your... Those were some crazy words you just said...\" Stammered Dee \"Just so crazy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it Dee\" Said Dennis sternly \"Okay guys, lets begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin what?\" Demanded Dee, sounding scared \"What are you do-mrrrffff??!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee was cut off by a funnel being thrust past her lips by Charlie, whose face housed a very unsettling expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets fill that belly of yours\" Said Charlie, giving the slight bulge of Dee's midriff a pat \"And this time we'll get the cut we deserve\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah seeing as we're doing all the work\" Said Mac as he began pouring an insanely calorific milkshake down the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment was filled with the sounds of frantic gulping, as Dee drank the incredibly fattening mixture that was being forced down her throat. When the milkshake was done Dee only had a brief window to catch her breath before the next one was dumped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo no wai-glugglugglggluuglug!!\" She wailed before the room became full of the sounds of frenzied gulping once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had finished five of the shakes Dee was too weak to complain any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gotta be it Frank\" Said Dennis \"A pound a shake right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should do one more to be sure?\" Suggested Mac \"Or weigh her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say do one more\" Said Charlie \"Its more fun, plus I like how she's not complaining anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this I like\" Said Dennis pointing at Dee who was just staring into space wearily, not seeming to registry anything that was being said \"This is much better than before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely\" Concurred Mac \"Now its bulk up time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac poured the next shake down the funnel into poor Dees exhausted mouth. Dees cheeks expanded with the mixture for a few moments before she was forced to slowly gulp it down into her groaning, bloated belly. When the last mouthful was swallowed of this hefty calorie shake, Dee let out a muffled burp and the funnel fell from her mouth to the floor. She was so weak from the feeding that she almost joined it, but Charlie and Mac grabbed her under the arms and lifted her unsteadily to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrppp!\" She mumbled, her eyes unfocused and half closed as she swayed on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get that bitch on the scaled\" Ordered Frank \"Lets see if we can get our cut yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang dragged Dee to the scales, before shoving her onto them and watching the numbers rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" Said Mac \"145 pounds, that's like a gain of... Of, erm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 7 pounds\" Said Frank as Mac stumbled trying to get his head around the advanced mathematics \"That ain't bad... What's the return on that? And don't bullshit us this time Deandra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc\" Replied Dee weakly \"A thousand... Urrrpp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oho!\" Yelled Mac \"Not bad for ten minutes work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't even call that work\" Said Charlie \"I legitimately enjoyed that... I wish that was my full time job instead of killing rats and cleaning toilets\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hang on a second there Charlie\" Said Dennis, his face devious \"I think you just hit the nail on the head there. Why can't it be? We just made more money a piece than the bar makes in a week... I say we just do this, we stuff Dee's face we make that disgusting belly of hers fatter and we reap the rewards we deserve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you hearing this Deandra?\" Said Frank \"We did all the work for that five pounds, and we even gave you two extra. That thousand bucks is ours... And if you try and deceive us again, your really gonna regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee stared back dizzily, her head lolling and her legs having trouble keeping her steady as though she were standing on a boat in a stormy sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc! Uhhh... Whatever... Just don't feed me anymore please... Urrrp!\" Came Dee's barely audible response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" Said Frank \"We'll be in touch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Frank left, followed by the rest of the gang. Dee staggered to the sofa and collapsed, groaning softly to herself before slowly drifting off into a food induced sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dee awoke a couple of hours later, she looked around her empty apartment in dishevelled confusion as her memory returned to her. She remembered the feeding assualt that she had endured at the hands of her 'friends' and groaned to herself. She instinctively lifted up her best top to examine the damage, and immediately saw the small paunch that formed at her midriff as she was sat down. Her jeans felt tight, and she could see that the taut top button was probably only a couple of extra pounds away from popping off. She remembered the warning that Frank had given her and sighed, as she was afraid of crossing him which meant that these extra pounds she'd been forced to gain would be for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it\" She mumbled to herself as she poked her new belly \"Now I'm gonna have to gain three more pounds before i even get any money for this shit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grim determination Dee approached her fridge, and removed as many cans of whipped cram as she could carry (she now had an entire shelf of her fridge devoted to the stuff, as they proved to be quick and easy calories). She lay the four cans in a line over her bathroom sink, and stood on the scales seeing with a sigh the numbers hit 145lbs. She grabbed the first can, stuffed the nozzle into her mouth and hit the button sending the whipped contents into her mouth. She guzzled the first can in just a few minutes, never releasing her finger from the button so she consumed the contents as fast as possible. After taking a deep breath and giving a cute hiccup that took her by surprise she grabbed the next can and repeated the process. Slowly the needle climbed on the scale as Dee emptied the cans contents into her ever expanding belly, before grabbing the next. After years of beer bongs and keg stands Dee had developed a technique for quickly swallowing, which was what she was utilising right now. Cans three and four disappeared into her belly with little resistance, and when she dropped the forth can to the ground she let out a rather unladylike burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a bullet the top button popped off her very tight jeans (they were definitely a few sizes too small now), and her bloated belly more breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap-urrrhhhppp!\" She exclaimed, as her jeans were not cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked past the flesh dome which was her bloated tummy to the scales beneath and saw the read out with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"152! Shit! I gained too much!\" She yelled, frustrated that she'd not paid more attention to how much weight she was piling on \"Now I've got to gain three more damn pounds again or it'll be for God damn nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumpily Dee stepped off the scales, and with one hand holding up her jeans walked back to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit\" She cursed to herself as she opened the fridge, this time grabbing a huge multipack of chocolate pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee returned to the scales and began her next mammoth eating task, as she worked her way through the rich pots of chocolate pudding. With a large spoon she was able to finish each pot in only a few large mouthfuls and she blasted through the multi pack whilst keeping a keen eye on the scales. She noted that her bloated belly was beginning to obscure her view so she sucked it in and as she ate the calorific pudding she thought with sadness about how much larger she was going to get. Slowly the numbers climbed as she forced down the fattening desserts, each bite making her stomach growl in protest. It was a hard graft, but finally with commendable effort Dee swallowed a particularly large mouthful and the numbers rose to 155.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhr.. Hiccc!\" She said wearily, stepping off the scale \"God damn... I earnt this damn paycheque... Urrrrp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The Waitress whistled, clearly impressed and very happy at the number she saw there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't ever let me say you don't earn your money Dee\" She said, giving Dees protruding tummy a playful pat \"You must've really been pigging out to gain fifteen damn pounds in a single day! Just imagine how fat your gonna be in a week... You'll be a huge fat cow no man will ever want again in a month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up\" Said Dee, secretly worrying at the mental image she now had of her future self \"Lets just get this stupid 'punishment' over and done with so i can leave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure Dee, and you have no idea how much pleasure\" Said The Waitress in an unpleasant tone \"Follow me and ill show you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee followed The Waitress from the bathroom to her bedroom, and watched as she approached her large wardrobe. From inside she pulled out a coat hanger which appeared to have a pink bikini hung on it. Dee's eyes widened in horror when she figured out what it was and The Waitress merely nodded grimly to confirm her fears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Said Dee shaking her head \"No way... That's too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took the money\" Said The Waitress simply \"There is no room for negotiation... Put it on you fat bitch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee sighed, knowing there was no way out of this. Under The Waitress's scruttinous gaze she slowly undressed until she stood only in her underwear. The Waitress looked her up and down, nodding to herself with satisfaction as she took in the bulge of her small belly, and how her breasts were clearly a little squished by a bra that was becoming too small to house them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to stare at me while i get dressed?\" Growled Dee, glowing red with embarrassment \"Perv\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't blame me for checking your progress can you?\" Said The Waitress with a grin \"I think you look better with a bit of pudge... Though i can't say you'll still be looking good after I'm done with you. Here, I'm not done with you yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Waitress approached Dee, and began adding new additions to her costume. First, a pigs snout was placed over her nose and pigs ears on her head, there was already a twisted pigs tail protruding from the back of her pink panties, so with these new additions it finally dawned on her what the theme of her costume was. Next she fastened a white buttoned collar around her neck, with a pink bow tie and large white shirt cuffs around her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tadaa! Your a playboy piggie!\" Announced The Waitress happily as Dee stared back in wide eyed horror \"Seems fitting... Plus it'll allow everybody to see you turn into a disgusting ball of blubber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta be shitting me...\" Dee began but was silenced by The Waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah\" She said putting her finger over her lips \"That's not what a piggie sounds like... You may talk, but you gotta oink to! There's a microphone in your bow tie, so ill be listening to you and also telling you fun stuff to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... I can't...\" Stammered Dee but following a look from The Waitress stopped in her tracks \"Oink oink\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said The Waitress in a business like tone \"Now off you go... I'm sure there are many people who would love to see you looking like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee glared at The Waitress, her expression sullen as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a good burrito\" Said Charlie as he ate a large burrito at the bar \"Can you believe somebody just threw it in the trash? There were only a few bites taken out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you'd stop eating things you find in the trash\" Said Dennis \"I'm sick of watching you eat dumpster burritos\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A large part of my diet is dumpster foods\" Said Charlie \"You never know what your gonna find\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumpster foods isn't a thing Charlie!\" Said Mac, his tone rising slowly which indicated an incoming argument \"That's not a food group!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the most important food group!!\" Yelled Charlie, just as the door to the bar opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gang turned to inspect the visitor and the conversation stopped dead at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dee... What the hell are you dressed like that for?\" Asked Mac in surprise and increasing amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She made me\" Replied Dee, glowing red from embarrassment before reluctantly adding \"Oink oink!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" Said Frank, already losing interest \"Where's our cut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee approached the group, not wanting to test them again after what happened last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\" She said, handing Frank a wad of notes \"Oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be the best money making scheme we've ever had\" Said Mac, as he was handed his share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah for sure\" Said Dennis \"Now get behind the bar Dee, your shift started a half hour ago\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee mumbled a response, followed by an \"oink\" before obediently walking behind the bar to start, what she knew would be a very long shift indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It seemed that there were an exceptionally large amount of people in Philly who were very interested in being able to 'feed a loser'. At first Dee was taken completely off guard as the first customer ordered their drink, which she served to them only to have a donut shoved roughly into her mouth. The other customers laughed openly as she was forced to chew and swallow and she blushed deeply, very self conscious of her chunkier frame on show to all in her ridiculous piglet bikini outfit. Dee glanced over the other side of the bar where there was a crowd gathered and noticed all the signs that had been prepared by her 'friends'. She groaned miserably to herself as the next customer wasted no time cramming more food into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should of done this a long time ago\" Said Frank \"Its crazy in here tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Agreed Charlie \"And she's starting to get fat right?

And every extra pound is money in the bank for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang all nodded in agreement as the queue to feed Dee only increased at the bar. After a few more feedings Dee grumpily turned to serve the next customer and found a familiar face standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, hey Dee\" Said Artemis, completely taken aback by the image of her friend before her \"I saw the signs and had to come in and see for myself... What the hell happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. Um... Its kinda a long story\" Said Dee \"But lets just move past it shall we? Don't need to... Um... Draw too much attention to it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sure, it ain't no thing don't worry\" Said Artemis \"We all got our kinks right? Your clearly on some feedee/ public humiliation thing... Which is fine! In fact, how bout I feed you to? I mean, that's what you want right? Hmm? Would that get you off piggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Actually Artemis\" Said Dee hurriedly \"Ill just put the brakes on there a little... I know your into all that weird food fetish shit, and God knows what else with Frank, but really I'm not a feedee or whatev-Mrrrfff!?-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, its okay Sweet Dee\" Crooned Artemis as she pushed a bear claw into Dee's mouth \"Just enjoy the humiliation, embrace the fact you'll never live this down and soon be even fatter than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis certainly fit into the 'larger woman' category, so this statement was another blow poor Dee could of done without. The gang watched on with interest as Dee received a vigorous feeding from Artemis, causing an impatient line of people to form behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Frank?\" Asked Mac \"Did you tell Artemis about our new... Arrangement with Dee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah\" Replied Frank simply \"She just loves this kinky shit, I mean last week we were in a dumpster outside Mcdonalds and she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough Frank\" Ordered Dennis \"I don't want to hear about your steamy dumpster sex sessions with Artemis\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank shrugged as the gang continued to watch as Artemis emptied a box of krispy kreams into Dee's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly the service began to dwindle towards the tail end of the night, as Dee had been forced to consume an astonishing amount over the space of several hours. Drinks were spilled and wrong orders given but none of the clientele seemed to mind too much, as their main interest was stuffing the poor girl silly. Dee's hugely taut and bloated belly, which made her look heavily pregnant was a big talking point and the source of many jokes at her expense. The rest of the gang spent the evening as they usually did, that being pounding beers and yelling over each other, only now they spared the odd joke about Dee's weight gain and current predicament. Artemis had began rallying the other customers to feed the poor girl after her arms got tired from constantly shovelling food down her throat, and there had been a steady stream of food finding its way into Dee's groaning belly ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrrppp... Oh God... Uhhh so damn full\" Groaned Dee as she staggered from one customer feeding to the next, spilling the whisky and coke she was holding everywhere due to how weary and unsteady she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly and breasts bounced with each step she took, the extra weight quite obvious to everybody present as it was clearly stretching the material of her kinky pink bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Guys\" She said \"Have you been enjoying the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, it's been great\" Said Frank and the gang nodded in agreement \"Listen, I think you need to know a thing or two about what's actually going on here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are going to love this\" Interjected Charlie \"It's really great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis raised an eyebrow of interest as Frank explained the whole sordid situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this ain't some kinda public humiliation kink?\" Asked Artemis slowly \"Shes just doing this for money? And really not enjoying it one bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Said Mac<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much\" Said Dennis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Artemis, seemingly pondering the bizarre situation \"That's...

Just you wait boys, things are going to get very interesting for Sweet Dee from here on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of her shift all Dee could do was slump in a chair in the corner. That night she had been stuffed up to, and beyond capacity and it was impressive that she had remained standing until now. Her stomach was gigantic at this point, resembling that of a ten month pregnant woman and it rose and fell steadily as she breathed heavily from fatigue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Dee\" Said Artemis looking at her friend with wry amusement \"You really put on a show tonight you greedy bitch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp\" Responded Dee,rubbing her taut growling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you enjoyed it\" Continued Artemis \"I mean humiliating yourself in front of so many people,dressed in that ridiculous piglet bikini which barely fits your fatass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrp..

I mean why else would you be doing it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis tailed off and raised an eyebrow as she studied Dee. Dee's food addled brain suddenly received a spark of energy, realizing that the last thing she needed now was for Artemis to get involved in her money making scheme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err yeah hicc!\" Said Dee rather unconvincingly as she sat upright with some difficulty \"I'm so... Hot right now... Getting fattened up really turns me on I'll tell you... Urrp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it\" Said Artemis \"Your such a dirty little piglet... Hey, i know what would be great right now, let's weigh you and see how fat you are lard ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh maybe in a minute Artemis... So full I....\" Dee was cut off as Artemis dragged her to her feet and lead her briskly into the back office where there were scales set up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow 165?!?\" Exclaimed Artemis after shoving the lethargic bloated form of Dee onto the scales \"This new fetish of yours is really taking its toll on you huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Said Dee, clearly unhappy though she tried to remind herself that every pound was money in the bank \"I guess it is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sighed to herself as she felt her stomach with her hand, noticing that it definitely felt soft, and she had the beginnings of a permanent pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it\" She said to herself sadly \"Its payday today... just focus on that..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling to find clothing which fit her, another fact which depressed her immensely, she knocked on the Waitresses front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's you\" Said The Waitress when she answered and smirked \"And just look at you... your really going all in one this aren't you? You becoming a real fatass bitch... give me a twirl you cow, let's see your chunky figure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee blushed deeply at the hurtful comments, but nevertheless did as she was told. She turned as slowly and elegantly as she cold,  before ending on a side view to show the bulge of belly which she patted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I really let myself go huh? Said Dee, half trying to act like she was unfazed by the repeated complete humiliations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus your such a fat loser\" Said The Waitress \"Just get your stupid fatass on the scales\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee meekly obeyed and entered the apartment. As she stood on the scales she felt mixed emotions; excited to get her money and yet miserable and embarassed by at how quickly she was gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!!\" Exclaimed The Waitress in delight \"167?!? Wow you've outdone yourself you fat bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah yeah\" Said Dee hotly \"Just gimme my money and shut the hell up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw is somebody a bit moody?\" Mocked The Waitress before handing over a wad of notes \"Here you go... a few more LB's and you'll be able to Truffle Shuffle haha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee glared at her before going to leave, but was stopped as The Waitress gripped her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey not so fast Missy\" She said \"I've been feeling awfully left out of this whole process... So I've invited a friend so I can witness you making your money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue the door bell rang and the door swung open, revealing Artemis carrying some large bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey Sweet Dee!\" She said with a gleefulness that Dee did not mirror \"It's time to put on a kink clinic fatass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please lets not...\" Said Dee, her lip quivering \"Please you guys... I've got things to do todaymurrfff?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feeble pleads were cut short as The Waitress stuffed a sticky Danish Pastry into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\" She said \"You know the drill by now, your mouth is for eating not talking... so sit your tubby ass down and lets get you fattened up some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, lets give you a nice outfit to wear!\" Said Artemis, pulling the Piglet bikini from yesterday from her bag \"This should show off your chub nicely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee looked mortified as several more pastries were crammed down her throat, and her tormentors undressed her. She could feel The Waitress unashamedly groping her, squeezing at her body where the fat had accumulated thus far, enjoying the feel of the new paunch. The feeding continued as she was redressed before before shoved into a chair, and bound tightly to it. Her new weight gain was extremely evident at this point, as her skimpy pig bikini exposed how her soft belly bulged outward onto her thighs, which were also far softer and meatier than they ever had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!\" Exclaimed The Waitress upon seeing the cute belly bulge \"Would you just look at that? Why hello there Miss Pot Belly, thanks for joining the party\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut-urrrrrp!!\" Exclaimed Dee, taking herself by surprise and sending her two captors into a fit of hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just you wait\" Said Artemis to The Waitress upon getting her breath back \"Feeding this fat bird is the gift that keeps on giving\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can believe that\" The Waitress replied \"Now lets fatten this bitch up shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Artemis didn't need asking twice and once again Dee endured a humiliating and heavy handed feeding. The poor blonde grunted and moaned miserably as her kind of-sort of friends and her sworn enemy used both hands to cram as much food as possible down her throat. The pair clearly had very lofty ideas of Dees eating ability, as they fed her at a speed that surpassed that of the previous evening, when she had been fed by a large crowd of customers. The Waitress was like some deprived child playing with her first Christmas present, as she fed Dee with an excited intensity while also being unable from keeping her hands from exploring her growing body. Dee was helpless to prevent her hands from groping at her belly and the slight overspill of her love handles,  and occasionly brushing against the thin fabric of her pig bikini bottoms which only subtly covered her crotch. She tried to stop herself but every so often Dee would offer a gasp or a squeak between mouthfuls as she felt her excited hands rub against her nether regions. Her feeders were seemingly too engrossed in their task to notice the poor blondes involuntary exclamations and the feeding continued until The Waitress abruptly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah what the hell?!\" She exclaimed pulling away from Dee in shock \"Eww... Oh my God... Dee did you just...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis had stopped as well at this point giving the stuffed beauty a much needed respite while they examined a wet patch that had formed on her piggy bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this got you off you fat dirty bitch!\" Yelled Artemis happily \"I can't believe you just came!! Hahaha!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee blushed deeply as her two tormentors bent over in hysterics, trying to cross her legs to hide her shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp!! I haven't been touched... urrrp!! For awhile\" Whispered Dee in complete embarrassment \"It had nothing to do with this bullshit! Hicc!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I could drink it in gallons if that way possible... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee checked the beer taps... Okay there was a pretty new barrel connected to it that had contained 10 gallons in the beginning and Dee estimated that there were still a good 8 left of them. Of course Dee didn\u00b4t plan to drink all of it but a gallon would be a great start of the still young night... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, there\u00b4s a hose and there\u00b4s duck tape... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the \"Filling Dee up\"-construction was done and same-called Dee sitting in a chair right infront the tap area put one end of the hose right into her mouth to open the tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Dee has underestimated the pressure of the beer inside the tap so she\u00b4s pushed into the chair unable to close the tap and beer is rushing into her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The Waitress sneaks into the bar and finds Dee infront of her construction...</span></div></div>",

This option was quickly dismissed however when she realized that Charlie, Mac and Dennis were no doubt concocting some kind of ridiculous money making scheme as usual, and she was in no mood for their bullshit. As she shuffled delicately down the street (bumping into people, and muttering curses under her breath), she decided to head to the other side of town where she knew of some bars which were never visited by anybody she knew. The walk took some ten minutes, but finally she reached a place that seemed interesting. The bar was called \u201cWilly\u2019s\u201d, and she couldn\u2019t recall having ever seen it before. A look in the window also revealed a drinks menu that had very reasonable prices indeed, which was ideal for her as her job at Paddy\u2019s paid so little she could basically be regarded as a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about\u201d Dee said to herself, and shuffled into the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

She felt goosebumps raise on her soft skin at her touch, and she moaned in pleasure just as her tits tore her bra right above the cups, revealing part of her dark blue nipples which were obviously standing erect. As Dee fondled her tits, her bulging ass and hips finally finished pulling apart the seams at the top her jeans and the torn fragments fell down past her knees (where some structure still remained) revealing her severly stretched black panties, which luckily had a little more give in them. Her blue flesh bulged above and below the waistband of her underwear and as her hips, ass and thighs continued to slowly expand her underwear began to ride up her ass and crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...

Your hips are getting wider than the damn doorways, and those bulging tits of yours... Damn\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee was currently groping the bulging tits in question, which were now approaching a size D and had pretty much completely dessimated her bra and shirt. It was at this point, when Dee was approaching a screaming climax that her expansion stopped. Her pupils undulated as the intense feelings of sexual pleasure faded away and her mind slowly returned to reality. Dee looked around in cute confusion for a few moments, seemingly suffering from temporary loss of memory as she didn't seem to remember what just happened. She frowned slightly as she licked her lips, tasting blueberry as she did but also noticing how plump they were. The small amount of blueberry juice on her inflated lips momentarily sparked a very slight, yet familiar feeling inside of Dee which took her by surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... AHHHHHHHHHHH!! Whu... What the shit?!\" She screamed in horror, as she looked down and found her vision was completely obscured by her gigantic dark blue breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts (and the rest of her) slowly expanded outward for a few moments due to the very small amount of juice she'd just swallowed. Dee groaned as her ridiculously tight panties tightened even more (they looked like dental floss) until they finally snapped off completely, revealing her dripping wet (blueberry juice of course) pussy to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta tell you Dee\" Said Willie, who had been watching in amusement \"You look ridiculous... But I'd bang you, like super hard...

Her huge thighs rubbed together as she moved, and her gigantic rear end bounced with each movement and weighed her back making it hard for her to keep her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't turn you back to normal even if I could\" Said Willie with a laugh as he watched the dark blue skinned blonde with the overinflated hour glass figure attempt to navigate the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of bitch!\" Growled Dee \"I would kick your ass...

I could not see past your skinny body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew...\" Said The Waitress quietly \"I just always thought you didn't like me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo... No no\" Said Dennis, sounding a little less convincing but The Waitress didn't pick up on it \"I really do care about you... I'm sorry to spring this on you, I just thought you deserved to know the truth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dennis, that means a lot\" Said The Waitress, obviously touched by Dennis's 'honesty' as the waiter approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to order?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have my usual\" Said Dennis smugly \"Please continue while I use your restroom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis vacated the table and the waiter turned to The Waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for yourself ma'am?\" He asked politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Waitress looked troubled, her head still spinning from Dennis's surprising confession. Crazy ideas surfaced in her mind as she thought on what Dennis had said, seeing an opportunity to win him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" Asked The Waiter again as she stared at him blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Sorry\" She said snapping out of her daze \"Um... What has the highest calorie and fat count out of everything you serve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Waiter looked understandably confused, but nevertheless pointed out a few items from the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... I'll take it all... Please\" She said quietly, embarrassed by her own greed \"The doctor said I was below my bmi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explanation was feeble at best and the waiter clearly didn't believe her, but nevertheless he nodded curtly and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

After what felt like eternity her several meals were served to her, along with Dennis's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this all for you ma'am?\" Asked one of the waiters, seeing her sat alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr\" She said, thinking about Dennis's amazing confession earlier \"Yes... All for me, thanks\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter looked uncertain but chose to not address the fact that there was a lot of food for such a small slim lady. When he left The Waitress took a deep breath and grabbed a fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Here we go\" She said to herself and took her first bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was delicious, and it was far from a chore to make her way through the high calorie meal. At around half way through the meal she could feel the food wall approaching, which is usually the point where she would stop eating, but remembering Dennis's words helped her power on. When she'd finished all of hers she felt uncomfortably full, and sat back in her chair groaning softly. She eyes Dennis's meal, which seemed all the more daunting after finishing her own. It was a testament to her obsession with him that, with a grunt of effort, she sat up and pulled the next meal over to herself before digging in. Other patrons were watching from the corners of their eyes as the pretty blonde began to munch away on her second meal, despite being clearly full. The Waitress ate and ate, almost zoning out as she forced more and more food into her bloated belly despite the lack of room therein. She had no idea how, but after about ten minutes she had finished Dennis's meal, and she collapsed back into her chair almost seccumbing to the food coma and falling asleep. Her eyes were closed as she shifted uncomfortably in her seat, holding her tender, taut belly as she moaned miserably. The waiter then approached her, looking a little uncomfortably by the pretty blondes gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you shan't be wanting desert?\" He said, sounding a little more judgemental than he had intended \"I mean your welcome to see the menu if you wanted to of course...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Waitress openly her eyes blearily, struggling to focus her vision on the waiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Hiccc\" She Mumbled, feeling quite food drunk and delirious from the huge amount she'd just consumed \"Your most fat-urrrrrp-tening desert... What would that be? Hiccurrrp\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Waiter looked taken aback by her insatiable appetite, before nervously pointing to a very large chocolate sundae with an infeasibly high calorie count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it hicc\" She said weakly, before leading back into her chair, closing her eyes and moaning softly once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter shrugged and left, leaving the Waitress to succumb to the food coma and doze off. When she awoke it was to the sound of the waiter clearing his throat which caused her to start and look around in cute confusion as she got her bearings back. In front of her sat an ice cream sundae of biblical proportions, and she gulped nervously to herself as the waiter handed her a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck\" He said, before scampering away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip, wondering how on earth she was going to even start let alone finish this, all the time feeling the eyes of the other restaurants patrons on her. Tentatively she loaded up her spoon and took the first gooey, chocolatey bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she'd managed to finish the gargantuan dessert the restaurant was closing. The waiters were standing around awkwardly as she finally took the last bite and collapsed back into her chair groaning, her stomach making similar miserable noises. Seeing their moment they edged forward, wanting to catch the stuffed blonde before she fell asleep again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, ma'am... We're closing\" Said one delicately, and the Waitress struggled to focus her eyes on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may need -hicccc!!!- some help guys\" She said, vaguely trying to sit up but looking like a Turtle on its back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiters exchanged looks, but realized the only way they were going to go home that night was if they got this greedy, stuffed blonde out of the restaurant. The waiters grabbed her under her arms, and with a grunt of effort hoisted her to her feet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Waitress awoke the next morning with Dennis\u2019s confession still fresh in her mind. Truth be told she really didn\u2019t want to get fat, as her self esteem was low enough it was, but she just couldn\u2019t pass up this chance to finally be with her beloved. So in this train of thought she made herself a gigantic breakfast, which almost used everything she had in her fridge, and munched through it as quickly as she could. She was hoping she could finish the huge meal before her slim tummy had a chance to realise it was full and she succeeded, though when the fullness hit her afterward it did so like a ton of bricks. She could feel her bloated tummy pushing against the waistband of her pajama bottoms, but tried to ignore it as she forced herself to stand with a groan. She hobbled to her room and got ready for work as quickly as she could, her belly churning as it tried to digest the hundreds of calories it had just consumed in such a short period of time. She then returned to the kitchen and made herself 3 very large weight gain shakes, which she planned to consume on her bus journey to work, before quickly leaving her apartment. When she arrived at the coffee shop, The Waitress was understandably very full indeed. After such a \u2018hearty\u2019 breakfast, fitting three very large weight gain shakes into her tiny tummy was one he\u2019ll of an undertaking, but never the less she doggedly persevered. Her fellow bus passengers couldn\u2019t help but watch with amazement as the petite blonde chugged down three monstrous shakes, despite how difficult it clearly was. She tried her best to collect herself as she approached her first table to take their order, but she still couldn\u2019t help stifling the odd hiccup and burp as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi-urrrp!\u201d She exclaimed immediately and blushed \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, excuse me -hicccurrrp- what can I get you? Urrrp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family exchanged glances before nervously ordering their food, trying to avoid staring at the small bump at the blondes midriff. Already the cogs were whirring in the young blondes head, as she thought about how she was going to continue her weight gain journey at work. Following a spark of inspiration, she deliberately jotted down the orders incorrectly, giving each person the largest version of the meals they had ordered. She went around each table, using the same over ordering method at each, before it was time for her to pick up the first order. The group looked at their large plates with raised eyebrows, clearly surprised at the portion sizes but decided not to question it to The Waitresses relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all for you Dennis...\u201d She muttered to herself as she returned to the kitchen for the next order.<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly (and indeed what The Waitress had intended) when she returned to the first table, a very large amount of the food remained. Between the kitchen and the Dining area was a spot where she couldn\u2019t be seen by the customers or staff, so after taking the food stacked place she headed there. It was a very risky as she began to tuck into the meals, as at any moment she could be caught stuffing her face, so she ate as quickly as she could despite her stomachs groans of protest. Stifling a burp and rearranging her waitress uniform, which was beginning to cling uncomfortably to her bloated tummy, she returned the empty plates to the kitchen before repeating the process. Half way through this mountain of food The Waitress was stuffed to the brim and really had to grit her teeth and power through to finish it. Each time the process was repeated the pretty blonde Waitress looked more worse for wear, and could be seen staggering to each table with her belly noticeably accentuated by her ever tightening and restrictive uniform. She tried her best to stifle her weary burps and hiccups but was caught offguard on a few occasions and had to apologize to the table she was waiting, her face red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Monday:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan had been working brilliantly - The Waitress had managed to get away with eating the leftovers in the annex area for the entire day, it really was an ideal spot where no wandering eyes could venture. <br>\r\nThe steadily growing blonde had managed to sample every dish that made its way back to the kitchen, and as she neared the end of her shift it looked like she would get away with it again. While it was obvious that The Waitress had been pushing herself all day, the results were even more so - she couldn't help but feel like a pig as her packed stomach gurgled its way through the latest leftovers, creamy pasta still dotting the corner of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one couple left - a thin man and woman who had just been seated a few minutes ago, and while The Waitress was feeling pretty full from her gourmet gauntlet, she figured that she definitely handle the last hour of her shift without issue.<br>\r\nBrushing the hair out of her eyes and collecting the plates from the latest order, she gathered all of the untouched meals onto one plate before stacking the rest underneath and whisking them away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs The Waitress made her way to the annex, the nearest table where the young couple was seated took notice. <br>\r\n\"Um... we're ready to order now.\" The petite brunette piped up. <br>\r\n'Shit. This is going to have to be a meal on wheels...' The Waitress thought to herself. <br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be right back!\" The Waitress shot out as sweetly as she could before disappearing behind the counter and out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second, she was crouched down near the floor and bringing up forkful after forkful from the plate to her mouth. She had always loved pasta, but with the rather limited menu at her work and days spent digging into similar dishes she was beginning to tire of it. Still, she used the fork to scoop up the remnants of sauce and Parmesan noodles at a record pace, knowing that she would need to return to the customers very soon. <br>\r\nGulping down the last straggling limp noodle, The Waitress steadied the collection of plates and propped herself up with the counter, and headed around the blind corner into the kitchen. The commotion inside of clanging dishes, hydrant-like spray from the sink and orders shouted over the resulting cacophony meant she could pretty much slip in and out undetected every single time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down the plates delicately next to the sink, The Waitress spun on her heel and left the din of the kitchen to her waiting customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry about that.\" The Waitress offered as she made her way nearer to the table, \"What can I get you guys?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeh...could we get the... Veal Parmesan to share?\" The brunette handed her back the menu.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" The waitress chirped as she began to write the order down on her notepad, \"And to drink?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh... um... what do you have?\"<br>\r\nThe Waitress didn't even have to think before the rehearsed pitch left her mouth. <br>\r\n\"We have a number of house wines that pair really well with Veal Parmesan, there's the- <br>\r\n\"Oh, just water then - I'm on a diet,\" The brunette interrupted, \"Red wine is like, way too many calories.\"<br>\r\nThe Waitress raised an eyebrow. 'Duly noted...' she thought.<br>\r\n\"Alright, you guys just sit tight and...\" The Waitress gathered the remaining menu from the brunettes boyfriend, \"I'll be back with all of that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned, the Waitress spotted a recently dined-in table on the opposite side of the room, normally she would have zeroed in in on the tip, but now she only had eyes for the half finished Beef Stroganoff. Gathering the plates and pocketing the tip, The Waitress retreated to the familiar area just beyond the counter and crouched down out of sight once more.<br>\r\nThe Waitress only managed to shovel in a few mouthfuls of Stroganoff before her stomach began to audibly protest - after all, in the first hour of her shift she had managed to eat enough half-finished servings to equate to at least three pretty substantial meals, but she pressed on regardless.<br>\r\n\"Hic! Ooh...\" She was really feeling how heavy the pasta felt now, especially as it sat rather brick-like in her stomach, her shirt barely capable of hiding her steadily rounding form.  \"For Dennis...\" The Waitress reminded herself under her breath before filling her cheeks with another helping, \"Every bite...mmmrrp\" she mumbled with her mouth full, \"...for Dennis.\" <br>\r\nRiding on her new-found wave of motivation, The Waitress ate through each bite with determination, all the while feeling more and more full by the second.<br>\r\nStruggling, she swallowed the last mouthful which seemed to settle heavily in her stomach, a dull pain making itself known as she tried to stand. <br>\r\n\"Whew...\" The Waitress exhaled as she rose to her feet - to the onlookers it appeared as though the poor woman had just swallowed a bowling ball, and that was a pretty apt description for how it left her feeling as well. <br>\r\nOpening the door as the roar of kitchen activity seemed to spike audibly, The Waitress delivered the plates to the sink and sought out the nearest Chef, though her rushed jog seemed to wind her a bit, especially after her latest meal.  <br>\r\n\"Veal Parmesan!\" she called out, catching the attention of the Chef over the noisy kitchen, unfortunately her next breath caught in her throat, leaving her to wheeze out a considerably softer \"for table two...\"  <br>\r\n\"For who?\" the Chef reacted, leaving the now-panting Waitress to become annoyed.<br>\r\n\"I said...\" The Waitress returned, starting to catch her breath, \"...for two...\"<br>\r\nUttering a satisfied grunt in response, the Chef prepped the dish while The Waitress made her way back to the dining room with two glasses of water.<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be too long now,\" The Waitress remarked huskily as she set down the glasses, \"Our head chef makes the <i>best</i> Veal Parmesan.\" <br>\r\nIt wasn't a lie either, the Waitress mused, she had done enough taste testing in the preceding days to have some sort of authority on the matter. <br>\r\nPacing the rest of the dining room as she did her rounds, The Waitress soon found herself back behind the counter, though this time she choose to stand out of view rather than crouch. <br>\r\nChecking the kitchen door out of the corner of her eye, The Waitress found her hands moving down towards her midsection as she rubbed her stomach. Oof. <br>\r\nHer previously toned figure was now anything but, a rather pronounced belly pushing painfully against her jeans. <br>\r\n'I don't I should eat anymore...' The Waitress thought warily as she felt her growing form. 'But...could I eat anymore?' <br>\r\nShe fumbled briefly with the button on her jeans, snapping them open and allowing her stomach to surge forward now free. <br>\r\n'I think... Dennis would want me to have more...' Now that thought was in her head she had difficulty shaking it. <br>\r\n'Dennis would want me to have... a lot more.' She pursed her lips as she continued to rub, finding her own mental state somewhere between hopelessly romantic and extremely eager to please. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" A voice called out from the now-open kitchen door causing The Waitress to jump. \"Order's up.\"  In the few seconds that the door had swung shut again, the flushed Waitress tried to recompose herself, and then followed suit into the kitchen. <br>\r\nGrabbing the plates, The Waitress returned to the dining room and began to set down the dishes.<br>\r\n\"And here...\" she began, \"is your Veal Parmas-\"<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" the brunette interrupted, \"We only wanted one of those, to share... remember?\"<br>\r\n'Shit!' The Waitress screamed in her head, suddenly very aware that she was in fact carrying two plates when only one was wanted. <br>\r\n\"I'm so, so sorry... there, there was a miscommunication in the kitchen, I um...\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" the boyfriend offered, diffusing the situation, \"We'll just take this one here.\"<br>\r\n\"Right.\" The Waitress responded dumbly as she handed over the plate. \"Um, enjoy guys!\" <br>\r\nTurning on her heel she retreated back towards the kitchen, trying to hide the shade of crimson that had invaded her cheeks. <br>\r\nSuddenly, the Waitress stopped herself just behind the counter as another realization washed over her. 'I can't bring this back into the kitchen like this, getting the orders right is like, half my job...' She weighed her options. 'Well, they'll either make me pay for it or... I'll get fired. Not exactly the gamble I want to take right now...'<br>\r\nAnd that left only final option, disposing the evidence.<br>\r\nStaring down at the very full plate in silent horror, The Waitress realized what she had to do, and so did her stomach as it let out a painful gurgle.<br>\r\nBringing a reluctant forkful to her mouth, The Waitress took the first bite of many, working it over with her tongue and swallowing her regret topped with creamy Parmesan sauce. The next bite was even worse, she breathed low wondering if it was all about to come back up again, but then perished the thought with the next forkful. Then another. And then another. \"Ooh...\" she groaned before hiccuping. And so it went, with every mouthful to the final forkful that had been raised dizzily to her lips, until at last The Waitress had finished the whole plate. Hiding the empty plate underneath the counter, the bloated blonde made her way back to the dining room, her stomach absolutely stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Waitress arrived at the table with a few unsteady steps, and collected the couples shared plate which now had nothing left but a bit of residual sauce like her own.<br>\r\n\"Can I get you guys some dessert?\" The Waitress offered out of habit more than anything.<br>\r\n\"Mmm.. no thank you,\" the brunette answered, dabbing her cheek with a napkin, \"That was already <i>really</i> filling even with just the two of us.\" <br>\r\nShe put her napkin away before adding, \"I couldn't imagine eating an entire one by myself.\"<br>\r\n'Ugh... you have no idea.' the Waitress thought to herself, her stomach ebbing with painful reality. <br>\r\n\"We'll just get the bill.\" The boyfriend added, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\nThe Waitress nodded curtly and headed back towards the front counter to the register, stacking their plate atop hers as she took them all into the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Although she was only a few months into her internship, but so far she hadn't gotten along very well with the Latina nurse. In Elliot's opinion, Carla was very condescending for someone who hadn't been to medical school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Doctor.\" Carla said as Elliot walked up to the bedside, and Elliot listened carefully for any hint of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes. Good morning. And how are you feeling this morning Mrs Reinholt?\" Elliot asked, surreptitiously scanning the chart for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I was just telling Carla here, I still have this terrible cough.\" The elderly woman said, patting Carla's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiled. \"I recommend a limited dosage of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute, Nurse Espinosa.\" Elliot interrupted, emphasising the word nurse. She knew it was harsh, but she was annoyed by Carla's easy rapport with patients. She squinted at the chart, trying to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I will, um, request some more tests and get back to you as soon as possible.\" She said, unable to think of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and began to walk out, but Carla intercepted her before she got out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I really think...\" Carla began, but Elliot cut her off once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to hear what you think okay?\" She said quietly, so Mrs Reinholt wouldn't hear. \"Keep your advice to yourself, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla frowned, then noticed the mop bucket that the Janitor had placed down just outside the doorway, right next to Elliot's foot. \"Yes, Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Elliot said, and with that she turned to exit the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shriek, followed rapidly by a loud crash and a splash of soapy water. After a few seconds, there was an extra-long, extra-loud cry of \"Frick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get why I'm here, but don't you hate Elliot?\" JD asked as they rode the elevator up to Elliot's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I don't hate her, I just... Shut up.\" Carla elbowed him, almost causing him to drop the basket of mini-muffins he was carrying. In truth, she was feeling pretty guilty. She had only wanted to take Elliot down a peg, not leave her with a broken ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the door, and JD rang the bell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" Came the muffled response. Three minutes of cringing at every thump and groan later, the door swung open, revealing Elliot leaning heavily on a pair of aluminium crutches. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and she wore a pink tank top and grey track pants, the left leg of which had been neatly cut off just below the knee, exposing a thick plaster cast that was still dazzlingly white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi JD. Oh, and, um, hi.\" She said, after noticing Carla standing just behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence as Elliot limped back to the couch, which JD attempted to fill. \"Wow, this place is amazing. What a view!\" He said, gesturing to Elliot's admittedly spacious apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this failed to elicit a response, he tried a new tack. \"We brought mini-muffins, there's one of every flavour.\" He placed the basket down on the coffee table, next to the cushion on which Elliot's foot rested, her pink toes peeking out of the tip of the cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks JD.\" Elliot said with a tired smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Did they say when you'll be able to come back to work?\" JD ventured casually, as Carla perched herself awkwardly on the arm of a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot let out a drawn out sigh, leaning forward to grab one of the muffins. \"They say it'll be at least three months, maybe four. I'm not even supposed to be using these crutches yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bite of the muffin, then continued, sounding more emotional. \"It's just, I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't cook, I can't get groceries, I can't do my laundry...\" She was on the verge of tears now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could help you!\" Carla blurted out, unable to contain herself. Both Elliot and JD looked at her with surprise. <br>\r\n\"I could come over once a day and help you out, run errands, cook meals, whatever you need.\" Carla continued, desperately seeking a way to salve her conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Elliot asked, sniffing and wiping her eyes. \"Carla, that would be, well, amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla nodded, already feeling better about herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot perked up after that, and after a pleasant half hour of light conversation, they arranged for Carla to drop by after her shift the next day. After saying good night, she and JD were back in the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Carla, that was really nice of you.\" JD said, as they descended to the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know me.\" Carla brushed off the compliment. \"Besides, how bad could it be?\"</span></div></div>",

What do you need me to do?\" Carla asked, trying to sound casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot, dressed in the same clothes as yesterday except with her hair down,  looked bashful. \"Well, there's some laundry in a basket in my room, um, the grocery list is on the fridge, and I guess, if you could make some dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla nodded, determined to not let it  be awkward. \"Great.

She turned on the machines and went back upstairs to tidy the apartment a little, ignoring Elliot's weak protests. She just straightened and tidied, although she couldn't help but notice that the entire basket of mini-muffins had been emptied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the list and Elliot's credit card, she headed to the grocery store, after transferring the laundry to the dryers. She picked up everything on the list, getting double the amount of ice-cream because it was on sale, and a few extra things for the meal she had planned. She got back to the apartment, hauling grocery bags in one hand and the nearly folded laundry in the other, letting herself in with Elliot's spare key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting away her clothes, Carla made a quick salad to tide Elliot over, before starting to cook the main meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that smells good! What are you making?\" Elliot asked, over the hiss of hot oil. She had relaxed a little bit, possibly as a result of her pain medication. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empanadas.\" Carla explained, carrying out a plateful. \"It's chicken, cheese and vegetables all wrapped up in little parcels of fried dough. It's a family recipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot thanked her profusely as she tucked into the delicious food, finishing the entire plate in minutes. A second soon followed, and then a third. By the time Carla had finished packing another two dozen empanadas into Tupperware containers for tomorrow, Elliot was positively stuffed, her round stomach peeking out from under her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Carla brought out one of the tubs of ice-cream she had bought, handing Elliot a spoon and a bottle of chocolate sauce. She had already made a noticeable dent in it by the time Carla finished washing up the dishes, and pulled on her coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Elliot, those Tupperware containers are in the fridge, they'll be fine cold, or just two minutes in the microwave.\" Carla said, trying not to let her tiredness show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much Carla, u honestly don't know what I'd do without you.\" Elliot said, after swallowing a large mouthful of ice-cream. \"Same time tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later...</span></div></div>",

It was obvious to most that there was nothing really wrong with Mr. Tarrenger (when it came to his health, not his personality) as he was not much of a good actor, so his feeble cries of pain and stupid complaints fooled nobody. The only real reason why he was taking up space at Sacred Heart Hospital was because he had a thing for young female nurses, and had enough money to ensure that he could do whatever he wished. Unfortunately for Elliot, she seemed to receive the brunt of his affections and she was beginning to tire of his crude comments and overall attitude. She exhaled sharply as she turned the knob on the door and entered the room where Mr. Tarrenger lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Mr. Tarrenger\u201d She said, forcing a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there blondie\u201d Tarrenger said in his usual slimy tone as he eyed Elliot\u2019s assets without any subtly whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the results for your tests\u2026 And it would appear that your fine\u201d Said Elliot, a vague edge of triumph to her voice, even though she knew what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tarrenger regarded the cute blond doctor for a moment before he spoke, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better I would of thought you wanted to get rid of me\u201d He said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just what your test said\u2026\u201d Began Elliot, but was cut off by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob Kelso walked in and Elliot\u2019s eyes fell to her shoes as he approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh hey there sport\u201d He said jovially to Elliot, \u201cI was wondering if I may have a word with you in the hall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Bob\u201d Said Mr. Tarrenger, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Karl, hope you don\u2019t mind\u2026 just need a word with young\u2026\u201d Kelso stopped and gave Elliot a meaningful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElliot\u201d She said miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, Elliot\u2026 Won\u2019t be a moment Karl\u201d Said Kelso as he steered Elliot outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Kelso say?</span></div></div>",

Karl was delighted as he watched the gorgeous blonde demean herself in such a way, and allow him to chart her progress. It wasn't just Karl Tarrenger who observed Eliots new gluttonous behaviour however, as her new uncharacteristic eating habits were garnering attention from several of her friends and fellow co workers. The following day in the cafeteria, Carla frowned as her friend began piling the unhealthiest foods on offer onto her plate, not stopping until it was stacked high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be... Err... Real hungry today\" Said Carla tactfully, trying to hide her concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah? Said Eliot \"Its been a long day y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla nodded but her frown remained as she watched Eliot take a deep breath of preparation before she tore into her titanic meal. It wasn't long before the pair were joined by JD and Turk, each of whom generally chose rather large meals at the cafeteria but even they were taken aback by the size of Eliots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eliot\" Said JD, sounding as chirpy as always though his face mirrored the concerned frown of Carlas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot grunted a response through a mouthful of food, not even looking up from her plate to acknowledge her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, in deep concentration huh?\" He said \"Yeah i get that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot didn't say a word for the remainder of the lunch period, choosing instead to focus her full attention on eating. The food wall hit at about half way, but she forced herself past it with commendable spirit continueing to gorge herself much to the bewilderment of her friends. Finally when she'd finished her meal, which would have been enough for both JD and Turk, she pushed her chair out from the table and loosened the string on the waistband of her scrubs to let them out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.. Urrp...\" She groaned as she rubbed her incredibly full tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive\" Said Turk \"You know I bet we could enter you in an eating contest and you'd win... Alls I'm sayin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Turk\" Scaulded Carla \"Eliot, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'... Fine... Hic!\" Murmured Eliot, her eyes half closed in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say Carla was not convinced of her friends wellbeing, but decided to probe no further... For the time being at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch Eliot reluctantly returned to Karls room, and as soon as she entered he forced a large cup of weight gain shake into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink it\" He said, smiling the same creepy smile Eliot was accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" She growled angrily and after a few moments gulped down the calorific mixture into her groaning belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the scales if you please\" Said Karl motioning toward the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot shot him a dangerous look, but never the less she swallowed the remains of her weight gain shake and complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see it from here, what does it say?\" Karl called over from his bed and Eliot gritted her teeth angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"124\" She said, her voice displaying both anger and sorrow at the discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've gained...\" Said Karl, trailing off with the intention of Eliot filling in the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost ten frickin pounds!\" She yelled, her cheeks going pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Not bad for a few days work\" Commented Karl, obviously eyeing up the pretty blonde doctor to see if he could see the extra weight on her slender body \"Just think about how big your going to be in a months time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot almost teared up at the thought, but was determined to not give Karl the satisfaction of seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week progressed in much the same manner as the beginning had, though Eliots friends concerns grew with each day. She continued to stuff herself silly, giving no explanation whatsoever as to her new gluttony and barely communicating at all. She had decided that there was no point in explaining her situation to them, reasoning that it would just further complicate the situation with Karl and Kelso which could potentially negatively effect her job. Each day Eliot found that she could eat just a little bit more, and that she often felt hungry despite having recently eaten. This could be attributed to the weight gain shakes that Karl had been forcing her to drink, because aside from being extremely fattening they also contained ingredients which tricked the body into feelings of hunger. Little did poor Eliot know that the more she ate, the more addicted to eating she became and this really started to show more and more as she was beginning to snack more and more between meals, seemingly without even realizing she was doing it. Her weigh in the next day showed a further gain of six pounds (putting her at 130) and Karl smiled as he looked her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those baggy scrubs are looking a little less baggy today\" He said, practically licking his lips as he saw a little extra weight on her rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh go to frickin hell\" She growled before storming out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um do you really think you should be eating here?\" Asked Carla, \"And also do you ever stop eating? If your not careful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Carla\" Snapped Eliot through a mouthful of cruller, that she hadn't really noticed she was eating until now \"I skipped breakfast this morning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't true of course, because Eliot had in fact had a rather substantial breakfast consisting of a generous stack of pancakes (they were also very generously drenched in syrup) but she didn't want Carla to poke her nose into this any more than she already was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just looking out for you...\" Said Carla, sounding anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" Said Eliot, a little guilty for having snapped at her well meaning friend \"But I'm fine...honestly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eliot was weighed that day Karl was rather happy to see that she was munching on a Danish while she stood on the scales (and she gulped down the weight gain shake in record time). The scales showed a six and a half pound gain (136.5 pounds total weight) , and to his delight her body showed it to. It wasn't exactly super obvious but to somebody with the obsession of Karl, the new slight bulge of her stomach and butt was very obvious indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmmmm\" He exclaimed \"Looks like you got abit of extra jello on that donut\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shuddup\" Said Eliot through a mouthful of Danish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl grinned at the beautiful young blonde... He loved teasing her about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's your patient doing?\" Asked Kelso when Eliot was on her way back from lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... Y'know...\" Said Eliot trying to sound positive, whilst biting into a donut \"Great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso frowned as he watched her raise the remains of the donut to her mouth and pop it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll overlook the fact your stuffing your face in the hospital if you can assure me that Karl is being taken good care of\" Said Bob Kelso, with a slight aire of danger to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you he is *munch*\" Said Eliot uncaring, swallowing the last piece of donut \"In fact my new eating habits are because of him... He told me to get fatter for his own sick amusement\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliots blunt honesty took Kelso off guard, and his eyes involuntarily wandered down Eliots body to the slight bulge at her midriff, which provided proof that her statement was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

To fulfil some kind of sick fantasy?\" Said Kelso, seemingly outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso's tone caught Eliot's interest, and for a moment she saw a glimmer of hope; a way out of her forced gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-hicc! Yes!\" She stammered through a mouthful of donut \"Its totally sick what he's doing! I mean look at me for fricks sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot presented Kelso with a side on view of her body, gripping her belly to show off the extra weight which had accumulated there curiosity of Mr. Tarranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how awful\" Said Kelso \"Have no fear, I will straighten this out at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kelso stormed away towards Karl's room, leaving Eliot looking relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard what you've been doing to Dr. Reid\" Said Bob Kelso sounding stern \"And all I have to say is... How's that going? Is she pleasing you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah its going fine I guess\" Said Karl, not sounding overly enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything that I can do to... Improve your stay here at Sacred Heart?\" Asked Kelso, and Karl grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you asked Bob\" He replied, the same nasty smile on his face \"Here's a list of things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl handed Kelso a list, which Kelso now read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... You have very unique tastes\" He said to himself \"But it will be done, don't worry I plan to make your stay here as pleasurable as possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Bob\" Said Karl \"I knew I could rely on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eliot walked into Karls room next she had a new spring in her step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello nurse\" He said brightly \"Your just in time for your weighing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot gave him a defiant look, placing her hands on her slightly thicker hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think so Karl\" She said \"This whole fattening me up for your own sick fantasies is done! So there will be no more gaining weight or charting my progress, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that so?\" Said Karl, amused at the pretty blondes misplaced confidence \"And why is that may I ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Said Eliot darkly \"I happened to inform Dr. Kelso about our little arrangement... And needless to say he was equally as disgusted and outraged as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm interesting...\" He said, examining his watch nonchalantly \"Very interesting indeed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot frowned at Karls reaction, and stared on in confusion as he counted backwards from 5. When he reached zero Eliot heard the sounds of squeaking wheels approaching the room. She turned to see a large cart, being pushed by none other than Bobs dogsbody Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Dr. Reid\" Said Ted, sweating from pushing the cart \"Here's, um, well... You know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled a sheet off the top of the cart to reveal....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" Said Eliot, her fear growing at what Ted had just revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was what appeared to be a rather sexy nurse outfit, clearly designed by those with a kink for such things. It was composed of a white, lace up, pvc corset top with fluffy red trim, a red cross and a rather deep cleavage to further show off those assets. At the bottom there were red bows which in turn attached to ribbon suspenders for white fish net stockings. To finish it off there were also red stilettos, white silk gloves and a pvc nurse hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That my dear\" Said Karl, smiling unpleasantly \"Is your new uniform... Which if you wish to keep your job you will wear until you become to fat to fit into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot was stunned by the sudden change in fortune, and it slowly dawned on her that Kelso had actually betrayed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be frickin kiddin me...\" She said quietly \"There's no way... I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you will my dear\" Said Karl \"And you will do so right now... Get changed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot stared from Karl to Ted, hoping for some help from Kelso's dogsbody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" He said, not meeting her gaze \"There's also something under the trolly for you... Sorry again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shuffled uncomfortably from the room as Eliot grimly pulled the sheet back further to reveal what else awaited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course\" Said Eliot bitterly, as she saw a large amount of cakes and pastries \"That's just great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Karls unashamed stared Eliot slowly stripped from her scrubs into her underwear. As she did she couldn't help but notice the extra weight that she had so cruelly been forced to add to her body and her mood dropped even further if possible. The outfit felt rather tight on her, which she realised was probably the point, and the bottom did nothing to hide her silk white panties which were on show to everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look wonderful sweetie!\" Said Karl happily \"Now get stuck in! Your looking rather hungry after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot glared at Karl, focusing all her energy into giving the most poisonous look possible but this just seemed to amuse him further. Glumly, Eliot grabbed a donut from the trolly and got \"stuck in\" as she had been told to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eliot had literally just eaten before coming to Karls room, it was rather a tall order for her to finish the whole trolley of snacks but nevertheless she stuffed her face for Karls pleasure. She realized that her food capacity was definitely increasing, which she grimly noted meant that her weight would begin increasing much quicker than it already was. When she'd finished the last bite she rearranged the pvc corset which was punching uncomfortably below her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!\" Said Karl, clearly impressed \"What a good little piglet you are... Looks like you need to let your uniform out a little though, sounds like its straining a little trying to contain your belly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Hiccc- oh bite me\" She responded weakly, though she followed Karls advise and undid the lace on her corset allowing her belly room to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scales time tubby\" Ordered Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot staggered to the scales, the mixture of food induced fatigue and large stilettos throwing her off balance somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"140 Urrrrp!\" Said Eliot weakly \"You happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm extremely happy!\" Said Karl, almost in awe of his own handiwork \"Every new bulge to your thickening frame brings me untold happiness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot absent mindedly squeezed her growing belly flab which was packed tightly into her sexy nurse outfit, her thoughts on the hopeless predicament she found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day the interns were huddled around a patient as Dr. Kelso gave one of his trademark patronising Q &amp; A's. After asking a complicated technical question on the best way to help treat the patient he stopped and stared expectantly at the largely blank faced group of aspiring doctors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the best thing to do would be...\" Began JD, giving his own expert analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob Kelso frowned as he looked over the group, not even listening to the answer JD was giving as he searched out the blonde head of Eliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't possibly be that stupid\" He muttered to himself as JD finished, believing that Eliot was skiving work in order to avoid her obligation to Karl \"Oh erm, yes good answer sport!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD smiled, looking around smugly at the rest of his peers just as the harsh click clack of heels sounded on the floor of the wing. The group turned at Kelso smiled as he saw Eliot approaching them, her expression clearly forlorn. To the complete disbelief of her fellow colleagues, Eliot was still dressed in her new 'uniform', the pvc fabric of which squeaked with each step she took as it was clearly too small for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhkay\" Said JD, breaking the silence \"Um... Did I oversleep for a few months last night and its now Halloween?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Bambi\" Replied Carla, her unblinking gaze not leaving Eliot \"No it is not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay cool\" Said JD, seemingly relieved \"You'd tell me if that did happen though right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh Doctor Reed\" Said Bob Kelso, smiling \"So glad of you to join us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm, um, late sir\" She stammered, glowing red as she rearranged her tight pvc nurse costume \"Its hard to walk in these heels\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh don't you worry\" He said in a misleadingly warm tone \"You only work in a hospital, where every second means life and death... Now, where was I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso then continued and the groups focus turned from Eliot back to him. Carla however turned to her friend, wanting to know exactly what the hell she was doing. Before she could open her mouth however Eliot was tapped on the shoulder by Ted, who was holding a large box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From um... You know who... Sorry\" He said awkwardly, and turned to walk away before adding \"Karl that is, not the dark lord Voldemort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Carla exasperated stare Eliot opened the box to reveal several rows of glistening, glazed donuts of many colours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot be serious!\" Carla said, attempting a whisper but failing \"Whats going on with you Eliot??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin\" Replied Eliot robotically, as she took her first bite of donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not nothing!\" Replied Carla, her voice rising causing a few heads to turn \"Eliot, your getting fat! You barely fit that ridiculous outfit! Why are you wearing that??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot sighed as she swallowed the first donut, she knew every word was true but she felt so powerless. She could feel her breasts bulging above her skin tight outfit, while the middle bunched uncomfortably around her growing midriff and thicker hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Clearly there were no lengths that Kelso wouldn't go to satisfy Karls needs, who viewed the hospital as his own personal hotel rather than a medical practice. Telling Carla about it could well endanger her job security, but as Eliot stood there with the tight PVC nurse outfit she'd been forced to wear squeezing the extra body fat she'd been forced to gain she decided she didn't care anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's making me do this\" She said under her breath \"Kelso is making me do whatever Karl tells me to... And it turns out he has some kind of fat nurse fetish, as you can see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla looked even more shocked and horrified, if that were possible, and merely stared back with her mouth agape as her brain struggled to process the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill him\" She said finally \"I am going to walk up there and kill Bob Kelso with my bare hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no\" Said Eliot, holding Carlas arm after a few moments of seriously allowing her friend to launch herself at Kelso \"Don't...

He had a broad smile on his face as they glared back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eliots informed me about your disgusting plan\" Said Carla angrily, her hands on her hips \"Have you no shame at all you pervert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you weirdo\" Eliot chimed in, her bulkier frame obviously squeezed into her tight pvc nurse outfit which squeaked when she moved \"How could you do this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's easy\" Replied Karl \"Because it was enormous fun to turn you into a fatass, and believe me... I'm nowhere near done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliots cheeks flushed pink and she pouted which only made her look sexier to Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here\" Said Carla, her eyes darkening \"You'd better leave my friend alone! You will not force her to gain a single pound more or you'll be in trouble\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really\" Said Karl with wry amusement \"What do you think Bob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is all very interesting\" Replied Kelso from behind the girls, causing Eliot you jump which made her tits jiggle and bounce \"Very interesting indeed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you!\" Said Carla, turning her anger on her boss \"How could you side with this pervert?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Reed\" Said Bob, ignoring Carla completely \"Please reciprocate the talk we had to your friend here...

I can't remember it word for word exactly...\" Said Eliot nervously \"But basically it centred around being run by money... And Karl has money so what he says goes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eloquently put sport!\" Said Kelso, flip flopping from an angry attitude to a jovial one as he often did \"Which means if you value your own job you will obey... Or your husbands\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a grim silence as the words sank in and Carlas face slowly dropped and her anger shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't... You can't...\" She said, realizing all too late that she should not have got involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will and can\" Said Kelso simply \"You poked your nose in where it didn't belong Missy... What do you think Karl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl looked the girls up and down, and Carla's lip quivered as she also looked at her slightly chunky friend squeezed into her sexy outfit, realizing that she would soon be sharing the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm\" Said Karl as he looked the beautiful young latino up and down \"Looks like this one had a bit of a head start on our other chubby nurse... Nice ghetto booty... But i think she'd look a lot better with even more meat on her bones\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But... No...\" Stammered Carla, though she knew it was futile \"This can't be happening... I don't want to be fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the record I didn't want to be fat either\" Said Eliot quietly \"But look at me now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" Said Karl \"Would you be so kind to fetch me the necessary to welcome my new guest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed nodded grimly, disappearing from the room before returning pushing a trolley that Eliot recognized immediately. The trolley was laden with all kinds of junk food, and also to Carlas dismay another latex nurse outfit that matched Eliots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that's all sorted I think ill take my leave\" Said Bob \"And leave you in the very capable hands of Karl here. Good day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob and Ted then left the room, leaving Karl alone with the girls once more. In the space of a few minutes the atmosphere had completely changed, and it would have been an understatement to say that Carla had had the wind taken out of her sails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well get dressed then\" Said Karl \"We'd better get started, you've got some catching up to do if your going to get as fat as your chubby friend here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla went scarlet in the face, but nevertheless proceeded to obey after muttering some rather unladylike curses. There was nowhere in the room for her to change in private, and Eliot seemed to notice her looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not an oversight\" She said miserably \"He will want to watch you change... Believe me i know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is happening\" Said Carla mournfully as she slowly started to get unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl practically licked his lips at the sight of Carlas bare curves, primarily her juicy rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to be such a sexy fatty\" He commented \"I bet it mostly goes to your fat ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bite me\" Said Carla hotly as she slowly pulled her new sexy latex nurse outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

As they each grabbed something from it they heard a click and a whirr from behind them, and they turned back to find Karl holding a camcorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" He said \"But I think I'm going to want to document this... For future viewing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you do-mrrrf-\" Said Carla coldly just as Eliot pushed a heavily frosted bear claw into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla swallowed and sighed before returning the favour to Eliot, pushing a twinkie into her friends mouth. Karl looked even more overjoyed than usual, now he had two sexy gaining nurses to entertain him rather than one. He loved how different both of their bodies were, and he was very interested to see who would pack on fat where. Eliot clearly had a head start, but Carla had probably been meatier than her starting off, as her accentuated booty proved which looked gorgeous in the white latex of her outfit. Karl leaned back and relaxed, resting the camera in his lap as he watched the two nurses feed each other. After a while the cart supplies began to dwindle and the feeding slowed as the nurses began feeling full, something which was not helped by their constrictive latex get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok guys\" Said Karl suddenly, raising the camera from his lap \"Would you like to share any thoughts or feelings to the camera? And remember, really sell this... Otherwise there will be consequences\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nurses exchanged miserable glances before sighing and turning to face the camera and Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... How do you feel Eliot?\" Asked Karl \"Oh and would you please continue feeding each other while you answer me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't have to be told twice and glumly continued stuffing each other silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel completely humiliated and ridiculous -Ullp!\" Said Carla flatly as she received another mouthful of donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why\" Said Karl gravely \"It wasn't so long ago that you were a perfectly slim and attractive young woman, now look at you! Your clearly too fat for that stupid outfit your wearing, thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" Stammered Eliot, a tear rolling down her cheek as Carla reluctantly fed her more \"Mrrrff! Hicccurrrp! Yes your right... I'm becoming quite a tub of lard, and everybody can see it. Especially in this silly tight outfit, you can actually see my fat rolls squished into it -Mmrrrff!-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes indeed I can\" Said Karl happily \"Such a pretty little porker your becoming... Now how about you Carla? Seeing your chubby little friend here, getting fatter by the second, how does it feel knowing you'll soon be just as big and fat as her... Perhaps even more so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc!\" Exclaimed Carla weakly, her eyes drooping \"I... Im not too happy about it... I don't want to be fat like you've made Eliot... But I guess that's out of my control\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very true\" Said Karl \"But I'm still sensing some resistance from you my dear... Lets see how long that continues for\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl watched as the pair fed each other the remainder of the trolley, and upon each of them swallowing the last morsel they slunk slowly and miserably to the floor. He chuckled to himself as he saw their pvc outfits bunch noticeably around their bloated mid sections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, well done girls\" Said Karl \"I think that was a very good welcome for Carla here, you truly made a pig of yourself.. Now, you know the drill Eliot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot sighed, stifling a burp as she groggily rose to her feet and helped Carla up to, rearranging her tight and uncomfortable outfit as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to weigh ourselves\" She exclaimed glumly to Carla, who was far too stuffed to offer any opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo Eliot, what's the damage?\" Asked Karl, clearly very happy indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc! 148...\" She said groggily, mortified at her ever increasing waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Said Karl, clearly impressed with his own handiwork \"You are fattening up very nicely indeed... Yes... Now, how about you Carla? How much are you now and what were you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was 124 this morning... I'm 130 now\" She answered glumly, staring at her stilettos \"So thank you very much for making me gain six pounds in a day you freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot shot Carla a warning look, knowing that Karl would likely punish her worse for any more of her sass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'm a busy man afterall, so maybe we should kick it up a notch, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot scowled at Carla, knowing that her attitude had caused this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly are you going to make this sick fantasy of yours any worse?\" Demanded Carla, her anger getting the better of her as it so often did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be telling\" Answered Karl cryptically \"And I think it would be much more entertaining for you to discover that yourself! I'm tired now anyway so you can leave now, but don't go too far... I will be demanding your presence when i wake up. Good day ladies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses mumbled a grumpy response before shuffling miserably from the room. Out in the corridor Eliot slapped Carla's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane?! You've just made things even worse!\" Yelled Eliot in exasperation, then following a glare from Carla shrank slightly \"Sorry... I was mad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy just really drives me crazy!\" Said Carla \"How can we just let him get away with this? How have you gone this long living like this? Its completely insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What choice do we have?\" Said Eliot, absent mindedelly adjusting her subtly tighter nurse outfit \"If we don't do what he says then we're most likely both out of a job...

They climbed into their bunk beds before drifting off to sleep, their full bellies gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day the girls climbed groggily out of bed and pulled on their hated new sexy nurse uniforms. Eliot clearly had more trouble in doing so than Carla, as the outfit was probably a couple of sizes too small for her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frick... If I carry on like this your going to have to grease me up to get me into this stupid fricking thing!\" She said testily when she had finally managed to squeeze into the skin tight latex nurse uniform \"Look at me! I'm becoming a beached whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it makes you feel any better it won't be long before I am to\" Said Carla gravelly \"Lets just go down to the cafeteria, at least we have a little time to ourselves... Even if we are dressed like morons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nurses went down to the cafeteria and approached the main counter to order breakfast. Unwilling to do Karls work for him both of them were planning  order the healthiest breakfast possible with a coffee on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill have a bowl and Muesli\" Said Carla \"And a large black coffee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Said the cashier \"I can't do that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Said Carla, putting her hands on her hips and fixing the cashier with a withering look \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um new policy has been introduced\" Relief the cashier nervously \"You two can't order here... You can only eat, um, over there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier pointed across the room where Carla and Eliot noticed, with wide eyed disbelief, a large picture of each of them adorning the wall. Underneath the pictures was a plack that read \"Eliot feeding station\" and \"Carla feeding station\"and below this was a long tube protruding from a big box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be fricking kidding me\" Exclaimed Eliot in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good morning girls\" Came the jovial tone of Bob Kelso from behind them \"Please follow me to your seats\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls rounded their mortified and confused countenances on him and he merely grinned back. He lead them over to their individual feeding stations, as Carla struggled to find words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this\" She stammered as she was sat in her chair \"This is insane! I thought you were using Karls money to run the hospital... Not this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but this is an investment, Sport\" Replied Kelso \"What we're doing here is keeping Mr.Tarranger interested and entertained... The longer we are able to do this, the longer he'll be compelled to stay here. Isn't that right Karl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh yess\" Came a very recognisable voice that caused the girls to flush in rage \"I think I'm going to be here for a long time if you keep me entertained like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. But...\" Stammered Eliot in horror \"You can't mrrrrff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Sport\" Said Kelso as cafeteria staff sat the girls down and attached the hoses to their mouths \"Be a trooper and put on a show for our valued patient. Karl if you could do the honors\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh with pleasure\" Said Karl, pulling a lever on the feeding stations and a pumping sound became audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the girls heads was a light up display, which showed the girls weights to all and any further weight gained thereafter. The girls just had time to exchange miserable looks before  a sweet, porridge like mixture pumped down the tubes and into their mouths, causing their cheeks to balloon comically until they were forced to swallow. The sounds of frenzied gulping now filled the cafeteria, as its other occupants watched in silence. At this point JD, Turk and Todd entered, clearly in need of a morning pick me up as at first they shuffled over to the cash register without paying any attention to the strange atmosphere in the cafeteria. They each ordered a large cup of coffee (all accept JD who ordered a rather feminine latte), paid for it and in perfect unison both turned and dropped their beverage onto the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no sexual comment to make about this\" Said Todd \"Like, help me guys... I think I'm broken\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD and Turk merely stared mouths agape in mute disbelief at the sight of JD's former girlfriend and Turks current wife being publicly force fed in very sexy latex nurse outfits. JD's eyebrows were raised so high they looked like they might fly off his head as he noticed how bulky Eliot was looking, particularly as she was squeezed into her latex outfit with a very noticeable bulge of a belly at her midriff. The illuminated numbers above their heads rose at a scary pace, which indicated just how many calories was in the mixture they were being forced to suck down. In a mere ten minutes Carlas had climbed up to 133lbs while Eliots was an impressive 150lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there fellas\" Said Kelso in his usual sinister jovial manner \"What do you think about this mornings entertainment, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they say?</span></div></div>",

Entertaining\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, I'm so glad you agree sport\" Said Kelso, the sinister edge vanishing a quickly as it had come \"Its going to become quite a common sight, so it's best you get used to it and even enjoy it! How about you? Do you like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh yeah!\" Responded Turk in his usual exaggerated manner \"This is what I'm talkin about! Just what I like to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear it sport\" Said Bob, turning back to the ever expanding forms of Eliot and Carla whose slutty nurse outfits could barely contain them \"As you were gentlemen, enjoy the show\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob sauntered away happily, just as Todd muttered dejectedly about not being asked his valuable opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your okay with this?\" JD asked Turk \"With your wife being fattened up in front of everybody like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me put it this way\" Said Turk \"Remember when I told you about how much better sex with Carla is when she's pissed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD nodded and Todds ears pricked like a puppy at the word 'sex'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine how pissed she's going to be after this?\" Said Turk \"Tonight is going to be... Biblical my friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Todd practically drooled over this mental image, JD turned his gaze of Eliot. Though his support had been essentially bullied out of him by Kelso, JD couldn't deny his feelings over the sight of Eliots expanding figure. The extra pounds looked very good on the pretty blonde doctor, especially accentuated as they were by her tight,  slutty new uniform. He wondered how she'd look once she really started gaining real weight, and actually had to wipe some drool from the corner of his own mouth at the very thought of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After the day before Carla now weighed 138lbs while Eliot had jumped to a hefty 155lbs, and every pound of this was becoming more and more obvious as it was enhanced by their skin tight slutty nurse outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im seriously going to need a change in uniform soon\" Said Eliot, as she tried her best to rearrange the pvc outfit so it didn't pinch at her flab \"Otherwise I'm going to burst out of this fricking thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm counting on that obviously, you dumb fatass\" Said Karl condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot flushed angrily just as Ted wheeled in a large familiar food cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" He said quietly before leaving the room, avoiding eye contact at all cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, stand on the scales and feed each other\" Commanded Karl, as he put his hands behind his head and relaxed \"Lets see how much more punishment those uniforms can take\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls exchanged miserable glances and sighed, before doing as they were told and stood on the scales. Reluctantly the girls began to load up from the large food laden cart and the feeding began again. Eliot actually didn't mind being fed by Carla, compared to the more humiliating methods that had been employed previously, as she was at least gentle about it. Of course Carla didn't particularly feel the same, as there was no part of this fattening process that she found the least bit tolerable. Karl smiled widely at the sight of the two beautiful and ever expanding girls feeding each other, in complete heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's quite a way to start a day\" Said Karl as the last of the food found is way into each girls belly \"Thanks for the show my little nurse pigletts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shove it -urrrp!-\" Replied Carla testilly and Karl laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlas scale read 141lbs, something which only added to her rage. She hated how her pvc outfit seemed to frame and enhance her protruding belly, and how every other bulge was also obvious to see. Eliot was pretty much resigned to her fate at this point, knowing her skinny days were long behind her and only getting further away. Her scale read 158 and she could feel every pound of this pushing tightly against her uniform, which was audibly creaking at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, let's get on with our day shall we?\" Said Karl with wry amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

There arms and legs were tied with ropes, while a belt was tightened over their ever softening midriffs (which accentuated the fat which had accumulated there, especially on Eliot) and another around their foreheads which kept them stood rigidly upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... Today girls, you will doing your rounds around the hospital\u201d Explained Karl \u201cJust so you can experience first hand which of your colleagues are sympathetic to your predicament... and which are not\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla and Eliot exchanged worried glances, as their experience up to this point did not fill them with confidence. The girls were then wheeled from the room with Karl waving happily after them. Immediately outside Karls room they ran into Ted, who was stood next to a restocked cafeteria cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi again\u201d He said nervously \u201cOrders... and whatever...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither girl looked convinced by this excuse but they had little time to dwell on it as Ted pushed a large slice of fudge cake into each of their mouths. This slice was swiftly followed by another and another, each one being crammed in with ruthless efficiency just barely giving the poor nurses time to chew and swallow before the next slice was forced in. After 6 slices (at which point the girls had consumed a whole fudge cake each) Ted handed funnels to Turk and JD, which they took trying to look reluctant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh.. bruurrrppmrrrf!\u201d Exclaimed each of the sexy nurses in unison as the funnel was pushed past their lips.<br>\r\nTed grabbed two huge cartons of double cream and proceeded to dump one down each funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlerrpluggluppluggglurrglurrpp\u201d Exclaimed Carla and Eliot, their wyes wide with shock at how fast they were expected to drink the fattening cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid minute of frenzied gulping the cartons were emptied and the funnels removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh... brurrrrp!\u201d Exclaimed Eliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhrrr.. please Tedurrrppp!\u201d Pleaded Carla weakly \u201cNo more hiccurrrpp!... pleasshhhmrrf!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot looking at all apologetic Ted pushed the first slice of cake number two into their weary mouths. After each cake was finished, a whole carton of double cream followed. Five whole cakes met their end at the drooling mouths of the sexy nurses, as did five large cartons of double cream until Ted mercifully stopped. The girls looked exhausted, with their bellies gurgling and looked bloated as they pushing tightly against their belts. Even Eliot, whose stomach capacity had increased quite significantly from her daily feedings, was looking rather worse for wear, and all they could offer was groans and feeble burps as they were wheeled away. They were taken down the hallway and around the corner where they saw the corridor full of doctors and nurses, stood in a row against each wall. The girls heads lolled to the side so they made miserable eye contact at this new discovery as their colleagues brandished all manor of calorific junk foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen wiiide ladies! Its feedin\u2019 time!\u201d Said Turk, clearly forgetting he wasn\u2019t supposed to be enjoying this (it took a nudge from JD to remind him) \u201cUm I mean... Thats what Karl would want I guess... Not us...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliot and Carla frowned at each other at this slip up on Turks behalf, but as they were wheeled forward they both sighed sadly and turned their heads with their mouths open. Handfuls of donuts, cakes and many other fattening treats found their way unceremoniously into their waiting mouths, and it was a real test of their eating speed to keep up with the demand. There were around twenty staff members on either side of the corridor, all of whom were very eager to stuff as much food as possible into the poor girls mouths. After a whirlwind of heavy handed feeding, the girls gave a muffled grunt of effort and swallowed the last of the calorific confectionaries. Eliot and Carla groaned miserably, looking rather dishevelled with strands of hair over their face and their bellies looking like large domes which were causing their tight thick belts to creak. Looking back up the hallway JD and Turk could see that the doctors and nurses still had a substantial amount of food on them, so with a snigger they wheeled the defeated forms of their friends backwards up the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeep beep beep!\u201d Announced Turk, imitating a reversing dump truck \u201cWide loads coming through\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn\u2019t even have the energy to exchange annoyed looks at the insult, as their mouths were soon forced open and more food was piled in. After being backed up to the start of the corridor, the two stuffed sexy nurses were pushed back down. Their colleagues were given the chance to unload whatever food remained, which they did with gusto. This feeding was probably the most frantic of all as the hospital staff just forced everything into Eliot and Carlas drooling mouths at once. When they finally reached the end the two stuffed beauties mouths hung agape, with several pastries comically sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrrrlllrrr\u201d They murmered, lacking the strength needed to chew and swallow \u201cMrrrfff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD and Turk did the honours for them and pushed the pastries into their mouths forcing them to chew and swallow. Eliot and Carla tried to give the guys a withering glare, but all they managed was a vacant look of bemused exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carla and Eliot ate on autopilot, chewing and swallowing whatever fatty foodstuff was crammed into their mouths without any thought process.

They shamelessly stared the girls up and down, taking in every bulge of flesh which pressed tightly against their outfits. At an even 160 pounds Eliot was really thickening up nicely, but the extra weight was looking more evident on Carla also (Who was now 145 pounds). They both had highly engorged breasts, which were barely being contained by their latex outfits, but despite this it was their dome like stuffed bellies which received JD and Turks attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan i dont think those outfits can take much more of this punishment\u201d Said JD in awe \u201cWhos belly do you think is going to make a break for freedom first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta go with my girl Carla\u201d Said Turk confidently, unable to stop himself from poking and stroking his wifes taut belly causing her to squirm uncomfortably \u201cTen bucks says this belly will break out first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be trippin fool!\u201d Said JD in his usual manner when he spoke to Turk \u201cThat bellies got nuthin on this one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJD groped unashamedly at his friends bloated tummy, taking advantage on the fact the gorgeous blonde was busy having her face stuffed and thus couldnt shout at him.

The group of feeders seemed to notice this, and perhaps worried they may be told to stop, they speeded up considerably, barely giving the poor nurses time to chew and swallow before forcing more fattening foods past their weary lips. They could actually feel themselves gain weight as they stood only under the support of the dolleys they were tied to. The rips grew quickly as their bodies swelled, their food stuffed bellies pushing harder and harder against the latex of their slutty outfits, unable to be contained any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha right on cue\" Announced Doctor Cox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her face was still oval like but now she had a double chin, her arms were thicker and her breasts were huge the have grown into GG cups. Her stomach was round and met into her lower roll and hung slightly over her thighs. Her hips had gained a few inches to say the least and her butt had grown huge with big basketball sized cheeks. Her thighs were thick and touched together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eliot waddled to see her patient who was making her gain weight.

As well as working long shifts, the interns still had to hit the books if they wanted to receive a residency. They had been studying for the last three hours, throwing questions back and forth as they grazed on chips and candy, as well as the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie grunted as she sat back up and grabbed a book. After scanning it for a few seconds she found a suitable question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A patient presenting with gross hematuria and suprapubic pain is most likely suffering from..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise hesitated, squinting quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cystitis?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Nephrolithiasis?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Glomerulonephritis?\"<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" Denise pounded the table, causing a small pyramid of beer cans to fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small noise attracted the attention of Sonja 'Sunny' Day, a fellow intern, who's apartment they were currently in. She was aptly named, being possessed of a painfully cheerful demeanour. Some people found it annoying, Denise included, but it was hard to stay mad at such a friendly person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" She asked, returning from the kitchen bearing a plastic tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sorry I guess.\" Denise replied. \"Just kind of frustrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know what will help!\" Sunny smiled, placing the tray down on top of the books. \"Ice-cream with chocolate sauce and rainbow sprinkles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three young women eagerly dug in to the creamy dessert, studying forgotten, along with prior complaints of fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the last thing I need.\" Katie said a few minutes later, ruefully licking her spoon. \"I swear I've put on ten pounds since we started at the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise nodded, scooping up another mouthful. \"Yeah, it's ridiculous. I was getting changed and I swear, I got turned on by the sight of my own flabby ass in the mirror.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny blushed slightly at Denise's characteristic bluntness, but she had to agree with the sentiment, as she had put on a few pounds herself. The hectic schedule of a medical intern left little time for exercise, and meals were usually fast food or whatever they had in the cafeteria, supplemented by plenty of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their griping, all three bowls were scraped clean before they thunked back down on the table. They made a half-hearted attempt at studying, but decided to call it a night after ten minutes of wrong answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get some sleep, I'm in at six tomorrow.\" Katie yawned, stretching languorously, exposing her small pot belly beneath her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget Denise, we're supposed to work on our research project tomorrow.\" Sunny said, already stacking the bowls and tidying away the pizza box. \"Do you want to meet at Coffee Bucks at eight? Or nine, or ten, I don't mind.\" She smiled broadly, unaware of a red sprinkle stuck between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise sighed, buttoning her jacket over her swollen stomach. \"Yeah, I'll see you there at ten, or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they travelled down in the elevator, it was Katie's turn to be unsympathetic. \"Hey, at least your not stuck with Howie. Plus I bet she'll do like all the work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise shrugged. She didn't really mind Sunny that much. And Coffee Bucks did have those great banana nut muffins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However she was also prone to collapses in willpower, meaning when she did give in to junk food, she tended to pig out until she felt like she was going to be sick. As a result her small potbelly had continued to grow, and was now supported by a pair of bulging love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny had taken her usual positive attitude to the idea of watching her weight, but had been let down by her overactive sweet-tooth. Her meals might have been sensible, but when it came to dessert and candy, she had no defence. Her gain was more even, meaning she was just a little chunkier around the midsection, her backside a little rounder. The only really noticeable change was her chest, which had gone up a cup-size,her breasts bulging over the cups of her bra and garnering stares from most of her male colleagues and patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise had never really paid attention to her weight before now. Usually, she ate whenever she felt hungry, and she ate whatever she wanted to.  Unfortunately she seemed to be hungrier a lot more often these days, and it was clearly having an effect. She had actually gained the most, offset slightly by the fact that she was a good bit taller than both Katie and Sunny. Her stomach now had a noticeable curve, but most of the weight had settled in her lower half. Her butt had gotten even bigger, causing her scrubs to ride up uncomfortably, and the tops of her thicker thighs were even starting to rub together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this sucks.\" Denise began, having finished her burger and moved on to her cheese fries. \"I can't stop eating, and every freaking calorie goes straight to my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me.\" Katie grumbled, picking through her salad and looking enviously at Denise's plate. \"I've been eating salads everyday, and I'm still getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because you ate an entire pizza by yourself last night, and two orders of chicken wings.\" Denise pointed out, squeezing ketchup on to her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, its not that bad. There are worse things in the world then putting on weight.\" Sunny interjected before a real argument could begin, taking another bite of her chicken sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say that too if I'd put on ten pounds of pure boob.\" Denise sneered, gesturing towards Sunny's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny blushed, partially pleased with with her little 'growth spurt'. She kind of enjoyed the attention, and was particularly looking forward to the large piece of chocolate cake that had been placed on her tray when she had innocently leaned over the salad bar to grab a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't get how the other female doctors avoid it.\" Denise continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could ask them.\" Sunny suggested, nibbling on her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Katie said, and in the same breath. \"Doctor Reid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde doctor had just been passing by with her own lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just wondering Doctor Reid, how do you stay so skinny?\" Katie asked, tilting her head and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise rolled her eyes at the blatant flattery, but the senior attending didn't seem to notice, brushing her hair back proudly. \"Well Katie, since you asked. As well as eating right and exercising regularly, I find it helps if your mother has passively aggressively destroyed your relationship with food and forced you to equate your weight with your own self worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny and Denise exchanged glances, the former's concerned, the latter's bemused, but Katie didn't miss a beat. \"Wow, thanks Doctor Reid, I hadn't considered that perspective before.\" She said, smiling broadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Doctor Reid practically skipped away, Denise shot a withering look at Katie. \"You're pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you.\" Katie fired back, \"I might as well make the best of the situation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny had started on her cake, but swallowed quickly to attempt to keep the peace. \"So, we're all on call tonight, right? It'll be like a little slumber party, we can tell stories and gossip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have pillow fights in our underwear?\" Denise asked sarcastically, causing the Todd to perk his head up from five tables away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it'll be fun.\" Sunny insisted, taking another forkful of cake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At six a.m, when their shift finally ended, it was three very tired, sore and hungry interns who limped out of Sacred Heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I changed my mind, I don't want to a doctor anymore.\" Katie groaned as she collapsed down on the bus stop bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise sat down next to her, running her tongue over her teeth. \"I think that tranny chipped my tooth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" Katie asked, yawning as she leaned her head against Denise's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one that looked kind of like Doctor Reid, if she had a moustache?\" Denise replied, shrugging her off casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean...\" Katie began, but she was interrupted almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go get breakfast!\"<br>\r\nSunny's voice was as cheerful as always, even though she was slumped against the bus stop with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie and Denise mumbled vaguely, but the audible rumbling of their stomachs was answer enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Sunny said, followed by a small snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can I get you ladies anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress' question went unanswered by the three women in the medical scrubs currently occupying the window booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side Denise was slowly massaging her swollen stomach, having devoured the entire 'Lumberjack' sized stack of pancakes, with extra bacon and scrambled eggs, all doused in a liberal amount of maple syrup. She let her head fall back against the red vinyl seat and let out an impressive belch, drawing glances from the few other tables that were occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the table, Sunny was hiccoughing gently, her own stomach sticking out almost as far as her ample bust. She had chosen the chocolate chips waffles, with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce, washed down with two chocolate milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to her, Katie was currently taking up most of the seat, having spread her legs to accommodate her massively bloated belly, which currently contained a six egg ham and cheese omelette and half a loaf's worth of hot buttered toast. With each breath, it brushed against the edge of the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds Katie managed to shake her head and wave the waitress away, but it was a good twenty minutes before they finally felt able to get up, pay the cheque and waddle out of the diner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Over the last few weeks, the emphasis had shifted from actually learning and become an excuse to pig out on fast food and watch TV. Tonight however, Katie was in a foul mood as a result of her embarrassing wardrobe malfunction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had changed from her scrubs into workout gear, a pair of tight pink yoga pants and a grey tracksuit top that was stretched over her pendulous belly. She had attempted to jog to Denise's, five blocks from the hospital, only to give up after getting a cramp just outside the parking lot. A short cab ride later, she had arrived to find Sunny and Denise sitting on the couch, chowing down on burgers and fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you guys, I thought we were going to study.\" Katie said, as she collapsed on to the beanbag chair opposite them. \"We have that endocrinology lecture with Doctor Reid next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny swallowed a large mouthful of chicken burger and had the decency to look slightly embarrassed. \"We will, we were just going to have something to eat first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise rolled her eyes. She hadn't actually seen Katie split her pants, but she had heard a lot of people making jokes about it. \"Katie, don't be a jerk. We got you some of those gross fish sandwiches you like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie scowled, shaking her head. \"No thanks, I already ate way too much today.\" She blushed, remembering the sound of her scrubs ripping, revealing her black lace underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, more for me.\" Denise shrugged, grabbing two burgers and squeezing them together, taking one enormous bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny frowned, looking from one friend to another. Katie was glumly rubbing her belly and looking longingly at the food, while Denise crammed an entire order of fries into her mouth, letting out a muffled moan of satisfaction. She looked down at her own half-eaten burger, and at the crumbs nestling in her generous cleavage. Though she couldn't actually see it over her breasts, she knew her own belly was getting bigger, along with the rest of her. She had always enjoyed her food, never really worrying about her weight before. Her positive attitude was unassailable, no matter what the scale said. With a shrug, she took another bite, and grabbed a handful of fries before Denise ate them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, she actually appeared to have put on a few more pounds, most of it going straight to her ass and thighs, which had been pretty substantial to begin with. Not that anyone would ever say it out loud, fearful of Carla's wrath, but the Latina nurse was actually getting a little chubby. It was especially noticeable when she bent over, the outline of her panties clearly visible through the stretched material of her scrubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Elliot next saw Katie, sitting in the break room, munching half-heartedly on an apple, she felt inspired to say something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Doctor Reid.\" Katie said, after swallowing a mouthful of fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing?\" Elliot asked, sitting down on the couch next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay, I guess. You know, considering.\" She said, gesturing to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot, taking this a reference to her unplanned pregnancy, nodded understandingly. \"I know what you're going through.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked surprised. What did she know about getting fat? \"Have you ever been...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, no. But for a while it was all I wanted, and all I could think about.\" Elliot confided, remembering her period of baby-craziness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was even more confused. Doctor Reid had wanted to be fat? \"Well, I certainly didn't want this.\" Katie said, rubbing her rotund belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but now you have to just accept it and keep moving forward.\" Elliot said comfortingly, also placing a hand on the intern's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was now severely weirded out. \"Um, I've been trying to lose weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot interrupted her with a shocked voice. \"That should be the last thing on you mind! You have to embrace this Katie. If you could eat anything, right now, what would it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie still didn't understand why Doctor Reid was doing all this, but the offer of food was causing her battered willpower to crumble. \"Um, well, pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Elliot paid the delivery guy and returned to the break room with the extra-large pizza with everything on it. Katie's misgivings disappeared as the smell of melted cheese filled the room, and as she opened the box she was practically drooling. The first slice disappeared in a matter of seconds, followed rapidly by a second. Elliot watched happily as the younger blonde stuffed herself, feeling she had done a good deed. By the time the pizza was half gone, Katie had recovered herself a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you for the pizza Doctor Reid.\" She said, her mouth still half full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't be so formal.\" Elliot insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, Elliot. Would you like a slice? I'd feel less like a fat pig if you did.\" Katie said, gesturing to the remaining slices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot would normally stay away from fatty foods, but Katie looked so pleading. She took a small slice, just to be nice, but it was so delicious she ended up having a second, and even a third. Between them, the two women finished the entire pizza in fifteen minutes, before sitting back, feeling different degrees of bloatedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what would be perfect right now?\" Katie said after a few minutes, \"An ice-cream sundae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot groaned, but stood up and helped Katie to her feet. \"Come on, we can take my car. I'm buying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, maybe she would get a little something for herself, she thought, unconsciously patting her belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still operating under the impression that the younger woman was pregnant, she had allowed her to indulge her every whim, most of which involved food, but also included new clothes, a day at the spa and her last electricity bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp! Thanks Doctor... Elliot.\" Katie groaned, shovelling the rich and creamy pasta into her mouth. She had given in to the older woman's pampering partly out of her desire to ingratiate herself with her superior, partly out of her desire for free food. As for what Doctor Reid was getting it of it, she wasn't so sure. She figured there was a sexual aspect to it, which didn't bother her too much. She had experimented a little in college, more than a little, and Doctor Reid was pretty attractive. Plus she bought her all sorts of nice things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot smiled and made up a plate for herself. Being around Katie had allowed her to indulge herself a little as well. The results were a few extra pounds on her own frame, giving her a little potbelly and slightly rounder cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nothing compared with Katie, who had grown even fatter thanks to Elliot's patronage. Her thighs were thicker, her ass rounder, and her breasts were finally getting in on the action, going up at least two cup sizes. Her belly was already  huge, and thanks to all the food it was currently swollen to the size of a beach-ball, her shirt rolling up to just above her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had eaten about all she could take, feeling slightly woozy as Elliot leaned over and dabbed at her mouth with a napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done?\" Elliot asked. \"I hope you saved some room for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie nodded weakly, rubbing her belly. Elliot noticed this, and placed her own hands on Katie's bloated belly, massaging it gently but firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie responded with a low groan. She had been wondering when the older woman would make her move. She hammed up the moans a little bit, biting her lip to suppress a belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot raised her eyebrows. \"Does that feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie tried to flutter her eyelashes seductively. \"So much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot was oblivious. \"Just think, you're going to get so much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's eyes widened. \"I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. If you're this big now, think what size you'll be in a few months.\" Elliot told her. \"You really need to read up on this don't you? I thought they would have covered it at Med School...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a beeping sound from the other room. \"Ooh, the pie is done!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elliot hurried to the kitchen, Katie was feeling worried. Just how big did Doctor Reid expect her to get?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her relief was short lived however, as Jordan shoved her down on to the couch and told her not to move her fat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman had clearly been there already, judging by the half-eaten junk food and empty bottles that were dotted around the room, not to mention the broken chair. Jordan lurched around the room, gathering up whatever she could find before returning to Sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide!\" She had crooned, shoving a partly-eaten chilli dog into Sunny's mouth, muffling her protests. When that was gone, she moved on to a mostly intact cheeseburger, followed by a sleeve of lukewarm curly fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny had tried to resist, but Jordan was not to be denied. When she attempted to bat the food away, Jordan had grabbed her stethoscope and used it to tie her hands behind her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sunny effectively trapped, Jordan had leisurely stuffed her, sometimes taking a few bites for herself before cramming the rest into  the immobilised intern. Sunny's belly had swollen out further and further, forcing her scrubs top up to just underneath her enormous breasts. This amused Jordan to no end, and she cackled as she poked and prodded at the younger woman's bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you can really put it away, can't you?\" Jordan said, slapping her hand against Sunny's taut flesh. \"I think you and me are going to have a lot of fun together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny must have passed out at that point, because the next thing she knew light was streaming in through the window shade, and Jordan was no where to be seen. Her arms were cramping painfully, and her head was pounding as well, probably due to the half bottle of vodka that Jordan had poured down her throat. She started to panic when she realised that Doctor Cox could arrive at any moment, and with a squeak that turned into a grunt, she heaved herself to her feet, almost tipping over due to her still swollen belly. <br>\r\nSomehow she managed to pull her hands free, and after surveying the mess for a few seconds, decided her best option was simply to flee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some miracle the hallway outside the office was empty, and Sunny managed to make it all the way to the women's locker room without anyone seeing her. After cleaning herself up and changing her scrubs, she had realised that her next shift was starting in less than an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bench, Sunny wondered exactly what Ms. Sullivan had meant when she said they were going to have fun together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of Denise, who sat down next to her, causing the wooden bench to creak alarmingly. The blonde was panting heavily, dark sweat stains visible at the armpits of her grey sweatsuit. The reason for her exhaustion was the two suitcases, one duffel bag and three black garbage sacks she had dragged all the way from the bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise? What happened?\" Sunny asked, genuinely concerned but also happy for the distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Denise another minute to catch her breath, before she launched into her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed she had been a little late in the rent for her apartment. More than a little late. She had been spending practically all of her disposable income on food, and when that ran out she had started in on her less-than-disposable income. When her landlady came looking for the money, she had found the apartment 'a little messy' and had used that as an excuse to kick her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Denise's apartment had been more than 'a little messy'. Her new habits left little time for cleaning, so anything she was finished with usually just ended up on the floor. Pizza boxes, beer bottles, clothes that no longer fit her... In some places the floor was covered in a layer of trash almost six inches deep. When the landlady arrived she had made her way through the piles of garbage to find Denise asleep on the couch in her underwear, a bucket of fried chicken under one arm, a half-eaten drumstick clenched in her fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful!\" Sunny sympathised, taking the story at face value. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it sucks balls.\" Denise agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny looked momentarily out of sorts, but she immediately perked back up. \"You could move in with me! The couch folds out into a bed, and there's still plenty of closet space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, thanks.\" Denise said casually,  sniffing at her armpits. \"I'll bring my stuff over when my shift ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny smiled excitedly, clapping her hands together. Denise was about to tell her to calm down when a car pulled up in front of the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passenger door opened, and with a little rocking back and forth and a helpful push from the driver, Katie squeezed her way out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she shuffled out of the way and closed the door, Denise and Sunny saw the driver of the car was Doctor Reid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you at lunch Katie! We can try that new cupcake place, and maybe pick you up some new pants.\" Elliot said, waving to the other interns before driving away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked embarrassed as Sunny and Denise stared at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you spend the night at Doctor Reid's?\" Denise asked, her eyebrows raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was a little cagey.\"No. Well, yes. Nothing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing had happened, to Katie's continuing confusion. After finishing off the entire pie, Elliot hand feeding her the last slice, Katie could barely keep her eyes open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot had guided her upstairs, to her own bedroom, and had even helped her remove her shirt and pants. Katie had laid there, naked but for her tight black underwear, expecting at any second to feel Doctor Reid's hands on her thighs, when suddenly the lights went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nighty night!\" Elliot had said cheerily, closing the door behind her as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was left in the dark, literally and figuratively. She wasn't sure if she was relieved or disappointed, just that she was very confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was no less confused this morning, Doctor Reid bringing her breakfast in bed,  mounds of bacon and eggs, before leaving her to get dressed and driving her to the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her two fellow interns and shrugged. \"You guys want to get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir various problems put aside for now, the three hungry interns went in search of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This had nothing to do with her own eating habits, but more so with the fact that Carla was stealing her food whenever they were together, which just so happened to be a lot.  Where Denise's waistline suffered minimally, Carla's was taking quite a beating.  In addition to her usual large proportions at dinner, Carla was now eating Denise's large meals as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmph\" Carla grunted as she stood to leave the table.  \"Thanks for the bacon Denise.\"  Carla called as she slowly waddled to the doors, her butt now filling 2 chairs at the table.  Denise looked on as the hefty Dominican lumbered to the exit, the seat of her pants looking ready to rip.  She looked back down to her own plate and sighed at the little piece of bacon left, and 2 bites of eggs.  She thought about getting back in line to get more food, but she wouldn't have time before her shift and in reality she was too lazy to wait for the food again, she'd rather just stay hungry til lunch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise sat in silence for the few moments she had before having to heave herself up, she watched as fellow interns enjoyed a light meal.  JD and Turk walked in chatting about something and Denise managed to pick up a fragment before they went back out of earshot, \"I'm telling you dude, she is about to make me sleep on the couch because of how big she's getting.\" Denise smiled at what she picked up and realized that Carla's plan to stop her from getting fat is messing with her waist more than she probably anticipated.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He rolled onto his side and was greeted by the pudgy face of his wife, Carla, who had a faint smile on her face while asleep.  There was drool on her lips and she was mumbling causing her prominent double chin to quiver as she lay there.  Turk heard the faint sounds of her saying \"pasta....cookies.....full\" before another fart escaped her mammoth backside.  The bed was beginning to feel smaller each week as Carla's appetite kept getting larger and larger to match her figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk rolled completely over and saw their wedding picture on his bedside table.  Carla was never a twig by any means and her butt had always had just enough cushion to appease Turk but these days it was getting a little ridiculous.  He slowly got out of bed, taking a peeking glance to make sure he didn't wake Carla from her sleep.  At this point she was so deep a hurricane wouldn't wake her.  The clock read 4 am and Turk sighed knowing he wouldn't get back to sleep so he went to the living room, taking one last look at the mount of flesh that was his wife laying in bed.  She must have sensed he was gone as she rolled onto her stomach now, taking up nearly all of the bed, her ass jiggling as she began to snore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk sat down on the couch and looked at the walls of their apartment, pictures of their memories together filled them.  Each month the couple added a new picture and the past 12 pictures did a great job at documenting just how fat Carla was getting, Turk usually held her up, but a few months ago it became too much and they resorted to just standing next to each other.  The latest picture hung on the wall, and Carla was wearing a pair of scrubs, her belly hanging out the bottom and her hips sticking out so far Turk had to contort his body to stand next to her.  Carla was smiling from ear to ear, but Turk had a pained expression on his face,  moments before the picture Carla had mentioned the possibility of needing to go to the gym because the scales seemed to think she weighed 270 pounds.  She laughed it off and blamed a broken scale while Turk processed the sheer size of his life partner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk shook his head in disbelief as he sat there, about to doze off when the loudest <b>Pthhhpppppttttttt</b> echoed through the room as his wife released more pressure from her stomach.

The smell was absolutely divine she thought as she inhaled the odors of bacon and hashbrowns and eggs.  She was distraught to see a plump Elliot Reid in the kitchen, an empty plate in front of her and her hands on her belly.  \"Elliot, What the hell!?\" Carla was confused as much as she was angry that the stick (though not really) of a blonde was stealing her food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Elliot responded harshly. \"Turk left your breakfast in the fridge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla greedily made her way to the fridge, the smile on her face washed off when she saw a half a grapefruit and an apple on a plate with a note that said \"Baby, you know how we said 'til death do us part', ya might wanna lose a few pounds, cuz this brotha bout to have a heart attack\".  Turk was never one for much tact when it came to situations like this, so Carla wasn't as mad as another woman might be.  Plus, she wasn't dumb, she knew she had let herself go quite a bit, and the whole Denise situation wasn't helping.  Carla sighed as she pulled the plate from the fridge, she looked back at Elliot with jealousy in her eyes as the blonde doctor began buttering a piece of toast and jamming it in her mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla thought that if she was going to diet, she was gonna need someone to enjoy all the food for her and thought, why not have it be her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She flipped through the pages and still couldn't help but feel shocked that the 1st page said 290 pounds with a picture of her wearing a very tight pair of underwear showing off an ass that had a shelf to it and a very very wide set of hips.  She continued to flip through the pages, her body shrinking slowly but surely until she got to the blank page for today where she wrote in the numbers 275.  She was rather proud of herself for losing 15 pounds in a month, and Turk was beaming each time he saw her in the gym or snacking on fruit instead of chocolate.  It was tough, the daily stealing of Denise's food had come to a halt, so the intern was plumping up at an alarming rate, surpassing the 200 pound mark by the looks of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was Hamburger day in the cafeteria and they had Carlas favorite apple pie for dessert, it was tempting to grab a slice or two to celebrate her progress but she saw Turk sitting with JD watching her every move so she sighed and grabbed a salad like every other day this past month, skipping the dressing as it was unneeded calories.  Turk smiled as He watched Carla waddle her way to the table where her and Elliot usually met to eat.  Carla was now sitting in one chair again, but noted how much of her butt stuck over the sides and hung out.  She was a fan of how she could sit a little closer to the table though, making it easier to reach her plate to eat.  She bit into the salad with gusto, only to slow down when she tasted the blahness of the lettuce and carrots on top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla slammed her fork down and looked back up at Denise who was smirking in her direction as she took a big bite of her pie before leaning back in the chair to belch while patting her belly.  Carla was about to stand and confront her but she heard a huff behind her followed by ,\"What a pig!\".  Carla turned in her seat the best she could for a 275 pound woman and smiled when she saw Elliot standing there with a mountain of food on her tray.  Her eyes then traveled to the blonde doctors midsection and the grin widened when she saw her belly peeking out from the bottom of her scrubs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was safe to say that the weight Carla had lost had found its way to Elliot.  Every part of her was covered in a layer of chub now as she sat across from Carla, digging into the feast before her.  If Carla had to guess, Elliot was pushing 180 pounds now, and showed no signs of slowing down as she shoved fries in her mouth before swallowing her burger.  Out of the corner of her eye Carla saw Denise stand up and make her way over to their table, moving slowly while she held her very full belly.  \"excuse me, Dr. Reid, you seem to have something on you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot looked up at Denise with a mouth full of food and said \"wuhffs daht?\" Denise smiled and patted Elliots belly and said, \"A nice layer of chub\" before walking away laughing like a maniac.  Elliot looked down at her tummy with a hamburger in one hand and fries in the other, she shrugged and continued to eat.   When she finished she looked at Carla and said \"What's she calling me fat for, I'm pretty sure she's the fattest one in this place other than you.\" At that Carla looked at her friend while she hastily tried to apologize, the apology was cut short by a belch that sent the two laughing in fits.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On morning though after she had weighed herself to be 248 after a light breakfast she made her way to the gym.  She began her workout as usual and was unfortunate enough to feel overconfident in her abilities which led to an injured ankle on the treadmill.  Being a nurse she knew that the popping noise her ankle made was not a good sign and had JD look at it that day only to confirm her suspicions that she had injured it quite badly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Carla,\" JD started.  \"I'd say for a.... normal..... sized person a month of recovery is adequate but seeing as you erm... well... are fatter than most I'd suggest around 2 months of recovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was devastated that she had to stop working out and was limited to the time she could spend on her feet.

She couldn't say the same about her co-workers, Elliot and Denise.

Denise had ballooned to the point Dr. Kelso allowed her to take a new job as a \"Phone Doctor\" where she would sit behind the desk and take patients over the phone.  Rumor had it, this was because she had begun eating patients meals as she delivered them which raised complaints.  Denise kept her weight a secret but the number that kept coming up was 255, making her officially fatter than Carla at that time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla's new knowledge of Denise surpassing her in weight made her day even if she was limited in her activity for the next few months.  To celebrate Carla enjoyed a single candy bar, something she hadn't done in ages.  The first bite was heavenly and the second was even better.  Before she knew it, 5 candy bars had been opened and eaten.  Carla looked down at the mess of wrappers and shrugged, thinking to herself one binge isn't the end of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 months later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turk\" Carla pleaded, \"you can't do this Turk! I love you, we are married, issues come up and we are supposed to fix them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk had just laid out the papers for separation on the table in front of Carla's massive breakfast feast.  The last six months had rejuvenated Carla's appetite leaving her at her heaviest weight ever.  Turk had realized he had had enough when he noticed Carla's appetite had affected him as well, leaving a small potbelly where his abs used to be.  It also didn't help that she was now too big to share a regular bed with and the couple had to buy a king sized bed to accommodate.  Even now as Turk told Carla what was happening Carla didn't take a break from her eating as she poured nearly an entire container of syrup on her pancakes and waffles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carla, baby...\" Turk said, watching his soon to be ex dig into her meal with disgust on his face.  \"you are fatter than ever, I though you were trying to change that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurt... Remember?\" Carla had used her ankle as an excuse 4 months after the allotted recovery time to justify her laziness and increasing weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull, I saw you 'running' just fine when the cafeteria said there was only one pizza slice left.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla turned a shade of red as she continued to eat.  She lost herself in the food and had to adjust her mammoth rear in the seat.  The chair groaned under her weight and Turk had left the apartment while she finished up her meal. Carla slowly made her way to the couch, Dr. Kelso had fired her last week for eating on the job and \"indecent exposure\" as her scrub bottoms had ripped, exposing herself to patients and board members in the hall.  Carla pulled out her diet journal from many months ago and opened it to the first page that said 290 and had an embarrassingly fat picture of her.  She flipped through each page and saw as the weight declined to 248 and her smile got larger in each picture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk had assumed she stopped keeping entries and for awhile Carla had stopped.  3 months ago though she stepped on the scale again and snapped another picture.  Doing that week after week until her last weigh in this morning while Turk was asleep.  She wrote down 360 in the journal and pinned a picture of her unrecognizable body next to it, a smirk on her face as she had one hand on her absolutely massive behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... At the hospital...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After committing several traffic violations on the way she finally arrived at her office, hurried into the building and pressed a number in the elevator for a floor she\u2019d never visited before. She rearranged herself hurriedly in the mirrored walls of the elevator, making sure her hair was neat and her bra was comfortable before she stepped out. The corridors were unsurprisingly rather quiet, most of the staff having gone home already, though a few stragglers remained still hard at work. Carrie came to the door of the meeting room where she had been instructed to meet Kirstie and knocked lightly before she entered. Kirstie was sat at the long table and smiled at Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Carrie\u201d She said, extending her hand which Carrie shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Who are you again?\u201d Responded Carrie jokingly and they both shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease take a seat\u201d Said Kirstie, gesturing to a seat next to hers and Carrie obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next ten minutes were an ice breaking session, as Carrie tried her best to form a good early relationship with her client. Carrie knew exactly how important this was, and if she lost Kirstie as a client she would not only have wasted all the hard work it took to reach this point, but also put her back in possibly a worse position than she was before. Failure was not an option. Soon the topic eventually (and inevitably) arrived at Kirsties recent, and well publicized, weight loss which she was more than happy to discuss with Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great!\u201d Commented Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d said Kirstie, \u201cIt was really hard work, but now I can reap the benefits\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I bet, what were you like 300 pounds?\u201d Said Carrie bluntly without thinking and saw Kirstie\u2019s jaw tense momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem\u2026 about 230 actually\u201d She said rather stiffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm\u2026 Well you look amazing now at least\u201d Carrie said, trying to save the situation and to her relief Kirstie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still hard though\u201d Said Kirstie, \u201cI mean the cravings never truly go away\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was far from enjoying herself but was extremely desperate to please Kirstie, so she tried her best not to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you full already?\" Asked Kirstie disappointedly after half an hour of solid eating on Carrie's behalf, as she had noticeably slowed her pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

From under the blanket she saw she was wearing a white t shirt with short sleeves, showing to her an outstretched arm of almost bone, almost like she hadn\u2019t eaten anything her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as quickly as she saw her arm, a perfectly healthy hand stuffed her form back under the blanket, as Kirstie\u2019s voice coos, \u201cNo, no, no. Not yet, my little pig, soon you will be ready.\u201d Carrie decided to instead start looking around, finding that she was in some hallway, the walls covered with mirrors. She saw Kirstie was dressed like a nurse in a cheap porno, but Carrie looked at her face and saw how sunken in it is. She decided to stop looking at herself and look forward, eventually finding the hallway ending at a simple dining table made of mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wheelchair was placed at the head of the table, and Kirstie struts off to the other side of the table. She claps in a snobbish way, and faceless butlers appeared out of thin air, carrying with them trays after trays of foods. Some had nothing but hot dogs, spaghetti, pizza, steak, cake, burgers, lobster, and other meals and desserts. When the food was placed before her, she didn\u2019t even wait to start. At first she moved slowly with a fork already in hand, jabbing at anything and everything, but with her first bite, she noticed that she started to look healthier already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second she thought that, she threw the blanket off of her, now seeing she has on a pair of jeans to go with her white shirt. She suddenly started eating with gusto, it didn\u2019t matter what she ate, it just mattered that she didn\u2019t become like that skeleton again. While she was munching on a burger, she felt her shirt ride up on her, she looked down and saw that she now had a pot belly, now visible as her shirt had ridden up her body into a second bra. She didn\u2019t care and continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continues eating, she finds that her arms and legs have gotten thicker, with a double chin forming. Her thick frame had popped the button of her jeans off, flying a few feet away at Kirstie's feet. Kirstie takes this as a cue to help out. She struts over to Carrie as she\u2019s busy shovelling ice cream into her mouth, staining her white shirt with all kinds of food. Kirstie takes this time to grope Carries massive stomach and equally massive breasts. She then orders more food and starts taking the fork that Carrie discarded what felt like long ago and started feeding her the food. Suddenly, a tear is heard in Carries jeans and shirt, tearing at the seams.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie was sitting on a gilded chair, at the head of a long table, loaded with food. In front of her was an almost-empty plate, a few scattered shrimps the remnants of a meal that had almost spilled onto the table, and she stabbed at the remaining portions with her fork, quickly and eagerly placing them into her waiting mouth, each one a brief burst of garlic and butter as it went down. Her other hand had a piece of savoury pastry, and she stuff it in after the shrimp, hastily chewing to get it down. Still a few pieces of shrimp remained, but she looked up to see Kirstie walking towards her, carrying another plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new plate was a pyramid of fried rice, liberally doused in heavy, thick sauce with pieces of chicken and pork heaped on top. Kirstie, looking approvingly at Carrie, snatched the empty plate away as she placed the new one down, and Carrie took the opportunity to take another last piece of shrimp before continuing with her meal. Dropping the fork, she switched to a spoon and started to shovel her new course into her mouth, taking huge bites of rice, meat and sauce, which dribbled down the sides of her mouth, running down her growing double chin. She took bite after bite, and her belly began to grow, putting pressure on her buttons as she briefly gasped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kirstie arrived again, carrying a bowl this time with a ladle placed in it; Carrie had only eaten about two-thirds of the rice, and though she dug in with gusto, she hadn't finished by the time Kirstie switched dishes. She looked down again, and saw a huge bowl of thick, fatty stew, loaded with meat with fat glistening on the top, and forgetting the rice, she started to take huge mouthfuls of the bubbling broth, at first using her spoon before switching to the convenient ladle. Her buttons were really beginning to strain now as she continued to expand, fat building up on her arms and legs, her trouser seams beginning to complain. She paused for a second, gasping for breath, and saw Kirstie walking down again, this time pushing a trolley in front of her. She paused in front of Carrie, looking down with a smile, then reached to her belly, jiggling the fat with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing well, my little piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked up with a mix of despair and greed, and Kirstie took away the bowl, replacing it this time with half a dozen plates from the trolley, this time all sweets. A pile of eclairs, a jelly as big as her head, a trio of huge cakes, and a massive tureen of chocolate dessert. Her eager hands reached for the new food as Kirstie watched, snatching handfuls of cake and taking them to her waiting mouth, then pushing eclairs down with a trio of bites, before finally she went for the dessert, taking deep mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crack, the buttons on her top gave, and her belly fat rolled out across her lap. She looked down, drips of chocolate running onto her exposed stomach, then up at Kirstie who started to laugh, then moved across to the table, picking up one of the cakes and shoving it in Carrie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep eating! You've got to eat more, and more and MORE!\"</span></div></div>",

It would mean a lot to me if you gave it a go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstie gave Carrie a meaningful look after this last sentence, making it easy for her to read between the lines. Carrie looked over the gigantic and rather unhealthy looking breakfast Kirstie had ordered for her and sighed, knowing that she would be expected to finish the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no time like the present I guess\" Said Carrie unable to hide her uncertainty as she took her first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it taste?

Mrs. Carrie Heffernan is very hungry indeed\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was flabbergasted at the sudden turn of events, and cursed herself for not just keeping her mouth shut.

The food cart was wheeled in and Carrie groaned at the sheer amount of snacks it was laden with, still feeling a little full from her huge breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the drill\" Said Kirstie brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie smiled sarcastically and reached out to the food cart, grabbing a large bear claw and taking a reluctant bite. Through the rest of the meeting Carrie slowly ate her way through the food laden cart while Kirstie talked about business aims, stopping every now and then to ask Carrie how something tasted or how full she felt. Carrie groaned as she finished a large iced danish and following a look from Kirstie reached out for a swiss roll. At this point Carrie had really hit a food wall, so with a smile Kirstie took the pastry from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping it would come to this again\" Kirstie said happily and proceeded to force feed Carrie the roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's eyes were becoming glazed as she chomped away on the sweet pastry that was being forced into her face, which was causing crumbs and fragments to land on the shirt over her bosom. When she'd swallowed the last bite Kirstie obviously had no intention of stopping and grabbed the next item from the cart (a large donut), which Carrie eyed miserably as it soon approached her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wiiide!\" Kirstie sang and Carrie groaned as she complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the day Carrie was forced to work her way through the huge pile of fattening foods by Kirstie, and by the end of it she was breathing rather heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now last bite\" Said Kirstie soothingly, forcing the last pastry into Carrie's exhausted mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... -Hic!- Urrp!... So full...\" Carrie mumbled, slouching back in her chair as with great difficulty she chewed and swallowed the last bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! That's a good girl!\" Said Kirstie, stroking Carrie on the head encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Huff puff&gt;... Urrrp!\" Carrie exclaimed groggily and the top button popped off her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's belly looked obviously bloated and was emitting groaning noises as it pushed uncomfortably against the lower buttons of her shirt, which were obviously being strained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She wondered grimly if this was now Kirstie's key interest, to live out her own gluttonous ambitions through her and ultimately fatten her up to a weight close to or even beyond her own weight as it had been a few years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh -hic- Yeah....

Each time she slept of a feeding she awoke to find a freshly stocked snack cart, which was subsequently stuffed into her growing belly. Carrie didn't want to think about how much weight this constant gorging was making her gain and she just hoped that Kirstie would lose interest before it went too far. When Carrie arrived home that night she staggered through the door, only to be greeted by Doug and a large takeaway for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey!\" He said happily \"I've prepared dinner again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"prepared\" was accompanied by hand quotation marks from Doug, and Carrie smiled back rather unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yay\" She said, adding under her breath \"... Crap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal did not go down without a serious fight on Carrie's behalf and once she had finished she could barely move. Doug was a little worried at first about how his wife had reacted  the meal, but after mumbled reassurance he seemed appeased (though had to almost physically carry her upstairs to bed). The next morning Carrie awoke and immediately checked her midsection underneath her pajama top, looking for any signs that her bingeing had affected get body. She couldn't be sure but she could swear there was more of a bulge to her stomach than usual, and that her pajama were s little more snug than they had once been. She decided she had to know for sure so before Doug got up she darted to the bathroom and locked the door behind her. With her eyes closed in fearful anticipation she stepped on the bathroom scale, waiting awhile before she opened them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have got to be kidding me!\" She said in disbelief as she saw the readout on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale read 128 pounds. Before she had met with Kirstie a few days ago Carrie had weighed in at a miniscule 110 pounds, and as the proof of her weight gain stared her in the face there was a knock at the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie? You in there?\" Came Dougs voice \"I've gotta pee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sighed sadly to herself before opening the bathroom door and letting Doug in, who was clearly bursting for the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went exactly the same as yesterday had done (which truthfully was what Carrie had expected), with Kirstie gleefully stuffing whatever food she had to hand into Carrie's mouth. Carrie noticed that she was being forced to eat more in each sitting, with a shorter cool down period in between each feeding which led her to believe that Kirstie was trying to increase her appetite and food capacity. Any form of work had been completely abandoned by Kirstie, as she now made the feeding of Carrie her only focus. When Carrie had finished the last feeding of the day, she sat dazed in her chair the buttons on her shirt straining slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we feeling?\" Quizzed Kirstie, admiring her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. Urrrrp... Very full...\" Said Carrie, almost too quietly to hear \"As usual... Hic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Kirstie sounding appeased \"lt's Friday tomorrow... This office has casual dress on Fridays does it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yeah... Hic!\" Replied Carrie, her voice still quiet and exhausted sounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I think you should come in tomorrow wearing something that shows off your changing body\" Said Kirstie brightly, patting Carries taut belly \"So the whole office can observe you get chubbier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

With some effort (and groaning) Carrie hoisted herself you her feet, only to have Kirstie playfully push yet another donut into her mouth, which she begrudgingly chewed and swallowed. Kirstie led Carrie through the office, the latter being rather clumsy on her feet due to how stuffed with food she was and it was needless to say she drew some curious looks. Her bloated belly was unmistakeable as her tight shirt did nothing to hide it, rather it made it more obvious due to how strained the buttons looked. Carrie was led around the shopping district of Queens as Kirstie held her hand like child, pulling her into each store in turn to try on clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat outfit does Kirstie go for?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie would of probably enjoyed the shopping aspect of Kirstie's plan, if it wasn't for the fact that Kirstie's large handbag was full to the brim with farthing snacks. As Carrie was dragged from store to store, these fattening treats were stuffed into her mouth at regular intervals, meaning she was offered no reprieve from the constant feeding. She knew she had already gained at least five pounds today, as each time she had to redress into her work attire it was more of a struggle to force the buttons through their corresponding holes. Kirstie was clearly after something very specific, as Carrie had tried on at least twenty different dresses, each one sexier than the last until finally she seemed appeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" She said thoughtfully as Carrie modelled her outfit for her and she handed her a donut to begrudgingly chow down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress was a black cocktail dress, which looked like something somebody would wear at a drug lords yacht party. It was incredibly sexy, and rather short with a deep cleavage and gaps up the side to show off even more skin. However the most deciding factor for Kirstie was how tight it was on poor Carrie, who looked like she'd been sewn into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a twirl\" Ordered Kirstie, and Carrie obeyed with half a donut sticking from her mouth \"Give me a side on view\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie could see Kirstie's eyes light up when she gave her a side on, and instinctively tried to suck her belly in. The dress clung to her figure so closely that it looked painted on, every new pound she had gained was magnified and her belly in particular was rather prominent. She could feel how the soft flesh around her waist and side oozed slightly from the gaps in her dress and her breasts were too large for the dresses cleavage as they appeared squashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Exclaimed Kirstie, as she casually stuffed a chocolate croissant into Carrie's mouth \" What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-hiccough!\" Said Carrie, struggling to swallow yet another mouthful of food \"If the aim is to show off my new... Erm... Bulk... Then I guess its perfect\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you agree\" Said Kirstie, beaming \"Say ahhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sighed, tugging at the uncomfortably tight dress unconsciously before opening her mouth. The other patrons of the store watched in interest as Kirstie systematically emptied the fattening contents of her bag into Carries mouth. It was a bizarre scene for sure, as Carrie was stunningly beautiful in her sexy black dress and was completely ruining her figure and demeaning herself in front of the general public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we get all this into that belly of yours I think we'll be ready to show you off around the office\" Said Kirstie as she shovelled handful after handful of calorific treats into poor Carries mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'belly' she was referring to was becoming more and more prominent by the second, as it was pushing very tightly against the fabric of her black cocktail dress. Finally, with commendable effort on Carries behalf, the bag of food was empty. Carrie groaned, barely able to stand as she was exhibiting the classic signs of a food coma, and the seams of her dress creaked ominously as she swayed unsteadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, all gone\" Said Kirstie appeased as she turned her bag upside down to show it was empty \"Hmmm... And not a moment to soon it would appear, one more bite and I think you'd tear out of that dress before I even had a chance to buy it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh-uhhrrrrpppp!\" Exclaimed Carrie and a few patrons jumped at the sudden sound and turned their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the office, and after Carrie was weighed and a new weight of 133 pounds was confirmed, Carrie was paraded around to show off her new outfit. Kirstie had brought a pair of black stilettos to go with the outfit, knowing that Carrie would probably have trouble walking in them after her feeding. She was proved right, as Carrie staggered around in the heels her skin tight dress creaking with each jolting movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Carrie\" Said Mr. Kaplan, as he noticed her \"I'm glad I caught you, I really needed... Erm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stopped in his tracks as he took a moment to take in Carries appearance, and raised his eyebrows at what he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh hi Mr. Kaplan -hicc!-\" Replied Carrie, trying to suck in her belly as to make it less obvious \"What did you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Nevermind\"He said awkwardly, unable to keep his eyes from the uncharacteristic bulge at Carries midsection which was straining the fabric of her sexy black dress \"Its not important...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstie was pleased at Carries bosses reaction, seeing it as a sign that her 'hard work' (that being stuffing the poor girl silly) was paying off and showing obvious results. When Mr. Kaplan walked away Kirstie prodded Carrie from behind to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't suck it in\" She said sternly \"Let that belly of yours hang out for all to see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sighed sadly, but obeyed and let her belly back out again which made her dress creak dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... Why don't you go show off your new curves to Dawn over there?\" Suggested Kirstie \"Oh, and while your stuffing these into your face! That would be perfect\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstie handed her a box of donuts which Carrie stared at in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't...\" Began Carrie, but was silenced by a look from Kirstie and merely offered a resigned sigh \"Okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie walked up to Dawn, who was sat at a nearby desk with a number of others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hi Dawn\" Carrie said awkwardly, taking a bite of a donut \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn turned to speak to Carrie, but found herself eye level with Carries new belly. On Kirsties orders Carrie was giving a rather sexy pose, which only pushed her belly out further into Dawns face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Erm... Wow, hi Carrie\" Stammered Dawn, as Carrie stuffed her face with donuts \"You look... Um... Really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat, i know\" Said Carrie, trying to hide how mortified she was as she forced her way through the box of sugary pastries \"I've really let myself go huh? And this dress, what was I thinking? I can feel the seams stretching around this huge ugly belly of mine you know what I'm sayin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't want to say anything\" Said Kirstie, not being able to resist butting in to the humourously humiliating scene \"But you've definitely put on a few lb's... Which is hardly surprising considering what a glutton you've been this past week\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right -urrrp!\" Said Carrie as another donut found its way into her growing belly \"Just can't stuffing my greedy face\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was clear that Carries coworkers were becoming rather uncomfortable by the scene they'd been forced to spectate, as an ugly, awkward silence had spread around the office. As she continued to shove donut after fattening donut into her mouth, Carrie thought grimly about how she would ever live this down as this would surely been engrained in their memories for a long time. After awhile of constant eating the seams of Carrie's sexy dress, which was skin tight even before her new show of gluttony, were beginning to creak ominously. Kirstie couldn't pass up the chance to make a big show of this to everyone, so she put her hand to ear next her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh folks\" She said with mock concern \"I don't know how much longer the structural integrity of her dress is going to hold out! Her fat belly is getting too large to be contained!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few awkward laughs were shared between some of Carries colleagues as Carrie ploughed on unabated. She was really feeling full now and her tight restraining cocktail dress was not helping as it uncomfortably restricted her belly. Her pace was really beginning to wane at this point, which was something Kirstie picked up on immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick up the pace\" She whispered dangerously into Carries ear \"I want you to stuff your face like the glutton you at until that flabby belly of yours rips out of your dress! Isn't that something you want all your work colleagues to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicccurrrp\" Exclaimed Carrie weakly \"Uh yeah... Sure why not. I'd love for everybody to see me outgrowing my clothes..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Kirstie \"Now hurry up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Carries distress her sadistic employer began stuffing donuts into her mouth right in front of everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys\" She said encouragingly to Carries work colleagues \"Get stuck in and lets see if we can make that dress rip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie expected people to leave at this latest request, thinking this was surely going too far... But much to her dismay several of her colleagues stepped forward. Carrie was now fed at an alarming speed, as Kirstie and several of her coworkers crammed food into her mouth. Considering what she had already eaten that day, it was not surprising that Carrie found it rather difficult to keep up with the shear amount she was now expected to eat. She was sat in an office chair, as it was clear that her growing food coma was making her unsteady on her feet and as she sat the fabric of her skin tight dress groaned as her belly pushed against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Carrie\" Said Dawn, one of Carries work colleagues who had often been offended by her brash attitude \"I think that dress was a bad idea if you were going to pig out like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mrrrfff!\" Carrie responded as Dawn stuffed a cruller into her mouth \"Thanks for the tip -hicc!-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Carrie was stuffed relentlessly by her employer and coworkers while the rest of the office watched on in mixed bemusement and interest. As she was fed she could actually feel herself outgrow the sexy dress she'd been forced to where, as it tightened uncomfortably over her bulging belly. Following a large iced bun from Dawn a seam popped just below her arm pit, which slowly grew as her more chub was added to her once perfect body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! I just made her pop a seam!\" Cheered Dawn, clearly proud of her achievement \"She must be getting fatter by the second! Do I win a prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Responded Kirstie with a wry smile \"In fact whoever makes her completely burst out of that dress will receive a rather substantial prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the feeding team exchanged glances and Carrie gulped weakly, her breathing laboured as she looked at her coworkers fearfully. The team seemed to get a new, even more frantic energy from the prospect of winning a prize, and the feeding now began again at earnest. Carrie was forced back into her chair by the sheer force and volume of the feeding she now received. Food was stuffed into her mouth at a truly astonishing pace, as each of her Co workers wanted to win the prize. As she was fed Carrie felt more of the seams of the dress begin to pop open as her expanding form pressed against the skin tight fabric which struggled to contain her. Parts of Carries flesh bulged out of the tears which were slowly growing on the dress, and Kirstie couldn't help but pinch one such bit of flab from the gorgeous womans growing muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great work guys\" Said Kirstie encouragingly \"Shes beginning to look like a sausage bursting from its skin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie shot Kirstie a weary look, a half eaten donut sticking from her mouth which was promptly pushed in by Dawn. It took only a few more minutes before the pay off everybody (minus Carrie) wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRIIIPPPPP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarries hugely stuffed belly finally burst dramatically from its sexy cocktail dress prison, ripping the fabric all the way up to her arm pit before coming to rest on her fuller thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a winner!\" Yelled Kirstie and some of the audience cheered \"Well done Dawn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The outfit that she now pulled on consisted of a tight black corset top which connected to a very short plaid mini skirt. She grunted with effort as she tried to pull close the clasps of her corset top, having to breath in as much as she could to close it. She felt like she was wearing a boa constrictor and she blushed when she caught her reflection on the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's going with the chubby cheerleader slut look\" Said Carrie moodily \"Great choice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carrie returned from the bathroom Dawn have a low whistle upon seeing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Just wow\" Said Dawn \"Now that's something... Oh actually just one more thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn signaled for Carrie to take a seat in front of her, which she did begrudgingly. Dawn then gave Carrie a couple of pig tails, tying each with a pink ribbon at the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\" She said, satisfied at Carries new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so\" Said Carrie grumpily, tugging at her uncomfortably tight corset top, which was constricting her belly which had bulged slightly when she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So today Carrie you will be my little assistant\" Said Dawn,before adding gleefully \"...Well not that little anymore i guess tehe! But anyway, if you could just look after my emails and do all my paperwork that would be great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do your job for you basically?\" Said Carrie \"And what will you be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know\" Said Dawn \"Just relaxing... Maybe having a little fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie turned and saw a huge line of people (comprising of most, if not all of her work colleagues) standing at her desk. She looked fearful as she saw that everyone of them were holding more food than they even carry, thinking grimly what this meant for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay enough slacking tubby\" Said Dawn in an authoritative tone \"Get to work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie scowled at the dig at her weight gain but nevertheless sullenly began working. Almost immediately Carrie felt a sticky sweet donut being forced past her lips, which she was forced to chew and swallow before another was stuffed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep working!\" Dawn barked, almost taken aback by her own authoritative tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie grunted a response before beginning to type away on her computer, just before the next donut was stuffed into her mouth. The feeder was a young intern who was holding two extra large boxes of Krispy kream donuts, and he was quite eager about emptying them into her mouth as fast as possible. Carrie was fed these donuts relentlessly and before long she was swallowing the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One down\" Announced Dawn \"Only.. <br>\r\nHmm... Say a hundred more to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie raised a weary eyebrow at the thought of having to be fed by everybody in the office wondering, despite her new larger appetite she'd gotten from all her over eating, how she'd manage to get through it. With obvious difficulty Carrie plodded on with Dawns work, typing up legal paperwork and checking emails while being systemically stuffed silly. Meanwhile Dawn kicked back and relaxed, only breaking out of it to give the odd stab at Carries ever climbing weight. The queue of eager feeders slowly dwindled as Carrie somehow managed to continue working, though her work was getting sloppier the more full and lethargic she got. Suddenly the phone started to ring and, following a nod from Dawn Carrie stifled a burp and answered it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello -hicc- Dawns phone, how may I-Mrrrf?!\" Carrie had wrongly assumed that the feeding would cease while she spoke on the phone and had been cut off by a large Danish being pushed into her face \"How may I help you? Urrrp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie shifted uncomfortably in her chair, her stomachs capacity being tested and its ever expanding form being tightly constricted by her corset top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Carrie\" Came a voice she recognised to be Kirstie's \"And how is it going today being Dawns assistant today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff... It's going very -hicc- well thank you\" Said Carrie weakly between each mouthful of food \"She is making sure I'm as -Murrrf- humiliated as possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful news\" Said Kirstie \"Could you please describe what exactly is happening and how your feeling? I have a room full here who are quite interested in your new piggish habits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err yes hello Carrie\" Came a voice that she recognised as her boss Mr. Pruzan \"I must say I was fascinated by the news, and felt I just had to hear it for myself... As did a few of the senior partners who had nothing better to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be -merrff!?- kidding me -urrrp-\" Said Carrie miserably, forced to swallow a bear claw mid sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\" Said Kirstie \"You must know how this works by now... So please, describe the events and how they unfold\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie flushed in complete embarrassment, gritting her teeth before finding the words to describe the humiliating scene to her peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well Kirstie...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie was maroon in the face as Dawn continued to roughly stuff more fattening, sugary treats past her lips while she was on a conference call to some of the most important people at her firm. She knew this was career suicide, but she felt powerless against such an influental and powerful client like Kirstie. And also, Kirstie was paying her handsomly for her 'services', but once she lost interest where would that leave Carrie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Came a demanding voice in Carries ear, snapping her out of her miserable thoughts into her miserable reality \"Did i tell you to stop describing your humiliation to us to fat cow? Actually, Dawn would you be so kind as to weigh that fatass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my yes!\" Said Dawn, clicking her fingers at a nearby intern and mouthing the weird \"scales\" to her which she immediately understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was clearly not ready to stop feeding Carrie, and continued to roughly push double handfulls of confectionaries down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet your clothes are starting to fit rather snugly now aye Carrie?\" Asked Kirstie \"Why not describe that to us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrfff! Urrrp\" Carrie exclaimed \"Well  thanks to Dawn &lt;hicccc&gt; I'm stuffed into a very slutty and tight outfit mrrrf!! I look ridiculous!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shes not lying!\" Chimed in Dawn happily, using one hand to push another donut down Carries throat and another to grab at her belly which bulged against the skin tight corset \"Shes getting quite a belly bulge now! Ooo, and here's the scales! Let's get you weighed you fat cow\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still having food piled past her lips Carrie was hoisted up and stood on the electronic scales as the board room waited in eager silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my Oh my\" Said Dawn as she saw the number rise on the scale \"Carrie please be so kind and read it out for everybody\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sighed to herself, while stifling a hiccup as she looked at the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc... One hundred and fifty five\" She said, clearly in disbelief at the huge jump in weight over such a short period of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blushed, rearranging her skin tight slutty outfit as the boardroom and the office howled with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this place\" She Mumbled dejectedly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day did not get any better for poor Carrie. When Dawn had to do some legitimate work which Carrie couldn't do, Dawn just fed her to the wolves. There was an eager group of colleagues who were clearly eager to further humiliate the poor beautiful brunette. As she stumbled between one feeding to the next she could feel her corset top becoming more and more constrictive as her belly grew with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrrp\" She managed to exclaim before a large, icing laden bear claw was pushed into her face, forcing her to eat it. <br>\r\nShe stumbled back as the sticky pastry was forced into her face and fell back onto an office chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw is somebody getting tired?\" Asked one of her cruel Co workers condescendingly, and as if on cue one of the clasps on her insanely tight corset top popped open \"Hahaha! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea\"  Said another \"Let it all hang out and relax...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarries sadistic Co workers crowded around her, some taking advantage of the poor beauties exhaustion and tying her arms and legs to the chair she was sat on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...hiccc... No more\" She Mumbled vaguely \"Too fullmrfffsh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\" Said a Co worker as she stuffed a donut into Carries mouth \"Time to use your mouth for eating, not talking fatass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sighed in miserable exhaustion as yet more sweet pastries were crammed down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, the law firm workers were grabbing their coats to head home. Carrie was still bound to her office chair, her breathing labored and her corset top completely popped open revealing her bloated, groaning belly. Their food sources dwindled to nothing, Carries Co workers had lost interest in her and merely left her bound to the chair as they went home for the day. Just then Kirstie entered as the last of her colleagues left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" She said, snorting with laughter at the sight of a very bloated Carrie bound to an office chair \"My my my... Mrs. Heffernan are you a sight for sore eyes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust turning her head slightly to give a lethargic look, used every last bit of energy that poor Carrie had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw don't pout honey\" Said Kirstie condescendingly, squeezing Carries cheek as Carrie glared up at her \"I'm proud of you! Look at that fat belly! What a pig your becoming! I couldn't be happier with the way this is going\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstie took the time to poke and squeeze her captives ever growing belly, enjoying the feel of the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak Hiccurrrp... For yourself...\" Mumbled Carrie as Kirstie undid her restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was\" Said Kirstie, as she helped Carrie to her feet \"I like the fact that your not exactly enjoying it. That... Pleases me greatly\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie groaned as she was led back to the scales, her exposed belly jiggling and bouncing with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the scales lard-o\" Ordered Kirstie and Carrie complied, weighing herself die the second time that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstie watched the numbers rise as Carrie groaned miserably, offering the odd hiccup or burp here and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"161!!\" Exclaimed Kirstie \"Holy crap on a cracker!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

As you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" Said Kirstie after a long pause \"Yes I suppose so... Tomorrow's a new day after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie breathed a sigh of relief and stepped off the scale, vaguely trying to cover her belly but failing. Her old clothes had been taken by Dawn so she had no choice but to go home in the ill fitting sexy garments she now wore. Luckily her coat was quite concealing so she donned this to cover her shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow Carrie\" Said Kirstie waving \"I can't wait\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah... Urrrp\" Replied Carrie vaguely and staggered out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived home she found Doug in the kitchen and hastily wrapped her coat tightly around her thicker frame to hide it and her slutty outfit from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" He said brightly \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Err... Good... Yeah\" She responded, rather unconvincingly \"You know me... Always going good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug frowned at this, as he didn't know a single person who would describe Carrie as always \"going good\" but he knew better than to open that can of worms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well allrighttttt then\" He said jovially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna get dressed\" Said Carrie, hastily excusing herself from the room and the unwanted interaction with Doug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and don't worry about dinner!\" Said Doug calling after her \"Me and Mr. Soo have got you covered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Great\" Responded Carrie without a molecule of the enthusiasm Doug had shown, before adding under her breath \"Crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie picked the loosest fit clothing she could find, but even then she found it clung rather uncomfortably to her frame and she had to keep tugging and rearranging it. Downstairs Doug had laid out a very large amount of Chinese food and Carrie gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you order the whole menu?!\" She asked incredulously \"There's only three of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, erm actually Arthur went out\" Said Doug, and saw Carrie about to say something so he cut her off \"He gave me a lot of free stuff for being such a good customer, what was I supposed to do? Turn down free food? You know I'm not about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie sighed feeling her thicker frame sadly as she looked over the takeaway laden table. She decided to just pace herself and he sensible, eating as little as possible as she knew Doug would have no problem going it solo. She sat down and took a spring roll which she daintily nibbled at while Doug loaded up his own plate height. She didn't know why exactly, but the situation seemed to get away from her pretty quickly as she soon found herself finishing her second plate and piling up a third. Before she had started she wouldn't have said she was even particularly hungry, due to how much she'd already eaten that day, but all her over eating was beginning to have an adverse effect on her appetite. Doug actually looked away from his own plate of food, something which didn't happen very often, and raised an eyebrow at the sight of his beautiful wife eating more and more like a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they not feeding you at work?\" Doug joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie shot him a withering look, silencing him, though also feeling very self conscious at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong with me?!\" She thought to herself, continuing the stuff her face even though she wasn't even hungry anymore \"I can't stop eating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug had since returned his attention to his own meal and the two ate in silence, almost as if it were a competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a half hour only empty food containers remained, and a rather substantial amount of their contents no resided in Carries bloated, groaning tummy. For the first time ever Carrie had matched Doug bite for bite, perhaps even eating more than him, despite the fact she hadn't really been hungry. The miserable form of Carrie lay spread eagled on the sofa, breathing heavily and trying her best to stifle burps and hiccups. She was completely disgusted with herself, as this time nobody had forced her to eat, she had completely pigged out all on her own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I'm impressed!\" Said Doug, who was no where near as full as his wife due to the fact that he was quite an experienced over eater \"You left me in the dust there! In fact, I'm still a little hungry... Need a little something sweet, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie wasn't really listening, as she was preoccupied with her severe food coma. However something in her food addled brain resonated when Doug mentioned the prospect of even more food. With some difficulty she managed to hoist herself up back into a seating position and fixed Doug with a rather unfocused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Fridge\" She mumbled weakly, despite the fact that she was beyond full at this point \"In -hicccc!!- da fridge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Doug stared at Carrie in disbelief for a few moments, who sat their swaying clearing suffering from a rather severe food coma. She had just eaten more than Doug had ever seen her eat and she still wanted more. In fact what was more now Doug actually took the time to look his wife over, she was definitely looking a little more \"voluptuous\" than usual, something even her loose fit joggers and t shirt couldn't hide. You didn't have to be a genius to see something was wrong, but as usual Doug was selfishly thinking of himself at the moment, that being that he wanted dessert. Under normal circumstances Carrie would certainly not allow him to have dessert, so he saw his chance and took it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" He said \"Whatever my baby wants, my baby gets\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie merely grunted a response before slumping back into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" He said to himself, smiling as he walked to the kitchen \"These are the good times\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug opened the fridge and liberated an 8 pack of chocolate pudding and brought it back to the living room. Doug put one of the chocolate puddings in Carries lap, who stared at it with a vacant almost zombie like expression while Doug happily dug into his own. Carrie grunted as she wearily sat up and began to eat her own, looking like she was doing so on auto pilot rather than being in complete control of her own body. It was clearly difficult for her to swallow anymore but somehow she persevered and emptied her pot, before groggily reaching for her next. Doug only needed two to satisfy his sweet tooth, but Carrie seemed insatiable as she ploughed through the remaining six with reckless abandon. When she'd finished she looked a little green to say the least, as she had never felt so stuffed in her life. After a rather large burp which she was far too weak to hide she mumbled something incoherent and almost immediately passed out on the coach. Doug grinned and picked up the television remote, and switched the channel to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He then opened a beer and sighed in contentment as he reclined in his chair and took a sip of his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good times\" He said simply, as Carrie began to snore, her taut barrel of a belly gurgling unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie awoke the next day, lying face down on the sofa. Her hair was mad and disheveled as she looked around the room, confused at her surroundings while the horrible memory of last nights binge returned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... No...\" She said as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes and saw the Chinese takeaway graveyard in front of her, making her remember what a shameless glutton she'd been \"Oh... Crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her stomach, and her fingers sunk into the doughy flesh that had accumulated there. It bulged over and under her so called \"loose fit\" joggers and her t-shirt was pulled so tightly over it her deep naval was visible through the strained fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you've let yourself go girl\" Said Carrie to herself as she poked at the small muffin top which rested on her lap \"It's official... You are now a fatass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also felt around the rest of her body, finding bulges here and there which were certainly not there prior to her meeting with Kirstie. She found that her underwear was feeling a little snug also, which meant a fair amount of her new weight had been added to her butt and breasts. While she explored her thicker form with distaste and shame, her stomach started to growl loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have got to be kidding me\" She said grumpily as she began to feel hungrier and hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved herself up and went to the kitchen, with the express intention of making a healthy and nutritious breakfast, though this idea faded the hungrier she got. Before she knew what she was doing she was rummaging through the cupboards, finding a box of Lucky Charms Cereal which she began to greedily eat from the box. She started by eating handfuls, washing it down with milk, before she just poured the cereal from box into her greedy mouth. This was followed with the whole carton of milk and she moved onto the next box of unhealthy cereal, which she consumed the same way with a litre of chocolate milk this time. After this box she ate three boxes of pop tarts, before moving on to other non breakfasty junk food. While she was eating slices of cheese from the fridge her father entered the kitchen from his basement bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning dear\" He said, making her jump and quickly swallow all the cheese she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Gulp... Hiccc! Morning dad\" She responded, like a child who'd just been caught doing something naughty \"How's... Um... Things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean aside from living in a basement like a common troll?\" He asked dramatically \"Never better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... That's good news\" Said Carrie awkwardly and Arthur frowned at her odd behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay honey?\" He asked \"I'm surprised your not ready for work yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah everything's fine y'know\" Said Carrie breezily, trying to rearrange her t shirt so that it didn't cling quite so obviously to her pot belly \"Got the day off today... Get some relaxin done y'know what I'm sayin? Heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good\" Said Arthur sounding appeased \"Well if you find the time outside your 'relaxing' to go to the store, I would very much appreciate some cereal... I see Douglas has already ravaged the cupboards this morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Responded Carrie before she cottoned on \"Oh... Ohhh yeah I know right? Clearly this is Dougs handiwork... Classic Doug.. I'll pick some up for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appreciated\" Said Arthur \"Anywho, I'd better be off... I have a score to settle with a certain smart mouthed paperboy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure\" Responded Carrie dismissively and Arthur left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie hurriedly went to her bedroom, the events of her most recent binge fresh in her mind. She decided to call in sick at her office, and when doing so was lucky that neither Kirstie or Mr. Pruzan were there yet. Using a skill she'd honed from years of skipping school, Carrie put on her best husky sickly voice and it seemed to work without any trouble. She breathed a sigh of relief as she hung up the phone, very happy to have a humiliation and feeding free day. This happiness was immediately mulled however as, against her better judgement, she decided to weigh herself. The scale read 166, meaning she'd managed to gain an additional five pounds completely on her own. She decided to change from her all too form fitting \"loose fit\" joggers and t-shirt, though knowing and dreading that it was unlikely anything else would fit her at this point. These fears were proven founded, as after about ten minutes of writhing and squirming on her bed while desperately tugging at her pants in an attempt to get them past her thick thighs, she completely failed. She stood up, panting, and looked at herself in her mirror. She wanted to cry at the sight, her jeans up to her knees with her belly bulging over her black panties. Her vest top couldn't even completely cover her belly bulge, or hide her impressive rack, and she thought back to how amazing her figure had been prior to meeting Kirstie. While she was lamenting the days of being slim and not appreciating them enough at the time, she suddenly remembered something. A few anniversarys ago Doug had gotten her a rather sexy outfit, which was a few sizes too big due to the fact he had no idea about women's clothing sizes. They had argued about it at the time but Carrie had never taken the outfit back, so it could be the only viable option she had. She part hopped and part waddled (due to the crazy tight pants around her knees) over the wardrobe, which sent her body jiggling violently. After rummaging around the wardrobe she found the outfit right at the back and pulled it out, though she grimaced when she saw it. Calling the outfit 'sexy' was a bit of an understatement, as it was actually borderline burlesque/ fetish. She had no idea what Doug had been thinking when he'd bought it, but at the time she would have imagined she'd never had to of worn it outside of some kind of boundary pushing bedroom foreplay. The outfit consisted of a black leather collar (like a dog collar) with a little white dickie bow on it. This was connected by black straps to the main part of the outfit, which was a tight lace tugged corset, also black leather, which had a ruffled trim above the bosom (much of the breasts would be on display Carrie noted) and a very short black tutu which would barely cover her underwear. Other straps connected black stockings and long black lace gloves, each of which also had the ruffled trim of the bosom. Understand lay Carrie felt rather self conscious as she reluctantly tried it on, cursing Doug as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After her unashamed gluttony however the kitchen cupboards were rather bare, so she had to go to the store to restock. Luckily she was able to find a black button overcoat which hid her shame for the most part, though the buttons were noticeably straining as they tried to hide her girth. With a deep breath, Carrie psyched herself and she left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove to the local mall, as due to her insatiable appetite a rather large food shop was required. Upon grabbing a shopping cart, she perused the aisles of the large grocery store, picking sensible things at first as she had to somehow curb her weight gain (or at least not be such a glutton when Kirstie wasn\u2019t forcing her to be). She took special care to not move too abruptly, as despite the fact her sexy outfit was fitted with a corset, the buttons were still dangerously close to popping off which was something she could not afford to happen. She almost didnt realize it was happening, but she had grabbed a large bag of bbq potato chips, which she had nonchalantly torn open and was carelessly shovelling down her throat. She met eyes awkwardly with a store worker, who had raised her eyebrow at the sight of the gorgeous, noticeably curvaceous brunette stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIll... erm... munch munch munch... hicc!\u201d She mumbled, blushing yet still stuffing her face \u201cPay for these at the counter... munch munch... I missed breakfast ya know... urrp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker looked her plump figure up and down with a look of distaste, scoffing at the sight of the buttons on her overcoat looking ready to explode off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you could stand to miss a few more meals\u201d She said bluntly, before walking off leaving Carrie standing there with her mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this rude employee would have had hell rain down on them from the hot tempered brunette, and indeed she felt her face flush with rage. But then it kind of fizzled out, her self esteem so low that she no longer had the energy to explode with rage like normal. She sighed to herself, looking dejected and hurt but nevertheless  emptying the last of the large bag of chips into her greedy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrrrrp!!\u201d She exclaimed, before grabbing several candy bars and tearing off their wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bars followed the chips, down her throat and into her ever swelling belly as she next set her attention on a large box of Lucky Charms cereal. She tore off the lid of the box like a wild animal, before grabbing a jug of chocolate milk and pouring it into the box. It was a trick she\u2019d learnt from Doug, the fact that she was picking up his questionable eating habits really stinging her pride. She just couldn\u2019t stop herself at this point, before she knew it she\u2019d already lifted the box to her lips and began to greedily glug down the mixture. While she gorged herself she suddenly became aware that she was being watched, before hearing a voice which made her blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie??

She hated herself for thinking it, but she actually would have eaten one or two of the delictible confectionarys quite happily, although she highly doubted one or two donuts was her tormentors game plan here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful idea Dawn!\" Said Kirstie clapping her hands together excitedly \"Lets see if they'll let this fat hooked in hehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tehe yeah Carrie you fat slut!\" Giggled Dawn and Carrie blushed, feeling very self conscious squeezed into the ill fitting slutty outfit she'd foolishly chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair dragged her towards her next calorific meal, as she tried to stammer a pathetic argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. but.. wait!\" She said desperatly as she was marched over and sat into a chair, Dawn and Kirstie clearly meaning business \"Lets not do anything to hasty... I'm so so sorry for calling in sick... please don't do this... mrrrff!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstie had thrust the first donut into her mouth at this point and Carrie knew her fate was sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush now my dear little chunker\" She Crooned \"I'm very cross with you... I'm hoping you'll learn your lesson after this... it's going to be a loooong day for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie gulped miserably as the first two donuts disappeared down her throat quickly, at which point she was full and would have happily stopped... but this was clearly not up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Naturally passers by stopped to watch as what appeared to be a chunky burlesque dancer received the feeding of a life time. Patrons of the popular donut shop began to gather outside after realizing it was closed, and noticing that bizarre spectacle occurring in its window. The miserable beauty blushed deeply from the humiliation, as the crowds grew along with her belly. Much to poor Carrie's dismay, her tormentors really turned up a notch and played to the audience. She was fed at a ruthless pace, with Kirstie and Dawn double teaming her and cramming donut after donut down her weary throat.

She returned with a thick hose, one end of which she pushed past Carrie's exhausted lips. The other end led to a vat of donut batter and frosting, which with a flick of a switch began pumping down the hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UhhDouglublublubbb\" She attempted to say before being cut off by the monstrously fattening mix, just as her and Doug's eyes met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This extra padding was mostly attributed to her marriage with Doug, as his rather extreme eating habits had rubbed off on her over the years.

Whenever she was told to do something she would often do the exact opposite and took a great amount of pleasure in the effects this had on people. She also enjoyed the effects that her looks had on guys her age (most currently her cousin George Micheal), as despite her numerous freckles she was a very pretty girl. Her hair was of a dark chestnut, the same colour as her eyes, and was long, frizzy and constantly being styled differently by her incredibly superficial mother. Her features seemed to be able to tread the line between strong and delicate, and her body was slim (she perhaps weighed 110 pounds) though not overally skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment she was bored which was a quite common as she got bored incredibly easily, and it was actually during these moments where she often decided to rebel.

Think of what people will say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby smiled at this remark, but Lindsey didn't seem to notice and left the room. Her mother hadn't realized the grave error she had just made, because she had just told Maeby exactly what she wanted to hear...

The weight gain powder had been left in the Bluth house by Steve Holt, and its discovery was a remarkable stroke of luck that only increased George-Michaels belief in what he was doing. Maeby visibly struggled to finish that large amount of food, but George-Michael wouldn\u2019t allow her to quit and shouted motivational slogans at her until she finished. Upon finishing Maeby collapsed onto the sofa, groaning as she rubbed her full tummy. It wasn\u2019t long before her food coma led to a fully fledged nap and soon Maeby was snoozing on the sofa, George-Michael staring at her bloated belly with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby awoke with a start at the shrill sound that rattled in her ear drums. She looked up blearily to discover George-Michael standing over her, holding the offending source of the sound which happened to be an air horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d Demanded Maeby groggily, as she rubbed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a schedule to keep to!\u201d Responded George-Michael happily, thrusting a brown paper bag into Maeby\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby examined the contents of the bag, still slightly dazed after being so rudely awoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez George-Michael\u201d She said incredulously, upon discovering a large amount of brownies in the bag, \u201cI literally just ate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge-Michael crossed his arms sternly before he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Maeby, you said you wanted my help\u201d He said, \u201cSo unless you listen to me there\u2019s no way your going to meet your daily calorie quota\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby looked as though she was having second thoughts about the whole thing, so George-Michael changed tact, knowing her well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do want to get back at your mother, don\u2019t you?\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lit a sudden fire in Maebys eyes and she nodded purposefully, which relieved George-Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets do this!\u201d She said and took her first bite of brownie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby ate at a steady pace, though she still felt full from earlier her will forced her to carry on (that and George-Michael of course). George-Michael handed her another weight gain shake, so she alternated between sips of it and mouthfuls of brownie until she had finished everything. She slunk back onto the sofa once more, this time undoing the top button on her jeans in order to allow more room for her bloated midsection (which caused a warm feeling of arousal in George-Michael, that he tried to hide).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was rather simple meal of chicken and potatoes (his father wasn\u2019t exactly much of a cook), which he soon realized wasn\u2019t exactly unhealthy. Thinking quickly he added a quarter of everybody's plate to Maeby\u2019s  (5 in all) and half of his own, which made Maeby\u2019s portion substantially larger. He then set to work on her food, melting a full bar of butter and lard into a separate bowl, which he then added a large helping of Steve Holt\u2019s weight gain powder to. He then added double cream to thicken the mixture, which he poured all over Maebys food (as well as more weight gain powder) and put all the food into the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

George-Michael finished his own meal while Maeby had barely made it a quarter of the way through her own. He felt a pang of arousal as he watched her stuffing her face, especially when he saw the bump of her bloated tummy. At the half way point Maeby had slowed to a crawl, and it was evident that there wasn\u2019t much room left in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Maeby\u201d George-Michael said encouragingly, \u201cFight the burn\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCant\u2026 uff\u2026 eat\u2026 puff\u2026 no more\u201d She whispered through her mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to get out of shape with that attitude\u201d He said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith obvious effort Maeby swallowed what was in her mouth and sat back in her chair, panting softly. Once again the top button of her jeans had been unbuttoned, a fact that George-Michael noticed with yet another pang of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 urp!... quit\u2026\u201d She said weakly and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge-Michael looked desperate, knowing that if he allowed Maeby to quit now she would do so again whenever she felt like it. If he didn\u2019t instate his authority now he knew he could kiss his dreams of watching her fatten up goodbye, which was something he wasn\u2019t prepared to do. George-Michael steeled himself, knowing what he must do though hoping he wasn\u2019t severely overstepping his boundaries as her personal \u201cUnfitness coach\u201d in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Maeby, but I can\u2019t let you quit\u201d He said, his voice breaking awkwardly through nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 ULP!?!\u201d Maeby attempted to say without opening her eyes, but was cut off by a forkful of food being crammed into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed by the block of cheese, which she was also forced to take a bite of and swallow before the next forkful of her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fight it\u201d said George-Michael softly, \u201cThis is for your own good\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMRRFSHH\u201d Was Maeby\u2019s only reply, which George-Michael decided to interpret as a positive response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to stuff her at a steady pace, and Maeby showed no signs of struggle as she was fed (though this may have been because she was too weak to stop it, George-Michael liked to believe it was because she was enjoying it). The force feeding took roughly ten minutes, with George-Michael following the routine of alternating between forkfuls of dinner and bites of cheese until everything had been consumed. When he had finished Maeby let out a fatigued burp and slumped back into her chair, with her eyes half closed. Maeby couldn\u2019t even speak and merely sat, uttering quiet moans and groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u201d Said George-Michael, impulsively \u201cLet me rub your belly\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby groaned at his touch, but didn\u2019t fight it as George-Michael rubbed her swollen mid section. The young beauty looked like she was in her 2nd trimester of pregnancy and needless to say George-Michael could feel the crotch of his trousers tighten as he caressed it. Soon maybe was fast asleep, snoring softly and George-Michael smiled to himself, happy with how the day had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is only the beginning\u201d He said ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

George-Michael placed a tray on her lap, which had a breakfast so large on it that it partially obscured him from view. There was a gigantic stack of pancakes which had been drowned in maple syrup, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. There were also 5 Twinkies and 5 Krispy Kream donuts that had been placed strategically around the base of the structure, as well as a super sized milkshake that contained a large helping of weight gain formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Said Maeby, raising an eyebrow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t really stick with much of a breakfast theme here did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell pancakes are breakfasty\u2026\u201d He said uncertainly, \u201c\u2026 And I guess donuts\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t really matter much at this point\u201d Said Maeby and George-Michael smiled at her attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby dug into the huge stack with gusto and found that it tasted astronomically superior to her dinner the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve outdone yourshelf\u201d She said through a particularly large mouthful, using the milkshake to help her swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby hadn\u2019t realized how hungry she actually was, and she tore through the extremely fattening breakfast and a swift pace. Upon reaching three quarters of the way through however Maeby finally hit the wall and her pace slowed noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 Hic\u2026\u201d She said feebly as she sat back against her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do it Maeby!\u201d Said George-Michael encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Too\u2026 full\u2026\u201d She said, between labored breaths, \u201cYou\u2019ll\u2026 Urp!... Have to feed me again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge-Michael stared at Maeby for a few moments, unsure if she\u2019d said what he thought she\u2019d said. Maeby looked up at George-Michael and he saw something in her eyes that made him realize how serious she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge-Michael was still unsure, although secretly he couldn\u2019t believe his luck. He picked up the fork from her plate and speared another large portion of the pancakes as Maeby watched on in anticipation. Maeby opened her mouth without instruction and George-Michael fed her, perhaps a bit more roughly than he intended due to his excitement. Maeby seemed to enjoy being fed forcefully, and she chewed her mouthful with her eyes half closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaster\u201d She said as she swallowed, \u201cI\u2019m being too slow\u2026 Force me to eat faster\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge-Michael complied, still obviously in disbelief as he crammed more and more food into Maeby\u2019s mouth, forcing her to eat faster. This process went on for about ten minutes, and once again George-Michael felt something happen downstairs from his arousal of feeding Maeby. Maeby\u2019s stomach was becoming extremely bloated and was poking from underneath her top as George-Michael stuffed the last morsel of food into Maeby\u2019s exhausted mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done\u2026\u201d He said quietly, unsure of how should act around her after what he\u2019d just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201d Groaned Maeby, looking a little green from the feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

George-Michael then returned to the room, once more carrying a tray stacked with so much food he could barely see where he was going.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch time\" He said happily, and Maeby opened her eyes sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" She said at the sight of the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in\" Said George-Michael as he laid down the tray in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the boss\" Said Maeby as she began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby ate steadily, once again alternating between mouthfulls of food and big gulps from the weight gain shake as George-Michael watched on happily. The tray of food was even larger than the one for breakfast, as George-Michael was trying to build up Maebys portion sizes so her body got used to it quicker (or so was his theory). Maeby grunted in satisfaction as she ate a large sub sandwich, finishing it amazingly quickly. After about twenty minutes of Maeby stuffing her face she began to slow, her bloated belly becoming evident once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp... So full...\" She said starting to sound weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight the burn!\" Said George-Michael encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...

Urp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge-Michael was hoping this would happen again, and he looked positively gleeful at the prospect of acting out his fantasy once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" He said, smiling broadly \"Open wide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby complied and George-Michael began to shovel the food into her mouth. Maeby moaned and groaned as she was force fed, her bloated tummy being pushed to its limits yet again. Despite the discomfort she felt Maeby actually really enjoyed the feeling of stuffing her belly beyond capacity, the feeling of it bulge outward due to her gluttony actually turned her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Faster... Mmrff... Urp!...Feed me faster!\" Maeby kept saying, despite how full she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge-Michael complied and pretty soon Maeby was being fed at a relentless pace. After about twenty minutes of this Maeby finally swallowed the last morsel of food and the top button popped off her jeans, allowing her incredibly bloated belly space to expand outward. She was breathing heavily, her eyes closed in discomfort as her taut belly rose and fell with her breathes, emitting angry gurgling noises as it did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done\" Said George-Michael softly \"You've popped your first button, the first of many...

She lifted up her top to examine the results of her binging, and saw that her belly still bore a slight bump from her gluttony (which she realized excited her in more ways than one). She prodded at it, noticing that it did feel softer than it did before but overall the weight she had gained had seemingly distributed itself fairly evenly (which made it less noticeable than she would of liked).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is my mother ever going notice my gluttony at this rate?\" She said to herself just as George-Michael entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dinners ready\" He said, smiling at the sight of her probing her tummy \"Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your ass I am\" She said and after donning another pair of jeans (as she had bust the button on the ones she was wearing) she followed George-Michael downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dining room Maeby saw that a large portion of the Bluth family were present, though to her annoyance her shallow mother was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Mom?\" She asked Tobias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And hello to you to\" He replied \"Am I not good enough company for you? She's out galavanting with some new male friend of hers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby pouted at this news and turned to George-Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats the point in getting fat and pigging out if my mother can't see it?\" She asked in a tone that suggested second thoughts (she was notoriously fickle, and rarely kept her mind on any one idea for very long).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it will be an even bigger shock to her when she sees you've put on weight... It'll catch her off guard\" Said George-Michael, desperate to keep her mind on the goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby thought about this for a moment before nodding in agreement and George-Michael breathed a sigh of relief. Maeby joined the rest of the family around the table and saw that the meal had been prepared in a buffet style, with all the food in the middle so people could help themselves to what they wanted. Before anybody could speak Maeby was right in there, piling whatever she could reach onto her plate as if she feared it would all soon be taken away. Most of the people sat at the table were in complete shock as Maeby began cramming food into her greedy mouth, any attempt at being lady like being left in the dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Well then lets eat i guess\" Said Michael Bluth, a little taken aback by Maeby's ferocious appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby ploughed into the mountain of food like a girl possessed, and most of the dinner guests tried to ignore her to focus on their own meals. That was apart from Lucile of course, who predictibly made no attempt to hide her distaste for her granddaughters piggish eating habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good God you eat like a pig\" She said with disgust \"Do you have any idea how repulsive you look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby looked her grandmother dead in the eye as she crammed more food into her greedy mouth, showing her how defiant she was. Lucile rolled her eyes and focused on her own meal and everybody ate in silence. Throughout the course of the meal Maeby refilled her plate four times, forcing herself to gorge despite the fullness she felt. She tried to hide the fact that she was beginning to feel aroused from pushing herself past the brink of fullness, though the look in her eyes was a giveaway. Everybody else around the table finished their meals around the same time, but Maeby ploughed on regardless. The atmosphere was getting a little awkward as Maeby continued to stuff her face in silence, and it was obvious that people wanted to leave but stayed sitting for the sake of manners. When she finally finished the last bite, she stifled a weary burp and undid the tight top button on her trousers (which George-Michael noticed with a pang of arousal). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... I hope you enjoyed that\" Said Michael, taken aback by Maeby's new ravenous appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrr -hic!-\" She groaned in response \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Hic!!...\" Said Maeby weakly, though still loud enough to be heard \"I want Urrrp... Dessert...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family looked dumbfounded at this statement, given how much the young girl had just consumed but nevertheless they slowly retook their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your serious?\" Asked Gob, \"You want more? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby felt her cheeks flush and a slight tingle from down below as she felt everybodys looks of amazement, and slight disgust on her. It was a little disconcerting for Maeby to feel these strange new feelings, though George Micheal seemed to enjoy watching them manifest themselves a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never.. Urpp.. been more serious\" She responded, her weariness preventing her from seeming as deadly serious as she would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed George Michael a look that he instantly recognised and understood so he nodded and hurried quickly from the table. Maeby realised in hindsight that she could have easily allowed her family to leave, and merely eaten dessert by herself without the looks of silent judgement. But she wanted them there, to judge her and look on in disgust, to talk about her behind her back speaking of what a disgusting greedy pig she was being... It turned her on in ways she never thought possible. George Michael returned with a bowl of pretty much everything that could be vaguely considered dessert; which basically consisted of an entire tub of ice cream adorned with everything from marshmallows to pop tarts. This was placed in front of Maeby, who's eyes were sagging severely and her breathing was rather laboured. She moaned softly as she opened one eye and saw the huge dessert in front of her, wondering if this was even remotely achievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\" Said Lucile derisively, \"Looks like that's to much, even for you my pig of a granddaughter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Maeby needed, the combination of the challenge and the insult (which caused another warm tingle in Maebys loins) sparked something inside of her that energized her to grab a spoon and dig in. Lucile glared at her granddaughter, whom she knew was pigging out in defiance of her. After the first few bites however Maeby quickly realized that though her mind and resolve were strong her flesh and body were weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. Urrp...\" She exclaimed weakly, as her large full belly groaned in miserable protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael was rather obviously leering at Maebys food stuffed belly as the weary young beauty came to a grinding halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maeby looked like she was on the brink of passing out, as her eyes were now fully closed and her breathing was laboured. She whispered something, but it was almost completely inaudible due to how weak she now was and the noise of her gurgling tummy so George Micheal moved his head closer to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Hic... Know what to... Urrrp... Do...\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments for the words to sink in and even then he wasnt completely sure he'd heard what he thought he'd heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... What?\" He said, in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...\" Replied Maeby, her voice rising \"Feed me... Hic!... Force all that food into my greedy mouth like the pig that I am... Urrrp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... In front of everybody?\" He whispered back, very aware of the eyes of his family upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Replied Maeby her eyes now fully open \"I want them to see what a greedy cow I am... And what a huge fat ass I'm going to become\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michal gulped, crossing his legs to try to conceal his excitement though he was pretty sure Maeby was well aware of it. With the eyes of his family upon him he picked up her spoon and scooped up a hefty pile of ice cream, which he then brought to Maebys lips. Even Lucile was speechless at what was happening, as George Michael began to force feed Maeby who was clearly very very full. Maeby groaned and shifted uncomfortably in her chair as she forced down each mouthful into her taut belly which was making her look pregnant. One hand rested on her belly while the other on the seat between her legs, partly to keep her steady but also because she was currently so turned on she couldn't resist but feel herself through her jeans. She bit her lip as she stroked her crotch, the increasingly uncomfortable fullness sparking increasingly intense sexual urges as another mouthful of creamy ice cream was stuffed into her mouth. The rest of the Bluth family looked more uncomfortable than ever, and soon Gob could clearly not take anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd love to stay and watch... Whatever this is\" He said, gesturing at the groaning stuffed form of Maeby as he rose from his chair \"But I have a magic show to prepare for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis departure seemed to inspire the other table occupants, as though now it was finally acceptable to leave and each of them began to follow suit. Lucile was the last to leave and she fixed Maeby, who was moaning and shifting in her chair as George Michael continued to feed her, with a powerful glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disgust me, you fat pig\" She said, sounding truly revolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.. Oink oink...\" Said Maeby lethargically, though the defiance was still obvious \"Uuuuurrppp!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile suddenly went red in the face, her trademark cool contempt being replaced with real anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be a greedy disgusting pig?!\" She yelled and George Michael stopped his feeding operation, startled by his grandmothers sudden rage \"Fine... Then ill treat you like one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille stalked forward and George Michael stood and backed away as Maeby merely sat and groaned seemingly barely awake. Lucille grabbed the spoon from the plate, which still contained about half of the behemothic dessert and loomed over the barely conscious form of her granddaughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your mouth\" She ordered and she saw the sides of Maebys mouth twitch, betraying the pleasure she was still obviously feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby obeyed without question despite the groans of despair from her incredibly full and taut tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink for it pig\" Demanded Lucile, trying to find a limit to her granddaughters self deprecation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink oink\" Maeby whispered, her eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile stuffed the spoonful into her mouth, which with some difficulty Maeby forced herself to swallow. George Michael watched on, desperately trying to disguise his own arousal as Lucile stuffed spoonful after spoonful of thick creamy ice cream into Maebys greedy mouth. Maebys insanely bloated belly was now poking out obviously from under her top, and was slowly pushing down the zipper of her trousers. Lucile was getting more angry as Maeby was clearly enjoying herself (her hand was now snaking its way down the front of her panties) so she suddenly dropped the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should be fed in a style more befitting to your disgusting gluttony\" Said Lucile smiling nastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaebys only response was her laboured breathing as Lucile lent closer to her. George Michael watched on curiously as Lucile gently stroked Maebys head, before grabbing it and pushing it downward into the bowl of ice cream. Maeby merely uttered grunts (partly due to exhaustion and partly due to wanting to act the part of a pig) as she slowly ate her way through the dessert her face had been forced into. Maebys groaning belly was forcing down the zipper on her trousers as it was stuffed way beyond capacity, but no matter how full she got she didn't want to stop. On the contrary the more uncomfortably stuffed she felt the now turned on she was, and this coupled with the humiliation she was feeling was really making her moist downstairs. When she had finished the gigantic dessert Maeby remained lying face down on the table, <br>\r\na barely audible moan coming from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable\" Said Lucille in disgust \"No pride whatsoever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Maeby awoke, having set her alarm earlier than usual for her to get ready for school. This was definitely the first time she had ever risen early for school (she was often late) and at first she'd couldn't actually remember why she had. Slowly her mind cleared and she remembered however, and upon doing so she lifted up the blanket to examine herself. She was excited to see how much weight she had gained, and hoped that it was noticeable. She caressed her tummy, squeezing it softly to see if she could grab hold of any fat and was delighted that she now could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez...\" She said quietly to herself \"What a little fatass I'm becoming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she demeaned herself, Maeby felt a familiar sensation in her loins and smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that I'm up...\" She said, and slowly lowered her hand down her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an intense twenty minutes of self pleasure, interspersed with self deprecating comments which spurred her on, Maeby got out of bed and went to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay tubby\" She said to herself \"Lets see how much fatter you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby got on the scales and eagerly watched the numbers rise, wanting the figure to be as high as possible. When the number stopped Maeby gave a low whistle at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\" She said with mock concern \"133 lbs... I've really let myself go... Guess this fat bitch needs to go on a diet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby walked downstairs, guided by the smell of cooking bacon and found George Michael busying himself in the kitchen. He was preparing a gigantic breakfast, something which Maeby was becoming accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what's all this?\" Maeby purred and George Michael smiled \"Surely you can't expect me to eat all this? If you hadn't noticed I've already put on quite a bit of weight... At least fifteen pounds of disgusting flab actually... Thanks to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I had noticed, you fat slob... And your welcome\" Said George Michael \"Now sit down, shut up and eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the events of the previous day George Michael had realized just how into this Maeby actually was, which meant he could now take control and push her harder than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" She said, adopting a meek disposition and took a seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby loved how George Michael was dominating her, and she tried to hide her eagerness as a huge plate of food was laid in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then\" Said George Michael, his domineering tone breaking slightly as it was not one he was used to using \"Stuff your fat face... We want you to be bursting out of your clothes when you get to school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby bit her lip as she imagined herself in that scenario, her clothes clinging to her bulky frame, the buttons straining obviously as her fellow schoolmates whispered to one another and laughed behind her back. She dug into the plate with a furious vigour, desperate to stuff herself beyond capacity and gain weight as quickly as possible. Maeby ate and ate, not even giving herself a chance to taste what she was eating due to how fast she shovelled it in. George Michael waited patiently, watching the pretty young brunette stuff herself silly, waiting for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrp!\" Exclaimed Maeby after consuming a large portion of the large breakfast, though not all of it \"Uhhh... Can't eat no more... Guess I'll just have to leave the rest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed a look at George Michael confirming that his favourite time had come at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear\" He said, relishing the new domineering confidence he felt empower him \"That will never do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaebys mouth twitched into a smile as George Michael approached her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now open up nice and wiiiide my little piglet\" He said spearing a large piece of waffle on the fork \"Lets get you nice and fat for our school to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael had to practically carry his poor stuffed cousin back upstairs to get her ready for school. Maeby was stuffed to the brim and beyond, a rather uncomfortable feeling that she had grown to adore over the past few days. Together they carefully selected an outfit for the day, deliberately picking the tightest one available (though a large portion of her wardrobe was becoming too small for her growing frame). Then, with buttons straining noticeably from her girth (and another weighing which revealed another 2 pound gain from breakfast alone, putting her at 135lbs) Maeby and George Michael made their way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\" Said George Michael, handing Maeby a backpack which she took and felt that it was quite weighty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" She asked, puzzled as she unzipped it to peak inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I figured you'll probably get hungry throughout the day\" He said \"Especially considering, you know, what a fat greedy glutton you've become\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me well\" She says quietly \"Master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby then fixed George Michael with a meaningful look that, even with his newfound confidence and bravado had to sink in for a few moments before he understood. The dynamics of their relationship had changed irrevocably, and George Michael couldn't have been happier for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>George Michael and Maeby didn't share every class that day, which was something he would later come to lament, though luckily they shared the first one. He sat behind her and grinned as he watched her carefully reaching into her bag while their teacher droned away at the front of the class. She turned and gave him a rather seductive wink before digging into the first selection of the bag of treats he'd provided her. George Michael was impressed at how stealthy Maeby was being, perfectly timing each bite of food whenever the teacher turned his focus away from them, but in doing so her consumption speed dropped. George Michael didn't much care if Maeby was caught, in fact at this point he honestly thought she'd enjoy the embarrassing attention, so he quickly scribbled a note to encourage her to eat more quickly. He tapped her lightly on the shoulder and she turned to him whilst swallowing a mouthful of cheesecake and looked at him quizzically. He passed her the note and she raised an eyebrow in a very cute look of interest and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note read \"Eat faster fatass!! It doesn't matter if you get caught anyway, it'll draw everybodys attention to your new blubber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corners of Maebys mouth twitched in unmistakable amusement and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master...\" She whispered \"You are so mean to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of their fellow class mates were giving interested looks from the corners of their eyes, clearly eavesdropping as Maeby lifted the bag of food onto her desk. Their neighbors went from peripheral vision to full on staring now as the pretty young brunette began shovelling food into her mouth from the bag, snorting and grunting as she munched away. Maeby knew her classmates were staring and she felt a familiar flutter downstairs, though it seemed much warmer and intense than it had before. Maeby realized that the larger the audience, the more pleasurable it was for her and she vaguely wondered (as the pleasure was making her less rational by the second) what her life was going to become if she continued down this path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Miss Funke\" Said the teacher, who had stopped his boring lecture when he had noticed Maeby stuffing her face like a girl possessed \"Can you please save your lunch for um lunchtime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sorry-urrp!\" She said simply, continuing to wolf down the bags contents \"I'm far too greedy I'm afraid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me young lady?\" Said the teacher, a combination of dumbfounded and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class were listening intently now, clearly very interested in the bizarre scene unfolding in otherwise despicably dull lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm far too much of a -munchmunch! Ulpp!-greedy fat cow to stop sir\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher clearly couldn't believe what he was hearing, as this was not a scenario he'd encountered before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Funke!\" He yelled, trying to stay in control of the class as people began to laugh \"Come to the front of the class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby merely shrugged, clearly unrattled at her teachers growing anger. She carefully rose to her feet, deliberately struggling to pull her slight pudgy belly past her desk which made George Michael carefully cross his legs to hide his arousal. To the teachers disbelief Maeby took the bag with her, continuing her gluttonous feast as she slowly walked to the front of the class, deliberately taking her time and dawdling so she could continue to gorge. Maeby could hear the whispered words and laughs behind her back and she moaned softly, her cheeks flushing as she felt the flutter of pleasure in her loins. It was very noticeable to all present that the pretty brunette had put on a substantial amount of weight in a small space of time, as she was practically squeezed into her shirt and trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Miss Funke, if you like being the centre of attention so much maybe you should finish that whole bag of food in front of everybody here!\" Said the teacher smugly, obviously thinking that this would be a fitting punishment for the gluttonous beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael gave an involuntary snort at this, clearly amused at how things were transpiring. Maebys eyes flickered onto him for a moment and she gave a look of mock horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\" She said, with seeming concern \"Please don't make me sir... That would be so humiliating, in front of my classmates and all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've brought this on yourself Missy!\" Announced the teacher dramatically, clearly thankful to have apparently regained control \"You will eat every last morsel, then maybe you'll learn a valuable lesson about not eating in my classroom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael was all smiles, something Maeby obviously noticed as her mock forlorn gaze fell on him for a moment. He was amused at how little the teacher, or indeed the whole class understood what was truly happening as Maeby dug into the bag of food. He saw how every not so subtle whispered insult and laugh from her classmates caused Maeby to jolt with pleasure and stuff her face even faster. George Michael leaned towards his neighbour, a very pretty and popular girl, to voice his opinions on what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe this fat pig?\" He said \"Like what is she even doing right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Replied the girl who had been in disbelief until this point \"Hey Maeby! When did you become such a lard ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class erupted in laughter and Maeby blushed, though her eating only seemed to increase. The taunts and laughter slowly built in volume which the teacher made no attempt to control, obviously thinking that Maeby deserve every last cruel jab and insult. Maeby ate and ate, every so often grabbing and squeezing at her crotch and breasts as the insults turned her on. The buttons on her shirt had been straining before she'd even come to school so now they were really being punished by her ever growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down guys!\" Yelled George Michael \"It looks like the fat idiots fat gut is going to pop those shirt buttons right off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby squirmed where she stood, never stopping her public gluttony as she felt her bloated, uncomfortably full belly push against its tight shirt prison. She was so turned on that she wanted to pleasure herself right there and then, but with remarkable restraint she stopped herself, thinking that this would definitely be pushing things that step too far. Her shirt buttons were audibly creaking, and when she finished the last of the good bag they had finally reached their limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pop!* *Pop!* *Pop!* *Pop!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne at a time the buttons popped off Maebys tight shirt, and flew across the room towards the rest of the class who roared with laughter. Maeby was breathing heavily from bring so stuffed, and one particularly laboured breath also popped the top button off her skin tight trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I think that's enough Maeby\" Said the teacher, clearly a little uncomfortable for being the cause of what had just happened \"Please retake your seat, and remember in future not to eat in my lessons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicuuurrrrppp!! Yessir... Uhrrr\" Maeby responded before groggily stumbling back toward her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer now near buttonless shirt (a few remained, though clearly strained over her bosom) completely revealed her pale belly, and as she walked past her classmates this was poked and prodded while they mocked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay that's enough class!\" Said the teacher, getting their attention back on him and his lesson \"Leave the greedy girl alone now and lets focus on learning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your such a disgusting fat pig aren't you?\" Whispered George Michael to Maeby, who was lying face down on her desk and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hicc! Damn right master\" She mumbled \"Oink oink\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

On the contrary this only seemed to strengthen her resolve and force her onward into an even more uncontrollable feeding frenzy. After the first lesson, Maeby and George Michael parted ways (which George Michael did with a playful slap of her growing derriere) but this didn't stop the sexy, growing brunette from seeking pleasure as she had before. In between lessons George Michael was happy to see her stumbling along the school hall way, never without some morsel of food poking past her lips despite how full she clearly was. At the end of the day they walked towards the exit together, and George Michael couldn't help but poke her exposed belly with a look of wonder and arousal on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your really getting... Porky\" Commented George Michael and Maeby blushed \"Have you weighed yourself today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc! Yes I did master...\" Maeby purred \"I am now a healthy 138 pounds... I hope that pleases you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yes... It does\" Said George Michael, still getting used to his cousins new attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a group of girls who had shared the first lesson with Maeby shoved deliberately past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of the way you fat loser\" The lead girl spat and the others giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... If my fat belly got in the way\" Murmured Maeby, clearly turned on by the insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the school building Maeby caught sight of somebody she had not seen for a few days; her mother Lindsay. She was standing in front of her car, clearly intending to give the two a ride back home to the Bluth complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey\" She said brightly \"I'm back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Hi Mom\" Stammered Maeby, caught off guard by her mothers sudden appearance and briefly forgetting her whole weight gain plan \"What are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i haven't been around for a few days, so I thought I'd drop by your school and give you guys a ride home\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael shifted uncomfortably as he noticed Lindsey frown slightly as she looked at her daughter, clearly noticing some difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to your shirt?\" She asked slowly \"Your.. Um... Belly is showing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um\" Said Maeby, suddenly self conscious before slipping back into her new self \"I guess I've got too fat too fit into it...

She knew exactly what her daughter was doing, as this was not the first time she'd gone to extreme measures just to get under her skin. She decided to have a little fun at Maebys expense, not realizing the sexual pleasure her spiraling weight gain was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really\" She replied simply \"Hi George Michael\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hi\" Said George Michael awkwardly, seeing Maebys face drop at Lindseys complete indifference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu.. But\" Stammered Maeby, finding her voice after her mothers surprising response \"Look at my fat belly! I'm a fat bitch! Don't I disgust you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay almost smirked as Maeby performed what could only be described as a truffle shuffle, shaking the slight bulge of a belly she'd gained, causing it to wobble comically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" Replied Lindsay again \"You actually look like you've lost weight deary, I'm a little worried... Have you not been eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Said Maeby in exasperation \"I.. I... Yes! Of course I have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a ride back home George Michael?\" Asked Lindsay, completely cutting across Maeby \"Hop in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Said George Michael, also reeling a little from the strange exchange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby was still trying to argue as George Michael and Lindsay got in the car, so she sullenly followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is she talking about?\" Said Maeby quietly as she sat next to George Michael in the back of her mother's 4x4 \"I'm getting fat aren't I??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael mused on this for a moment before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" He said slowly \"I guess you've been slacking a bit... Maybe it's time you get really serious about this, and show your mother what a fat pig her daughter is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pep talk inspired the response George Michael was looking for, that grim look of determination from Maeby meaning things were going to get very interesting indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and George Michael emptied the cupboards of whatever junk food they could find and retired to Maebys room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the drill\" Said Maeby handing George Michael a rope and sitting down on a chair with her hands behind her back \"Feed me.. Until I pass out if necessary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael was very excited by her determination and was very happy to comply with her wish and tied her arms behind her back. The feeding began in earnest, which George Michael maintaining a fast and steady pace. Maeby had a steely and determined expression on her face as she inhaled whatever George Michael stuffed into her mouth. To begin with there was a gigantic party bag of nacho chips which Maeby was fed by the handful, each of which had been dipped liberally in sour cream and nacho cheese. Throughout the bag Maeby managed to get through ten pots of dips, as each handful had basically a huge scoop on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrfff.. Uhh... Uhhrrrp! Feed me faster damn it!\" Said Maeby desperately \"Stuff my -Mrrrfff!! Stupid fat face.... Tell me what a fat pig bitch I am hiccc!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say\" Said George Michael holding her head fondly with one hand before forcing the nozel of a can of squirty cream into a mouth in spraying it in \"You fat slob! Did you see the look on peoples faces at school? Your a fat disgrace! Imagine what people will say when you're an immobile blob of fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in Maebys food crazed sordid mind she registered the thought of being an \"immobile blob of fat\". It certainly hadn't been her intention to reach that point, but she couldn't exactly argue while she was guzzling down whipped cream. She half hoped it wouldn't come to that, but her dark fetish side (which had already begun to take over) hoped that it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll -munch munch ulpp!- show mom! Hicc!\" She managed to say between each mouthful \"She'll be -munch munch! Urrrp!\" Disgusted at what a fat bitch her daughter has become hicccurrrp!! I want you to fatten me up to at least 160 pounds before dinner master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael was using both hands to cram food down her throat this point, so he knew it wouldn't be a problem to get her to her desired weight. Time seemed to pass very quickly, as it seemed no longer than ten minutes before they heard Michaels voice calling up the stairs announcing dinner was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Uhhrrrp\" Groaned Maeby, clearly very full but enjoying the discomfort \"Lets -hiccc!- get my fatass on the scales shall we -burrp!\" Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael seemed eager to do just that as he quickly untied his cousins binds and, with a little more difficulty than expected, pulled her to her feet and walked her to the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"161 pounds!\" Announced George Michael after a long whistle \"Not bad for a pre dinner workout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Maeby burped and the button popped off her pants with a satisfying *ping*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you've saved room for dinner tubby!\" Said George Michael in amusement \"In fact, you said you wanted to prove a point to your mom... Shall we dress you for the occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat costume do they choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With considerable difficulty, Maeby made her way from George Michaels room, her latex pig outfit squeaking and creaking as her ever expanding figure pushed against it. He followed her out and grinned to himself as he watched her pull at the back of her pink leotard, as it was clearly giving her a wedgie. Maeby squeaked down the stairs and into the dining room where the table was all laid out for dinner. No other family members were present, which George Michael attributed to them being uncomfortable around the ever growing form of Maeby. Maeby took her seat at the table, her pink pig leotard squeaking loudly as she parked her chunky booty in the chair. George Michael sat down next to her, preparing to wait for Lindsey to bring in the food, but Maeby immediately called out to her Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOink oink oink!! Your fat daughter is hungry mother!\u201d She said very loudly \u201cI must stuff my greedy face right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Silence followed before Lindsay entered the room carrying large plates of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing my dear\u201d She said, not even acknowledging the self deprecating things her daughter had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the plates on table before looking up at Maeby sat there squeezed into her ridiculous outfit. Lindsey frowned as she looked at her daughter, something which Maeby looked clearly proud of as her mother had finally noticed what a disgusting fatass she was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s different about you my dear\u201d Said Lindsay and Maeby grinned while pushing her impressive bosom outward so it bulged above the pink latex \u201cA new hair style? It suits you, its about time you took some pride in your appearance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby looked dumb founded and George Michael nearly smirked, seeing what her mother was doing. Maeby was too blinded by her desire to displease Lindsay that she couldnt see that her mother was playing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... but I...\u201d She stammered \u201cIm dressed as a... oink oink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay merely smiled and left the room, living a perplexed Maeby and an amused George Michael sitting with a huge plate of creamy mashed potato, a huge pitcher of gravy and a plate of fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cant... how did she not notice?\u201d Asked Maeby in complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess your just not serious enough about this\u201d Said George Michael bluntly \u201cNows the time to up your game\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaeby breathed deeply through her cute little snout, clearly trying to psych herself up to put on a show for her mother despite how much she\u2019d consumed already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what to do\u201d She said gruffily \u201cill show her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Michael knew the drill by now and didnt skip a beat in grabbing the food laden plates from the centre if the table. As he grabbed them he frowned slightly, expecting them to be piping hot as the food had just been prepared, but found them warm but cool enough to eat. He quickly surmised this was no accident, meaning this was all staged by Lindsay.  He realized that if was the case, then Lindsay had intended all this food for Maeby and had probably taken special precautions to make it is a fattening and calorific as possible. He was of course correct, but despite the insane amount of calories contained within the innocent looking dinner, Lindsay had also added another \u2018special ingredient\u2019 which was part of the much larger plan Lindsay had in store for he oblivious, disobedient daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Polly writhed on the bed trying to escape but as she was stuffed silly the fight in her slowly drained away until she merely lay there miserably. As Manuel stuffed in the last part of the gigantic meal, Polly let out a little hiccough before merely groaning softly.

It felt like not a minute passed between each feeding, which made doing her actual job a lot more challenging. She was trying to clean a guests room when she was descended upon, forced onto the bed and fed fattening snacks with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUlpp!! Munch munch! Urrp\u201d Exclaimed the pretty Blonde as bags of crisps were emptied down her throat by Manuel \u201cWhy areeumfff!! Munch munch! Hicc... you doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy I do what?\u201d Replied Manuel in broken English as he moved on to a large paper bag of heavily iced pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy urrfff!! Do you keep mrrrff! Stuffing my face?! Hiccurrpp\u201d Demanded Polly in between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErmm...\u201d Considered Manuel, clearly not even sure of the answer himself \u201cYou too skinny maybe? Guests maybe prefer a fatter maid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly was not overly keen on the explanation, as she had no desire to be fat, but Manuel didn\u2019t let up for a second and merely continued piling food down the poor girls throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her shift came to an end, poor Polly was a little worse for wear. She\u2019d spent the whole day stumbling from one feeding to the next, somehow attending to her other duties as well. When Basil found her she was laid groaning on the bed in an empty room, her bloated tummy visibly pressed tightly against her blue maid outfit, rising and falling with each laboured breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear oh dear\u201d He said, without much compassion \u201cLooks like somebodys overdone it today, hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh...\u201d Groaned Polly wearily \u201cBruuuurrrpp!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sentiments exactly\u201d Said Basil, clearly amused \u201cWell it looks like your a bit... Ahem... Too full to go home, so I guess you can spend the night here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly muttered something unintelligible before drifting off to sleep, her taut tummy still gurgling loudly.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nThe next morning Polly was woken by the morning sun shining through the window. She opened her eyes groggily and assessed her surroundings with confusion, not recognising where she had spent the night. Her memory returned to in drips and drabs and her heart sank when she remembered the previous days events, particularly Manuels revelation that she was going to be fed until she was \u201ca fat maid\u201d. Instinctively she lifted up her Maid uniform to inspect the damage which had been done to her figure by her crazed feeders. She frowned as she poked and squeezed her tummy, a very cute expression in her gorgeous face, unsure if it felt softer than it had the day before. She jumped at the sound of a brisk knock at her door, which she cautiously rose from her bed to answer. Her caution was well founded, as no sooner had she opened the door that she was being frogmarched back to her bed by Manuel and pushed back down onto it. Behind him she saw Terry bringing up the rear with a sheepish look on his face, pushing a cart covered in a metal dome. From her recent experiences and the hands of these two, it didnt take her much to figure out what was underneath the metal food cover. Her suspicions were proved correct when the cover was removed revealing an intimidating plethora of breakfast items. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNo no waitmrrrf!\u201d Polly attempted to plead but was cut off by a pancake being shoved into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast!\u201d Said Manuel happily before following the first pancake with a second, third, fourth etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of pancakes was excessive to say the least, but even so the whole stack somehow found its way into Pollys ever expanding tummy. The final pancake however was rolled into a funnel shape by Manuel, who pushed the small end into Pollys mouth. Polly miserably stared past the pancake funnel to Manuel who looked very proud of his own ingenuity as he grabbed a large box of heavily sugared cereal and poured that down the makeshift funnel.  The box was poured until Pollys cheeks bulged comically, at which point a healthy glug of milk was poured down which forced her to chew and swallow her mouthful. This process was repeated until three large boxes of cereal and bottles of milk had been dispatched, at which point the pancake was also mercilessly stuffed down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhrraaarrp!\u201d Exclaimed Polly wearily as she collapsed back onto the bed, her belly bloated and taut once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Pol\u201d Said Terry, sounding sincere \u201cBut Basil said he wants to see all staff right away... Said he has an announcement or something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly could only offer feeble groans as Manuel and Terry grabbed her by the arms to lift her from the bed, before practically carrying her from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess i could do that, yeah\" Said Tara, not sounding particularly confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'd better\" Said Rachel darkly \"Otherwise there'll be trouble\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the conveyor belt kicked into motion, and soon plates were sent down towards Tara's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, there's your first load now\" Said Rachel \"You'd better get to it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then grinned evilly before leaving the room as a line of dishes full of discarded foods made their way towards Tara. Tara gulped at the shere amount, knowing this was only the beginning as a plate of greasy fish and chips stopped in front of her. The person who had ordered it had clearly barely touched it, and Tara sighed before digging into the large battered fish. It was quite tasty to be fair, though clearly very unhealthy which Tara realized was the whole point. She had to eat quickly as the next plate was trying to force itself onto the table, so with great effort she emptied the large plate before moving onto the next. This was again barely eaten, a large brownie sundae thickly smothered in chocolate sauce which Tara switched to a spoon and started wolfing down as the next plate fought for space in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unnhhh... Brain freeze!\" Cried Tara in discomfort as she massaged her temples as her speed of consumption had triggered brain freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had little time for recovery however as the next plate landed in front of her. She munched her way through this plate though the food wall was quickly approaching. She was a small girl, and the amount she had consumed already was way more than she was used to, as she could feel her stomach was beginning to feel uncomfortably full...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tara do?</span></div></div>",

The ruckus was not unheard as pretty soon Rachel entered the room looking red faced and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing you stupid emo bitch?\" She roared at the fatigued and bloated form of Tara \"Look at this mess you've made!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured at the numerous broken plates and discarded meals now littering the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too...

The sausage was soon joined by the others and the thick creamy mash before the empty plate was set aside and the she started on the next one. Throughout the feeding process all that kept Tara going was her thoughts of Simon, her true love (Ah, the niaivity of teenagers). The next few plates were a blur of frenzied chewing and swallowing, as Rachel was clearly becoming impatient. Meal after meal found its way into the beautiful teens groaning belly, which was actually quite and impressive feat considering its modest size. The confines of her belly were pushed to and beyond breaking point and it wasn't until the button finally gave up and popped off her trousers that Rachel mercifully stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Said Rachel, scrutinising the poor exhausted and bloated form of Tara \"That'll do for today I think...

For the most part they didn't even acknowledge Tara, as they gossiped with each other and sipped wine while cramming handfuls of popcorn, nachos and whatever other snacks they had lying around. Tara looked very weary and groaned miserably after swallowing each mouthful that she was forced to eat and by the half way point of the movie her eyes were basically shut. It was only after she swallowed a handful of toffee popcorn and let out a sudden burp that the rest of the girls suddenly paid attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you shut the hell up?\" Said Carli aggressively \"We're trying to watch the film you emo pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Chimed in Rachel \"Shut the Fuck up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between each word Rachel crammed a handful of food into poor Taras weary mouth, which the other girls clearly found amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fuck it\" Said Carli \"Lets just feed the bitch everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were clearly very happy with this idea (though Tara clearly was not) as they all gathered the remaining bowls and packets of junk food ready for the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls\" Said Carli \"Ready set... Go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were all leant over Tara (who stared back in horror at what was about to happen) up to the count down, and upon \"go!\" They sprung into action. Tara was already exhausted, so the feeding she now endured was very hard work indeed. The sadistic girls stuffed handful after handful of the fattening snacks into her mouth, each trying to finish their own stash first. Taras already comically swollen belly grew more and more, further pushing down the zipper of her buttonless jeans. After what like eternity Tara finally finished the last of the food, each of Carlis friends roughly stuffing their last handful into her mouth which she somehow found the strength to chew and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done girls!\" Announced Carli stroking poor Taras dome of a grumbling belly \"I think she learnt her lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhrrr...

Rachel treated her awfully, pushing her harder and harder to consume all of the left over food at the restaurant, which Tara ate focusing her mind on her goal of pleasing Simon. The constant gluttony was beginning to have an effect on her figure, as at her last weight in (the previous evening after 'work') she had come in at around 9 stone 28 (130 lbs), and she wondered sadly how much bigger she'd need to get. During school hours she saw very little of Simon, and she worried that he might be losing interest before she even reached her goal weight, as he seemed a little put out each time she did see him. During these times she did show affection, but Carli and her cronies were never far away so she was never given a large window to spend time with him. She hoped he at least noticed how her school uniform was getting subtly tighter as each day passed, but he seemed to be becoming increasingly aloof. Finally on Friday Carli was off sick, meaning that Tara could get away from her group of friends who seemed to have less interest of her without their queen bee present. During lunch break Tara went to the break room in hopes of finding her beloved there. She had to keep adjusting her school shirt and jumper, as well as her trousers as they were seeming much more tight and restrictive than they had at the start of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon!\" She yelled, her voice accidentally excited and shrill which caused heads to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was sat with Jay, Neil and Will in their usual place, and he smiled when he saw her.

Before you know it you're fucking a porker, and when that happens you know you've gotta fuck her off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slightly harsh\" Said Will \"But for once I think you've made a fairish point there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat girls need love to\" Neil chimed in innocently \"A lot of them are really grateful, so they don't mind doing weird stuff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay raised an eyebrow and gave Neil an incredulous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like taking it up the bum I mean\" Clarified Neil which did nothing to lift the looks of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thanks for that Neil\" Said Will sarcastically, which didn't register with Neil at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everybody\" Said Mr. Gilbert who entered, ruining Simon and Taras moment \"Stop whatever pointless conversation your having and listen to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he say?</span></div></div>",

Mr. Gilbert left the room, and the form slowly fell into line behind him and followed. As the gang were about to follow they were approached by Carli and her entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Simon\" She said, which caused a look of awkward terror from Simon \"Could I speak with Tara alone please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... Uhh.. Yes... Of course Carli\" Stammered Simon stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara tried to catch Simons eye with a pleading look, but he was far too focused on Carli to notice. Carli noticed this and fixed her with a crippling stare, as Simon, Will, Jay and Neil followed their class mates out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tara\" Said Carli, a sudden edge to her voice \"I do hope you weren't trying to avoid me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. No...\" Said Tara nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good\" Said Carli and her friends laughed \"Well lets get going then... On the drive there we would like to ask you to sit at the back of the coach with us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara clearly didn't share the groups enthusiasm but was given no opportunity to argue as she too was led from the room at a brisk pace by Carli's cronies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was marched right past Simon on the coach, who had saved her a seat, and was sat at the back. Tara groaned miserably as she was surrounded by the girls, each of whom carried a large rucksack whose contents she could guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls you know what time it is\" Said Carli \"And Tara you should know to, so prepare yourself... This is going to be a loooong trip hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara sighed as each of the girls opened their rucksacks and each removed some kind of junk food from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was indeed a long one, made even longer by the constant barrage of food the poor gorgeous emo girl now faced. Tara was certainly starting to regret asking for Carlis help, as she was beginning to realise the cruel blonde had anything but her best interests in mind. Furthermore when she had seen Simon earlier, he seemed just as enamoured with her than he ever had been... Leading her to wonder the truth of Carlis theory that Simon liked fat girls. Either way it was clearly too late to stop what was happening, as Carli and her entire entourage seemed obsessed with forcing her to get fatter and fatter. Tara chewed and swallowed as quickly as she could while Carli and her cronies fed her at a truly relentless pace. There were more than a few turned heads as other sixth formers on the coach regarded the strange scene at the back with interest and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrff!! Urrrp! Do we have to do this infront of everybody... Hiccc!\" Groaned Tara who was feeling rather embarrassed that everyone was seeing her being fed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes sweetie\" Said Tara as she pushed a donut past Taras lips \"I think everybody needs to see what a greedy pig you've become... And um, Simon loves that... I totally promise he won't be able to resist you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara didn't look convinced, as the girls exchanged amused looks before continuing to stuff her silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The coach trip lasted 2 hours. 2 hours in which the poor gorgeous emo girl was stuffed relentlessly, so much so that even the increase in her stomach capacity wasn't enough to keep up with it. The fact that she was completely surrounded by her fellow 6th formers meant that the spectacle was blocked from view to others on the bus, most notably Simon who may well have questioned why his hot girlfriend was being roughly force fed in public. Of course Carli remained the chief tormentor, forcing herself front and centre of Tara's gruelling humiliation. At present she was sat with her knees either side of Tara's legs so that she faced her in a kneeling position as she forced spoonful after spoonful of full fat yogurt into her weary mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right lard arse, you greedy fat slut! Keep stuffing your fat face!\" She growled ruthlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was far too stuffed and lethargic to offer any response other than the odd burp or miserable groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the coach arrived at its destination (a small, rather dreary seaside town) the students at the began to frantically pile as much food as possible into poor Tara's mouth, who was experiencing a rather severe food coma at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you dumb bitch, chew faster!\" Said Carli in a harsh whisper, as she and her cronies used both hands to stuff her silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone\" Said Mr. Gilbert \"Time to get off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 6th formers complied and followed him off, while Tara was pulled groggily to her feet. She had to be heavily supported to walk, so much so that she practically had to be carried from coach due to how much she'd been fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Tara?\" Said Simon at the sight of this, not noticing the telltale bulge of her midsection (her school jumper hid it quite well, had she not have been wearing it the buttons on her school shirt would he been noticeably straining against her belly and even her boobs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's feeling sleepy, bless her\" answered Carli, as Tara offered a miserable groan with unfocused, half closed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok\" said Simon dejectedly \"I'll see you later then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 6th form girls and boys were split into different in order to, in Mr. Gilbert's words, avoid any procreation. When the girls were settled in their room some scales were brought out, their purpose obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on the scales then you heifer\" ordered Carli and Tara meekly complied \"and read out what they say\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"135 pounds\" replied Tara glumly, who had now recovered from her previous feeding for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Exclaimed Carli as the other girls laughed cruelly \"5 pounds already?! And that was only a warm up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now at the mercy of the girls, and away from the prying eyes of Simon and Mr. Gilbert, the rest of the day was quite a miserable affair for poor Tara. It largely consisted of feeding and teasing, much as the journey here had been, but now it felt like it would never end. During the whirlwind of feedings and cruel jokes at her behalf, Tara had to constantly remind herself that it was all worth it for her beloved Simon. As evening approached the feeding mercifully slowed, as Tara was laid spread eagled on her bed breathing heavily from the amount she'd been forced to consume. Soon she pulled to her feet and plonked on the scales again, revealing a new weight of 140pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief!\" Said Carli with a laugh \"I bet that school uniform is getting a bit tight now aye? Why don't you whip that jumper off and show us what a chunker your becoming!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara blushed but nevertheless obeyed and the girls giggled cruelly at the sight. Her school did indeed look a few sizes too small, as the buttons were clearly straining with stress lines on the fabric. Carli prodded the small dome of Tara's belly, putting her finger inbetween where the shirt fabric was pulled tightly by the button so she could feel the soft flesh beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm talking about!\" Said Carli \"Keep that jumper off from now on and show that Buddha belly off girl! You want dear old Simon to see what a fat cow your becoming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded glumly, not particularly wanting her body to be scrutinised by the entire 6th form, though on the other hand wanting to see if it pleased Simon. For the next hour or so Tara was largely left alone as the other girls got changed. A party had been announced in their room, so they were all getting ready to look as hot as possible for when the boys arrived. Tara wasn't too thrilled on this idea, but Carli gave her a few pre drinks which took the edge off her nerve and made her head a bit fuzzy. Tara decided to get changed also but was stopped by Carli who shook her head at her and instead passed her a small plaid mini skirt from her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep the shirt and tie, but put this on\" She said \"it'll drive Simon wild\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara frowned a little but being a little drunk thought it sounded like a great idea and proceeded to wear the mini skirt as instructed. She was also persuaded to tie a knot in the bottom of her school shirt to show off her belly and also to tie her hair into pig tails. Soon the boys began to arrive, all of whom had already been briefed about Tara and what the evening would hold for her. As the room began to fill soon there was a knock on the door which once opened Revealed Simon and his unpopular entourage standing, each of them peering into the room expectantly. Tara, who was a few drinks deep at this point, went to wave to Simon but she was stopped in her tracks by Carli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so desperate\" Muttered Carli \"Your part of the cool group now and Simon... Well... Really isn't. If you show him indifference he will worship the ground you walk on, trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Simon noticed Tara and waved to her in his usual dorkish overly enthusiastic manner. Tara wasn't sure how to react for a moment, but then took Carli's advise and tried to look as indifferent and sexy as possible as she completely blanked him. Simon looked hurt but also raised an eyebrow as he suddenly registered how she was dressed, and the apparent weight accumulation at her exposed midriff. The door was then closed in his face, leaving Tara to feel a bit guilty for her actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"couldn't you have let him in?\" She asked Carli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's out of my hands\" Carli responded \"don't worry about him anyway... Loosen up and have some fun, here have another drink\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara took the drink, sighed and then proceeded to down it, which quickly erased any doubts she had had. Carli smiled as she watched the sluttily dressed school girl lose her inhibitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be fun\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tara jumped and twirled around feeling like the life and soul of the party (which sent her pigtails flailing and her small belly jiggling) she suddenly began to feel a little strange. It felt like a hot flush, a strange warm feeling which spread throughout her body and made her feel lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear you don't look so good\" said Carli, barely even pretending to sound concerned \"why don't you sit down, hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel... Strange\" Said Tara in a vague, slurry tone, as she took a seat on a chair which was sat in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara felt so dazed that she barely registered the fact that some of her classmates were tying her hands behind her back and her legs to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whu... What's happening?\" Tara was barely able to stammer as the increasingly pleasurable feelings intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I thought we needed some entertainment\" Said Carli in a careless manner \"So I spiked your drinks with Viagra\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Ooo... Did... Uhhhh... Whu... What?\" Tara managed to say between moans as the sexually pleasurable feelings grew in her loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me fatass!\" Growled Carli \"Now spread those legs slut!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarli yanked down Tara's panties before pushing a serious looking vibrator up her mini skirt and sliding it into her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhnnnggh... Mrfff??!\" Tara exclaimed before a funnel was pushed past her lips blocking the sounds of her groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\" Said Carli patronisingly \"No more talking from you, it's time we had some fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cruel smile Carli then reached her hand under Tara's mini skirt and turned the vibrator on, ensuring it was turned up to the absolute maximum setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muurrlllff!\" Babbled Tara as the sex toy vibrated quite violently inside her, her eyes rolling back and her cheeks going pink from the amazing feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay let's get this party started!\" Announced Carli, to which everybody roared in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music was turned up and soon the party was pumping, with drink flowing and people jumping and dancing. Tara was the complete centre of the party, as everybody took their time to torment her. This usually consisted of dumping one of the hundreds of calorific milkshakes, which had been provided for just this purpose, down the funnel and into the poor girls mouth. Others took group selfies with her, each of would be emblazoned over social media for the whole world to see. Carli, who was getting rather drunk at this point, decided she wanted in on the spectacle so she downed her drink and approached Tara who was currently glugging down her tenth milkshake. When she'd finished Carli saddled herself on her lap and stared seductively into Tara's unfocused eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your loving this aren't you you dirty fat bitch?\" Carli purred with a bit of a slur as she stroked Tara's face fondly  \"You love being the centre of attention, so let's have a little fun hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarli was handed another milkshake which she began to pour down the funnel while staring her dead in the eyes and then proceeded to grind on her. The rather sexual grinder had the added effect of pumping Tara's dildo deeper into her, causing her to give muffled squeaks of shock and pleasure. Carli could also feel the handle of the vibrator rubbing on her own crotch, which was also pleasurable and caused her to grind harder to increase her own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh yeah!\" Cried Carli as she rode the poor bound girl like a bronco while continually feeding her \"Do you uhhhnn like that you stupid fat ooooo slut?! Drink it down you greedy... Ohhh.. Fat cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carli got more and more into it, and once the milkshake had been finished, she began to grope at Tara's bulging breasts (they had gone up a cup size at least at this point) and squeeze her full tummy which hung over the waistband of her tartan mini skirt. Other party goers were filming the insane spectacle on their phones as Carli removed the funnel from Tara's mouth, allowing her muffled cries of pleasure to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhrrrpp! Ohhh ohhhh &lt;hicccc!!&gt; ohhh god!!\" She exclaimed, her moans becoming louder and more frequent as she got closer to an orgasm \"ohhh fu... Urrrp! Fuck yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarli herself began to moan softly, also closing in on an orgasm of her own, something she may have tried harder to hide if it were not for the amount she'd had to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'm going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue lolled from her drooling mouth and her eyes watered as Carli grinded away on her, pushing the vibrator deeper. Carli herself was beginning to moan and breath quicker as her clit brushed the handle of Tara's vibrator. What had started as a lap dance to humiliate Tara, had quickly turned into Carli pleasuring herself in front of her friends. The party itself had grinded to a halt as everybody present watched on in amazement, some filming on their phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhnnn... Ooohh ohhh ohhh!\" Carli whimpered \"Uhhh yeahhh, you fuh... Oooo... Fat bitch! Fat fucking cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh unnghh I'm a fat cunt!\" Tara almost bellowed in response \"Fat... Uhnnn... Fucking ugly bitch! Ohh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls began to whimper and pant louder and louder until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHH GODDDD UHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls climaxed together, reaching body shaking orgasms which sent their moans and cries echoing around the halls of the lodge. When they were done they both went limp from the exertion, with Carli lying on top of Tara with her head resting on her shoulder as they both panted. Nobody knew quite what to say about what they'd just witnessed, they merely exchanged stunned glances in silence. Some of the guys had clearly enjoyed the show, but the girls looked rather nonplussed and a little repulsed by it. Carli's mind suddenly cleared as the the party goers began whispering amongst themselves and it slowly dawned on her what she'd just done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\" She whispered \"God no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes met Tara's and she saw that hers were still glazed in weary pleasure, which could be attributed to the fact that her vibrator was still buzzing away inside of her. Carli looked positively mortified as she pushed herself up and away from Tara, her mind working feverishly. She feigned a look of disgust as she turned back to everybody, and climbed back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, did you guys see that?!\" Said Carli, sounding rather desperate \"This fat twat just fucking came! Do you believe that? She just orgasmed in front of everybody! What a loser, am I right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gave a rather excruciatingly long and nervous laugh, clearly desperate for somebody to join in with her. After what felt like a life time a few people began to laugh, which eventually spread around the room which left Carli looking highly relieved. The party began to build up again, and Carli breathed a sigh of relief thinking herself to be in the clear. Unfortunately for her however this was not exactly the case, as there were several influential members of the 6th form hierarchy who had not been bought off by her speech. Nevertheless the party was soon at the height it was before and Carli tried her best to forget the whole embarrassing incident. Meanwhile the funnel was shoved back into Tara's mouth and the intense feeding began anew, while she approached on her second orgasm of the evening. <br>\r\nThe party continued into the early hours, by which time poor Tara had reached a screaming orgasm six times. Each one had been more intense than the last, so by the end she was completely slouched into the chair she was bound to, having no strength to hold herself upright. On top if this she had consumed countless milkshakes, litres of the the stuff in fact, which contained many thousands of calories which had given her a great dome of belly which was packed tight as a drum (the top button of her mini skirt had been popped off long ago). Tara was barely conscious as Carli carefully slid the buzzing sex toy from her sopping wet vagina, offering only a vague murmur and a weary burp at its removal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" Announced Carli \"This losers looking a bit worse for wears! Let's get this lard arse weighed shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party goers seemed to be quite eager to find out Tara's new weight as several approached her and lifted her from her chair. She was led over to some scales, where she had to be held in place to prevent her slinking down to the ground from exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Exclaimed Carli when she saw the numbers on the scale confirming Tara's new weight \"146 pounds! Not bad for an evenings work, aye fatass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarli then slapped Tara's more prominent, softer rear causing her to give a fatigued burp and her buttonless mini skirt to fall down her legs, exposing her nether regions to everybody. The entire room erupted in cruel laughter and Tara blushed in complete humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Tara was given a well deserved break from the force feeding and torment she\u2019d become accustomed to, and was allowed to see Simon. She was excited at the prospect at seeing her beloved, but was feeling very self conscious , hoping that Simon liked her new curves. She sighed as she changed in front of the mirror, standing side on so she could better see the bulge at her midriff which had never been there before. As she felt the soft flesh, feeling rather gloomy about the extra weight she\u2019d been forced to gain, she began to experience other, much more complex and sexual feelings. She lost herself for a moment, one hand exploring her curves while the other slowly reached past her belly to her nether region. A knock on the door made her jump and snapped her out of her sexual trance. She felt embarrassed and confused at what had just happened, but tried to put it from her mind as she hastily got dressed to answer the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTara!\u201d Said Simon excitedly as she opened the door \u201cI\u2019ve missed you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi Simon\u201d She said, caught off guard by his appearance \u201cYeah missed you to\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara tugged absent mindedly at her black emo t-shirt, as she felt it clinging to her belly and pinching under her armpits. Simon frowned as he looked his girlfriend up and down, seemingly noticing how ill fitting her clothing was becoming, but deciding he must be imagining it. Behind Simon stood his goony friends; Will, Jay and Neil \u2013 who also seemed to have noticed something was different about the pretty emo girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm... do you guys notice anything different about Tara?\u201d Muttered Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew haircut?\u201d Answered Neil dimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad her tits done?\u201d Ventured Jay crudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay was actually in the right ballpark, as Will noticed that her breasts were definitely looking rather voluptuous today as they were clearly straining her t shirt. Will looked her up and down, noticing how her emo clothing looked snugger than it once had, clearly defining a somewhat curvier figure. Tara noticed Will staring at her so he hastily looked away, leaving both of them feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day the group left their lodging to wander around the rather dull and depressing seaside town they were staying in. There wasn\u2019t much to do exactly, but Simon at least seemed happy and content being able to spend some quality time with his gorgeous girlfriend. Tara on the other hand had other things on her mind, so she wasn\u2019t quite as invested as Simon was. Sure, whenever Simon embraced her in a snog she reciprocated, but she just tuned out his chatter offering only grunts in response. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Carli, and the events that occurred the previous evening. She knew she should have felt mortified and disgusted at the public humiliation she had endured... but this wasn\u2019t exactly the case. She did feel disgusted at herself, but also found reliving the events in her mind gave her a flutter of pleasure in her loins. It was exciting, in a deeply perverse way, and was something she\u2019d never felt before. She heard Simons voice end on a higher tone, indicating he had just asked her a question.

Of course there was much more to it than this, as she herself was becoming moist from rubbing herself on the gorgeous feedee beneath her. Tara was insatiable as she squealed and moaned from her Mistresses touch, keeping her drooling mouth open to accept whatever fattening treats she had coming for her. Carli couldn't help herself and soon found she was feeling Taras breasts and began kissing her neck with growing passion. Clothes were then removed and soon both girls were naked and lost to their uncontrollable desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two naked girls lay panting on the bed after almost an hour of frenzied, intense sexual activity and feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc... your very good at that ma'am\" Said the quite stuffed and very satisfied emo girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh yeah I know...\" Replied Carli before her thoughts returned to her and she realized in horror what she'd done \"..

Her belly was already bloated, and she would have already stopped now but this was not her decision to make, nor would it be for the foreseeable future. Tara was quite startled by the sudden  change in their dynamic, though she of course didn't mind it, as she liked to be dominated and demeaned by the fierce blonde. Carli was clearly angry at herself for letting her sexual feelings towards Tara overwhelm her, so now Tara was being punished for that. Suddenly there was a knock at the door which meant the heavy handed feeding Tara had been enduring up to this point stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Exclaimed Carli, climbing down from the stuffed naked emo girl spread eagles her bed to search for her clothes \"Shit shit shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd covered her own nakedity Charlie pulled Tara up and pushed her into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your stupid mouth shut\" )She growled dangerously as Tara nodded timidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's at the door?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If you asked anybody about Manny Pritchett, more than likely the response you'd get was that the boy was older than his years. Manny realized this himself whenever he had to socialize with others his own age (Luke mainly), as he found it a real chore and extremely difficult to dumb himself down to their intellectual level. Because of this Manny paid way more attention to the world around him, while all the other kids were blissfully unaware enjoying the naivety of youth he fretted over the big picture. Gloria Pritchett was Mannys stunningly beautiful Columbian mother, and was perhaps the one person he felt truly close to (he loved Jay as well of course, though the relationship they had wasn't quite as warm). It was because of this that he was really getting sick and tired of every guy blatantly leering over Gloria, their eyes constantly flashing to her voluptuous breasts and rear in a less than subtle way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Manny~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was getting a bit sick and tired of all the attention she was getting from guys, I've got enough to deal with without having to witness all the stares and whispered words about my mother from creeps. I knew she brought it on herself to some degree though, she enjoyed the feeling to some extent which is why I knew I couldn't just ask her to dress in a more flattering way. No, I realized if I was going to change things I'd have to take matters into my own hands...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mid afternoon on Sunday and he and his family arrived at the Dumphey house, having been invited over for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys\" Said Claire warmly as they entered \"Come in and make yourselves at home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny looked over Claire's shoulder and saw Phillip standing there, hovering awkwardly and trying desperately to fight his eyes from dropping to Gloria's bosom. He never stood a chance, Gloria was wearing a busty red dress that almost doubled her cleavage. Manny had already noted that Gloria's choice of clothing seemed specifically designed to attract the lustful gazes of men, turning them into gooey eyed morons whenever she passed by. At first he had wondered how Jay could stand it, and at times he could see it did annoy him though there was always a small element of enjoyment there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Jay~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure I get annoyed about it, what guy wouldn't? But what could I do about it? And to be honest, its kind of nice to be able to say \"Yeah I'm an old ass man... But look at the ass on this broad I'm having sex with\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Gloria so great to see you\" Said Phil, smiling the usual goofy smile he had on his face around Gloria \"Dress. Good. Nice... Um your dress is nice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shot him a dangerous glance and he instantly shrank, though Gloria lifted his spirit by beaming at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Phil that is so nice\" She said in her thick Columbian accent \"You see someone notice that I wear new dress, not like you Jay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stab was obvious, and Manny knew it was coming. If Jay had just said \"Amazing\" when Gloria had previously asked him \"How do I look?\" instead of \"Fine\" he could of avoided a day of annoyed digs from her, but alas Jay did not operate that way. It was at this point, between the lustful gaze of Phil and his fathers failure at giving Gloria the notice she desired that he suddenly formed the beginnings of an idea in his head. It was rash, but looking at the bigger picture as he so often did it seemed it would benefit everyone in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was tired of the attention that every guy gave her, only because of her looks. So, the following day he put his plan into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm going to start a cooking more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's wonderful Manny, this will be such a good skill for you to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Mom, I think it will really compliment my skillset and make me well rounded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Manny went online and started looking for desserts that he could make, and decided to start with something simple, chocolate cake. However, he looked for the most calorie laden option possible. He took his time on it, putting in the same diligence as he did other endeavors, and finishing up with a pretty good product. Jay was at work, but Gloria was home the whole time, and could not help but smell the wonderful cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Manny took it out, she was excited, \"Oooo, Manny that looks so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Please have a slice to let me know if it turned out okay, I don't want to think I am doing a good job and embarrass myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria took the large slice that Manny gave him, and was immediately struck by how rich it was, she could not believe that he had made something that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Manny, this is wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" He replied, not telling her that it tasted so good because of the high amounts of butter, chocolate and sugar, creating an extremely rich option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Manny left the room, Gloria thought it was so good, it was worth splurging and having another slice.  </span></div></div>",

I both keep the unwanted attention away from my mother but making her get fatter and also get to practice my cooking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the coming days Manny put all his attention into perfecting his cooking process. The aim as he saw it was to cram as many calories as possible into each of his culinary creations, meaning that even a meager helping could have dire effects on the consumers waistline. Due to how supportive Gloria tried to be with anything Manny did, it really was like shooting fish in a barrel. Whatever Manny put in front of his gorgeous mother she gulped down without a second thought, leaving nothing but a plate of crumbs. It helped that everything he made was sinfully delicious of course, which was thanks to his liberal use of butter, cream and any number of other wonderfully naughty ingredients. Little did poor Gloria realize the true reason for all the pampering, and pretty soon it was too late as she was slowly becoming more addicted to the fattening confectionaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Gloria~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so nice to be pampered for once! I do so much work around the house and don't get recognised in any way! My Manny is such a good boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few weeks later, and Gloria and Manny were getting ready to head to the mall. Jay was out playing golf, so it would be just the two of them, and Manny was busy preparing a quick snack as his mother got ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you stupid thing\" Came his mothers thick Columbian accent from upstairs \"You fit only last week! Don't tell me Jay has shrunk you in wash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny grinned as he listened to his mothers struggle, knowing full well that the chances of Jay using the washing machine for any reason were precisely nil. He had observed his mother over the week, looking for any changes in her figure that may be brought about by his new 'hobby' and he had not been disappointed. Due to his mothers habit of dressing in a way which flaunted her figure, even the slightest change was quite evident and after only a week he had noticed a subtle thickening there. For the moment the extra weight seemed only to accentuate her figure more (to Mannys slight annoyance) as it was mostly settling on her glorious rear and thighs, but Manny reasoned once the weight gain got fully going this would change. Manny had estimated perhaps a ten to fifteen pound weight gain over the course of the two weeks, which he found extremely encouraging and he wondered how long it would take others to notice. Just as he finished what he was making (heavily sugared churros with a bowl of very calorific melted chocolate) Gloria entered, having seemingly won her battle with her troublesome clothing. She was wearing a black vest top and her favourite pair of jeans, and Manny noticed how tightly she was squeezed into them. There was clearly a small bulge of fat over her waistband, and the top button was getting strained (Manny wondered if he could get it to pop off completely before the day was out).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go Manny\" She said, pulling at the waistband of her jeans which was clearly digging uncomfortably into her soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a quick snack before we go\" He announced happily \"I think you'll enjoy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Okay\" She said slowly, seemingly taken aback by how her son seemed to be cramming her with snacks at any opportunity \"I... Are those churros?! Oh Manny, churros are my most favourite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mother\" He said, smiling rather darkly \"Please, go ahead and enjoy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was wonderful and Gloria just could not help herself as she ascended on the plate of sweet pastries. It was over almost before it had begun, and soon Gloria found herself absent mindedly licking the remains of the melted chocolate from the bowl, any semblance of pride forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Manny~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a genius.

I think it's stuck.\" She asked, turning her back on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny could already tell there was no way the dress would fit properly, but he didn't want his mother to realise she was putting on weight. He gingerly reached forward and attempted to pull up the zipper, almost immediately causing his mother to shriek as it pinched her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny panicked slightly and pulled it back down. \"Uh, I think you got the wrong size mom, I'll go get the right one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurried back out and grabbed a passing shop assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I need that Egyptian blue cocktail dress in a size 8.\" He said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the dressing room behind him he heard a ripping sound followed by Gloria cursing in Spanish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny winced. \"Maybe a size 10?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With his confidence raised he decided to finish the day with an extra special treat, which would have very grave repurcusions on Gloria's figure. At the far end of the food court was a restaurant called 'Carlo's Sundae Bar', which specialised in ice cream sundaes, and there was one in particular that Manny was interested in. The place was a favourite of Gloria's, though she seldom came here other than the odd birthday due to the astonishing calorie count each of the signature sundaes possessed. Manny smiled as he saw a look of almost childlike excitement in his mothers eyes as they approached, which indicated she was certainly not at all full after the day of consistent snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Interview with Gloria~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God I love Carlo's! It does the best sundaes I ever tried! The ice cream is so creamy and rich, and the toppings are amazing! I never get to eat here because I have to watch my figure all the time... But once in awhile can't hurt right? I mean, my figure is just fine right now and I deserve a little treat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the restaurant and the owner approached them, beaming warmly. Carlo was a short, fat old man, known for his warm welcomes and jovial attitude though he did not possess not the firmest grasp on the English language. Little did Gloria know that Manny had planned this all along, and had called ahead to book a table and make some requests. When he had called he had spoken to Carlo's granddaughter, who had reiterated the message to Carlo. Manny had anticipated what his mother would order, and he grinned as they were lead to their booth and given menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know what I will have\" Said Gloria, pulling at her uncomfortable dress that had suddenly tightened around her middle as she sat down \"I will have the fat free special\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMannys smile increased, as he had anticipated this request and had made arrangements to sabotage her choice. When he had spoken to Carlo's granddaughter he had informed her that his mother didn't speak great English either, and when she asked for the \"Fat free special\" what she actually meant was \"The belly buster fried ice cream supreme\". This was by far the largest item on the menu and the calorie punch it possessed was truly mind boggling. When the sundae arrived to the table it had to be carried by two people and when it was placed in front of Gloria it blocked her from view. Gloria's eyes nearly popped out of her head at the sight of the colossal dessert in front of her, which certainly didn't resemble her usual 'fat free special'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is dis?\" She said, almost in awe of the ice cream monolith that cast her in shadow \"This is not my usual...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" Said Manny hurriedly \"They've changed it a little... Its still only about a hundred calories or so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thatsh good...\" Said Gloria through a generous mouthful of ice cream, having already started before Manny had even finished \"Ohh myyyy Gerrrdddd Manny! This ishh amashinnggg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently eating her way through several scoops of fried iced cream, smothered in chocolate fudge sauce, almonds and marshmallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You no finish ice cream... I now um... I now feed you rest. New policy of Carlos\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manny?\" Asked Gloria uncertainly as they were joined by a team of attractive female waiters \"What is happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay\" Said Manny, not sounding too assuring \"It just means you get to eat a lot more of the delicious ice cream\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria gulped as her eyes landed on the still substantial ice cream sundae in front of her, realizing too late that she was going to be made to finish it as the waiters brandished large spoons. Carlo gave a nod and the staff simultaneously drove their spoons into the rich tower of ice cream, producing a heaping mound each which were now lowered to Glorias quivering lips. She didn't have a chance to argue, as the first spoon was pushed past her lips and the freezing cold nature of the fattening confection forced her to swallow it. Gloria was wide eyed in disbelief as she was fed, her gaze falling on Manny for a moment who tried not to show his satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Gloria ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was a strange policy to have, we do not do things like feed customers in Columbia... But I am still learning the ways of people here, so I dug deep and kept eating so as not to cause offence\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact she was clearly struggling Gloria accepted each spoonful as it was forced past her lips, sending more ice cream into her tightly packed stomach. Towards the end of the sundae Gloria's mightily stuffed belly was seriously testing the fabric of her dress. By this point Gloria was slouched in her chair, her head unsteady to the point that one of the female waiters had to hold it upright as her colleagues continued to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neeearly there\" Said Manny reassuringly into his incredibly stuffed mothers ear \"Just a few more mouthfuls\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So full... Urrrp!! Ullpp!\" Gloria murmured back before another heaping spoon was crammed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Gloria swallowed the last few mouthfuls of the sundae before uttering a fatigued burp and letting her head flop to rest on her heaving, soft bosom. Gloria's eyes began to droop and before long the food coma overcame her causing her to drift off and start snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Could I get like a wheelbarrow or something to get her home?\" Said Manny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Manny watched her for a few moments as her taut tummy, accentuated so beautifully by her tight dress, rose and fell with each of her peaceful slumbering breaths, before he left smiling a satisfied smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Manny~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It had been a tough day for Mom and I was beginning to think I was pushing her a bit too far... But I couldn't have been more wrong, which I learnt a few hours later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny was in his bedroom when he heard movement downstairs which, knowing only he and his mother were in the house, aroused his interest and he went to investigate. In the kitchen he found some eight or so cans of whipped cream set in a line on the work surface. To Manny's astonishment he watched as Gloria held a can aloft and sprayed its contents greedily into her mouth, down her throat and into her seemingly insatiable belly. The belly had clearly shrunk since her nap but there was still a bulge there and Manny knew a few extra lb's had been transferred there after her afternoon feeding. Manny hid behind the doorframe, not wanting to interrupt his mothers insane calorific binge as she finished the can she was holding, tossed it over her shoulder carelessly and grabbed the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Manny~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't believe what I was seeing... I mean it was very encouraging, but it was completely unexpected. My theory was that she had always been a fat girl stuck in a slim girls body... She came from poverty in Columbia so food was probably pretty scarce back then, and since she's been here she's been trying to keep her figure for Jay... I guessed that she'd finally snapped, and most likely didn't even realize what she was doing... Which was pretty great actually\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny watched patiently as his mother greedily guzzled can after can, the only noise being the sounds of the spray and Gloria's muffled, ecstatic whimpering. Finally the final can landed with a clatter on the floor and Gloria seemingly snapped out of whatever trance she had been in. She turned which gave Manny a side on view of her and her couldn't stop himself from snorting a repressed laugh which caused her to jump and her belly, breasts and butt to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manny!\" She said, holding her hand to her heart (and soft breast) \"You scare me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's belly was magnificent, just like it had been after her feeding at the mall and was clearly causing stress lines on her very tight dress. Manny knew that if he could her belly to this state after each time she ate, Gloria's weight would balloon quicker than he could of ever hoped possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Interview with Gloria~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only a couple of cans... I think. I can't remember actually, but its no big deal. Its not so bad to treat yourself every once in a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny had prepared some food for when Gloria awoke ('some' being rather an understatement) but after witnessing her binge just now he was a little worried she would be unable to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh made you some food Mom\" He said \"I figured you might be hungry when you woke up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Manny you are so thoughtful\" Said Gloria, stifling a burp as she spoke \"I am a little hungry now you say it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny grinned, which Gloria mistook for kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" He said, rubbing his hands together \"Take a seat and ill bring it over to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria smiled happily and rearranged her tight dress unconsciously over her belly as she parked her meaty derriere on a stool next to the kitchen table. Manny brought over a very appetising, though very large, Mexican feast which had Gloria salivating despite her day of binging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh Manny!\" Said Gloria in delight \"This looks so good! You are such a good boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I am Mom\" Said Manny \"Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria didn't need telling twice, infact she already had a mouth full of cheesy nachos in her mouth before Manny suggested it. Manny was in disbelief as he watched his mother demolish the huge meal, wondering how much her eating habits would be changed and if she would ever stop... Even after she'd reached an appropriate weight to stop every man drooling after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Gloria started to notice all the boys were stealing looks at Alex instead of herself, this was making Gloria mad. \"Why are they all staring at her instead of me, our breast are the same size but my ass is bigger then hers\" Gloria thought to herself. \"Only if I could make her smaller, then the boys would look at me instead\" just as Gloria finished that thought she noticed Alex's chest was getting smaller. Alex's chest went from being a FF cup to a E cup, chasing her bikini to be a little to big for her. Gloria's bikini started to feel tighter as her own breast grew from a F to a G cup. \"Holy crap, all I have to do is think it and I can take her size\" Gloria whispered under her breath. \"You say something Gloria?\" Alex said, turning her head to Gloria. \"No sweety, I didn't say anything, your bikini looks a little big on you don't you think?\" Gloria responded. Alex said it does and went to go change. When Alex came back out in a better fitting bikini Gloria went to get her pink one. It was still a tight fit but it fit better then her own. When Gloria went back out she wanted more. \"I wish Alex's breast were only a tiny B cup\" she watched Alex's breast shrink to a mear B cup while her own inflated to a HH cup, making the bikini dig into her shoulders and only cover her nipples. \"I also wish her ass was non existence\" she proceeded to watch Alex's once big bubble butt shrink down to bones. Her own ass inflated, becoming twice as just as Kim Kardashion's ass, Turing the bikini bottom into a non existence thong. \"Don't you think that bikini is a bit revealing Gloria?\" Gloria jumped when Alex walked up and said this. \"Well when you have a body to show off you gotta show it off, one day you might know this feeling\" Gloria started to walked towards the pool when Alex pulled her inside. \"You think you can just walk away from me with my breast and ass, yes I know you stole them!\" Alex yelled at Gloria, grabbing her breast. \"Your so young, you don't these\" Gloria said while pushing her new breast into Alex's face.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Desperate to not get held back a year, Haley decided to try and gain the weight reasoning that she could just lose it all at a later date (though she hoped that she wouldn't have to gain too much in the first place). With a sigh she entered the kitchen and started rustling through the cupboards looking for the most fattening foods she could find. She made herself a gigantic sandwich, packed full of deli meats, cheese and a lot of mayonnaise (full fat of course) accompanyng that with a couple of her dads party size bags of potato chips. Haley sat down on the sofa, sighed miserably and took a big bite of the sandwich (which she almost had to unhinge her jaw to do, given the size of it). Reluctantly she slowly worked her way through the gigantic sandwich and the several bags of chips that accompanied it, thinking about how all this food would change her perfect body. Haley ate as fast as she could, knowing that the food capacity of her slender stomach was rather low so the only hope she had was to finish before she had the chance to feel full. It was tough going but Haley finished the entire meal, and when she had she slumped back into the comfortable leather of the sofa. She knew that this wasn't enough to gain the weight required to begin her first lesson with her sister however, so despite how full she felt she clumsily got to her feet and returned to the kitchen. She found her mother in the kitchen, busying herself with making dinner for the family. She hadn't noticed Haley enter, as her back was turned so with as much stealth as her food stuffed belly would allow she crept to a nearby cupboard and removed a large chocolate bar before hastily leaving. She forced herself to munch her way through the large bar of empty calories while she waited for dinner, despite her stomach grumbling in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haley! Alex! Luke! Dinner!\" Claire yelled up the stairs, just as Haley swallowed the last square of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley groaned as the smell of her dinner wafted up the stairs, as she didn't feel remotely hungry considering how much she'd eaten already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinnerrrr Haleyyy!\" Came a voice through her bedroom door, which with gritted teeth she noted belonged to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! God!\" She yelled, sounding every bit the moody teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley joined her family at the table, trying to hide the fact there was a slight bump to her usual flat stomach as she sat. Alex regarded her older sister with interest, as she noticed the weary and queasy look in her eyes as she eyed at her dinner (spaghetti and meatballs smothered in thick sauce). Alex hadn't really expected Haley to do what she had told her to do earlier, thinking her much too proud to demean herself for her own amusement. It was nice to know how little self respect her teenage sister actually had she thought happily to herself. Haley reluctantly speared a large meatball and exhaled deeply, as though this would free up some space in her belly before she put it in her mouth. Alex watched on happily as Haley struggled through every bite of her meal, her eyes becoming glazed as she forced herself on. She was honestly impressed at her sisters determinedness as she was obviously struggling with the generous meal, and a quick glance under the table revealed why; her bloated food stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay Haley?\" Asked Claire, concerned by the look of misery on her eldest daughters face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah are you okay?\" Alex chimed in, her concern a lot less believable than her mothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah\" Responded Hayley, fighting back a cute hiccough \"Great dinner Mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley forced a smile which Alex found particularly amusing and forced herself to plough on with the meal. Remarkably, not only did Hayley manage to finish the whole thing but she was also the first to finish (using her method of eating as fast as possible before she hit the wall), and when she had she was so full she barely had the strength to stay seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Said Phil \"dessert then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley practically whimpered at this hint, her groaning taut stomach pushing uncomfortably against her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Hayley wants some\" Said Alex brightly, grinning at her weary sister \"Don't you Hayley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayleys head lolled to one side so that she could shoot Alex an aggressive look, but this merely added to Alexs enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hic! Yeah...\" Said Hayley, her voice extremely quiet \"I'd love some... Uhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the dinner was a struggle for Hayley, then the dessert could be compared to climbing Mount Everest. It was a large banana split, which at any other time she would have adored but not today. Unlike her dinner Hayley was the last to finish her dessert by a long way, to the point where the rest of the family was becoming a bit restless sat at the table. With a grunt of effort and her eyes closed Haley ate the last spoonful, and collapsed back into get chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhrrrppppp\" She exclaimed, no strength remaining to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" Said Phil, obviously feeling awkward by his daughters strangely uncharacteristic piggish behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sighed as she rubbed sleep from her eyes and climbed up on to the set of scales, to obverse the toll her previous day of bingeing had had on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-116.5-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley groaned when she saw the number, wondering just how much more she was going to have to ruin her figure for the sake of her grades. Suddenly there was a knock the door which broke Haley away from her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haleyyyy\" Came a very familiar voice and Hayley gritted her teeth angrily \"Aree you in thereeee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Haley responded angrily \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the dooooor and I'll tell youuuuu\" Responded Alex, and Haley complied miserably, unlocking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Said Haley aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you've already weighed yourself\" Said Alex happily, smiling at her sister \"But if like to see for myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley glared at her little sister but nonetheless complied, and Alex whistled at the number she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done\" Said Alex impressed \"that's a pound a half more than I even asked for, way to go above and beyond the call of duty! Lift up your jammies and let's see the damage\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked sullen, but none the less lifted up her pajama top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" Said Alex as she examined her big sisters midrif \"It could just be my imagination, but it appears slightly softer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up\" Said Haley \"Can we just have my first lesson now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Said Alex, sounding appeased \"Follow me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Alexs bedroom Haley sat on her bed while Alex pulled over a small black board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Todays lesson will be mathematics\" Announced Alex, writing 'mathematics' on the board with a piece of chalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley rolled her eyes, already seeming bored which Alex picked up on immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're attention span is very limited unless it's focused on boys or dressing like a tramp\" Said Alex snidely \"But we'll make the lesson as... Physical and hands on as possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley glared dangerously at Alex in response to the blunt insult, but knew she had no leg to stand on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" She grumbled \"Just get on with it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Alex \"Today we will do subtraction\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter writing 'subtraction' on the board Alex went to her wardrobe, removing a large box from there. Alex opened the box as Haley watched on with curiosity, but her eyes widened slighty when she saw what the box contained. It contained a large amount of food, most of which was very sugary confectionaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here we go\" Said Alex, piling up donuts onto a tray in front of Haley who gulped fearfully \"What do you get when you take 28 from 50?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\" Said Haley, slightly distracted from the question by the menacing pile of donuts \"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple\" Said Alex \"Eat 28 of these donuts and you'll have your answer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whu.. What?\" Stammered Haley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat the donuts\" Replied Alex, suddenly sounding very serious \"Or the lesson is over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked dumbstruck, in complete disbelief that Alex was making her do this but knowing deep down she had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\"Said Haley grumpily and grabbed the first donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex happily watched her sullen older sister munch her way through the pile of donuts, still in disbelief that she had actually agreed to the ridiculous proposition of gaining weight. In truth Haley was a little hungry, though she wasn't particularly in the mood for something so sweet the first ten or so donuts went down pretty easily. By number fifteen however her progress began to slow and by eighteen it was a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Haley\" Said Alex impatiently \"This is only an hour lesson you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley shot Alex a disdainful, rather fatigued look before reluctantly speeding up her eating. When she had finally finished she lay down on the bed, groaning miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Haley\"Said Alex \"So what's the answer to the question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Urrp...\" Groaned Haley \"22\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! See you can do this!\" Said Alex with much more enthusiasm than Haley currently felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Great...\" Said Haley grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now eat the rest of the donuts and we'll move onto the next problem\" Said Alex \"Remember, the longer you take the less time you'll have to learn\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley shot Alex another poisonous look, but nevertheless grumpily began munching down yet more donuts. It was very difficult but somehow Haley managed to consume all of the donuts, and when she'd finished she lay back on the bed groaning softly. Alex allowed Haley a few minutes of recovery before moving on to the next maths problem, this one being based around the percentage of liquid left in a large plastic bottle. The liquid contained in the bottle was a chocolate flavoured protein/weight gain shake and as before there was a physical side to the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink 80% of this\" Said Alex holding out the bottle and Haley practically whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Hiccc... Don't think i can Alex...\" Said Haley wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's such a shame...\"Said Alex sadly \"I hope you enjoy grade school when your 35...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley sighed, grabbed the bottle and spent the next few moments seemingly trying to psych herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... Here goes...\" Said Haley miserably before lofting the large bottle upwards and pouring its contents down her throat \"Glugglugglugglugggg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was impressed as she watched her older sister chug the shake despite her stomachs grumbling protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" She said \"I guess all those under age beer bongs really paid off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley ignored her smart mouthed younger sister and gulped down the mixture until she thought she'd reached the 80% point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... Hiccc...\"Said Haley, before slumping back onto the bed holding her extremely bloated tummy \"Are you happy.. Urrrp... Now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\"Said Alex, examining the bottle \"That's actually not bad Haley, id say that was about right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley merely groaned in response and Alex whistled at the size of her belly, which was slowly rising and falling in tone with her laboured breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Haley, I'm really impressed with your stomach capacity\" Alex commented \"You look pregnant right now... Your not pregnant are you? I mean I know your a tramp and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Shut... Up.... Urrp...\"Replied Haley weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Either you finish the rest or the lesson is over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you... Hic...\" Said Haley wearily \"Like so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Said Alex grinning as Haley grabbed the remains of the milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had to summon all her strength just to sit up and when she had she exhaled in a miserable attempt to muster the courage to begin. There wasn't much left in comparison to what she had already consumed of course, but this was the most stuffed that poor Haley had ever been in her life and she seriously doubted she could finish the fattening mix. Somehow, Haley managed to lethargically slurp down the remainder of the milkshake before setting down the empty the jug and collapsing heavily back onto the bed, groaning miserably. Suddenly the egg timer rang, signalling the end of the lesson and rendering Haleys last act of gluttony completely pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh\" Said Alex \"And that's time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta - Hicccc- be kiddin me...\" Said Haley in weary disbelief \"After all that... Urrrppp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry big sis\" Said Alex, not sounding remotely apologetic \"But if you want more tutoring you know what you've got to do... I hope at least some of the lesson sunk in to that, ahem, thick head of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley stared at her sister, her eyes glazed and her mouth agape as she breathed heavily. The truth was it hadn't really sunk in at all, but Haley was completely out of options and knew she had to persevere if she wanted to graduate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it then for now\" Said Alex \"The next class will come when you gain five more pounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Haley was beyond speech at this point, the immense food coma she was experiencing robbing her of her basic motor functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw is someone too full to speak?\" Said Alex, in her usual condescending tone \"Nod your head if you understand and agree you dummy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley tried her best to glare at Alex, but she was far too weak to display the appropriate malice so she reluctantly nodded her head. She reasoned that, after the days gluttony she must be at least close to gaining the next five pounds, so it wouldn't be too much of a push to gain the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Alex in a businesslike tone \"Now lets get you weighed shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had to do all the work to get Haley on her feet and walk her to the bathroom scales, but with some effort she managed. Haley stood blearily on the scales as the numbers rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"120 pounds\" Said Alex \"Wow, that's a gain of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was not rhetorical, and Haley could tell it was a test to see if she could figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three -hiccc- and a half pounds...\" Haley whispered, stifling a burp as she did \"So that's like only a pound and a half i have to gain right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Said Alex \"Oh no no my dear sister, this doesn't count towards the next five pounds you have to gain... Just think of it as, i don't know, bonus weight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked dumbfounded, the sudden revelation breaking her out from her food coma momentarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.. You...\" She stammered in horror \"Can't be serious... That's -urrrpp- not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never claimed it would be fair\" Said Alex \"But I'm not forcing you to do anything, its your choice to do this... So by this time tomorrow, either gain five pounds or our lessons are done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex patted Haleys groaning belly, smirking to her elder sister who looked positively miserable as she was left standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Haley sighed sadly, feeling her stomach to see if she could feel any of her extra poundage. She couldn't be sure but it did seem ever so slightly softer than usual and she wondered grimly how long it would take before the effects of her gluttony became noticeable to everybody.

Alex gestured to a rather rickety looking wooden chair, which Haley apprehensively took a seat on, feeling it creak audibly as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" Began Alex \"This chair was made by our father during his rather ill advised, though thankfully short lived DIY phase. As you can feel Haley, the craftsmanship is questionable at best\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and?\" Asked Haley impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what you are no experiencing is your body weight testing it's rather weak structure\" Said Alex \"How much extra weight do you think it could take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley shifted uncomfortably in the chair causing the legs to wobble as she considered the question, knowing full well what her answer would mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Maybe half a pound?\" She said carefully \"... If that? Probably less...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Asked Alex in a deeply condescending tone \"Well if that's your answer that's ok.. Forgot to mention a wrong answer will equal a forfeit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Responded Haley suddenly \"No wait I-Glumphhh?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\" Said Alex as she held the funnel in her sisters mouth \"This is science\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex proceeded to pour a highly calorific milkshake down the funnel which Haley had no choice but to gulp down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gluglugluug\" exclaimed Haley, wide eyed in horror as her sister fed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the chair creaking ominously underneath her as she swallowed the last of the first milkshake and started on the second. After the second had been dumped down Alex seemed increasingly impatient and thus all decorum was lost as she began dumping down two at a time instead. Poor Haley was bug eyed from the exertion it took to keep up with Alex, her gulping become comically quicker and more frantic as more and more of the calorific shakes were forced down her throat. The speed the Alex dumped down the shakes meant that the funnel was constantly full to the brim, almost overflowing as Haley had to alternate between deep breaths through her nose and deep gulps of the funnel. Despite Haley trying as hard as she could to keep up Alex was not at all impressed with the speed of her gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on you big fat moron!\" She said testily \"I've got a lesson to teach you fat pig, stop slacking and gorge faster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley managed a slightly lethargic glare at her sister, but was unable to stop gulping at the shake. Alex grinned as she watched her sisters belly swell, and put her thumb into it and the waistband of her tightening pants to feel how little room there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd say your definitely past your 'half pound' gain girl\" Said Alex as she fondled her sisters bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley mumbled an intelligible response as the chairs creaks became more frequent as serious sounding. Suddenly the chair could take no more of Haleys ballooning weight and it gave way sending her crashing to the ground. As an added bonus the top button of her pants also popped off, and Haley lay amongst the splintered wood panting and groaning from the intense feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you get fatass\" Crooned Alex, pulling her stuffed, groaning sister to her feet\"Let's go see how wrong you were\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was walked to and stood on the scales and Alex chuckled at the number which appeared on there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"128\" She said mockingly \"Geez, I never realised how much of a moron you really were... That's 3 pounds not half a pound you dumb fat pig! At this rate your going to be immobile before your able to pass your test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut... Urrrp!\" Grumbled Haley \"Just get on with the stupid nerd lessons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo not so fast\" Said Alex wagging her finger \"You still have a forfeit remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, hicc!\" Said Haley in exasperation \"Your already forcing me to become a disgusting tub of lard, what more do you want?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh much more sis...\" Said Alex darkly \"Much more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh whatever\" Said Haley, finally snapping \"Your just jealous of me and always have been! Your just trying to make yourself feel better than a nerd loser by taking my dignity! But it won't work you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Haleys buttonless pants slid down her legs revealing her panties, causing her to blush angry as she pulled them back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, maybe your right\" Said Alex unexpectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\" Said Haley, understandably surprised at her sisters sudden change of heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I won't be so hard on you in the future\" Said Alex \"Let's get back to lesson, that's why your here afterall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was perplexed as the lesson continued, with Alex making no further comments about her weight or her forfeit. Throughout the lesson Haley actually began to understand what was being taught to her, and she became hopeful for the first time that she may pass her test afterall and not be kept back a year. Haley was in high spirits when the lesson was winding down and was actually disappointed that it was ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Alex!\" Said Haley brightly \"I actually think I get it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's good\" Said Haley \"A pity this'll be your last lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! What?!\" Exclaimed Haley in horror \"But I'm no where near ready to take that test yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my problem\" Said Alex dismissively \"Sounds like you don't need my help anyway... In fact how did you put it? I'm jealous of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh that?\" Said Haley nervously \"That was just like... A joke... Yeah, just totally joking!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Said Alex \"I don't think you want it enough, your going to have to prove yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, like totally\" Said Haley desperately, not realising her sister was playing her \"You said I had a forfeit right? I'll do it right now, no problem! Whatever it is I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Alex, sounding unconvinced \"... All it was going to be was a bit of force feeding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft! No problem at all!\" Said Haley with desperate enthusiasm \"Could stuff my face! This little piglets got to eat right? Look I'll even let you tie my hands behind my back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex still looked uncertain as Haley smiled enthusiastically like an idiot. Almost reluctantly Alex sighed and proceeded to tie her sisters hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right tie it tight\" Haley crooned \"Come feed your piggie sister... Tell me what a fatass I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't want to say anything but you've kind of let yourself go big sis\" Said Alex with a grin as she grabbed a box of donuts and turned Haley to face her \"Such a belly your getting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right? I'm a real fatassmrrrff!\" Haley said just as Alex stuffed in the first donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh lardass\" Whispered Alex forcing the whole donut into her sisters mouth, before quickly following it with the next \"Let's get you a little fatter shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley nodded, while frantically chewing and swallowing the endless queue of donuts. After that box followed another and another, at which point Haleys pants fell down right to her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh your such a fat mess aren't you?\" Teased Alex as she slapped her sisters ass, which definitely seemed to bulge out more than before \"Your getting a booty you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrff Urrrp oh yeah I'm a real fat losermrrrff!\" Agreed Haley as the feeding continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce five boxes had disappeared into Haleys taut belly, the poor stuffed girl sat lethargically on the bed, panting wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I did the forfeit and I'll do anything else to continue our lessons... I really need this sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no sis\" Said Alex gravely \"I'm sorry, but you didn't let me finish before becoming the glutton you are... What I was saying was; that \"Would\" have been your forfeit... But after your little outburst I'm afraid I need more from you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But...\" Stammered Haley before seeing her sister raise her eyebrow and reverted back to her submissive enthusiasm \"yes... Of course oh perfect sister! What would you have me do? Whatever you say I'll do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's good to hear\" Said Alex \"Follow me then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt of effort and some floundering on the bed, Haley managed to pull herself to her feet and follow Alex from the room while holding up her pants. She followed Alex into the kitchen where she saw a gigantic cake stood on the kitchen work surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is moms triple chocolate Oreo ice cream cake\" Announced Alex \"Which she has made for tonight's dinner which the whole family will be attending...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Said Haley uncertainly \"Did you want me to eat a slice or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly\" Replied Alex \"The rest of the family will be here in about an hour, and when they arrive they will find no cake... Only a gluttonous fat loser who will explain to them she couldn't control her piggish appetite and scoffed the whole thing... Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked hurried at the prospect of humiliating herself infront of her whole family, but Alex's gaze did not waver so she sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" She whispered \"I understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said Alex handing her sister a large spoon \"Well then, I'll leave you to it... You have one hour\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex placed an egg timer next to the cake and set it to an hour, before leaving the room clearly very happy with herself. Haleys belly groaned at the sight of yet more food, but nevertheless she stifled a cute burp and dug her spoon in for her first bite. Haleys bloated tummy was extremely reluctant to allow any more food in, and yet somehow the gorgeous brunette pushed on regardless. Mouthful after heaped mouthful, Haley munched her way through the rich, titanic dessert. As it slowly dwindled Haley became less aware of the time she had, or even of her surroundings as the incredible fullness she felt reverted her to a zombie like state eating on auto pilot. Whenever Alex popped her head around the door to check on her she giggled to herself at the sight  of her sister, who was clearly barely able to sit upright, eating like a zombie with a miserable, vacant expression on her face. Haley had chocolate all round her mouth as she gave a weary burp and vaguely came back to her senses enough for her to see she had only ten minutes left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhrrrpp-crap-uhhh\" She mumbled groggily, visibly grimacing with effort as she struggled to sit herself upright, which in turn caused her dome of a belly to force the zipper of her pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley had about a third of the cake left, which was pretty impressive in itself considering how much she'd already eaten that day. With a look of lethargic, yet grim determination she lost her spoon and went into the cake with both hands, tearing off handfuls and cramming it into her mouth. At this point Alex entered and snorted with laughter at the sight of her once so vain and perfect big sister eating like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well\" Said Alex \"If only you could see yourself right now. What a greedy fat cow you've become...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrp.. Mrrrfff!\" Replied Haley as she continued to stuff her face \"Yeah... Hiccurrrp... Your right there sis... Uhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to have to do better than that though I'm afraid\" Said Alex gravely \"Here... Let me help you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Haley even registered what Alex had said, Alex was sat on her lap and had thrust to heaped spoonfuls of the ice cream cake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glumphhh?!\" Exclaimed Haley in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on fatass\" Said Alex impatiently \"Keep stuffing your stupid fat face\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Haley forced herself to swallow the mouthful (which was so large she couldn't close her mouth) and began to eat using her hands, inbetween duel spoonfuls from her sister. The two proved to be a good team, and somehow the final third of the cake dwindled at an impressive rate, until finally it was finished just before the egg timer rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp!!!\" Exclaimed Haley as she slumped back into the chair, groaning and looking a little green as her extremely bloated tummy growled audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, I'm impressed\" Said Alex \"If you keep on at this rate, imagine how fat your going to get before the end of school?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley thought about this will decidedly less enthusiasm than her sister. She thought about the looks on her extremely shallow friends faces when they saw what a fat blob she'd become and shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'd best be off\" Said Alex \"The family will be here soon and I want a good view of them discovering a fat slob loser has eaten their dessert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex pinched Haleys cheek patronisingly and Haley forced a smile to show she was still playing ball. Alex giggled at the sight of her sister stuffed to bursting, cake all around her face and couldn't wait to see the families reaction to the sight. Haley managed to hold her fake smile until Alex left the room, at which point it was replaced by a look of weary anguish and misery. She heard the door bell ring and considered making a run for it, but she was so full that even the idea of sitting up seemed out the question. What could she possibly say to explain this?! She thought to herself in panic as she imagined the faces of her family members discovering her during her gluttonous indiscretion. She heard the front door being opened and her dad's voice greeting the visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys!\" He said with his usual enthusiasm \"Come on in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No... please don't come in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were half closed at this point and the only indication that somebody had entered was their voice going higher in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Haley dear\" Came a voice she recognised to be Camorons \"Just an FYI... this is not a good look for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort Haley lifted her head to look at them, her whole family looking at her in disbelief, with cake frosting all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrr-braaaarrp!\" She exclaimed suddenly and she saw Alex and look laughing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haley what...\" Said her mother before her eyes fell on the plate which once contained her cake, but now only contained crumbs \"did you... eat the whole cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked at her feet in complete embarrassment (the sight of her protruding belly only adding to her shame), hearing her mother's tone of disbelief and slight disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" She Mumbled, before looking up again and seeing Alex giving her a meaningful look \"I just couldn't control myself... hiccurrp! I'm just a greedy cow I guess hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled as if the situation was perfectly normal and saw Jay face palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... anyway... Shall we sit down guys?\" Said Manny, eager to move on and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes thats a good idea\" Said Phil \"Lets sit down everyone... Haley I'm guessing you'll be skipping dinner this evening\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked up, giving her sister a pleading look but finding nothing but a cruel smile as she shook her head. Haley gulped, not knowing how she was going to continue but knowing she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Daddy\" She said \"Hiccurrp! That was just an appetiser hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody looked dumbfounded at this, but ignored this incredibly out of character behaviour from the gorgeous teenager and merely shrugged and sat down. Alex of course sat next to her big sister, clearly no where near finished humiliating her. Claire busied herself setting up the table as Alex leaned closer to Haley to whisper in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask me to feed you lard butt\" She whispered, and Haley gave her a lethargic look of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost refused or at least told her cruel little sister she was going too far, but then she thought of the prospect of being held back a year and sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Alex\" She whispered \"Would you... Um... feed me please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" Said Alex so everybody present could hear her \"What was that sis? Please repeat that so every body can hear you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked completely mortified as she felt the gazes of her family fall on her, but nevertheless cleared her throat before repeating her humiliating request for all to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, could you please feed me?\" She repeated, staring fixedly at her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex tried to hide her smirk as an uncomfortable silence fell over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow sis you really have no self respect at all do you? \" Gloated Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am\" Said Haley feeling her cheeks burn with embarrassment \"I'm just a greedy cow who needs feeding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I see that\" Said Alex with a giggle \"I didn't want to say anything but you really are my 'big' sister aren't you? Put on a few extra lb's have we? Hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked at her younger sister incredulously, in disbelief that she seemingly wanted her to beg to be fed in front of her whole family. Alex sneered at her and Haley gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please oh wonderful sister\" Began Haley \"Who is much prettier and smarter than me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And skinnier\" Chimed in Luke, clearly wanting to get in on humiliating his olier sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Haley said with a whisper \"Much skinnier than me... I mean look at my belly guys, I'm becoming such a fat cow aren't i?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah I guess\" Replied Manny as no adult could find an adequate response \"Youve let yourself go that's for sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please feed me oh perfect sister\" Saif Haley \"I'll oink for it like the pig I am... oink! Oink! Oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man your pathetic sis!\" Gloated Alex \"Luke, I think this is a two person job... let's see how much fatter our big sister will become!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke eagerly rushed to Haleys side, and her lip quivered as she regarded her two siblings. Haley didn't expect anything approaching gentle or dignified from her sister, but she was truly surprised at the heavy handled feeding she received from her little brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted a big sister\" Said Luke happily, seemingly understanding what Haleys miserable gaze meant \"Well, a much bigger big sister anyway hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley could tell by the look on his face that this was likely not going to be a one off, and she now had two siblings who wanted to get her as fat as possible. She mulled this grim image of her future miserably as Luke gleefully stuffed her face, barely giving her time to chew and swallow before her mouth was once again filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I mean imagine a life without worrying what she's up to... I hear being a fat loser builds character, maybe that would be better for her in the long run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can attest to that\" Said Manny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can all do our part\" Said Gloria \"We can help her succeed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's like tough love\" Said Mitchell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Haley was coming out of her food coma and beginning to realize that her future was being decided for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrr... no please..\" She whimpered \"Dont... Hicc... want to be fat... urpp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil nodded to Luke who immediately understood and sprung into action, clearly eager to continue what he was doing previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... mrrrff!! Ulppp!!! Munch munch!!! Urrrp\" Haley attempted to say but was cut off by her younger brother continuing to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Claire seemingly weighing the argument for forcibly fattening up her troublesome daughter \"I guess it would make life easier for us... and it may be the only way for her to graduate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommyyyyyurrrfff!! Pleasemurrrff!\" She whimpered just as Alex joined in on the feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh shhh\" Whispered her sadistic younger sister into her ear \"Thats enough talking from you... you'd better get used to this, because this is your life now dear sister... If you think this is bad, soon you'll look back on this fondly... when your an obese blob that's to large to stand, let alone leave the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley whimpered that this very bleak insight into her future, just as her siblings each forced another mouthful of food past her weary lips. As the meal time continued it became increasingly apparent that the rest of her family were not particularly hungry or, rather more concerningly, we're choosing not to eat so that their meals could be stuffed down poor Haleys throat. Whatever the case, when Haley had finished her own meal, the other plates of food soon followed suit and were crammed past her weary lips. Haleys feeble pleas of mercy became quieter and less frequent as she focused souly on chewing and swallowing aso her cruel siblings offered her no respite from the feeding. Haley had never eaten so much in one day in her whole life, and it was actually damn impressive that plate after plate was stuffed into her groaning belly (though it wasn't as if she had much choice in the matter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... She's really putting it away huh?\" Said Phil, breaking the silence around the table as the rest of the family watched the feeding spectacle \"I mean at this rate, she'll need a whole new wardrobe pretty soon right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes she's a real pig\" Said Gloria as Haley let out a rather unladylike belch and her siblings continued stuffing her silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew thats going to set you back\" Said Mitch \"Replacing this tubby pigs whole wardrobe when she gets too fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that!\" Interjected Alex, knowing her Mother would be concerned about this point \"I've got lots of cute outfits for my BIIIIG sister to wear, tehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley groaned lethargically, her food addled brain envisioning what her cruel sisters versions of \"Cute Outfits\" could be. The passage of time lost all meaning for poor Haley, as all she was able to focus on was chewing, swallowing and the very uncomfortable feeling of fullness in her taut belly. The only reason she knew she'd finished her other family members meals was when the none stop barrage of savoury foods was replaced with a sudden blast of sweetness. This sweetness came when Luke decided to empty a whole can of whipped cream down her throat, reasoning that she needed a desert, without acknowledgeding that she'd actually begun the mammoth meal by eating the entire families desert. Alex followed suite by emptying two cans of the sweet cream at once down her throat, at which point Haley went noticeably limp, the food coma overcoming her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I think she's had enough guys\" Said Claire finally upon seeing her daughter basically pass out from the feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should get her weighed\" Suggested Jay \"I bet she's put on a few pounds after all that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Luke had to help the poor girl from her chair and then practically carry her to the scales where they held her in place to stop her collapsing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...uhhrp\" Mumbled the incredibly stuffed young beauty her round tummy gurgling and her buttonless pants threatening to fall down as the numbers rose on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex snorted with laughter when she saw the read out on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"134!\" She announced \"Not bad aye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itll do... for now\" Said Claire, using a rather ominous tone that was out of character for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where we will see the fat\" Said Gloria, clearly excited at the prospect of watching the young girl get fatter \"Will she be all fat belly? Or maybe fat ass and big boobs? This will be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... yes it will\" Said Alex as she stroked her ever growing sisters taut belly, making her moan softly at the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was feeling very pleased with herself... as things couldn't have gone any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next? </span></div></div>",

Downstairs in the kitchen she saw breakfast had been served, with one plate in particular towering above the rest which gave her a glum indication where she'd be sat. Both her parents were sat there as if everything was completely normal, which was even more disconcerting as it showed how her being fattened up against her will had already become business as usual. Breakfast went much like dinner had the day before, except her siblings intervention happened much sooner into the meal. Nothing needed to be said, and so the feeding just happened as though it to was just business as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget your lunches once your finished guys\" Said Claire as Luke and Alex shovelled their big sisters breakfast down her throat <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaleys eyes fell on the kitchen counter where three huge bags sat, much larger than any lunch Claire had ever prepared for them before. Alex grinned maliciously at her as she forced another forkfull of maple syrup coated pancakes past her lips, enjoying the look of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee mom that's a lot of food\" Said Alex, loving every moment of her sisters misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Haleys a growing girl\" Said Claire \"And we need to keep her growing and growing... and growing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon sharing this dark truth, Claire casually laid another huge breakfast in front of her daughter, this one even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetit\" Said Claire happily and Haley managed a miserable moan before her siblings picked up the pace and crammed the rest of the first breakfast down her throat, before starting on the 2nd.<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stumbling back to her room, and spending longer than usual to pick and outfit for that day (as more and more of her wardrobe was feeling rather snug, a fact she lamented) the three Dunphy siblings were on the school bus headed to school. Of course Haley was unable to get away from Luke and Alex for the journey, and they sat next to her 'encouraging' her to begin her lunch early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to see you not eating today\" Said Alex dangerously \"If i do you will be punished... severely... is that clear, fatass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley nodded meakly as she began to eat once more, despite how full and bloated she was already. When she arrived to school, Luke and Alex basically had to help her walk into the building as she was so full and tired. She could already feel the waist band of her jeans digging into her bloated tummy, and wondered glumly if theyd hold out all day. Naively she stumbled towards her class, thinking that it was over now (and fighting the urge to undo her tight top button on her jeans) and feeling relief at being rid of her cruel siblings until lunch time at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast sis\" Said Alex handing her dazed and stuffed sister a piece of paper \"Here's you schedule for the day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley look forlornly at the paper which was marked with times barely an hour apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will meet us here at these times\" Said Alex bossily, indicating a classroom which stood empty  \"Failure to do so will also result in a severe punishment... now off to class you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley wasn't allowed to respond as Alex casually stuffed a donut into her mouth and shoo'ed her away to her first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn class Haley sat groaning in her seat, already full and exhausted before the day had even begun. She nervously watched the clock seeing it tick closer to her first 'appointment' with her siblings. In what felt like no time at all the first meeting with her siblings loomed, and with great reluctance Haley raised her hand to get her teachers attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Dunphy?\" Acknowledged the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to um... go to the rest room\" Said Haley meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok here you go\" Said the teacher, and offered a hall pass which Haley took on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley lamented using the excuse so early, wondering how many times she could use the bathroom excuse before eyebrows were raised. Glumly she approached the empty class room, wondering how her siblings were torment her this time. The question was answered immediately upon entering the room, as two nozels attached to cans of squirty cream were forced past her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glurrrb\" Burbled Haley as she was forced into the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was forced into the room, the spray cans of whipped cream being for down her throat as she stumbled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReload!\u201d Yelled Luke, and each sibling finished their current can and forced the next one past their older sisters miserable lips without skipping a beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow four cans of the calorific cream were spent before Haley even reached a seat, which she slumped into miserably before the all too familiar feeling of her arms and legs being bound behind her happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiccurrppp.. guys pleas-mrrlfff\" Her attempted pleas were cut off by the business ends of 2 more cans, which now fired their fattening contents down her throat and into her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry sis no time to talk\u201d Said Luke, nodding to a nearby box full of cans of whipped cream \u201cWere kind of on the clock right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\" Said Alex now wielding a 2nd can \u201cWeve gotta get all this fattening cream into that ever growing belly of yours... I really want you to outgrow your clothes before the end of the day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley gave a very muffled whimper as four nozzles were somehow forced into her mouth, doubling the amount she was consuming at once. <br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c12 cans in ten minutes\" Said Alex happily \u201cWow, that must be some kind of record!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh.. blurrrp\" Groaned Haley, slumped in her chair and breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should probably get back to class\" Said Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah your right, up you get lardo\" Said Alex impatiently untying her bloated sister and pulling her up \u201cOh my, such a lovely belly your developing dear sister\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiccurrp\" Haley mumbled as Alex patted her obvious stomach bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the sadistic siblings couldn\u2019t allow a second break for their poor sister, and despite her bulging stomach being nicely full (and preventing her doing the top button up on her pants) the feeding continued as she was walked back to her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait wait\" Said Alex upon reaching her classroom, opening a 6 box of Krispy creams and somehow cramming it down Haleys weary throat in only a few minutes \u201cOkay that\u2019ll do for now... see you soon sis tehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex squeezed her cheek patronisingly, before leaving Haley to stumble back to her classroom, using one hand to hold her pants up as they kept slinking down her thickening thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire was in a good mood as she walked down stairs, carefully avoiding the broken step. Phil was at work, Alex and Luke were at school, and she had no errands to run. She might catch up on some reading, or even go for a walk, she thought with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sunny disposition faded almost instantly as she entered the kitchen, and was presented with Haley's backside sticking out from behind the refrigerator door. Her eldest daughter was living at home after being kicked out of college, and after some early signs of enthusiasm in looking for a job, she had lapsed back into lazing around all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fridge door swung closed with a clink, revealing Haley, clad only in black panties and a white crop top. She was drinking straight from a carton of orange juice, tilting her head back and gulping steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire cleared her throat, and Haley's eyes snapped open. Her cheeks bulged momentarily, before she swallowed and removed the carton from her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Mom.\" She said, acting as though she was doing nothing wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed. \"You know the rules Haley, you can't strut around the house half-naked all day. Its almost noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley rolled hey eyes. \"For your information mother, I'm sick, so I was just going to take it easy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's concern wrestled with her skepticism and won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sick?\" She asked, pressing a hand against Haley's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley shrugged. \"Well, I threw up a bunch this morning, and now my stomach kind of hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't feel feverish, but Claire decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. \"Maybe have something to eat, that might settle your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley nodded, before taking another gulp of OJ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go for a walk, I'll check on you when I get back.\" Claire told her, grabbing her jacket and heading for the front door. The last thing she heard before she stepped outside was Haley letting out a belch, and the fridge door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thoroughly enjoyed her walk, extending it a little longer than she had originally intended. When she got home forty minutes later, she went straight down to the basement to check on Haley. The room was a total pigsty she noted, but Haley's bed was empty, aside from a laptop, a few fashion magazines and an empty bag of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back upstairs, and was dismayed to find the kitchen in a similar state of disarray. The fridge door was hanging open, and most of its contents were strewn across the counter tops and table. A jar of pickles had been emptied, a large bowl of chocolate pudding had been scooped out, there were even a few bites taken out of a block of cheese. The leftover fried chicken from last night looked like it had been eviscerated, gnawed right down to the bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she picked through the mess in disbelief, a snore from the other room alerted her to the whereabouts of the culprit. She walked through the double doors and looked down on to the couch. Haley was sleeping with a satisfied smile on her face, one hand resting on her distended stomach. The other hand was wrapped around a tub of rapidly melting vanilla ice-cream, which was leaking on to the fabric of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire couldn't contain her anger and poked her finger directly into her daughter's swollen stomach. \"Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley started awake with a scream, her limbs flailing, and accidentally sent the melted ice-cream flying. It landed with a splatter on Claire's face, getting into her eyes and dripping down in to her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a shriek of pain, causing Haley to scream again. Half blind, Claire defaulted to her old standby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to your room!\" She yelled, and when she finally wiped the cream from her eyes, she just caught a glimpse of Haley's backside as she scurried away. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening, the Dunphy family were all sitting at the kitchen table, enjoying a dinner of spaghetti and meatballs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I told Gil Thorp that no one takes it better than Phil Dunphy! And then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded along as Phil continued the story of his day at work. She did enough to act like she was listening, while focusing most of her attention on Haley. She had spent most of the day down in her bedroom, no doubt avoiding her, but had emerged when Phil had declared that dinner was ready. She was still wearing the crop top, her bloated belly out on display, but had at least pulled on a pair of jeans and some shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite having practically emptied the fridge earlier, Haley was stuffing her face once again, cheeks bulging with noodles and sauce. She paused occasionally to sip her drink or take a bite of garlic bread, before digging back in. Her stomach had swollen even larger, and looked to be threatening the top button of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, sitting at the opposite end of the table, caught her mother's eye and looked quizzically at her older sister. Claire just shook her head and decided to enjoy her own meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, could you...\" She began, but was interrupted by her son's panicked cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't looking at them!\" He said loudly, before looking down and closely examining a meatball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was confused, until she looked over at Haley, who was sitting opposite Luke. She wasn't wearing a bra, and her dark nipples were clearly visible through the thin fabric of her top. Claire could have sworn that her breasts were bigger too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Haley, would you mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she was interrupted before she could finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Could you stop nagging me for ten freaking seconds!\" Haley screamed, pushing her chair back from the table and standing up. The violent action caused the button of her jeans to pop open, allowing her belly to surge forward. Her unrestrained breasts bounced, almost slipping out of her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was taken aback. \"Haley, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone!\" Her daughter said, tears in her eyes, before she stomped out of the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil, Alex and Luke looked to Claire, who was just as confused as them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Claire woke up early, needing to prepare some brownies for a bake sale at Luke's school. As usual he had waited until the last minute to tell her about it. It was still dark outside, so she was surprised when she heard someone else moving around the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a dressing gown on over her pyjamas, she padded down the hallway until she reached the closed bathroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rapped lightly on the door. After a moment, she heard a weak reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go 'way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the better of her, and she knelt down and peered through the keyhole. She recognised her eldest daughter's slightly rounder behind, sticking out behind her as she clung to the toilet. Her blue pyjama pants slipped down slightly as she retched, revealing the top of her butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled smugly as she got back to her feet. Maybe that would teach Haley a lesson about making a pig of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's hope was misplaced, as she had just put the brownies in the oven when Haley appeared, looking for some breakfast. She had hitched her pants back up, but the buttons of the matching top were clearly straining over her belly.  The top two buttons were undone, providing an ample view of her bigger boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire watched, with a mixture of disapproval and fascination, Haley munched her way through two bowls of cereal, a stack of toaster waffles and half of the fruit bowl. Luke entered just as she was eating a particularly large banana, causing him to turn around and practically run back upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex and Phil came down, Claire fried up some bacon and eggs, of which Haley had a good portion, and then seconds, despite a pointed suggestion from Claire that she might have had enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Alex heading to school and Phil having an early client meeting, Haley was the last to leave the table, standing up with a groan that transitioned into a long belch. Her stomach was hugely bloated, putting even more pressure on her remaining shirt buttons. The lowest one had popped off after the first round of bacon and eggs, and she had undone the next lowest one as a precaution.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked over from the counter, where she was packing the brownies into a Tupperware container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough?\" She sniffed, looking her daughter up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley either didn't notice the tone or decided not to respond to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends. Can I have a brownie?\" She asked, taking a few steps towards the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pulled the box protectively towards her, and turned to call upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke! Come on, you're going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to put the lid on the container, and noticed that her neat stack had been disturbed. She looked up to see Haley cramming an entire brownie into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither that brownie was one bite too many, or else darting forward to grab it had been too much for the overworked garment, because suddenly Haley's pyjama top burst open. The last two buttons pinged off, one hitting Claire in the face, one skittering across the floor. At that exact moment, Luke walked into the kitchen, and was greeted by the sight of his half naked sister desperately trying to cover herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whimpered and ran out, slamming the front door behind him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire sipped her coffee, wondering what to do about Haley. She had just gotten back from the grocery store, needing to restock the kitchen after her latest binge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, Claire had chased after Luke, to no avail, and when she returned to the kitchen Haley was gone, along with another three brownies. She had considered going down to the basement to confront her about what had happened, but realised that she didn't know what to say. She figured she was bound to emerge sooner or later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Haley entered the kitchen,  wearing a pair of orange hot pants that clung tightly to her thicker thighs, and a once baggy white t-shirt that could no longer disguise her bulging midsection or enlarged breasts.  The effect was that of a Hooters girl who had let herself go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, do we have any aspirin? My back is killing me.\" She complained, opening the fridge and taking out a carton of orange juice. After taking a healthy swig, she began looking through the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starved. Do we have any watermelon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes widened, and she almost dropped her coffee cup. She didn't know why she hadn't seen it before, but it was like the word 'watermelon' had turned on a lightbulb inside her head. It was exactly what she had craved every time she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down her coffee, she hurried over to Haley and span her around. Ignoring her protests, she lifted up her shirt, fully exposing her swollen stomach. It was about the size of a soccer ball, and when she placed her hand on it, it felt taut rather than soft and flabby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what are you doing?\" Haley asked, still holding the OJ in one hand and a jar of peanut butter in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire tried to stay calm. \"Haley, when was the last time you had your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was pretty dumb, but even she realised what her mother was getting at. \"Ew, Mom! It was like, two weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire didn't feel relieved. \"But you're throwing up in the mornings, you're craving watermelon and  your nipples are tender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was starting to look frightened. \"My nipples aren't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire cut her off by flicking her left breast, causing her to squeal in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention the fact that you're eating like a pig and blowing up like a Thanksgiving day parade balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley pouted. \"Mom, I couldn't be...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shook her head. It seemed impossible, but still. \"There's only one way to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, again, for seeing us on such short notice.\" Claire said, as Dr. Miura ushered them into the exam room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem.\" The Asian woman said, checking a box on her chart. \"Now, how far along are you Ms Dunphy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley was indignant. \"I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not sure!\" Claire said quickly. \"We were hoping you could... clear that up for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Miura nodded, and asked Haley to lie down on the padded bench and lift up her shirt. Haley rolled her tight shirt up to just under her breasts, exposing the growing expanse of peach coloured flesh. She shivered as Dr. Miura applied the cool blue gel, spreading it across the dome of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few switches were flicked, and Dr. Miura began to slowly run the ultrasound wand over Haley's stomach. Claire bit her lip as the seconds passed by, and was surprised when she felt Haley reach for her hand. She took  her daughter's hand and squeezed it reassuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are.\" Dr. Miura said finally, squinting at the monitor. \"I should say, based on what I'm seeing here, that you're about four months along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley and Claire's mouths both dropped open simultaneously. It was Haley who found her voice first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But... I can't be having a baby.\" She said, looking down at her own stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Miura looked confused, understandably so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not having a baby.\" She said, turning the monitor to face them. \"You're having three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Dr. Miura, who recommended scheduling another checkup for a month's time, Haley and Claire returned to their car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor quite a long time, they sat in silence in the parking lot. Eventually, Haley spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, after a long pause,  nodded and started the car. Ten minute later they were going through the drive thru of a nearby burger place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get, uh, ten, double cheeseburgers, four orders of twisty fries, and, two extra-large chocolate milkshakes.\" Claire said haltingly into the speaker box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley nudged her, urgently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed. \"Make that fifteen double cheeseburgers. No, twenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to assemble their order, and a little longer for Claire to find the money to pay for it, but they were soon pulling into the first available parking space, Haley already tearing into the first of three bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire watched her for a few minutes as she quickly demolished three of the thick greasy burgers, barely pausing for breath between bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious thoughts vied for her attention. How had this happened? What were they going to do? Why did those burgers smell so good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last question won out, at least in the short-term, and Claire grabbed some burgers for herself. Side by side, mother and daughter stuffed their faces, problems momentarily forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley obviously had the advantage, but Claire was no stranger to stress eating, and put up an impressive showing. When the last bag was emptied, Claire had finished six and a half burgers, along with an order of curly fries. All the rest had disappeared into Haley's belly, including Claire's abandoned half burger, swelling it out to even greater proportions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's own stomach was fairly bloated as well, enough to make her regret wearing her tight fitting black jeans. She had just reached down and undone her pants button, allowing herself a little more breathing room, when there was a rap on the window next to her. </span></div></div>",

Except there was a slight slant to the floor, and it was downwind from a sewage treatment plant. Still, they were determined to make the best of it, deciding they could get used to the smell, and calling a contractor to investigate how much it would cost to fix the tilted floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were at McLaren's with the rest of the gang, looking over the invoice of the estimated cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Lily, even with our savings, we're still fifteen hundred dollars short.\" Marshall said, pointing to the final figure on the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't GNB just give you a loan?\" Robin suggested, sipping her beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with Lily's credit rating.\" Marshall said. Lily had run up massive debts due to her shopping addiction, which had almost prevented them from getting the apartment in the first place. \"You know, we could sell some of your clothes to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Lily cut him off. \"I mean, that won't be necessary, baby, I'll find someway to raise the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how? It's not like fifteen hundred dollars is just going to drop out of the sky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, Wendy the waitress walked by with a handful of flyers. \"Hey guys, the bar is having a hot dog eating contest next month, grand prize is fifteen hundred dollars!\" She handed Ted a flyer and moved on to the next table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's convenient.\" Barney remarked, as Lily grabbed the flyer out of Ted's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is perfect! I can totally win this!\" Lily said excitedly, scanning the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Hot dog eating?\" Robin asked, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily once ate 29 hot dogs in 8 minutes.\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\" Lily said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall was still sceptical. \"I don't know Lily, that was a long time ago, plus there's no time limit on this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it baby, I'm sure I can. I just need to train a little.\" Lily insisted. \"Robin will help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will? I mean, sure I will.\" Robin nodded after Lily kicked her under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily turned to face Marshall and gave him a puppy dog stare, sticking out her lower lip hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... All right. But if you don't win, we're selling all your clothes and that's final.\" Marshall said, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Lily smiled, clapping her hands together. \"Robin, can you come by tomorrow afternoon and get started on the training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess.\" Robin shrugged, draining the last of her beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Lily grinned. \"This is going to be great!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She handed Robin a bib to protect her clothing and placed a glass and pitcher of non ice water next to the platter. \"Are you ready?\" Lily asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Lily. I mean, I ate a few hours ago and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. It's a common misconception that you shouldn't eat before a competition. Look Robin, this is just a benchmark. You don't need to eat as many as me yet. We have some time, I just need to evaluate your current prowess. It'll be easy. Alright? 3, 2, 1, GO!!\" Robin quickly started to eat. A little awkwardly at first, after all chugging a beer is very different than cramming a hot dog down your throat. She would push the hot dog into her mouth and chew as quickly as possible. She almost choked twice during and splashed water on her front trying to save herself. \"And, time,\" Lily called \"final count is 6. Not bad for a first timer but I wish it was more.\" Robin coughed and chugged the rest of the water in her glass before pouring another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6? That's it? That was excruciating. How can you do this Lily?\" Robin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you,\" Lily said. She went into the kitchen and grabbed her own glass before filling it and returning to her seat. She moved the platter and took a deep breath. \"3, 2, 1, GO!!\" She shouted before taking her first hot dog off the pile. She dipped the bun in her glass of water before putting it into her mouth. She strategically moved the frank into her mouth with well timed bites. After she swallowed she wiggled in her seat a little and did so every time from then on. Lily repeated this process while Robin watched in amazement. When time was up Lily had devoured 22 hot dogs. \"Not bad for a cold start,\" Lily said as she whipped her mouth with the bib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you dip it in water?\" Robin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The water softens the bun and makes it easier to chew,\" Lily explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was with the wiggling?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiggling helps move the food down your esophagus. Ok now Robin, it's important that you sit and relax now. Just rest, that feeling in your stomach will go away but it's important to let yourself digest before trying to do anything else. I have some videos cued up for us to watch while we relax,\" Lily explained. She turned on the tv and a rather fit man was on the screen. It turned out to be a video on how to prepare for an eating contest. While it was on Robin's stomach started to hurt. She looked down at her belly and saw a slight bulge. She looked over at Lily and saw a much larger belly on her. Robin couldn't focus on the video and just rubbed her sore belly. \"By the way,\" Lily spoke and tossed Robin a pack of gum \"chew this. It'll help strengthen your jaw muscles.\" Robin took out a piece and began to chew now noticing how sore her jaw was too. </span></div></div>",

She'd been chewing it non stop since Lily told her to strengthen her jaw. She didn't know if it was working but she liked the gum so it was so bad. She walked into the apartment and saw the living room table covered in sliced watermelon. The bubble Robin had blown popped as she cautiously approach. \"Lily?\" The Canadian called. Lily walled into the room chewing her own gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you want to know about the watermelon?\" Her friend questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little bit,\" she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, watermelon helps expand the walls of your stomach, so you can pack more in it. You should eat it with every meal. Or as a snack. For today, we'll be eating this and watching more videos.\" Robin sighed in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More eating and watching stupid videos,\" Robin pouted and flopped down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is an <i>eating</i> contest,\" Lily emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever,\" Robin huffed. She spit out her gum into a tissue before picking up a piece of melon and popping it into her mouth. Lily handed her a bottle of water and sat down next to her. After a few minutes of silent eating Lily spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we'll be doing water training,\" Lily added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much water do you drink each day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know. I don't really drink just water. Maybe a bottle at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. You're going to start drinking 6 bottle a day. Not all at once, just make sure you have drank 6 bottles before you go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, ok?\" Robin agreed eyebrows raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After two days of that you'll increase to 9 bottles. And after 2 more days of that you drink 12.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drinking water will help expand your stomach. I need you to get your stomach and muscles used to the increase so when you start to chug water, your body will be ok,\" Lily explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be chugging water!?\" Robin's shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me.

She had found that carrying multiple bottles of water around with her was super inconvenient. Not to mention someone at work asked her if she was pregnant do to the water and the slight bloating that came with it. She opened the door without knocking and was welcomed with a wonderful smell. Meat. Lily came out of the kitchen carrying a plater with two thick juicy steaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, one of the teachers at my schools wife is making them go vegan so he was giving away his meat at school,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sucks to be him,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now this fortunate feast comes with some rules. Ok, you're going to eat a fairly large meal. And afterwards you're going to drink a quart of water.\" Lily informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lily. Can't we just have a nice meal without it being about training?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Robin. It hasn't been that bad. A little water and some melon never killed anyone and besides I'm feeding you steak so shush,\" Lily countered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sat in the chair with a bit of a pout. \"Can I at least get a beer with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Lily said before making Robin a plate. \"Now I need you to finish that,\" Lily said passing Robin the plate. A 20oz steak with a plentiful helping of fries was given to the Canadian. She started to eat and Lily brought her a beer. The dinner was nice as the two girls talked. The topic of food was skipped entirely deciding instead to discuss more enjoyable things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the meal Robin was struggling. She had a fourth of the steak left and a handful of fries. She looked up and saw Lily was chugging her water to signify that she was done with her food. The smaller woman placed the glass down and gave a victorious burp. Robin looked down at her plate unsure if she could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Robin. You can do it,\" Lily encouraged. Robin picked up another piece and weakly put it in her mouth. She chewed slowly not really wanting to continue. She swallowed and slumped in her chair. Lily stood up and carefully walked over to her partner. She picked up the fork and stabbed a piece of meat. She brought it to Robin's refusing lips. \"Open,\" Lily said firmly. With a grimace, Robin did and Lily inserted the food. She continued to do this for ever bite of steak. Robin felt so full. \"Are you ok?\" Lily asked in a calm voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Robin answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're almost done. You can finish,\" Lily insisted. She picked up a frie and brought it to the trembling lips. \"Robin!\" Lily spoke when her friend didn't open her mouth. With little bites the frie was consumed. Lily began to gently rub down Robin's throat to help her swallow. She grabbed another and repeated. When Robin didn't open Lily put a hand on her shoulder. The last of the fries were finished and a relieved Robin burped loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Robin hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One final thing,\" Lily said. She grabbed the quart off the table and handed it to Robin. \"Drink!\" Lily ordered. Robin was on the verge of tears. With a shaky hand she grabbed the glass and began to drink. The faster she finished the better she thought. Each swallow was a challenge but the water was finished. Lily took the beaker and put it on the table before rubbing Robin's stomach. Robin moaned as Lily somehow made her stomach feel better. \"I do this for Marshal every year on thanksgiving. It helps settle the food,\" she explained. She slid her hand down Robin's belly and over her waist. Robin started to panic until Lily undid her belt and she felt a hundred times better. \"Next time, don't wear a belt,\" Lily advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, we're doing this again tomorrow night. And then again the day after. Following that we are going to eat two large meals each day. But don't worry we won't eat three meals that day. Of course we'll still drink the quart of water after each one. This will all be worth it Robin,\" Lily elaborated as she continued to rub her friend's belly. Robin burped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Robin groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Let it out. Burping is getting rid of all the excess air in you stomach,\" She informed. She pressed on Robin's tummy and she burped again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked down and saw her belly was bloated. She looked at Lily to see a slightly larger belly on her. She must have been taking this very seriously. Robin closed her eyes as Lily continued to massage her. She didn't want her to stop.</span></div></div>",

She had finished her mighty serving of lasagna but still had 2 pieces of garlic bread left. Lily had the bread in her hand and was forcing it into Robin's mouth. The bread was wider than Robin's mouth so Lily crushed it slightly to make it fit. Ever time Robin opened her mouth even a tiny bit Lily pushed it deeper in. \"This is good for your gag reflex training too,\" Lily added. With her free hand Lily made Robin chew. Eventually Robin swallowed the bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to do this anymore,\" Robin begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more,\" Lily forced. A broken Robin opened her mouth and finished the bread. With weak resistance Robin drank the quart of water and was rewarded with Lily rubbing her belly to relieve the pressure. \"You did good Robin,\" Lily smiled as she massaged. Robin burped and slumped into the coach. They had eaten dinner on the coach tonight to make Robin more comfortable as she ate. Lily turned on the tv and a Canadian movie appeared. \"This is for doing so good,\" She informed. Robin gave a small smile and watched the move. After a few minutes Lily got up and went into the bathroom. She looked at the mirror and began to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wasn't going to make it as her partner for the contest if she kept fighting the training. She had to do something. She had options but the morality of those options were questionable. She had an appetite enhancer that could help Robin push through her wall. Or, she had an old hypno watch that she got from her grandmother. She could use it to influence Robin's mind to make her a better partner. Of course she didn't have to use either. She could simply push harder and get Robin over the hurdle the old fashion way. What was she going to do?</span></div></div>",

The watch could be done tonight but she'd have to set up the circumstances to use it.

Sooner is better than later and besides it would be relatively easy to get Robin to drink after her stomach settled. Her mind made up, Lily flushed the toilet and left the bathroom. She walked into the kitchen and took the watch out of her purse. She slipped it into her pocket and poured two glasses of wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the living room and sat down next to Robin. She handed the glass to her friend would took it with a slightly sour face. Lily rubbed her belly with a smile and Robin took a small sip. Lily stopped relieving Robin of her pain when she put the glass down. During the movie Lily would rub Robin's belly only when she took a sip of wine. The subconscious encouragement was working Robin began to drink more wine faster. Three glasses in and Lily cursed herself for serving bread with dinner. This was the last of the wine. She hopped it would be enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the couch again and Robin took the wine and took a swallow. Lily, in turn, massaged her belly. She saw Robin was flushed and her breathing had calmed. After the wine was gone and the movie was over Lily stood up and pulled out the watch. She turned to face Robin and began to swing the watch. Robin stared at the artifact in confusion before slowly loosing all expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are falling. Falling into a deep sleep. Your eyes are heavy and your mind is blank.\" Lily spoke. Robin's eyes fluttered. With a relieved smile Lily continued. \"Food is good. Food is wonderful. Eating makes you feel so good.\" Lily chanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. So good,\" Robin slurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A full belly is a happy belly. Feeling full feels so good. If you ever feel so full you can't eat anymore the words <i>come on Robin</i> will make you hungry. So hungry you'll feel like you're starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, so hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Lily could get Robin to eat plenty. But, why stop there.

Why did I say that?' She panicked internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi sexual,\" Robin confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dammit, I can't take that back. I'm so sorry Robin,' Lily thought. Why, why did she implant that. Was it the wine? Or, did she have a secret desire that she hadn't noticed until now. \"You now have a crush on me. Every time we eat together that crush grows stronger. You won't care I'm married and you won't tell anyone,\" Lily ordered. 'What is wrong with me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily, crush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I ever try to use this watch on you again you want question it and won't realize what I'm doing,\" Lily finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now waking up.

After the yawn Robin looked at Lily and froze. Confusion covering her face. Her jaw dropped a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" Lily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Fine,\" Robin spoked flustered slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna grab a snack. Want anything?\" Lily tested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah actually. I'd like some food,\" Robin answered suprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Lily said and walked into the kitchen. She could feel Robin staring at her ass as she walked away. 'What did I do?' She wondered. She grabbed a full box of cookies out of the pantry and walked back into the living room. She opened it and took out one. \"Here you go,\" she said handing it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Robin shyly smiled. They both ate a cookie. Each bite at the same time. Robin developed a light blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like them?\" Lily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Robin munched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was thinking.

She'd been over ever day for the passed week and a half with no issues. But, last night, something changed. She didn't know what but when she looked at Lily after the movie. She saw her in a new light. Her eyes seemed to dazzle like the sun. Her skin glowed with a warmth previously unknown to her. And her body just seemed so...enticing. Robin had snuck more than a few glances at Lily's bust and butt last night. But, why now did she notice these things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of bacon and hash browns filled Robin's nose. Oh, and Lily's cooking was divine. Speaking of food, Robin couldn't stop eating. Even after the stuffing she had at dinner she finished off a whole box of Cookies and on the way home she stopped by a 24 hour donut shop and ordered a dozen jelly donuts that she finished before reaching her apartment. She wasn't hungry, it just felt so good to eat for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer appetite forced her to knock at last. A few moments later the door was answered by Lily. She was still wearing her pajamas thanks to it only being 6:00 am. The cooking had flushed Lily's face giving had a red hue. A few hair dangled freely in front of her face. Robin saw herself brushing the hairs back as she cupped Lily's cheek. \"Hi Robin, breakfast is almost ready,\" Lily smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Robin returned as Lily let her in. The table had a large bowl of eggs, a plater of bacon, sausage, and hash browns, and a boat of gravy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and sit down. I just need to grab one more thing,\" Lily instructed. Robin sat down at the table and stared at the buffet before her. It took all of her will power to not dig in immediately. Lily walked out of the kitchen with a big bowl of biscuits, and a tub of butter. \"Here we go. That's the last of it. Now Marshall is still asleep from late hours at the office so let's keep the talking low,\" Lily almost whispered. Robin barely heard her as Lily bent over the table to grab her plate. Lily loaded it up with spoonfuls of food before giving an over flowing plate back to the waiting news anchor. Robin picked up a hash brown and lifted it up to her mouth. \"Hold on Robin. Let me get my food too,\" Lily said. Robin quickly put the item down in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes Lily sat down with her own plate and scooted her chair up. Her chest bounced with each hop. \"You can start now,\" Lily allowed. Robin began to dig into her breakfast. She stuffed her mouth to capacity before starting to chew. The gum she'd been chewing had really helped with her jaw strength. Robin looked over at Lily as she ate. Their jaws synchronizing as they chewed. She felt a warmth in her chest as she watched Lily eat. A drop of gravy fell onto her chest and Robin blushed. Lily whipped the drip off her skin and licked her finger. Robin moaned into her food. Within minutes she had finshed her plate. Robin was shocked by how quickly she had finished. Lily was only half way done with her meal. \"You can have more if you want,\" Lily offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I should,\" Robin said. Her belly was stuffed. She rubbed her taut tummy. It did feel nice to feel so full though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Robin. It's ok,\" Lily smiled. With that Robin felt hungry again. Not just hungry, famished. She practically dove at the food on the table. Forgoing table manner, Robin took food from the platers and put it directly into her mouth. Juices dripped down her chin and onto her chest. She even picked up the gravy boat and started to drink the thick dressing. The button on her pants popped as she stuffed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was flooded with a few different emotions. Part of her was glad her hypnotic suggestions worked, another part was scared at what she had done, and a third part just liked to watch Robin eat. The crumbs scattered across her chest. The juice making her skin shine. The way her belly expanded with each swallow. Robin collapsed into her chair and with a wet burp she was finished. She ate everything, even the butter. Robin grabbed her bloated belly with both hands and moaned. \"Oh god,\" Robin moaned \"So good.\" Lily took another bite of her food and Robin watched. Lily continued to eat as Robin rubbed her tummy. Each bite Robin's stare seemed to grow more intense. Down to her last bite of biscuit, Lily drug it around her plate to soak up all the juices. She raised it to her lips and Robin practically drooled. She placed it onto her tongue and slowly closed her mouth. She chewed it slow before swallowing with a long gulp. Robin sunk further into her chair and Lily stood. She walked over to Robin and placed her hands on her friends stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like breakfast?\" She asked. Robin moaned in response. \"You did such a good job. You ate everything like you were told,\" Lily added as she began to rub Robin's tummy. \"Does that feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good,\" Robin gasped. She was so full and is felt <i>soooo good</i>! Lily grabbed Robin's shirt and pulled it up so she could see her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you full?\" Lily asked getting on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So full,\" Robin squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Lily smiled and hovered her lips over Robin's skin. \"I'd hate for you to feel hungry,\" she told. The warmth of Lily's breath caused Robin to melt. A wetness began to coat her crotch. \"Let's get you over to the couch to relax,\" Lily said. She helped Robin and walked her to the sofa. </span></div></div>",

Robin pulled down the zipper on her pants and sighed. She then readjusted her panties so the elastic wasn't resting on her stomach in the slightest. She was as comfortable as she was gonna get. And yet, the more she thought about how full she was the more she liked it. Her attitude toward her situation slowly shifted from displeasure and regret to a feeling of deep satisfaction. She liked how full she was. She moaned as her hand slid up and down her taut tummy. She looked down and saw her belly was poking out 2 inches farther than it naturally did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing ok?\" Lily asked stepping out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Robin answered. Lily was getting ready for work while Robin had made this discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm almost ready to leave. I'd hate to make you leave after such a big meal, so stay as long as you'd like and just lock to door when you go.

Any movement of her lower body was met with protest by her stomach. The only thing she could do was rub her belly. Her nice, stuffed belly. That gurgled and groaned as it digested the glorious meal Lily had prepared for her that morning. Robin closed her eyes as she massaged her tummy. Her mind drifted as she imagined it was Lily's hands on her. Her awareness came back to her when her hands found her breasts. The Canadian girl couldn't deny it. She had fallen for the redhead. Exactly how it happened eluded her. Sure, she had always been more masculine do to her father having wanted a boy. And every relationship she'd had, ended very quickly. But did that mean she was a lesbian? No, clearly not, because she had definitely fallen for Ted who was a guy. A very feminine guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts occupied Robin for some time. The next thing she knew it was 10 o'clock. The pressure in her belly had eased to the point where she was able to stand. She attempted to button her pants but quickly discovered that was no longer an option. If she hadn't planned on staying before, she was now. Unless, she wanted to borrow pants from Marshal which wasn't going to happen. After freshening up in the bathroom Robin returned to her seat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" she spoke in disbelief as she stared at her stomach. She was hungry again. \"You know what? No,\" Robin said and turned on the tv. The food channel. Her stomach grumbled. \"I really don't need to eat anymore,\" she protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sure you do. Eating is good. Food is good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate enough for four people during breakfast,\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And wasn't it great. The tasting, the chewing, the swallowing. And the best part. Lily rubbing your belly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily isn't here,\" Robin notified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not yet, but she will be soon</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't you remember. She said she would be back for lunch. Why don't we order some food so it will be here when she gets home.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on Robin. It will be great. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin bit her lip. \"Ok,\" she said and picked up the phone. After half and hour the food arrived. 5 large pizzas, two dozen hot wings, 3 orders of cheese bread and four 2 liters of soda. \"Maybe I over did it a little,\" Robin speculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not at all. Lily will love this. Why don't you start eating?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"I should wait for Lily\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't be silly. She wouldn't want you to be hungry. Listen to your poor belly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue her stomach growled. \"Ok, but just a slice.\" And with that the feast began. After one bite Robin lost all sense of self control. She tore through the pizzas one by one. Sauce covered her lips and chin. Every bite of the pies were devoured. The wings were next. They took time as they had bones and needed to be lathered in ranch. The cheese bread put up little resistance as she didn't bother separating them. The last to go were the sodas which were chugged. With a loud, wet, violent burp Robin finished. Her belly was stuffed to capacity stretching out five inches onto her lap. She clutched the flesh of her pit with a weary smile. \"So good,\" she whimpered. She was a mess. Coated in cheese and ranch. But she didn't care, not right now. The voice had left her.  </span></div></div>",

The Burnett looked at her watch and saw it was 3:30. With a relieved sigh she opened the door and was greeted with a surprising sight. Robin was currently in a food coma with pizza boxes, wing containers, soda bottles, fried chicken buckets, and biscuit cartons spread out on the floor. Of course, the biggest mess had to be Robin's face and chest. It was practically dripping with grease. All but her lips, which were perfectly clean save for the shine of spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was speechless. The utter shock at seeing her friend like this, and knowing she was the one who did this to her. \"<i>I can't believe this. I've turned her into a gluten. A poor slob that can't be satisfied. I have to reverse this</i>,\" Lily thought. She began to shake the pig as she shouted \"Robin! Robin wake up!\" But the sleeping beast wouldn't be roused. \"<i>This is awful</i>,\" she internally spoke. The teacher sat down on the couch to try and think, but the crunching sound of garbage stopped her. \"This place is a mess. If nothing else, I can at least fix this,\" she determined. The grief filled artist spent the next 20 minutes cleaning the apartment and taking the trash out. When she got back she found Robin still sound asleep. \"What am I gonna do?\" She asked herself. Staring at the girl, Lily figured she could at least make her look decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into the kitchen to grab a towel and wetting it, Lily then began to wash the Canadian's face. She wiped all the cheese and grease off her face before moving to her neck. Forced to rewet the towel Lily went back into the kitchen and made a stop in her bedroom to grab one of Marshall's shirts. After returning to the living room, Lily went about removing Robin's stained and sticky shirt. Having difficulty only when she had to force it from the news anchor's head. Once free from the cloth Robin sat in full view before Lily. It was only now that she noticed to bulging belly that Robin sported. It was easily the size of a soccer ball. Stuffed taut, the orb was almost churning as it tried to digest the feast within. Truly, Lily was stunned into silence. She didn't know how to feel about the magnificent sight before her. She got on her knees and sat eye level with it. The jewel sat gracefully in Robins lap. The bulbous object had forced Robin's zipper all the way down to make room for itself. She wanted to touch it. Gingerly reaching a hand toward it, the new yorker was hesitant. When she was but a hair's breath away the monster seemed to push itself into her palm. It gurgled in pleasure like it had been waiting for her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith contact made, Lily lost all inhibition and began to explore the glorious globe. No surface was left untouched. She had her hands flat against the organ as she massaged it. Robin moaned in her sleep. Lily didn't stop, she only became more aggressive in her palming. She couldn't get enough of it. It was as if Robin was now hypnotizing her. \"More. I need more,\" Lily grunted. </span></div></div>",

The expulsions coming from the sleeping gluten, do to Lily's palming, seemed to help ease her discomfort. The moans coming from deep in Robin's throat were chipping away at Lily's hesitation. She wanted Robin to be bigger. And not just a little bigger, she wanted Robin to be humongous. She wanted her to have a belly so big that she could use it as a bed. A king sized stomach bed so she could cuddle up and sleep on it. Fantasies filled her head as a blush washed over her face. Lily bit her bottom lip as he fingers brushed the bottom of Robin's bra. With an adrenaline fueled last squeeze, Lily pulled out her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's Lily, I need a favor,\" the New Yorker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin woke up feeling groggy and fuller than she'd ever been in her life. Like a horrid slob, Robin had devoured more food than her entire hockey team had after they won the championship. Why did she feel so good about it. Echos of the little voice fluttered through Robin's head. With great effort, the news anchor grabbed hold of her belly. It was so full. Only now did she open her eyes so she could look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she noticed she was in her apartment. Failing in her attempt to sit up from her position on the couch, Robin did her best to determine if she was really where she thought she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good you're awake,\" Lily said as she came out of the kitchen carrying a plate of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by her friend's arrival, Robin jumped slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, did I get here?\" she asked as she gripped her angry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought you here. You crashed on my couch, so I cleaned you up and got you a new shirt,\" Lily explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin blushed, \"you cleaned me and changed my shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah. you had grease and cheese all over your face. You ruined your old shirt, so I got you one of Marshal's,\" Lily explained as she sat down next to Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" Robin said with her blush getting deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. It just means you're making progress. Look at this belly,\" Lily said grabbing hold of it \"you fit all that food in here in only a few hours. Soon, we'll have that time shaved down.\" Lily kept kneading Robin's belly. \"Does that feel good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Robin admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I'd hate to make you feel uncomfortable,\" Lily said as she picked up a cookie from the table. The stuffed woman's eyes locked onto the baked good as it made its way to Lily's mouth. Slowly, she took a bite and pulled, revealing the slightly melted chocolate chips within. Crumbs fell on her bosom and Robin saw the whole thing as if in slow motion. \"These cookies are so good,\" she said as she took another bite. She finished the first one and ran her pinkie along her bottom lip, removing the leftover chocolate before putting the digit into her mouth and sucking it clean. \"I just can't get enough.\" Lily grabbed another cookie and began eating it even slower than the first. Robin was frozen with desire. He face was burning and her crotch was soaked. Lily licked along the outside of her third cookie, leaving a thin line of saliva between it and her tongue as she pulled away. Robin hung off of Lily's even action. \"Do you want one?' she asked as she gently squeezed her breasts together with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dry mouth, Robin barely managed to answer before Lily popped a cookie in her mouth. \"You'll love these. I put a special ingredient in them,\" she teased as she let her fingertips linger on Robin's lips. The ingredient was a powder to help Robin's digestion. That and some lard to help her get fat, but she didn't have to know that. Lily went back and forth feeding herself and Robin. Before long, 2 dozen cookies were gone. \"Did you like them?\" Robin nodded gently. \"Do you want more?'</span></div></div>",

And then there was the little secret Robin keep locked inside her as she had won a contest herself, the legendary (though in the USA unknown) \"Moosejaw Miss Beer Belly Contest\" before she entered college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this time it wasn\u00b4t about liquid but solide food which could become a challenge. On the other hand Lily wanted Robin as secundant and coach, so Robin could learn from one of the best and probably imitate Lily\u00b4s style to win the contest... or at least to beat Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily Aldrin, get ready to get the beating of your life, Robin thought while grinning wittily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ...

The shareholder value had dropped decivingly and the leading managers knew that the next few weeks would be important to rather find new investors to save the station... or if it had to close its doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need a very polarizing report... Something that is all new and not heard of... that has never done before...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have something in the back but I don\u00b4t konw what reporter to pick... We need to build up a new face of the company as Mr. Rivers seems to be way over his prime time... So we need someone we could use in the future, who has a solid standing and fanbase but hasn\u00b4t had a breakthough moment yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhhh.... what about that Canadian woman? She seems to be loved by a small fanbase and it\u00b4s not that she lacks the quality it needs... I think her name is Scherbonksky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You maybe mean Scherbatsky?

So let\u00b4s all discuss about the project she might be involved and then decide if we pick her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin relaxed and leant back into the soft and comfortable leather chair. She closed her eyes and slowly blow cigar smoke into the air around hers. Despite being a resident of NYC for years now she hasn\u00b4t made much friends yet... aside from the gang. Not even here in the elegant cigar club despite being a respected member. Even the most traditionalistic men had to admint that Robin was indeed a big expert when it came to cigars... plus she could brag about the Cubans she smoked whenever being back home in Canada. But being a respected member and being a friend was a difference... that didn\u00b4t matter to Robin at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this place was like a second home for her... or maybe a 3rd home as her second was McLaren\u00b4s... but what about the home of Lily and Marshall... or Ted\u00b4s house then? Okay, it was more like one of her multiple homes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tough day behind her Robin loved how the soft leather stabilized her head and neck area. It didn\u00b4t matter what would happen over the day... after a lovely cigar in th club she always felt relaxed and somehow reborn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother drag drag she took and could feel the spiced smoke tickling her palate which caused Robin to sigh in joy... It was no Cuban but a great cigar nevertheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released the smoke and some curling soft lines of smoke formed a cloud next to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BEEP-BEEP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got angry... She just indulged in a great cigar and someone was disturbing her by the way of a SMS... Whoever that is, I\u00b4ll give that person heck... Robin thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look onto the screen and saw it was from one of her bosses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Ms Scherbatsky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease check your e-mails ASAP! It\u00b4s very important!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Miller\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow... from the big bosses themselves... must be a very special thing, Robin thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her laptop and opened it. A few minutes later she had logged in to check her mails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin read it with excitement and one could see the curiousity in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I\u00b4ll take that job!\" Robin screamed in joy... before recognizing all the heads that turned over to her... Oh, I\u00b4m still in the club... came into her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys!\" she said with an expression of smile and embarrassment on her face while turning a bit red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later Barney kissed Robin good-bye at the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is the report about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) It is about a special event/special location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Robin is sent to the jungle to live with a local tribe that was recently discovered and whose rituals and traditions are still unkonwn to science and public. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few quick looks around she saw a lot of women aged from 18-39, belonging to all kinds of racrs with all kinds of hairdos as well as haircolours and eyecolours.

Anyway, I suddenly get a phone call, turns out there's an emergency down at the \"mayor's office\". I tell her I'll call her, and ten minutes later I'm back at the bar, sharing a drink with a Victoria's Secret model!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff, sitting across the booth, shook his head. \"I'd be impressed, if I wasn't so disgusted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam nodded. \"Yeah, that's pretty cold Russell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, you're just jealous that if I get stuck with a fatty, I can ditch her without having to give her half my stuff.\" Russell retorted, sipping his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't seriously be calling Audrey a 'fatty'.\" Jeff said, an air of menace coming into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, plus Jen keeps it pretty tight.\" Adam agreed, smiling smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, for now. But once you walk her down the aisle, don't be surprised if that's the last bit of exercise she gets.\" Russell countered, before turning to Jeff. \"As for Audrey, you know she constantly has to watch what she eats, one chocolate bar too many and she'd blimp up like that kid in Willy Wonka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'd know all about that, being an Oompah-Loompah and all.\" Jeff quipped, getting up and taking out his wallet. \"Come on Adam, let's go before he starts singing a song.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Jeff and Adam left the diner, Audrey and Jen arrived. As the two couples chatted by the register, Russell suddenly had an idea. He quickly called over a waitress and placed an order, sending her away just before the two women sat down opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, you're still here.\" Audrey said, unbuttoning her blue jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too.\" Russell replied, smiling politely. \"That's a nice shirt Jen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks.\" Jen replied, justifiably suspicious of Russell's unusual civility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Audrey could ask what Russell was up to, the waitress arrived with two large slices of pie with ice-cream on top, placing them down in front of her and Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, we didn't order these.\" Jen told the waitress, but Russell answered before she could respond, trying to look disinterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was Adam and Jeff, something about you two being 'so sweet', I wasn't really listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen and Audrey said 'aww' simultaneously, sharing a look, before digging in to the delicious baked goods. By the time Russell had finished the last of his meal, having watched them eagerly devour their own fattening breakfast, a plan had formed in his mind. He would teach Adam and Jeff a lesson, and have fun too.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why aren't you picking up some bimbo and going yourself?\" Jen asked, passing Audrey the pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, normally I would, but this weekend the national cheer leading championships are being held right here in New York, and there are going to be a lot of disappointed runners-up in need of comforting.\" He explained, rubbing his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Audrey rolled her eyes.\"Charming, as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want to go or not? I have to call them and confirm by lunch.\" Russell said, standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at Jen, who nodded enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, yes, we'll go.\" Audrey said. \"And, uh, thanks Russell.\" She added hesitantly, unused to the idea of being grateful to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed his head humbly, hiding his smirk. As he walked back towards the exit, he sidled up to a waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you bring those two a stack of pancakes each? Just tell them they're on the house for two valued regulars.\" He said, slipping her a fifty. \"And extra syrup, okay?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this room is enormous!\" Jen said excitedly, dropping her suitcase on the bed closest to the door. It was Friday, and after lunch at the diner, they had made the drive up to the spa for their weekend of pampering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess we really owe Russell.\" Audrey agreed, looking around their room, still half-expecting to find a hidden camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do first? We could head down to the jacuzzi, maybe hit the sauna?\" Jen suggested, when the phone rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey picked it up. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Bingham? We have you and Ms. Morgan scheduled for a six o'clock mud bath down in the rejuvenation centre, unless you would like to reschedule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at Jen and mouthed the words 'mud bath'. The brunette smiled and gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure, we'll be down their in a few minutes.\" Audrey said, hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, having changed out of their clothes and pulled on luxurious bathrobes and complimentary flip-flops, they arrived at the 'rejuvenation' centre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they slipped into the hot mud, both women let out satisfied sighs. The lights dimmed and soothing music was piped in to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, the lights came back up, and the music gently faded out. After hauling themselves out of the baths and rinsing off in the shower, they decided to head back to their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so amazing, my skin is still tingling.\" Jen gushed, shivering inside her robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I almost fell asleep I was so relaxed.\" Audrey nodded, her key card beeping as she opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\" Jen asked, sitting down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a little hungry. We could order some room service?\" Audrey suggested, leafing through a menu next to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I'm actually starving.\" Jen agreed, hopping back up and looking at the menu. \"Ooh, ravioli! And lobster bisque.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, everything looks so good.\" Audrey agreed. \"I almost want to order all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen looked pensive, biting her fingernail. \"Well... It is all expenses paid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they resisted ordering everything on the menu, there was definitely more than enough. Shrimp cocktails to start, followed by a sirloin steak each and a split order of chicken ravioli. For dessert, unable to decide, both women got a slice of cheesecake and the Black Forest gateau, with ice-cream on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing the order, they got changed into the comfy silk pyjamas provided by the spa, and selected a film from the pay-per-view. By the end of the meal, they were both practically popping the buttons, their bellies swelling outward as they ate, the movie ignored in favour of the delicious food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some groaning and the occasional burp, Jen and Audrey clambered into their beds, wishing each other a groggy 'good night', and falling asleep practically as soon as the lights went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they slept, the familiar music from the rejuvenation room began to play softly, from the hidden speakers behind the beds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Following the death of her love and king Drogo, the vast majority of the Dothraki tribe abandoned her (as was there nature). What remained was a rag tag group of the sick and weak, mostly women though a few Dothraki warriors remained, their loyalty absolute despite the death of Khal Drogo. The main support she had was from her most trusted advisor Ser Jorah Mormont, who had proved himself time and again even when things appeared hopelessly bleak. But even Ser Jorahs counsel couldn't disguise bleak things were, as now they were wondering alone in the vast deserts of the Red Waste, without food or water. It was at this moment when two of her followers returned to her on horseback, having been sent to scout ahead of any settlements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What news do you have?\" Asked Princess Daenerys Targaryan in the rough tongue of the Dothraki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen\" Replied one, inclining his head slightly \"We found a large walked city... A days walk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys tried to hide her relief at the words, trying to forget that at several points she had thought that they would all perish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sun and stars, this news is most welcome\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is if they allow us entrance Khaleesi\" Said Ser Jorah \"Most cities do not simply open their doors to a tribe of Dothraki\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this Jorah\" Replied Daenerys \"But this is not a normal tribe of Dothraki... For this one is lead by the Mother of Dragons! The rightful ruler of all these lands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Jorah merely smiled, his admiration and love for the beautiful Princess barely in check. It was a hard days ride across the unforgiving desert, but finally the image of a huge walled city became visible on the shimmering horizon. As they drew closer to the magnificent city however, the tribe noticed that their approach had not give unnoticed. A large army of at least a thousand men were stood in front of the walls, ready to meet Daenerys and her Dothraki followers. Daenerys forced herself to show no fear as she and her followers stopped some hundred feet from the intimidating ranks of heavily armoured soldiers, though Ser Jorah certainly seemed tense. In front of the soldiers stood thirteen robed men, who Daenerys note focused her attention on ignoring the army behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Princess Daenerys Stormborn of house Targaryan... Mother of Dragons!\" She said loudly enough for all present to here \"The rightful heir to the throne. I and my people require refuge, and ships to reach Kings Landing. If you provide this you will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I am a member of The Thirteen of Qarth who, together with my other twelve companions govern the grand city you currently stand before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys steeled herself, fully aware that already this man was patronising her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am delighted to meet you.. Spice King, and all of your companions\" She said, choosing her words carefully \"The legend of Qarth is well known, and i would be honoured if you would allow us access to your illustrious city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I have no doubt that you would\" Said the man, his tone infuriating \"But I hope you can understand the reputation of the men you lead is also well known... Why would we allow such men into or home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I lead them\" She replied simply \"My word is iron, and you have my word nothing will become of your city if you accept us inside\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all I have is your word that YOUR word is iron\" Said The Spice King unimpressed by Daenerys claim \"I don't know you. All I know is who your father was... And that is not something which will strengthen your argument or gain you any trust or loyalty here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe band of Dothraki and the young blondes back stiffened noticeably, obviously aware of the disrespect being shown to their leader. They were horrendously outnumbered, but that did not matter to them and this was seemingly picked up by The Spice King who shrank back a little. They were then approached by another member of the thirteen; a tall black man, with an expression that worked against his intimidating stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take responsibility for her\" Said the man simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" The Spice King almost spat \"For her and her band of pillaging Dothraki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Replied the man, removing a large ceremonial dagger from the waistband of his tunic \"You have my word that nothing will become of Qarth while they reside here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then flashed the dagger across his palm, producing a deep cut along it to strengthen his promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" Said The Spice King, clearly unhappy \"But on your head be it. And to you Queen of Dragons I will say, during your stay here you will abide by our rules, and you will sign a contact to the same effect... If you refuse any of our demands and rules you will be cast out... Back to the Red Waste from whence you came\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat little man now stalked away from Daenerys, back to his fellow Thirteen. The dark skinned man now approached Daenerys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Daenerys Stormborn, welcome to Qarth\" He said, his voice deep yet calming \"My name is Xaro Xhoan Daxos\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Asked Daenerys as she walked with Xaro into Qarth, smiling though not hiding her suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you\" He said simply \"I can tell you have something, that is not commonly found in Qarth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys was no fool, she didn't trust the man but without his help she would surely perish on the the desolate plains of the Red Waste. Under Xaro's guidance Daenerys looked over the documents The Thirteen expected her to sign to gain entrance to the city for her people. There was a lot in it which used Quartheen terms and expressions which she was unfamiliar with, so Xaro had to explain them. This was all fine until they reached one paragraph in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does it say?</span></div></div>",

And you will consume whatever you are given, or our deal is over and you will banished from the city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a stunned, uncomfortable silence as Daenerys came to terms with this outrageous request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What madness is this Xaro?\" She demanded finally, her voice shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is... A custom of Qarth I'm afraid\" He answered gravely \"Women who are granted guest rites to our city are ceremonially fattened up, as a sign of the generosity and great wealth of the city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have other women with me\" Growled Daenerys \"Why am I the only one to be subjected to this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically you are the only person to be granted guest rites by us\" He said \"The others are guests of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys turned to Jorah, trying not to show her dismay and panic infront of everybody present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jorah\" She said quietly, her eyes betraying her emotions to him \"This is madness... I cannot agree to this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Khaleesi\" He answered softly \"We need these people and the city for the moment... Any weight you gain here can be lost again, but our losses if we are sent back onto the Red Waste cannot be regained\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves and frustration before picking up the quill to sign the parchment. She knew she had no choice, the needs of her people were too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Said The Spice King, an unpleasant smile on his face \"Welcome to Qarth, Queen of Dragons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the signing, Daenerys band of Dothraki were lead to rooms where they would be staying during their time on Qarth. Jorah remained at Daenerys side and together they took a walk around the grounds near their own personal quarters. The city of Qarth was truly an astonishing place, fully deserving of all the legends and stories Daenerys had heard as a child. Every single structure seemed designed to exemplify the cities enormous wealth, as every building was an example of the highest levels of architecture, scale and grandeur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its quite a city\" Commented Daenerys, playing down her awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is more lavish than anywhere in Westeros, even Kings Landing\" Jorah replied \"With walls to protect them and no other civilisation for hundreds of miles, they have not needed to fight any real wars here... They have just lived off the vast wealth generated at their harbours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked along a path flanked both sides by beautiful plants and trees they were approached by two women, both dressed in very elegant clothing and carrying large wicker baskets. At first Daenerys frowned at them, but then upon seeing food in the baskets they carried she merely sighed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" She said impatiently \"Just get it over with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women bowed their heads before each reaching into their baskets and removing some Qartheen delicacies. Jorah looked embarrassed, clearly unsure of where to look as the women began feeding Daenerys right there. The food was very rich and flavourful, and Daenerys could tell it was most likely rather fattening and made with expensive ingredients. As the womens baskets were emptied Daenerys was surprised just how much they expected her to eat, granted she was rather hungry from wandering the Red Waste, but she was satisfied awhile ago and yet the food kept coming. Finally she chewed and swallowed the last of what the women had, and stifled a small hiccough as she felt her stomach bulge slightly from the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Khaleesi\" Said the women in unison, giving a deep bow before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it Khaleesi?\" Asked Jorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I suppose\" She replied, stifling a burp \"I haven't eaten that well for a long time... I just wonder how often I'm going to be expected to eat like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to wait long for the answer, for as she and Jorah reached the end of the path they were greeted by a tall, olive skinned man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you Khaleesi\" He said opening the lid of a box he carried allowing steam to rise from within \"Specially baked today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys groaned, clearly quite full already but following a look from Jorah she merely sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" She said wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man began piling the sweet tasting selection of delicate pastries into the Princesses mouth, who had no choice but to begrudgingly accept them. Daenerys tiny frame and stature was not used to the sheer volume of food she was already being forced to eat, and she wondered grimly how she was going to make it through one day of it let alone the amount of time it would take to devise the next plan of action for her and her people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that day, after numerous feedings, Daenerys and Jorah were approached again by the Spice King and his ensemble of noble men and women. He was amused at the sight of the once so proud princess stumbling along, her clearly stuffed belly causing her some discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Khaleesi\" He said, making no attempt to hide his wry amusement \"I trust you have been enjoying our, ahem, offerings\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys exchanged a weary, yet venomous look with Jorah who quelled her thoughts with an incline of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" She said through gritted teeth \"Now what is it you want of me? You wish to feed me some more is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, such fire in your belly... You truly are the Queen of Dragons\" Said the Spice King \"As it happens no that was not my intention... Though now you've mentioned it I suppose it couldn't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys cursed her own quick tongue and groaned as, following a nod from the Spice King, several of the entourage approached and a steady stream of food was once again forced past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying\" The Spice King continued, his tone businesslike as Daenerys was fed before him \"I... Or we I should say, would be honoured if you would grace us with your presence at a gathering this eve... It would be in your honour, a fitting welcome to Qarth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmfff\" Replied Daenerys, a slice of cake protruding from her mouth which was promptly pushed in \"Urrrp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a resounding yes to me\" Said the Spice King with a smirk \"We look forward to seeing you... As you were Khaleesi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the end of the meeting, Daenerys feeders hurriedly stuffed as much food as physically possible into the poor blondes mouth. Handful after handful of luxurious, fattening cakes were forced into Daenerys already full belly until the Spice King cleared his throat to get their attention. Rather reluctantly the band of feeders slowly stopped stuffing the poor blonde beauty, though they couldn't help cramming in a last few handfuls first. They then bowed their heads to Daenerys who merely offered a feeble burp, and they scurried away in the Spice Kings wake. Once they were out of sight Daenerys slumped against a wall, slowly sliding down to the floor with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Asked Jorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicccurrrppp!\" Exclaimed Daenerys wearily \"I don't know if I can take this much longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to Khaleesi... Be strong for your people, they need you\" Replied Jorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys rolled her eyes as she stifled a cute hiccough, knowing that Jorah was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later (feeding free hours thankfully) Daenerys and Jorah arrived at the gathering near the luxurious town square of the city. Daenerys had changed from her simple white dress into a very exotic, Quartheen dress provided to her by slave girls who also helped her dress in it. The dress was made of the finest red silk, with a low neckline to enhance the bosom and a leather ribbon tied corset around the middle. The dress also only reached her knees and was very figure hugging, a fact that Daenerys knew was to deliberately expose any weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Mother of Dragons\" Said Xaro warmly \"I am so happy you could attend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really have a choice did I\" Muttered Daenerys grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXaro merely smiled before bowing his head and returned to his own circle of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Khaleesi\" Said Jorah in a low voice \"Do not give them any reason to make things worse for you... We have very little bargaining power at present...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys pouted, knowing Jorah was right but fumed inwardly that there was nothing she could do to change it. Daenerys spent the next ten minutes exchanging pleasantries with the upper echelon of Quarth high society. Everybody seemed pleasant and welcoming enough, though she still noticed a few exchanging quiet comments under their breath, giving her looks up and down to clearly determine if any weight had been gained by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was smiling, though his smile was not welcoming nor reassuring and Daenerys exchanged a cautious look with Jorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are one of The Thirteen\" Said Daenerys slowly \"I recognise you from our arrival here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you may call me Pyat Pree\" Said the man \"I am the city's chief warlock and would like to welcome you on behalf of all the warlocks of Qarth... i would like to extend to you an invitation to join me at the House of the Undying\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys could make see Xaro Xhoan Daxos in the crowd looking over to her, a look of concern on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the very kind offer\" Replied Daenerys carefully \"But perhaps I should get settled here before hand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Khaleesi\" Said Pyat Pree, giving a deep bow with the unsettling smile still on his face \"Some other time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyat Pree wondered into the crowd just as Xaro approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry about that Khaleesi\" He said \"Warlocks still have a presence in our society today... They are a strange folk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well... They aren't the only ones\" Said Daenerys darkly, as she noticed the Spice King approach with his entourage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Khaleesi\" He said \"I am so glad you accepted our invitation... And you wore the outfit we had picked out for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though you say it as though I had a choice\" Daenerys bit back \"I can see why you chose such a tight and revealing garment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes indeed\" Replied the Spice King \"In fact that reminds me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King approached a large ornate bell which had been suspended in the middle of the garden, and Daenerys shared a slightly worried look with Jorah and Xaro. The Spice King rang the bell and the crowds of Qarths high society fell silent. Daenerys awkwardly adjusted her tight fitting dress, as it pinched slightly at her armpits and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noble men and women of Qarth, our guest of honour has arrived in ceremonial dress\" He announced loudly \"And I'm sure you all know what that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd responded with a rather disconcerting roar of excitement, and Daenerys gulped nervously. Jorah had to consciously stop himself from drawing his sword as the large crowd of Qarth dignitaries suddenly swarmed Daenerys, taking her arms and pulling her away excitedly. Daenerys could only splutter indignantly as she was lead to a large golden pair of golden scales, which she had initially assumed was no more than an expensive sculpture. She could now see it was much more than that, as she saw a throne like chair on each scale. One was empty, but the other had another beautiful and elegantly dressed woman sat upon it. Daenerys raised an eyebrow, wondering what on insane spectacle they had prepared for her. The people of Qarth pushed her up a ladder to the top scale, where she sat on the throne. Daenerys looked down at the pretty young thing below her and saw that her \"ceremonial\" dress was even more tight fitting than hers was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\" Announced the Spice King to the rabble \"The pretty little thing on the left has been specially prepared for tonight... So as soon as our 'honoured' guest can get her scale to the ground, the initiation will be over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys stared in horror at this announcement, reading between the lines of The Spice Kings speech. The group formed under ladders which had been set to reach the top of the scale, and upon the Spice King ringing the bell once more they began hurriedly ascending towards Daenerys. Before she could give an angry response a steady stream of familiar exotic, fattening foods found its way pushed past her lips. She could see Jorah trying not to meet her eye, which he probably thought was to save her dignity but it only embarrassed her further. It wasn't long until poor Daenerys could feel the fabric of her short dress begin to feel rather restrictive and uncomfortable over her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jorah turned to the Spice King who was watching on rather smugly, a look that Jorah would really have like to permanently remove from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what your trying to do\" Said Jorah simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Replied The Spice King, not even looking at Jorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no more a Qarth tradition than is juggling manticores\" Said Jorah \"Your trying to break her... But let me just advise you one thing, you will never break her. She will soon sit on the iron throne as she was destined to, and on that day you will regret this little show very dearly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then... Until that day\" Said The Spice King with an incline of the head, clearly amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men watched on in silence as the music played and Daenerys was stuffed silly on the giant scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Qarth had had a merry evening indeed, drinking and dancing the night away while taking their turns to feed the Princess. Daenerys evening had been a lot less enjoyable, as despite the fact she had felt full pretty early on the feeding had not relented whatsoever. Slowly the large ornate scale she was sat upon began to descend, indicating the extra weight that was being forcibly added to her frame beginning to match that of the slave girl on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Called out the Spice King \"Feed her quicker! She's almost reached the ground\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys was just able to give a forlorn look before she was fed even faster than before, with the citizens of Qarth using both hands to stuff as much food into her mouth as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see who cannot be broken\" Said the Spice King quietly to his entourage, smiling as he locked eyes with Daenerys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Urrrrp\" She exclaimed weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys eyes were drooping severally from fatigue at this point, but even so the Spice King could still see a fire there that he had thus far failed to extinguish. Though this displeased him, he was rather pleased to see how tightly fitting the Princesses outfit was becoming, particularly over her bloated belly, as it looked as though the slightest wrong move would pop a seam or two. Finally the scale Daenerys was sat upon reached the floor, though her feeders seemed reluctant to stop and merely carried on piling fattening foods into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has reached the ground\" Growled Jorah \"Your spectacle is over, command your people to stop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King looked outraged at Jorahs tone, but reeled himself in when he saw the look on his face and the Dothraki warriors at his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" Said The Spice King, turning deliberately slowly and clearing his throat before speaking \"Citizens of Qarth... Lend me your ears... I would like to congratulate you all on your commendable job with our honoured guest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah scowled at The Spice King as he spoke deliberately slowly, with a long pause between each sentence. Meanwhile Daenerys feeding continued unabated, as she slumped back in her chair moaning miserably offering the odd feeble hiccup or burp between each mouth full. She could feel the seams begin to slowly pop under her armpits, as her food stuffed belly pushed harder and harder against the restrictive corset of her sexy dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And what's that I hear?\" Continued The Spice King slowly \"The popping of seams? What a great compliment from the Mother of Dragons for your efforts! You have stuffed her so full of food that her Quartheen garments can no longer contain her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that poor Daenerys let out a rather large burp after swallowing a particularly large mouthful of sweet pastries, and a few of the ribbon ties on her corset popped open allowing her insanely bloated belly room to expand outward. Despite the fact Daenerys clothes were literally bursting at the seams trying to contain her the feeding team didn't miss a beat and the veritable avalanche of food continually poured past her weary lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End this now\" Growled Jorah, his tone even more deadly than before \"Or I will end you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King scoffed at the threat, turning his gaze from the neverending feeding to face Jorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you draw your sword you, along with all your followers will be killed\" Said The Spice King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so\" Replied Jorah almost casually \"But that won't be any concern of yours... Just imagine what I will be able to do to you before then... I guarantee you, you will not enjoy it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorahs gaze was intense, the murder in his eyes plain to see and The Spice King shrank from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My people\" He hastily called out \"I hereby announce the end of the ceremony. I think our special guest has, ahem, eaten her fair share!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed amongst themselves at this understatement, as the Princess had consumed so much she looked as though she were in the final trimester of pregnancy. The feeding now slowed, before stopping altogether, though even then a few citizens couldn't resist piling in a last few handfuls of food. When they were done a few of the men moved the ladder over to the slave girl, who had been patiently waiting the whole time. While she was helped down The Spice King smiled, as despite Jorahs threats he was determined to remain in charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a special thank you to our, heh, human weight\" He said \"Tell us all my dear, how much do you weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"140 pounds or so\" She answered, seemingly not at all embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, so there we have it\" Said The Spice King, turning a maddening smile on Jorah and the rest of Daenerys Dothraki entourage \"The Princess now has a new weight, that being somewhere north of 140 pounds\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be exact Daenerys now weighed 145 pounds which, considering that the petite princess had only weighed around 125 on her arrival, was a rather impressive gain to say the least. As the feeding team disbanded Daenerys merely sat slumped in her chair breathing heavily, seemingly barely conscious at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may use this if you want to get her back to her quarters\" Said The Spice King to Jorah with wry amusement \"Have a pleasant evening\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice Kings entourage placed something that resembled a stretcher before Jorah, though in typical Quartheen style it was a very lavish and elegant example of one. Jorah scowled as The Spice King left, and the rest of the Quartheen high society followed in his wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daenerys slept soundly that night, despite the seemingly inescapable predicament she found herself in. This was of course attributed to the sheet amount that she had consumed that evening, as she had dozed when Jorah and one of her Dothraki guard had stretchered her back to her personal quarters. Daenerys was allowed her own personal guard on the entrance to her quarters, but though they were an effective deterrent to any would be assassin, they were not able to stop visiters sent by any of The Thirteen. That morning she awoke to the noise of the door to her quarters being opened, and she sat up wiping the sleep from her eyes as she got her bearings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Khaleesi\" Said the head of a group of female servants who had just entered \"I hope you have slept well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As well as can be expected\" Said Daenerys testilly, rolling her eyes when she noticed a large food laden cart which was being pulled behind the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Thirteen have had us prepare breakfast for you\" Explained the woman, noticing Daenerys gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How very kind\" Said Daenerys hollowly \"If you leave it here I will get round to eating it shortly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost laughed at her own promise, knowing full well it would not be so simple to get out of another feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately Khaleesi...\" Said The woman awkwardly, confirming what Daenerys already knew \"The Thirteen council were quite... Specific. They wish us to feed you this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys sighed, feeling how her midsection felt a little tight in her silk sleeping attire, as it bunched uncomfortably around her stomach when she sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" Said Daenerys \"Just get it over with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other servant girls didn't seem to speak english but following a nod from the head servant they eagerly pulled the food laden cart over to Daenerys bed side. In a manner that she was becoming accustomed to, Daenerys was now eagerly fed her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of constant feeding, Daenerys groggily emerged from her chamber clutching her food stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Khaleesi\" Said Jorah, trying to avoid make Daenerys feel self conscious by not acknowledging the large breakfast feeding she'd just had \"Our presence is requested at the main council Hall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp\" Exclaimed Daenerys suddenly, causing her to blush from embarrassment \"Um, excuse me... Let's see what they want now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys made her way to the grand Hall, where The Thirteen met to discuss the business of Qarth accompanied by her small band of nomadic body guards and Jorah. She was feeling rather ungraceful and heavy after her excessive breakfast feeding, and was hoping that the walk to the hall would be feeding free. It didn't take long however before she had walked past some Qarth citizens, who gleefully piled food into her mouth without warning. It seemed every person they passed had something to feed poor Daenerys, which could probably be attributed to the fact that all the citizens of Qarth now carried food on them at all times, just in case they crossed paths with the Princess. By the time she reached the hall Daenerys has crossed paths with more eager citizens than she could count, and upon reaching the grand oak doors of the building she was being supported by Jorah as she was too stuffed to walk unaided. The poor Princess was doubled over and groaning, holding her taut stomach that was obviously bulging against her usual white dress (which was usually quite loose fitting). The Thirteen were all sat around a large table waiting for Daenerys to join them. Upon entering the young beauty gave a respectable show of strength by standing straight, her head held high doing her upmost to show no weakness in front of The Thirteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wished to -hic- see me?\" Said Daenerys, her tone defiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Khaleesi\" Said The Spice King with mock concern \"Are you with child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys flushed red as there were a few chuckles in the room from the obvious jab at her food stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" She growled \"You know very well why I look the way I do, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course how could I be so forgetful\" He replied, still smiling his maddening smile \"Well it appears you've gained a few extra pounds there since only last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys gritted her teeth, not wanting to think about this fact (She was now at 153lbs, which wasn't bad for an hours work) as she rearranged her dress that was clinging to her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough\" Yelled Daenerys, getting angry despite trying to remain calm and dignified \"Why am I here? Xaro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys turned to Xaro Xhoan Daxos, knowing she would get nothing but subtle insults from the Spice King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been discussing your request for ships\" He said \"To transport you to Westeros. A decision has been reached, if you would like to hear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is decided? </span></div></div>",

As I'm sure you can appreciate ships are very valuable here, this being one of the oldest and most thriving port cities of this world. So, as you have nothing of any value to us to trade, we have devised another solution. If you wish to have your ships you will need to earn them through a series of trials, each more testing than the last\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many of these trials will involve me being forced fatter and fatter?\" Asked Daenerys derisively, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well\" Said The Spice King carelessly \"Put it this way my 'Queen'... I would be surprised if any ship in our fleet would be capable of carrying you one you've finished... In fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King clicked his fingers and Daenerys groaned before the flow of food was again relentlessly forced past her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as I was saying\" Continued The Spice King as the beautiful princess was force fed \"Your first trial will begin at dusk today... If you want your ships you will be her at that time. Good day Khaleesi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thirteen dispersed and Jorah glared after them while the servants continued to pile food into poor Daenerys mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow your damn masters\" Growled Jorah, causing the servants to jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fed Daenerys even faster now, determined to get as much food into her belly as possible before Jorah forced them to leave. Jorah took a menacing step forward and the servants fled, following their masters from the great Hall. Daenerys let out a weary burp before slumping into a chair, her eyes half closed as she groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may not seem it Khaleesi\" Said Jorah as gentle a tone he could muster \"But your people appreciate and respect all that your going through for them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrp\" Exclaimed Daenerys \"Kind words Ser Jorah... But I don't know how much longer I can take this... I fear I may not be able to complete these trials the Spice King mentioned\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've come this far Khaleesi\" Urged Jorah \"I fear this is the only option we have\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys rolled her eyes, knowing grimly that he spoke the truth but wondering if she was indeed going to be capable of sitting a ship without sinking it after the trials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" She said quietly \"Damn it, I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day Daenerys went into hiding, trying to avoid being force fed for at least a couple of hours before she'd have to face her first trial. On her way back to her quarters however she was accosted several times by citizens who were eager to give her a good stuffing. Jorah had no choice but to allow them to feed her but his menacing demeanor at least meant they didn't stick around for too long. The now 158lb Khaleesi lay on her bed in her private quarters, breathing heavily and feeling like a beached whale after the days feedings. Her full belly was clearly visible under her dress, as the material was clinging to it with a few stress lines stretching across the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have dozed off, as when she opened her eyes next the sun was setting in Qarth. A bell was sounding someway in the distance and once she'd gathered her bearings Daenerys knew it was time to face her first trial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its time Khaleesi\" Said Jorah softly, confirming her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys nodded and rose to a sitting position, noticing how her dress bunched tightly around her middle as she did. She walked to the Great Hall with her small entourage, noticing how no citizens attempted to feed her on the way. At the hall she saw large groups of people, with the Thirteen standing in front expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome\" Said The Spice King, unsurprisingly choosing to be the master of ceremony for the event \"It is time for your first trial... Please approach, alone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah nodded reassuringly to Daenerys who reluctantly stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extend your arms into the air\" Barked the Spice King and Daenerys obeyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few guards now stepped forward, holding what appeared to be steel stocks. This was fastened around her neck and had a long steel bar which spread along her arms and was manacled to her wrists, forcing her arms wide apart and keeping them locked there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your first trial is simple\" Said The Spice King, enjoying the look of fear in the Princess's face \"To demonstrate to us all what you are prepared to do for the good of your people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King nodded at the guards who now pulled a large sheet from a table which had been set up in front of them, underneath which were three gigantic cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key for your restraints is in one of those cakes\" He said simply \"I'm sure you can guess on the method you will need to use to find it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys glared at the Spice King, trying to move her arms but only managing to stagger awkwardly from side to side due to her restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may begin when your ready\" Said The Spice King with a smirk at the look of malice in the beautiful Princess's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, where Daenerys attempted to angle her outstretched hands to grab the cake and failed, she sighed and lowered her face to the first cake. The cakes were almost the same height as she was and she dreaded to think the amount of calories each one contained. Her first bite was careful, as she wanted to maintain whatever little dignity she had left in front of the whispering crowds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its going to take you an awful long time to find the key like that\" Said The Spice King \"And the people here came to see a show...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inclined his head at the guards, who proceeded to roughly push Daenerys face down into the cake. Jorah drew his sword, but the guards responded in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerrff Juwur\" Said Daenerys, barely audible with her face stuffed in the cake, though she also halted him with her outstretched palm \"I cerrn do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith considerable effort Jorah checked his anger and sheathed his sword. All eyes fell from him landed on the princess who began gorging on the cake like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her face had completely disappeared into the crator she'd eaten into the side of the rich chocolate cake, and all that could be heard was muffled grunts and munching from her. The crowds cheered while Jorah and the few Dothraki who had walked to the hall stood awkwardly, not wanting to watch the humiliating spectacle. Daenerys jerked ungracefully from side to side as she tried to angle her face to eat her way through the cake, but the iron stocks made any such dexterity difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mother of Dragons, where's your appetite?\" Asked The Spice King so all the crowd could hear \"Surely you have room in that growing belly of yours to eat faster? It would be nice if we could get this finished before the morning sun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys lifted her face from the cake, showing that her features were covered in icing and her cheeks were bulging like a chipmunks due to the amount of cake she had in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm errting as farsst as I cerrn, ufff\" She grunted before swallowing and returning to the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys desperately used her tongue to search through the moist interior of the cake each time she'd swallowed a bite to see if she had uncovered the key, but was each time left disappointed. More than anything she wanted this humiliating ordeal to end, but she knew the only way to do so was to gorge herself faster so this is what she did. Faster and faster Daenerys ate, her grunts becoming more pig like in the process as she gorged herself on the rich chocolate cake. The cheers from the crowd were muffled inside the soft confines of the cake, which allowed her to focus on stuffing herself as fast as humanly possible. The first cake slowly disappeared into Daernerys tummy which, given the size of the cake was now pushing uncomfortably against her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's one down Mother of Dragons, but alas no key\" Said The Spice King in a maddeningly patronising tone \"Perhaps the second cake will house what you seek, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys had a weary, yet poisonous look on her cake covered face before letting out a cute little burp that she was unable to stifle due to her restraints. With a deep breath she gathered her strength and staggered over to the next cake, plunging her face into the thick frosting to gorge herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a commendable effort (and many taunts from the Spice King), Daenerys reduced the second gigantic cake to mere rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my\" Said The Spice King, who had been quite relentless with his taunts \"I can see now why they call you 'Mother of Dragons'... You look like your carrying a litter of them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Urrrrp\" Exclaimed the exhausted Princess, swaying unsteadily as the crowds laughed openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you waiting for?\" Asked The Spice King impatiently \"You still have no key, so your search continues\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Can't...\" Whispered Daenerys, her hugely bloated stomach emitting some rather unhappy noises \"Too full... Hicc!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King sighed, and if Daenerys had her mind about her she may have been fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not finished I'm afraid\" He said simply \"The people came to see a show and the show is not over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large ornate chair was quickly pulled behind her, causing her to stagger backwards and sit down heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the good people of Qarth help you find the key to your freedom\" He said, gesturing to the eager audience who now descended on Daenerys who groaned miserably in anticipation of what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings quickly became business as usual for Daenerys as the rabble gleefully began to forcefully stuff her face, the difference being that this was probably the fullest the poor girl had felt since beginning her forced weight gain journey in Qarth. Every mouth full that was shoved past her lips was incredibly difficult to swallow, and her eyes watered as the crowd gave her no choice but to do so as they kept piling the cake into her mouth. Being forced into a sitting position meant that her dress, which had already been straining under the pressure of her ever expanding belly, was now stretched skin tight over it with no give left at all. Every mouthful she managed to swallow made her dress just that little bit tighter, and she groaned as her huge dome of a belly was constricted by the tightening fabric. The eager citizens were each using both hands to roughly force as much into her mouth as they could, so much so in fact her eyes bulged with the exertion as she was pushed deep into the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the next hour or so was hard going was a drastic understatement, as despite the fact that the Princess had led a very hard life up to this point the last hour had been gruelling. At the half way point Daenerys dress, which had done a commendable job of keeping her bulk contained thus far, could finally take no more strain and her bloated belly began to tear the seams. Unsurprisingly the Spice King was very happy indeed when he heard the slow ripping noise indicating the Princess's dress giving way to her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk Khaleesi\" He said in his usual tone of deep condescension \"Already bursting from your dress and yet still no key to free you... Oh well, only half left to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were half closed but nevertheless she attempted to shoot him a vicious look. He smiled, unmoved, and merely pushed the cake into her mouth that was petruding from her weary lips. The last half of the cake shared the fate of the first as it to was unceremoniously forced down her throat. Each mouthful meant her belly expanded more which meant the tear in her dress grew as her belly bulged outward. By the time the cake had gone Daenerys was slumped in her chair (or at least as much as her restraints would allow), her breathing labored and her eyes closed. Her spectacular belly, which was now completely on show to all is it had burst completely from her dress and rested on her lap, rose and fell with each breath and gurgled as it digested the huge amount of calorific cake she'd consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\" Said The Spice King as he stood over the bloated, defeated form of Daenerys \"Three cakes down and still no key... Oh, my apologies, I actually had the key all along\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King held up the key for the shackles and Jorah actually growled, his desire to end the fat mans life only intensifying. Daenerys was incapable of giving any other response other than feeble groans and the odd hiccup, in fact it was unlikely that she knew what had happened at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess you've got your freedom, although you didn't earn it\" He continued, sounding displeased as he grabbed an icing piping bag from the table \"The people came for a show and you failed to deliver!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a flash the nozzle of the piping bag was pushed past Daernerys weary lips and soon the thick, sugary icing flooded her mouth. The crowd laughed as the bag was quickly squeezed empty, and it was clear that Daenerys was so exhausted that she barely knew what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Roared Jorah, causing most of the audience to jump \"You've proved whatever point it was that you were trying to prove... Let the Khaleesi be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King was clearly wary of Jorah, as despite being drastically outnumbered he still wasn't sure if his guards could adequately protect him from the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" Said The Spice King, trying not to seem too flustered \"Your precious, fat Khaleesi is free to go... Get her out of my sight, as I frankly sick of looking at her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Spice Kings entourage removed Daenerys restraints, while another brought over the stretcher from her last feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its lucky your such strong men\" Commented the Spice King as the crowd disbanded, he patted her amazing belly \"Your little princess is not so little anymore... Pretty soon nobody will be able to carry her weight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thirteen followed the crowds leaving Daenerys, Jorah and the few remaining Dothraki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrrrrrrrp\" Exclaimed Daenerys, before slumping back into her chair groaning miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daenerys could feel every pound from the previous nights 'activities' when she awoke the next morning, as she actually felt heavier and more sluggish. She had vague memories of being stretchered back to her quarters by Jorah and one of her Dothraki guard (Who had been complaining in Dothraki about carrying her weight) but had succumbed to her immense food coma and fallen asleep. With a grunt of effort Daenerys rose to a seating position and immediately felt her muffin top bulge out into her lap, a feeling that made her sigh sadly. Unsurprisingly the evenings gluttony had had a profound effect on her figure, as she had gained a total of 8 extra pounds in all, putting her at a hefty 166lbs (especially for a woman of her petite size). She was still wearing the tattered remains of her dress from the night before, and she could feel how it tugged and squeezed every bulge of her body uncomfortably. As she was examining her cute pudgy belly (looking mournful as she was able to grab the flab in her hands) her personal servants entered with a few food laden trays, and she immediately knew what would follow. They looked at the Princess quizzically as she felt her exposed, paunchy belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get on with it\" She said moodily, and the servants shrugged and complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys sat sullenly on her bed as she was fed her substantial breakfast, her thoughts on her ever expanding waistline. As she was fed she had another visitor who appeared at the door to her chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings\" Said Xaro, bowing his head in a show of respect which only made Daenerys feel more self conscious as she was stuffed silly by her maids \"My apologies if I am interrupting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys merely shrugged, a sweet pastry poking from her lips which was soon pushed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem\" He said, slightly awkwardly \"I just wanted to make a few things known, as we have not had much time to converse since this all began. It may not seem it but there are those who admire you for what you're doing, you are showing incredible strength to help your people. Not all of the Thirteen agree with The Spice King, in fact some of us deplore his disrespect... Just hang in there, it will not be for that much longer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bowed his head gracefully as he left the room and Daenerys raised an eyebrow as she watched him leave, before several more handfuls of food were forcefully stuffed down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys was in the process of trying on outfits when there was another knock on her door. Try as she might, no matter how much she sucked in her belly and twisted and struggled with the dresses , none of them would fit her new bulky frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" She called, inbetween grunts of effort while trying to pull on a paticularly sexy dress \"I'm not &lt;huff&gt; decent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, we are here on behalf of The Thirteen\" Said the visitor \"I'm afraid I have to collect you immediately, your presence is requested at the Great Hall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not hear me?\" Said Daenerys assertively \"I am not decent, you will have to wait\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry Princess\" Said the visitor sternly \"but The Spice Kings instructions were very clear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Daenerys anger the door opened and in came several guards and servants. Daenerys went maroon in the face from both embarrassment and rage as she stood before them, her underwear completely on show and he fat rolls bulging against and over the skin tight dress she was failing to get on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" She said defiantly, trying not to seem as embarrassed as she was \"As you can see I'm not ready to go anywhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants suddenly set about her, as she tried to bat them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies but we have our orders Princess\" Said the servant who had been speaking earlier \"We will help you get dressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of the group, the dress was slowly pulled on to her thick frame. Daenerys winced as her fat was prodded, squeezed and constricted to allow the skin tight dress to cover her body, and somehow after a lot of elbow grease the group managed to get it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't... Breath\" Whispered Daenerys, grimacing as it felt like she was wearing a boa constrictor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards shamelessly ogled the gorgeous chunky Princess, who was so tightly squeezed into her dress. The dresses low neckline have Daernerys a truly monumental cleavage as her breasts bulged against and above the straining fabric (there were very noticeable stress lines going across her bosom). Her belly looked simply glorious, as it protruded in a perfect fleshy dome against the creaking fabric with her deep naval also clearly visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must come now Princess\" Said the servant urgently \"They are all awaiting your arrival\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff... Fine...\" She said, tugging at the insanely tight dress, trying in vain to stop it uncomfortably squeezing every part of her figure \"Lead the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice Kings entourage left with Daenerys following a long behind them, though she was walking much slower. It was comical to see, as due to the tightness of the dress Daenerys had to adopt a waddling uncoordinated gait, and every step she took was met with a omnivorous creak from the fabric as it threatened to split at the seams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make haste Princess\" Said the servant, trying to hide his impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said that done\" She mumbled as she grabbed at the back of her dress in an attempt to relieve a wedgie on her chubby booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the Great Hall Daenerys saw the Thirteen waiting expectantly (one more so than the rest) for her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings\" Said The Spice King \"We were beginning to fear you were not going to show... It is time for your next trial!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the next trial she must face? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have referred to this as 'The Gauntlet', be at the town square in an hour an it will begin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no further explanation, and the Thirteen left without another word. Daenerys turned to find Jorah standing there, whom she gave a quizzical look perhaps hoping he'd have more information on the vague description she'd just received on her next trial. All Jorah could offer was a bemused shake of the head however, and she merely sighed while absent mindedly rearranging her skin tight dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town square appeared to be even more populated than the City Hall had been the previous evening, proving that the Princess's predicament was becoming more popular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a turn out\" Daenerys muttered to Jorah upon seeing the vast crowds \"How wonderful that so many people want to see me be made to look a gluttonous fool\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put these people from your mind Khaleesi\" Said Jorah quietly \"Keep your mind focused on your goal, this will all be over and forgotten soon enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys gave Jorah an incredulous sideways look, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think our definitions of 'forgotten' are rather different\" She said quietly, pinching the bulge of belly flab she sported to emphasise the damage that had already been done to her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah had no response to this so Daenerys walked on through the crowds with her guard at her back, heading towards the front. She found the Spice King with the rest of the Thirteen, stood on a large stage elevated above the crowds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Mother of Dragons\" Said the Spice King \"To The Gauntlet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards offered a hand from the stage which she took, blushing slightly as the guard seemingly struggled slightly to pull her up. The Gauntlet actually looked a little underwhelming, and she frowned slightly as she looked at the small track with minor obstacles positioned around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your Gauntlet?\" She asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Xaro at the back of the group giving her a warning look as the Spice King smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" He replied \"You sound rather underwhelmed... All you must do is get to the far side and back again to complete this trial\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys felt uneasy at how easy he had made it sound, looking over the course sceptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you could use the workout Khaleesi\" Muttered the Spice King and Daenerys flushed with anger at the jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready\" She said doggedly \"I will make short work of this Gauntlet of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I love the determination\" Said the Spice King \"But there is actually one other part I failed to mention... Look over there my 'Queen'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys clenched her teeth at the mans continued disrespectful tone but nevertheless turned her gaze to the boarders of the Gauntlet where she noticed rows of hooded men standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are those men?\" Asked Daenerys, trying to keep her voice steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warlocks\" Said The Spice King simply \"The need for them is rare in our society other than to perform amusing parlour tricks, but today they will be a very important part of your trial\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys gulped nervously at the sight of the rather sinister hooded figures as she was told to get ready to begin. One of the guards rang a large bell which indicated the beginning of the trial, and Daenerys nervously walked forward. The crowd cheered and roared as the beautiful blonde Princess came to the first obstacle, which was merely a felled tree that she needed to climb over. It was clearly a little difficult for her to get over, as she had to angle her chunky legs awkwardly to avoid splitting a seam on her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Gods this dress is tight\" She grunted as the material dug into every inch of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her peripheral she saw movement and turned to see several of the hooded warlocks moving their arms in an intricate pattern as they muttered incantations. Daenerys gasped as she glanced around and saw many large wicker baskets laid around, which now opened without being touched. Food flew from the baskets, and as Daenerys stared she heard a very clear voice from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run Khaleesi!\" Yelled Jorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need telling twice this as this clearly was no mere parlour trick, so Daenerys picked up her pace as the food began to pile up in seperate piles, each forming a humanoid golum. The chunky Princess was obviously far less athletic than she had been before arriving at Qarth,and this coupled with her constricting dress really made her run more of a fast waddle. The food golums lumbered after her, and it wasn't long until the first one reached her and placed its hand on her shoulder. She turned in shock as the golum grabbed hold of her arms with both hands and loomed over her, it's menacing stature casting a shadow over the trembling Princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unhand me!\" She said shrilly \"Nooomrrrrff!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food golum now forced itself past her lips, forcing her to chew and swallow as its food mass flooded her mouth. Daenerys struggled and squirmed but it was no use, the food golum was determined to commit suicide down her throat and that's precisely what it did. Daenerys went limp as she was stuffed, the golum the only thing holding her upright until finally most of its structure was in her bloated belly and she slumped to her knees as the final parts of it forced its way into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" She groaned as she staggered back to her feet \"Hiccurrrp!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Jorah roaring more instructions at her, but the crowds were so loud at this point he was drowned out. It was obvious what he was saying however as the group of shambling food golums approached her, so she shook out the cobwebs and made haste as best she could. She could feel her body bounce and jiggle with each hurried step and could hear the seams of her dress creak ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff puff, damn this flab\" She said as she waddled along only to be stopped again by two golums this time \"No no wait!! Not againnnmmmrrfff!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark magic animated food again stuffed itself down her throat, though now at double the speed. Jorah groaned at the sight of the further public humiliation as Daenerys was forced to eat more and more, every bite threatening to split her skin tight dress. After a couple of minutes of frantic stuffing the crowds (especially the Spice King) prayers were answered, and a ripping sound was heard indicating the seams splitting under her arm pits. The tear grew in length and width as Daenerys was stuffed silly, and when it was finally over her chubby pale flesh could clearly be seen bulging through the holes. With a grunt she again hoisted herself to her feet and headed to the next obstacle which was a wall with a hole large enough for somebody to squeeze through (though if her girth would fit remained to be seen). She hobbled awkwardly over the wall feeling her body fat ripple and tear the seams of her dress even more every time she moved too vigorously. Upon reaching the hole Daenerys knelt down quickly and attempted to squeeze through, however upon doing so she felt her dress rip along her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" She swore, before feeling something grip her ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor stuffed Daenerys was pulled back from the wall and found the remaining food golums looming over her menacingly. She gulped nervously just before the first golum bent down and forced its way past her lips. Meanwhile The Spice King lent his head to Jorah to comment on the spectacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its almost as though she wants to be caught and fed\" He said quietly \"Do you think it possible that your Queen has given in to her own gluttony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen has never given in to anything, that is why she is my Queen\" Said Jorah curtly \"You will never break her, no matter what sick trial you force her to undertake. She will beat you every time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King smirked as he watched Daenerys being stuffed silly, her pale flesh bulging obviously through the tears in her skin tight dress. When she'd finished the first golum she scrabbled to get away, crawling on her hands and knees toward the hole in the wall and attempted to climb through. She managed to get half way when suddenly she felt her belly and ass jam and keep her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daenerys grunted as she struggled, trying to force her girth through the hole which has trapped her. It was no use, she could feel a pretty significant bulge of flab on her body either side of the hole, which had wedged her in place. As she squirmed and the crowds laughed and jeered Daenerys looked up just on time to see the remaining food golums looming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" She said fearfully \"...Shit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeding she now endured was perhaps the most extreme and merciless that she had experienced since her arrival in Qarth; which was saying something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrrfffmunchmunchmunch!!! Urrrrppp!!\" She exclaimed \"Uhhh... No more pleaseurrrrfff!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the jeering crowds ebbed away, as Daenerys became focused on being fed and nothing else. She soon lost track of time as the never ending avalanche of food piled past her lips and into her ever expanding belly. All she was aware of was having to constantly chew and swallow, and the increasing pressure around her midsection as it bulged against the hole she was jammed into, increasing her muffin top either side of it. She groaned vaguely as the discomfort increased around her stuffed middle, but was too weak to do anything but be fed like a pig. She had no idea how much time had passed when her surroundings returned to her, which they did when a harsh cracking sound rang in her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Force your way out Khaleesi!\" Roared Jorah from the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys realized her bulging belly and hips were having an impact on the structural stability of her wooden prison, as it was beginning to crack from the pressure. Seizing her chance, despite the food continuing to pile into her mouth which she continued to chew and swallow, Daenerys squirmed and twisted her flabby body against the weakening wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrppp!!! Come onmrrrfff!!\" Daenerys grunted through mouthfuls of fattening foods as she jostled her body in an attempt to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach swift jerk was rewarded with a loud creak or a crack, but also caused her fat belly, ass and breasts to wobble much to the amusement of the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccc!! That's it... Mrrrrfff\" Daenerys Mumbled to herself, feeling the pressure ease from around her middle, until finally.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKURAAAACKKK!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesshhhmmmrfff\" Cheered Daenerys, her open mouth only inviting more food to be crammed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith considerable difficulty, due to the fact she was so full and still being fed, Daenerys rose to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh!! Stop iturrrrf!\" She said in exasperation as the food golems fed her unabated and she tried to fight her way past them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys managed to break free of the lumbering food golems and passed by them, moving with an awkward, quite comical fast waddle due to her food stuffed belly and skin tight clothing. She could feel the seams continue to strain and pop against her ever increasing girth, but she tried to ignore how much of her pale flesh was on show to the audience and tried to focus on the trial at hand. Jorah roared encouragement, the polar opposite to the jeers coming from the rest of the audience, as Daenerys pushed forward to the next obstacle. Blocking her path was a high wall, with a large door built into it which appeared to be the only way through. Daenerys cursed to herself, inbetween labored huffs and puffs, turning as she ran to see the proximity of her food based pursuers. The golums were not fast movers but in her current state neither was she, and they so they were easily keeping up with her. In front of the door was a metal pressure pad, which she immediately identified as the means for opening the door, so with a grunt of exertion (and the pop of another seam) she launched herself upon it and the door opened. She stepped off the plate and entered the open doorway, as soon as she did so the door slammed behind her blocking the remaining food golums from reaching her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff... Hiccc..\" She wheezed, doubled over from the exhaustion of running (or fast waddling) such a short distance \"Thank the Gods thats over... Urrrp\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys now, for better or worse, had a chance to examine the new damage that had been done to her figure and suffice to say she did not like what she saw. When she looked down all she saw was the pale flesh of her impressive rack, noticing how her dress was torn down her cleavage further enhancing the effect. This she didn't mind too much, as she thought it would go someway to seducing men if she required it. She sighed however as she felt at the spare tire she now carried around her midriff, a substantial amount of which was on display as it bulged through various rips and tears in her skin tight dress. Her hands found their way past her thicker waist to her ass which bulged out prominently behind her, also visible through a rather large rip along the middle of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qarth will burn for this\" She muttered grimly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up ahead to see an identical high wall with a door built into it, and saw another pressure pad infront of the door. Instinctively she stood on the pad and was rewarded with the door opening, though she slightly perplexed at how easy the Gauntlet had gotten. This same pattern was repeated several more times until she was faced with a door which would not open. She tried jumping up and down on the pressure pad, but was only rewarded with the rips in her dress growing in size from her jiggling flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graddakh!\" She cursed in Dothraki<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she noticed a large cup of golden liquid in a cup holder set into the wall by the door. There was nothing else of any interest around her, so Daenerys figured this to be the solution to getting through the door. She didn't trust it one bit, and as she looked up she clearly saw the Spice King staring down at her behind a group of sorcerers, an unpleasant smile on his face. With a look of defiance Daenerys grabbed the cup and drank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daenerys stood defiant under the scornful gazes around her, trying to calm her breathing and hide the stitch she felt from the exertion. The Spice King glared at her and she glared back, trying to show her strength and prove herself as the rightful Queen of Westeros. As she stood panting, she began to feel a strange sensation growing within her. It began as a warmth in her chubby belly, and grew to a warmth in her loins which made her cheeks grow pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what... Ooo, oh no... Uhnn\" She began to moan, trying as best she could to not let on that there was a storm building in her loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Mother of Dragons?\" The Spice King called down snidely \"You don't look so good heh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys was swaying from the incredibly sexual feelings which were overcoming her, her eyes rolling slightly and going in and out of focus as each wave broke against her nether regions. She was becoming more and more aware of her body, feeling every extra pound that had been forced on her once slender frame. She could feel how her flab bulged uncomfortably against her skin tight dress, and how in some places it bulged through tears in the fabric. She bit her lip moaning sexually as she began to fondle herself, loving the feeling of her own soft cushiony flesh. Just then her stomach began to grumble, which was very odd considering how much she'd eaten already. This sensation was odd indeed, as it couldn't exactly be described as hunger as she still felt quite full, but it was more a desire... A desire to eat and demean herself. Clearly sensing this the Spice King nodded to his cohorts who now lowered large wooden buckets on ropes which were filled with food down to the gluttonous princess. She tried to fight the urge, she really did, but within moments Daenerys had fallen upon the food like a wild animal. Jorah face palmed at his queens lack of decorum as she used both hands to shovel the food into her drooling mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"grunt! huff! Mrrrf !!\" She moaned \"Can't... Muurrefff... Eat fast enoughshh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No khaleesi\" muttered Jorah, almost pleadingly seeing for the first time his vision of his queen crumble \"Stay strong... Don't do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmmshh munchmunchmunch!! Urrrrp!!!\" Exclaimed Daenerys between mouthfuls of food  \"For the love of fuck -hicc!!!- will somebody come feed me like the fat -urrrrp!!!- slut I am?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed while Jorah grimaced and The Spice King nodded to his entourage. Ladders were lowered down the wall and soon citizens were scrambling down, eager to oblige the gluttonous beauty. Daenerys watched the mob approach her as the powerful sexual feelings overpowered her senses and she bit her lip as she moaned in anticipation. As the first pastry was gleefully pushed past her lips her hand dropped down her waist and found its way up her tight skirt to her aching loins. The spice King was nudged by one of his cohorts to draw his attention to this interesting development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" He murmured \"If all goes to plan, our dear guest will never leave Qarth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daenerys was fed by the rowdy crowd, who did so roughly while jeering and mocking her, she began to finger herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesshhmrrff\" She murmured as she played with herself in front of everybody \"Stuff my fat face Glmpphhh!!! Urrrrp!!! Make me the fattest slut in all of Qarth mrrrrff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming more and more obvious that Daenerys self deprecating wish was becoming a reality, as more seams were popped in her dress every minute she was fed. While she strummed away at her clit, becoming moist as the depraved sexual feelings grew in intensity, she used her other hand to explore the dimensions of her ever growing body. Her dress, which was really more skin tight rags at this point, was barely covering her bulging flab and she loved the feeling of the soft flesh. She was approaching 180 pounds and she could feel every pound of it, and yearned for more. She wanted nothing more than to grow into an immobile blob of fat, to be humiliated and tormented and fed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daenerys lost herself for awhile as she focused on nothing more than her depraved gluttony. The constant flow of food that The Spice Kings minions were piling down her throat never missed a beat, so all she focused on was chewing and swallowing. She moaned and babbled as she felt her swelling, flabby frame test the dexterity of her dress, and each time a seam popped open against her girth she felt a jolt of pleasure deep in her loins. The aspiring Queen of Westeros was furiously fingering herself at this point, while her free hand explored her curves and bulges. Her exposed blubbery flesh rolls jiggled as she masturbated, humiliating herself in front if everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMllrrfflurrrp!! Uhnnnn ohh ohhh-mrrrfff!-\u201c She babbled between each mouthful, her breathing fast and sharp as she approached an orgasm \u201cOhhh shh.. shhittt.. Mrrrfff!! Munch munch! Urppp!! Fuckkk... hiccc!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes rolled back in her head as ahe whimpered, her vision blurring as she continued to finger herself and have her face stuffed roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Queen of Westeros\u201d Said The Spice King with savage sarcasm \u201cTell me... Would you still follow this fat slut?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah firmed his jaw and grinded his teeth, trying to keep his hand from his sword. He didnt want to admit it to himself, but he was beginning to doubt he knew the answer anymore<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\u201cMurrrfff!!! Yeshhhurrrp!! Oh yesss!!\u201d Daenerys wailed \u201cOhhhhmrrrfff!!! GODD!! FUCCCKKUHRRRRPPP!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrill wail ending in an almighty burp, the Queen of Dragons climaxed in front of all the citizens of Qarth. The orgasm was so powerful that her body twitched crazily and she collapsed into the Spice Kings entourage, her ability to stand being lost. The group held the gorgeous chubby blonde almost horizontally (it was clearly not so easy to hold her weight at this point) and the poor girl looked barely conscious as the mind melting orgasm robbed her of all her remaining strength. Despite this however the feeding did not cease, and the group continued to cram food down her throat. A few more seams in her dress popped open below her armpits, which caused a split to grow down each side as her pale flesh bulged through and her gut swelled outward. Suddenly the final door of the trial creaked open, signalling its end. Poor Daenerys didnt even seem to notice this as her eyes were fully closed and was being held up by The Spice Kings cohorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Khaleesi\u201d Muttered Jorah, almost pleadingly \u201cJust exit the trial\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys had several pastries comically sticking from her drooling mouth, which the Spice Kings minions gleefully forced in, followed by several others. After several more handfuls of pastries were forced down her throat (which caused her glorious swelling gut to cause further tears in her tattered, skin tight outfit) a large funnel was forced past her lips and large ornate jugs filled with rich fattening liquids were dumped down it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhglugluglugurrrpppp!!! Gluglugluglugg!!\u201d Daenerys mumbled weakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave her be!!\u201d Roared Jorah \u201cThe trial is over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King gave a signal for the feeding to stop (though there a good ten seconds between the signal and the feeding to end. The funnel was pulled from the exhausted fat girls mouth and the feeders let go of her, allowing her to fall to her knees. The last few strands of fabric which held her insanely tight dress over her bulbous form finally tore apart from the movement, and the tattered garb fell from her body leaving her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...\u201d She groaned on hands and knees, her impressive pale gut nearly touching the floor \u201cUhhrraaapppp!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Khaleesi!\u201d Called down The Spice King \u201cThe trial, and indeed this whole ordeal, will end when you walk through that door\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt of effort Daenerys managed to push herself up into a seating position, panting heavily. She pulled a rogue strand of her gorgeous, yet dishevelled, blonde hair from her face and looked up at the Spice King and the other citizens of Qarth. The Mother of Dragons days of being merely chubby were long gone, as now she was certainly fat now. Peaking at 185 pounds, and being completely naked, her body was covered in layers of flab. Her gut rested atop her thick thighs, with gorgeous juicy love handles and smaller ripples of fat above it to just below her titanic tits. Her face was also looking much softer than before, with fuller cheeks and a cute little double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will it be Khaleesi, hmm?\u201d Said The Spice King \u201cWill you end the trial and leave Qarth with your people? Or... Stay here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were returning to her now, and she thought about the choice which had been presented to her. It should have been a no brainer, but the intense aphrodisiac was clouding her judgement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes stared vacantly, her hands running rapaciously over her quivering mounds of flesh, her mind too consumed by lust to even consider doing anything at the moment. Her body took one, two, three feeble steps forward, and then she tumbled down onto her knees, making her rolls ripple until they settled a moment later. One hand was stroking the tip of her teat, while the other had wormed its way under her gut and vigorously probed her womanhood a second time. Her guttural moans of pleasure were soon joined by jeers and laughter by the crowd surrounding her, and the Spice King was counted among the heartiest partakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Jorah stood there, his hand inching closer and closer to the sword at his side. A Qartheen blade, lighter than what he was used to, but it would make the fat bastard bleed all the same. A low growl grew in the back of his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Ser Jorah,\" the Spice King tutted, \"this is no time for violence. After all, it would be hardly sporting to refute your queen's decision...\" A wicked smile appeared on his face and grew wider with every passing second. \"...which it seems will be quite soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a brief second of deliberation, Ser Jorah shoved aside the fat spicer and leaped down from the Thirteen's stage to the ground. As he strode forward, the smiles died and the crowd parted, the air now only being filled with the sound of a girl's moans and an ever-so-faint squishing sound. Oblivious to the knight heading towards her, Daenerys yelled out, \"I've - oh, <i>gods</i> - made my decision! I wa<i>aaAAAAAHh</i> - I want to st-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish the words that Jorah was afraid of, he quickly scooped her up (a feat easier said than done) and carried her over his shoulder through the door. A loud uproar erupted from the approximate location of the Spice King's chair. Jorah barked back, \"You said she had to pass through the door, not that she had to do it alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the disgruntled merchant-king replied, \"On behalf of the Thirteen and the Pureborn of Qarth, I hereby declare Daenerys Targaryen to have passed the trial! You shall be provided with three ships, fully stocked and crewed, by noon tomorrow. Any longer and our most generous offer will be rescinded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA team of Qartheen servants arrived with a litter, and Ser Jorah gingerly loaded his princess in before climbing in himself and drawing the curtains. Slowly, his Khaleesi became cognizant of her surroundings, looking at him with a renewed clarity in her eyes. \"Ser Jorah...\" she whispered, leaning in. As soon as that moment of lucidity had come, it had gone, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys leaned forward, her paunch settling on his lap, and started unbuttoning his shirt. The knight tried to squirm away, but a part of him was refusing to move. \"Oh, <i>Jorah</i>,\" she moaned, a somewhat-sticky hand reaching between his legs, \"you're ever so faithful. You deserve a reward.\" Her breasts, pale as alabaster and lined with pink stretch marks, now brushed the hairs of his exposed chest. \"I need a man to follow me. I need a man to feed me.\" Daenerys's hand suddenly reached down and seized his manhood, growing hard as she held it. \"I need a man to <i>fuck me</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

He embraced his fat queen in a passionate kiss and soon his hands reached her plump breasts and they embraced each other. The cohort of Qartheen servants grimaced as they carried the litter, as it began rock and gyrate violently from Daenerys and Jorahs ever increasing passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had hastily retired to Daenerys room, as the servants desperately gazed at the floor to avoid watching the fornicating duo. The passionate pair fell upon Daenerys soft bed, the sudden force buckling the bed and caused what was left of her skin tight garment to tear completely to shreds as her fat rolls bounced and jiggled violently. Jorah had never been overly attracted to larger women, but there was just something about how Daenerys carried this extra weight that he found so sexy. He\u2019d been so used to her tiny, perfectly slim frame that when she had begun her forced weight gain ordeal he couldn\u2019t imagine what she would look like as the weight piled on. But as he felt up her 185 pound body, he felt more turned on than he could ever remember. The petite Targariyan now had such gorgeous curves, though a substantial amount of the weight had accumulated at her midsection, her breasts, ass and thighs had also recieved generous amounts of luscious padding. Her belly was now a gut, with glorious love handles which Jorah was grasping to thrust deeper into her, each pelvic thrust causing a vast jiggling all over her soft, buxom frame. Her gorgeous plump tits in particular wobbled right in Jorahs face, so he buried his face in and kissed and licked her erect nipples. The bed creaked loudly, not used to the large weight which gyrated on top of it and the room was filled with the sounds of Daenerys squeals and wails of pleasure. Jorah was sure the servants outside could here them but he cared not, and continued to plough his fat queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh.... Unhhhhhhh\u201d Cried Daenerys, her lip quivering and her eyes rolling as she touched on the brink of orgasm \u201cYess... Fuck me, ohhhh! Harder... Ill be your fat... urrrhnnn... slut forever.... Im a worthless fat.... bitchhh... ohhhh!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe self deprecation only spurred Jorah on, though soon the connotation of those words would bring him turmoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost two hours of none stop, frantic sex, Daenerys reached a fourth screaming orgasm (her cries possibly echoing throughout Qarth at this point) and the two lay panting next to each other. Jorah had thought Daenerys sexual appetite was completely insatiable, but the fourth orgasm seemed to appease her for now. Soon she was asleep, leaving Jorah alone with his thoughts. He was actually impressed with his own endurance during the long live making session, as he was not a young man anymore, but he attributed this to his lust of the chunky blonde Khaleesi. He watched her bulging bosom rise and fall with each breath as she slept, her fuller face looking more at peace than he\u2019d perhaps ever seen her. His thoughts strayed as he watched her sleep, to her self deprecating sex talk where she constantly referred to herself as a worthless fat slob, a greedy slut whose only purpose was to forced ever fatter, fucked and humiliated for the rest of her life. He was worried that if he didn\u2019t get her away from this place she would never get close to taking the iron throne. He realized he had to choose between his own lust, and what was best for Westeros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Daenerys and Jorah packed what few possessions they had in preparation for leaving Qarth. Daenerys was provided another Qartheen dress, which was in a larger size than the one she had burst out of yesterday, but was even so was extremely tight and clung tightly to every bulge of her much thicker frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to leave Khaleesi?\u201d Asked Jorah as Daenerys tugged at the uncomfortably tight garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have never been more ready to leave somewhere in my life\u201d She said and Jorah chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the fat Khaleesis usual entourage on \u2018helpers\u2019 entered, each carrying their usual wicker baskets filled with fattening treats for her. Daenerys sighed, the rare brevity being extinguished immediately as the feeding began anew. Daenerys was led through the city, being stuffed full if food as she went, until she reached the grand docks where her boat awaited. Each mouthful of food she was forced to consume caused a pang of the same, now familiar, sexual feelings within her which she tried to ignore, focused instead of leaving this wretched place. The Spice King was of course already present, and he cleared his throat to silence the whispering crowds which had formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome one and all, to what I fear is a sad day for this fine city\u201d He said \u201cAs this is the day that the... ahem... Mother of Dragons leaves us, to begin her journey into Westeros. I know you all will miss seeing her daily humiliations and watching her grow fatter and fatter until she weighs as much as a dragon herself...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys looked sullen at this jab at her spiralling weight gain, and felt a seam pop open in her dress as she swallowed a particularly hefty mouthful of fattening Qartheen confectionary\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut at any rate, we will be bidding this fat slut fair well\u201d He continued \u201cThat is of course unless she\u2019d rather stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blunt insult coupled with her public feeding session sent a tingle of pleasure through her body, making her cheeks pinken and lip quiver. The Spice King smirked, clearly knowing what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat say you hmm?\u201d He asked \u201cYou may take this boat and leave Qarth right now... but if you do that, you will miss out on a very special event we have planned for today\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet on the boat Khaleesi\u201d Said Jorah as another seam popped in her skin tight garment and he saw her becoming overpowered with the sexual feelings again \u201cYou must leave this place... you must fulfil your destiny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King clapped his hands to signal his helpers to cease feeding the poor girl long enough to allow her to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well??\" He repeated \"Answer me you disgusting fat glutton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiccurrrrp!!\" Exclaimed Daenerys, the sudden exertion causing her many bulges and fat folds to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... Hiccc!\" She responded weakly, the unwanted sexual feelings beginning to cloud her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit it out you fat cow!\" Yelled the Spice King, smirking as he saw his harsh words cause the fat humiliated blonde to quiver with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah had gone very quiet as he saw his Queen trying to fight the fact she was getting hornier by the second. He knew leaving Qarth would undoutably be the best course of action for her, but as he stared at his fat gorgeous Queen, he began to think it would not be the best thing for him. He knew it was beyond selfish and perhaps quite trecherous, but he just wasn't ready to let go of the dark fantasy he now found himself in. Daenerys turned to him, her face flushing from the increasingly intense sexual feelings that were swelling inside of her the more she was humiliated, and fixed him with a pleadingful rather pathetic gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jor... Jorah... ooohh.. Urppp! Pluh... Please.... uhnnn\" She stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah swallowed hard before he spoke, knowing what he was about to do would doom her to a life time of obesity and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" He began, finding it very difficult to find the words \"Are a too much of a fat bitch to ever be Queen, you disgusting fat whore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys looked like she'd been struck, Jorahs betrayel truely hurting her. But soon this look ebbed away, as she lost control of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnn... Nooo... ohhh, fuhhh fuckk!\" She whimpered \"You know... what... ohh Goddd! This does to mee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip and her eyes rolled back into her head. Jorah took a deep breath and grabbed her hand, forcing it downstairs and rubbing it on her aching loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never be anything more than a fucking fat worthless cunt\" He spat, as Daenerys began to strum away at her clit without needing Jorahs assistance \"Give that man your answer you disgusting fat pig bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh... Fuckkkk yeahhh... I.... Uhnnnn... Waaaant to stayyy\" Wailed Daenerys as she fingered herself in front of everybody \"I want you to fatten me up... uhnnn... past fucking obesityyy.... Make me so fuhhh.. fucking fat I cannot moveee... Ohhhh Godddd!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\" Said the Spice King \"As you wish... Let the games begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somewhere deep inside of her Daenerys screamed, as she was desperate to leave this place and her never ending torment behind, but her dark sexual desires controlled and betrayed her. Daenerys was lead away from the docks and her salvation,  back towards the town square and her misery. A steady stream of food and cruel insults continued to keep the chunky princess a slave to her desires, as she was lead over the crest of a hill. Once at its peak Jordan stopped dead in his tracks, clearly awestruck at what he saw. Set up in the town centre was a gigantic, complex set of wooden slides and pools, and it's Shere scale and complexity lead Jorah to wander how many slaves it had taken to construct. Each slide descended into its own pool, which in turn lead to the next slide. The rows of interlinked slides and pools lead to a much larger pool at the bottom and it was hear Jorah noticed that it did not contain water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you really banked on her failure\" Said Jorah to the Spice King, realising he felt less anger towards the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh yes well it seems I know your queen better than she knows herself\" Said the Spice King \"Isn't that right you fat lump?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis insult was followed by a swift boot in her chunky rear end sending the fat blonde stumbling forward into a barrage of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mlrrrf Uhnnn...\" She moaned through a hefty mouthful, the mistreatment causing her to reach her hand between her thickening thunder thighs to pleasure herself \"brrarrrp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King eyed Jorah carefully, clearly testing to see what his reaction to such disrespect of his queen would be. As it turned out he was a man who possessed an exceptional judge of character, as Jorah merely continued as though nothing had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the liquid in the slides and pools?\" He asked conversationally \"It clearly isn't water\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A concoction of the finest, and most fattening ingrediants Quarth has to offer\" He responded smugly \"Along with a generous helping of our very special, aphrodisiac elixir... to keep our dear piglet princess focused on the task at hand\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah nodded as he watched Daenerys stumble along ahead, her skin tight dress barely containing her impressive growing booty. Once at the foot of the complex series of slides and pools, a leather harness was fitted on her shoulders, which connected to a saddle on her back. This was pulled tighter so that it squashed into her soft body, with bulges of flab almost engulfing the straps. A handle on the back of the saddle, which ended in a rather phallic shape, was pulled down behind her as ropes were attached to her shoulder straps. Jorah was beckoned over by the Spice Kings cohorts, and he was instructed to make good use of the phallic end of her harness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy... you fat slut\" He Growled into her ear, causing Daenerys to quiver and bite her lip just as he pushed the dildo deep into her aching loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhnnn\" She moaned as everybody laughed, and she was lifted by her ropes to the top of the first slide \"Hiccurrp!! Fu... fuckkk... Ooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwaiting her arrival was a teenage boy,  who removed her ropes and shoved the disgraced fat princess down onto her front into the fattening mixture which flowed down the series of slides. He them sat on the saddle secured to her back and pulled on the handle which connected to her sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your mouth you fat slut\" He commanded, continuing to pull the handle which caused the dildo to pump in and out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhnnn! Oohh shu... shittt\" She wailed just as she was shoved off the edge and befan he descent head first down the slide \"Uhnnnglublublublb!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra fattening sex elixir flooded her mouth, cutting off her moans as it cascaded down her throat and it her ever bulging belly. Daenerys gave muffled squeals and moans, as the sex toy was jostled around inside of her, with the river of elixir that was flooding her belly only increasing the animalistic sexual sensations she felt. She soon came to the end of the first slide and splashed into the pool below. Jorah watched on from below as the impatient boy continually wiggled and pulled on the handle connected to the sex toy inside the disgraced Princess, causing her to squeal and moan, in an attempt to manoeuvre her to the next slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you fat bitch! Move your worthless fat arse!\" Yelled the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unhhhhfucckkk!! Glublulblublubbb... Ohh shitttt.... Glublublubblerghhh! URRRPP!! I'm such a worthless fat cunt... unnnnn!\" Babbled the former Princess, feeling the familiar sensation of her tightening clothes slowly giving way against her growing girth, with seams popping open as she moaned from the insatiable feelings of orgasm inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah somehow maintained a calm demeanour as he watched his Queens constant humiliation, hiding his arousal well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will become of us now?\" He asked conversationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice Kings entourage sniggered between themselves as the fat orgasming blonde made her way down the next slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well life will be much simpler I would assume, now this disgraced fat bitch has given up on her dreams of claiming the Iron Throne\" Answered The Spice King \"You and your people will be honoured guests here, living in luxury... While I'm afraid she will live a life of servitude and never ending humiliation... She will be the citys plaything, to use and abuse as we see fit... We will fatten her up beyond obesity and immobility, which I'm sure you will enjoy seeing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah watched the woman he supposedly loved, and had pledged his allegiance to, barrel down the next slide as the Spice Kings wordo sunk in. The disgraced princess's moans, whimpers and loud gulping echoed around the court yard before she uttered an amusingly high pitched, very loud squeal which seemed to indicate that she'd reached a particularly powerful orgasm, before the process began anew inside of her and the next orgasm began to build. As onlookers laughed at her humiliating plight Jorah wondered how much lower his Queen could sink, and if he'd made the right decision by keeping her here....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Spice King waited until the fat Targaryen descended into the final pool with a loud *Splash!*, before turning to Jorah once more with a wry smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me\" He said carefully though still smiling \"But I feel it would be rude of me not to offer you... ahem... a 'Go' on your queen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah looked surprised at the offer, for once his cold demeanor slipping slightly. He didn't answer for a short time, merely watching as the bratty teenager who had ridden Daenerys down the slides continue to be little her, dunking her head under the water and forcing her to drink while simultaneously jostling the sex aide inside her making her cry out inbetween *Glubs*. He could see her pale flesh bulging through holes in her skin tight dress, jiggling as she moaned and cried in uncontrollable sadistic pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... as long as I'm here I suppose\" He said maintaining his demeanor and walked towards his ever expanding queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen was lead away leaving the hefty blonde floating in the pool breathing heavily. She was lifted from the pool once again using the series of leather straps and pullies, though this time it required the aide of an extra person, due to the extra weight she'd gained from her first trip down the slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLURRRARRRP\" She bellowed suddenly which caused a ripple all over her fat body, which in turn caused her bulges of cellulite to pop seams and rip holes all over her skin tight dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Daenerys now weighed in at an even 200 pounds and every single pound of that was incredibly obvious to everyone in the vast audience. Jorah couldn't keep his eyes of her as she glistened in the sun, her large juicy tits jiggling, her fat yet pert ass which was visible through a wide tear in her dress, and her wide luscious belly which split into two juicy fat rolls with luscious love handles. Once the team of rope pulled had managed to hoist the fat blonde to the top of the slides, Jorah was beckoned up. Daenerys, who was groaning in misery and insatiable sexual pleasure, was laid forward on to her fat belly and tits once more, though the sex handle was pulled from inside causing her to squeal and burp. Jorah unsheathed his manhood as he lay on top of her, before forcing it inside of his queen, causing a burble of vague sexual pleasure beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And off we go to fat mess\" He whispered into her ear, feeling her body shudder at his words \"You disgusting fat blob of a whore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Daenerys began her next trip down the slides, with Jorah pumping away at her as she went. The poor blonde only had the vaguest idea of what was happening, as more of the fattening sex potion flooded down her throat, her fat bulges ripping through whatever remained of her skin tight skimpy dress. She had long since lost count of how many orgasms she'd experienced until she reached the bottom pool once again, now completely naked bar a few ripped scraps of fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrrglurrbglubglub...\" She babbled in complete depraved ecstasy \"Ohhh... yesss yesss that's it my love huccurrpp!! Fuck me harder!! I'm such an obese disgusting slob glubglubglubbb!! Urrrp!! Fuck my worthless fat ass!! Unnhhh shiiiittt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time she squealed from the feeling of Jorahs meat deep inside her she gulped down more of the potion, everytime adding yet more girth onto her gloriously fat body. She orgasmed three more times on the way down the complex series of slides, each one more intense than the last, as the whole city of Qarth laughed at her expense. Finally with a huge splash! The engorged Targaryen landed in the final pool, and managed a vague whimper as Jorah pulled himself from her aching loins. Daenerys floated in the pool, her eyes half closed from sheer exhaustion as she stared up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhrblarrrpp!\" She exclaimed wearily, and a ripple was sent through her immense fat rolls \"uhhrr so fatttt....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasnt wrong, as after the last journey down the slide shed packed on an extra 8 pounds, putting her final weight at 208 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear you certainly are\" Said The Spice King with amusement \"In fact that's rather an understatement at this point dont you think? Get the disgusting fat cow out of there, and let's take a closer look at her shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice Kings helpers complied and Daenerys was dragged from the pool, and stood swaying, completely naked and dripping wet from weight potion and her own sexual juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Gods...\" Said Jorah in complete astonishment as he got a side on view of his once so tiny petite queen, her wife soft gut split into several rolls of flab bulging outward and glistening in the sun \"... Surely that's enough for you? She's as large as you are... perhaps more so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice King smirked at Jorahs stab at his own weight problem, having come to terms with it long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... BRAAARRRP!!\" Bellowed Daenerys suddenly, sending a ripple all around her fat body, every bulge of flab jiggling comically as everybody laughed and yelled weight related insults at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the extreme amount of weight she'd been unceremoniously forced to gain since arriving in Qarth, her naked gloriously plump double D tits remained perky and seemingly unfazed by the gravity of their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough? Well let's see...\" Mulled the Spice King as the naked fat blonde stood swaying before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Jorah took it, lowered himself and looked into the eyes of the woman he lusted more than his former wife, lying down in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the face of her former sword and shield so close, Daenerys's lucidity came back for the last time. \"Jorah, why ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that i like more to see you getting fattened than to see you rule\" then he kissed her, in a few seconds the sounds of protest were replaced by moans of pleasure, after a long time he parted from her lips and filled them with the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spice king smiled and opened the faucet, fattening juices poured down from the pool, filling the greedy mouth of the valyrian beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glub, mfff, glub, mfff,\u2026.\" at each swallow drop of creamy potions escaped from Daenerys's lips, forming two flows that descended her cheeks, and a third that dripped from her chins into a small pond in front of her huge tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink!

Drink!\" the people of Qarth cheered her together, finally able to do what they pleased with their favorite sow,<br>\r\na famous courtesan started to massage the hard surface of daenerys's belly softening the solid rock that it had become and allowing her to knead the rolls like bread.

Cersei was elated at what life had become since the passing of her husband and his nosy best friend.  The war raged on, but there was no chance it reached the gates of King's Landing and all the fighting led to an increased need for food in the surrounding cities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing as greedy as she was Cersei saw no reason to share what she felt she deserved with the soldiers and slaves fighting in the war.  In the 6 months that the war had been going on she took every chance she could to greedily stuff herself and make it well known to her servants that she had no intention on sharing.  Unbeknownst to the queen, all this excess food and wine was really doing a bit of damage to her figure.  Without Jaime around to fondle her and tell her what her body looked like she had no other opinions but her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening progressed as usual with a large feast being held in honor of King Joffrey for no reason in particular.  Since feasts were becoming a norm in King's Landing fewer and fewer guests would show up though Cersei was not disappointed at all.  She waved her glass in an attempt to draw attention to herself for a 5th glass of wine.  She stuffed bread and boar and lemon cakes in her mouth like she hadn't eaten in days.  When the feast was coming to an end she heaved herself off her chair with great difficulty from being so full of wine and food.  Hiccuping commands to her servants she then progressed to her chambers for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most nights lately she was completely inebriated and unable to comprehend the conversations around her as she was helped to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... the queen is resembling her late husband more and more these days\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our queen is the sole reason hunger hits so hard in the poor outer city limits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If her eating is not controlled we must make a new throne for her to place her ample rear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Cersei's loyalest of servants whispered when she wasn't around about, making whoever would listen laugh quietly.  Tonight was different than the others though because not only was it 6 months after King Robert's and Ned's passing, it was also the same day the once slender queen of 130 pounds reached a chubby 180 pounds.  It seemed the only person in all of King's landing to not know how fat the queen had gotten was the queen herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens Next? (Please continue)</span></div></div>",

She was far from happy, and her face definitely showed this as she scowled down on her people with contempt. Her mood could be attributed to the series of events following the success of her plot to get her son Joffrey onto the throne, which had involved the untimely (and not so accidental) death of her husband (and former King of Westeros) Robert. Cersei truly believed that with her own son on the throne life would be much simpler and that she would essentially be the true ruler of Westeros, but alas things were not that simple. Joffrey was far from easy to control, and this coupled with his arrogance and cruel heart made everyday a miserable struggle. Joffrey was beginning to refuse any advice that Cersei had for him and they had begun to drift apart, making Cersei worry her own power was in jeopardy. Cersei exhaled a frustrated breath of air and glanced down to the royal gardens which were directly below her. She saw her son undertaking one of his favourite past times, shooting at pigeons with his large crossbow and she gritted her teeth when she saw his company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Margaery Tyrell\" She muttered venomously to herself as she glared at the stunning woman who planned to marry her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrells and Lannisters had always been rivals, vying for the richest and most influential House in Westeros and often butting heads, but now Cersei was really worried that soon Margaery would take all the power she had worked so hard to obtain. Cersei had worked too long and hard to get to the position she was in, and she would be damned if she let that Tyrell whore take it from her. Slowly the wicked cogs of Cersei's brain began to turn, and a scheme began to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Margaery was surprised to find that Cersei would be joining them as they broke their fast. The weather was fine, so they sat out on the verandah, overlooking the Blackwater Bay. The door was flanked by two members of the Kingsguard, while a third stood watch by the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoffrey sat at the head of the table, with his mother at his left hand, and his bride-to-be at his right. He was dressed in a gold tunic, inlaid with the  the sigil of House Baratheon, the crowned stag, and a black cape draped over his shoulder. Both women wore the colours of their respective houses, Cersei in a red satin dress, with long dagged sleeves, while Margaery wore a low-cut sleeveless bodice over a long green skirt, decorated with the golden flowers of Highgarden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is very kind of the queen to join us, isn't it my lord?\" Margaery said with a smile, placing her hand on his. \"When her role as regent means that she is always so busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei smiled back. \"Sometimes it is necessary to act, but the most important duty of a queen is to serve and please the king, wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Margaery nodded, as though Cersei had unveiled a great wisdom. She laced her hand with Joffrey's and looked into his eyes. \"My only wish is to please my lord Joffrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, but it was a thin one, not reaching his eyes. He looked away and pounded his free hand on the table. \"Bring out the food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the doors swung open and a number of servants trooped in, carrying with them plates and platters of food. Freshly baked bread, ripe fruits and cold meats were placed on the table, along with an assortment of fine cheeses and sweet pastries, while servers refreshed glasses of wine and water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoffrey was served first of course, followed by Cersei and Margaery. Margaery selected a modest portion, a piece of bread lightly buttered, a thin slice of cured ham, and a small bunch of grapes. Cersei looked meaningfully at Joffrey, her eyes darting back to Margaery's plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady, does this food displease you?\" He asked after a moment's hesitation, his words polite but his voice laced with steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord?\" Margaery said, and Cersei smiled to see her caught off balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only ask because you pick at your food like a beggar woman picking through the scraps of a feast.\" Joffrey went on, colour rising in his cheeks. \"Perhaps my table compares poorly to that of my traitorous uncle Renly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery bowed her head. \"Forgive me my lord, if I have offended you. Please believe that it was not my intent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her head again, and Cersei was impressed to see tears welling in the corners of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I ask you my lord, how can simple food compare to the majesty of your presence?\" She said, her voice quavering. \"I feel as though your love is all I need to sustain me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Cersei's annoyance, this flattery had the desired effect, and the fire faded from Joffrey's eyes. He touched his hand to Margaery's cheek, wiping away a tear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cry not, sweet lady.\" He said soothingly. \"Your offense is already forgotten. Now, let us eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cersei and Joffrey spoke vaguely about the affairs of the Seven Kingdoms, Margaery quietly added more food to her plate, taking another slice of bread, more meats and even some cheese, the sharp crumbly yellow that came from across the Narrow Sea. This achieved, she began to eat, slowly but methodically, spearing chunks of meat with her knife and dabbing grease from her lips with a handkerchief, occasionally nibbling on a slice of bread. The cheese and grapes followed, the sweet fruit serving a pleasant counterpoint to the tang of the cheese. She laid down her knife just as Cersei was finishing a point about the Iron Islands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... are not a real threat. Your uncle Jaime has often said  that...\" She paused, noticing Margaery's empty plate. \"Ah, it seems a body cannot live on love alone after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and signaled to the servants, who began to refill her plate. Margaery began to politely protest, until she noticed the approving look on Joffrey's face. More meat, bread and cheese was piled on to her plate, along with another bunch of grapes and two juicy plums. Joffrey freshened her wine glass himself, an honour she made sure to thank him for profusely. This done he resumed conversing with his mother, leaving Margaery little option but to continue eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was full after the first few bites, uncomfortably so a few bites later, her bloated stomach pressing against the inside of her tight dress. The flow of conversation slowed to a trickle, as mother and son both watched her eat, sipping their wine as she struggled on resolutely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chewed and swallowed without really tasting the food, whether it was meat or cheese or fruit, washing it all down with the sweet red wine. Eventually she managed to clean her plate, leaving only a crust of bread and pits from the plums. She felt fuller then she ever had before, her swollen stomach painfully compressed by her rigid leather bodice. She was working hard to suppress any belches that were threatening to break loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei looked at her, feeling pleased that her plan had worked so well. She glanced at Joffrey, who also seemed to be enjoying himself, a faint sheen of sweat visible on his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Margaery.\" She said, as though the thought had just occurred to her, \"You really must taste these pastries, they are simply delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei's own pastry sat uneaten on her plate, but that didn't matter. Margaery looked to Joffrey, who was watching her closely. He nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery felt as though she might burst if she even looked at a pastry, but the look on Joffrey's face gave her hope. It was a look she was very familiar with, though she had never seen it on Renly's face and only sporadically on Joffrey's. It was the look of desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment, my lord.\" She said, as she began to unlace her bodice, from the bottom upward. Cersei looked puzzled but Joffrey was the one who mattered, and he appeared entranced as more and more of Margaery's bloated belly was exposed. There was quickly enough room for her to breathe easily again, and she allowed herself a long, audible sigh of relief. With the extra room afforded by this manoeuvre, she easily ate not one but two of the pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei attempted a quip about the latest Highgarden fashions but Joffrey was deaf to it, still staring longingly at Margaery. Moments later, after the most basic pleasantries, the royal couple had departed, Joffrey supporting Margaery with an arm around her waist. As soon as the door closed behind them, Cersei's smile turned to a scowl. Somehow Margaery had come out on top, shooting Cersei a victorious glance over her shoulder as they walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sipped her wine and picked at the uneaten pastry still sitting on her plate. She had tried the subtle approach, appealing to Joffrey's insecurities. Maybe Pycelle had something more obvious that would wipe that smile off of her face...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Bring in the next petitioner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourt was being held, though the King was nowhere to be found. Joffrey had vanished into the Kingswood at the head of a hunting party before mid-morning, in a manner so like his late father that it gave Cersei chills. With the King's Hand, her father, having returned to the Riverlands, it left her as Queen Regent to hold court in his stead. This wasn't actually recognised protocol, but no one had dared to stop her from taking a seat upon the Iron Throne. The members of the Small Council, Varys, Littlefinger and Maester Pycelle sat to her right, behind a modest table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had come and gone for hours, those seeking the King's justice. Cersei was growing sick of listening to their whining voices, pleading for the crown to intercede in their petty squabbles. Adding to her impatience was the fact that the Iron Throne was harder on the buttocks than she had imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What business brings you before the court today, my good man?\" Varys asked the next petitioner who limped to the front of the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked of an age with her father, but she had always found it difficult to tell with smallfolk. The man might have been younger than her for all she knew. He wore rough homespun, tied at the waist with a piece of rope, and shoes that appeared little better than untreated hide. He spoke with a thin, reedy voice that set Cersei's teeth on edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, my lords, your Grace, I beg you to help me. We was three days out of Maidenpool, heading down the Kingsroad, when we was attacked by armed men. They was wearing the Lannister lion, and they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei allowed the familiar tale of woe to wash over her, and ignoring the ache in her backside turned her mind to the problem of Margaery Tyrell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks had passed since the meal on the terraces of the Red Keep. If she had not understood exactly what it was she had witnessed at first, it soon became very clear. Since that day, Joffrey had been spending much more time with Margaery, and most of that time was spent watching her eat. He seemed fascinated with making her eat until she could eat no more, and the effect it was having on her slender frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the days had passed, the effects had made themselves known. Margaery had grown plumper by the day it seemed to Cersei, as though every morsel that passed her lips found a home on her hips. She was not the only one to have noticed of course, and the court was a hive of rumour and innuendo. Some stated with confidence that Joffrey had planted a baby in Margaery's belly, and that the wedding was being pushed forward, while others claimed that it wasn't Joffrey who had done the planting, but rather Robb Stark, or any member of the Kingsguard, or even the ghost of Renly Baratheon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gossip was just the kind of discord she had been hoping to sow, stinging Joffrey's pride and turning Margaery into a laughing stock. But when she conceived of her plan, what she had not foreseen was Joffrey's preference for the fuller figured Margaery. So like Robert, she thought again, remembering all the nights he had spurned her perfect body in favour of some bouncy serving girl. It still surprised her how much Joffrey could take after a man who bore him no blood relation. As it stood, rather than embarrass and weaken her rival, she had simply given her another means to manipulate her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had considered simply waiting, in the hopes that Joffrey would tire of his new hobby, or that Margaery would grow so fat that he would longer desire her. If that took too long, she could perhaps attempt to hasten affairs. She had consulted with Maester Pycelle, and he did know of a certain extract that would magnify a person's appetite and encourage corpulence. However, it required regular doses to be truly effective, in quantities too large to simply slip into Margaery's goblet. And even if she could have it done, there was no guarantee that it would not simply excite Joffrey all the more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she needed was something to distract Joffrey from his bride and her belly. According to the dispatches from the Neck, the war was going well, with Robb Stark's forces divided and close to collapse. Perhaps now was the time to send Joffrey to join his armies, so that he might claim the victory as his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she thought, as fear twisted through her gut. She could not risk putting another of her children into harm's way, not after Tyrion had schemed to send sweet Myrcella to those savages in Dorne. She needed to find another solution, something else to turn Joffrey's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she thought this, a sudden movement at the back of the hall caught her eye. She looked, and spied the long red hair of Sansa Stark, making her way out of the hall. She paused in the doorway, as a guard interrogated her about her business, giving Cersei a good look at her noble hostage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always been a skinny little thing, and the recent news from the North had no doubt caused her some sleepless nights. She looked almost gaunt, her simple grey dress cinched tightly around her narrow waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei smiled to herself. Joffrey had made no secret of his lust for the Stark girl. A little meat on her bones, and she might just prove herself useful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped back from her musing to see the Small Council and the petitioner looking at her, their expressions ranging from hopeful to bemused to bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat and adjusted her seat, trying to cover for her inattentiveness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the name of King Joffrey Baratheon, first of his name, this petition is granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nearly fell to his knees in gratitude, and had to be helped from the hall. The court murmured throughout his exit, causing Cersei to wonder what it was she had just promised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very generous your Grace.\" Varys said, in a tone that she couldn't pin down as admiring or mocking. The pain in her buttocks was back, sharper this time, as the next petitioner was admitted. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A single full length mirror was a luxury undreamed of by many a lord, but Margaery's chambers had three, arranged in such a fashion as to display every angle of her body. She had always enjoyed trying on gowns and dresses, while her cousins chattered and gossiped in the background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she stood before the mirrors again, fresh from her bath, casting a more reproving eye over her naked reflection. Her hips had spread wider, her legs thicker. A glance showed that her backside had not been spared, and her hand confirmed it, pinching and prodding her more ample buttocks. But it was her middle that had grown the most, her flat stomach swelling outwards into a rounded belly. She looked like a woman ripe with child, she thought, more so when she had just finished a meal, and her stomach was taut and heavy. Otherwise it was soft to the touch, bouncing slightly when she walked. She was not yet fat, she decided, through she was definitely not as slender as she had once been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she had been delighted to find Joffrey so enamoured of her expanding figure, and so eager to see it expand further. It made him much more amenable to her suggestions, so much easier to control. He was suddenly so eager to fulfil her every request, large or small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had been kind, kinder than he had ever been before, bringing her gifts of food and feeding her morsels from his own plate. Before too long however, his darker nature began to emerge once more. It seemed he was not happy until she had eaten to the point of discomfort, even pain, testing the very bounds of her stomach. Every meal was the same, and few were the times she could rise from her seat without assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner the previous evening he had  watched her eat a pie that would have fed four hungry men, alternating between begging and commanding her, growing excited and tentatively touching the swelling orb of her belly. She felt embarrassed engaging in this activity in full view of the servants, but at least their presence kept Joffrey's behaviour somewhat manageable. So far he had limited himself to a few caresses of her bloated stomach, and a handful of kisses that were more passionate than his usual courtly ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, while previously she had schemed and planned in order to spend time with Joffrey, now she found she needed to engineer reasons to part him from her side.  This morning, after breaking her fast on an entire loaf of bread with butter and honeycomb, she had expressed a craving for some roast pheasant. Joffrey had quickly ordered a hunting party together, and promised to return with an entire flock to sate his lady's desire. She silently feared he would do just that, and force her to crunch down every bone, wing and beak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was a young girl, she had always promised herself that she would do whatever was required for her to become queen. There was no action she would not countenance, no advantage she would not pursue. But as her clothes tightened and she watched her stomach expand, she wondered for the first time if it would all be worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked again at her rounded belly, giving it a light slap and watching it quiver. In the same instant she herself shivered, feeling goose pimples erupt across her bare flesh. There was an early autumn chill in the air, despite the shining of the sun. Winter, as the Starks were so fond of saying, was coming. Calling in her handmaidens and allowing them to dress her, Margaery found herself wondering what size she would be when spring came around again. </span></div></div>",

Cersei planned to use the young Stark girl as her next pawn in her never ending scheme to maintain her power. In order for her to be effective however she would need to surpass Margaery in Joffrey's lust. To do that Sansa would have to put on some weight due to the observation that Cersei had made in watching her eldest son become more enamoured with the Tyrell girl the fatter she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually a young girl with fiery red hair and a mournful look on her face appeared at the door to her chambers, she knocked and Cersei opened the door, warmly welcoming Sansa into her chambers. Sansa had not stopped mourning since she had recieved the news that her mother and brother were killed at the twins and Cersei planned to use her mourning to get her to put on weight under the hoax of actually caring about her dead relatives and pretending to try to comfort her with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sent for my my lady\" Sansa in a strained voice.\"Yes darling why don't you come in and have a seat, I know that you have been devastated by the loss of your family, but I suggest that you use my method of grieving by eating you sadness away, it helped me when I found out I was betrothed to that oaf Robert\" said Cersei with a convincingly caring voice\". Sansa was almost taken aback by the unexpected empathy that Cersei had for her, replying \"do you really think that eating away my grief will help\". Cersei buoyantly replied\" of course Sansa, food is the best medicine I know of for grief. You can start right now with some of the meals I've sent for that will be arriving soon\", and as if on cue, a pair of servants walked in with two massive platters of delicious and fattening food. Seemingly convinced, Sansa replied \"yes my lady I would be honored to dine with you in your own quarters\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0with that Sansa began to devour most of the food set before her, not noticing that Cersei barely touched a scrap of food while she ate almost all of the food by herself. Sansa finished the last of the food set before her and then leaned back to stretch. Cersei was impressed with Sansa's fortitude, as Sansa stretched back Cersei already noticed that Sansa's normally flat and lithe stomach was somewhat convex, protruding a few inches frome her body. Cersei then clapped twice and two more servants appeared through the doors to Cersei's chambers, each carrying a large platter of lemon cakes, Sansa's notoriously favorite dessert and laid them before Sansa. Sansa reacted saying \"my lady, I truely do appreciate the gesture,but my stomach is already packed full, I couldn't eat another bite\". Cersei quickly acted, saying \"nonsense, it's just a little dessert, this is the best part of the grief food, you get to eat all of your favorite foods\". Assured, Sansa continued into the lemon cakes, shoving the delicious yellow pastries into her waiting mouth. Cersei just watched, satisfied that she had sent Sansa on the correct trajectory to becoming another chubby lust for Joffrey to chase the affections of. As her stomach was almost visibly expanding now that she was so full and still stuffing her face. At the conclusion of Sansa's feast Cersei told Sansa \"darling any food you was any time you want it, just have one of your handmaidens send to the kitchens and it will be brought to you at once\", and with that, Sansa departed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It had been a full week since the day that Cersei had shown Sansa what she perceived to be true empathy, but was really just a hoax to get Sansa to gain weight. So far Cersei's plan was working flawlessly, Sansa had taken full advantage of her new freedom to order any food she desired to her chambers and she could eat it there, and some of the effects had begun to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sansa woke up one morning and went to her bathing chambers. unlike Margaery who had a three mirror set up to see more angles of herself, Sansa only had one, but that didn't hide the damage that had been done to her previously lithe and beautiful body. Sansa looked at herself disapprovingly, she first looked at her front, her previously toned stomach had turned soft and expanded forewards, when she was walking through the corridors of the castle in a happier upbeat manner, you could see the soft fat of her stomach start to bouyantly bounce and jiggle. she then gazed at her larger but still peky chest, which had recieved much of the extra weight that Sansa had put on, Sansa took them in and sized them up, feeling each breast as she realized that these new teats were a reason for Joffrey to continue his harrasment to her. Sansa then turned around to see her enlarged buttocks, she was shocked to see the new jiggly fat that had accumulated on her rear end, and as confirmation poked and proded her new jiggly rear assets. she also notice that her thighs, while never fully toned due to how cold it was in her homeland so she never really got to go out and walk, along with the fact that she was royalty so she never went hungry, were now full of celulite and wobbled a little bit as she walked. Sansa then turned back to face the mirror and looked herself in the face, she then noticed that her formerly slim face with a sharp jaw line and defined cheekbones was also filling out, her chin was still nowhere near doubling up, but the sharp definition that had been one of her defining features was fading into a soft and sloping chin, cheeks that looked much chubbier, and an overall softening of her face occured to her. Taking in her now enlarged frame, Sansa decided that she would have to stop going to food to answer for her grief, the only problem that she didn't see was that since she was already intaking many more calories consistently for the past week, it wasn't going to be grief that she ate for, it would be just her body trying to keep consistency in her diet. Sansa also realized that her body was not yet completely lost, and to some, her new bouncier figure would appeal even more, after all, her breasts and buttocks were much bigger. When she finished pouring over her new chubbier figure, Sansa got dressed with some difficulty as her usual dresses were tighter than they used to be, now clutching every curve of her body, and then proceeded to the great hall for a feast, her ample butt jiggling as she trotted down the halls of the Red Keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once she arrived in the great hall, Sansa saw her usual seat was open for her at the table and sat in it. As usual the servants brought out the meal of the morning and everybody proceeded to eat, but feeling particularly ravenous today, Sansa ate as much as the 5 people in close proximity to her combined. her soft stomach pushed further against her already tight fitting dress, causing stretching in her dress to show. From his perch at the center of the royal table, Joffrey noticed Sansa's paunch pushing against her dress, and Sansa noticed him noticing her malfunction caused by her expanding frame. Sansa blushed and retreated from the great hall at a slow and inconspicuous pace. because she was trying to seem like everything was alright, Joffrey was able to catch her with ease. Joffrey, full well knowing that he practically owned her, ordered her to his chambers that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sansa arrived in Joffrey's chambers around dusk that evening and found Joffrey waiting for her there, she also noticed that she and Joffrey weren't the only ones there, as Margaery Tyrell was sitting coyly on Joffrey's be with a plain expression on her face. Sansa had little idea what Joffrey wanted her there for, but she knew she was about to find out. Joffrey proceeded by saying \"so lovely of you to join us this evening Sansa, tonight you will be part of the unofficial consumation of my and Margaery's wedding.\" Sansa replied, your grace, I am not your betrothed, I am not supposed to be in here while you bed your wife\". Coming to notice Joffrey's wife, Sansa hadn't seen Margaery since the day of Joffrey's actual wedding, and Margaery looked to have gained weight too, even more that Sansa had, looking at her, Margaery looke much more plump and soft than she had at her wedding. Margaery was also shocked by the news that she would be joined in the bedding ceremony with Joffrey as well as Sansa, and \"Sansa looked like she had gained weight at well,\" thought Margaery looking at Sansa examining her immenent partner in the bedding ceremony with Joffrey, noticing her softer hips and expanded rear and was almost attracted to Sansa, but for her knowing that it was not proper to have intercourse with another woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As both Sansa and Margaery knew, Joffrey was prone to many perversions, but what Margaery knew that Sansa didn't was that one of those perversions was an enamoration with chubbier girls. Joffrey then spoke \"shall we begin ladies?\" there were no objections Joffrey continued, explaining what seemed to be one of his great desires \"good, so first Sansa, undress as come over and sit on my face, next Margaery, you are my wife so you shall be the one actually being bedded\". As this farce of a bedding ceremony proceeded, Sansa was at first taken aback, but the accepted her fate that Joffrey could dictate anything he wanted her to do because she was his prisoner, so Sansa then proceeded to put her much expanded rear on the kings face, Margaery then proceeded to mount Joffrey's hardened manhood and work up and down. from Joffreys point of view, he was in heaven, both of the girls he had lusted after for a while were having sex with him at the same time, as an added bonus, they had both made his greatest fantasies come true by gaining weight. as Sansa was maneuvering on his face he inhaled deeply, as he could not while his face was smothered in Sansa's plump backside. Sansa then returned to Joffreys face, but instead of her buttocks, she came with her chest which was also much more plump than it had been before. to Joffrey Sansa's breasts were massive and jiggling in his face, and Margaery who was lower down but he could still feel his wife's wide and soft hips. Joffrey grabbed his wifes butt and squeezed with every muscle in his body controlled by lust, Joffrey's hands were madly exploring each chubby beauty engulfing his body, and after a very short period of time, Joffrey finished, and all three of the newly made non-virgins collapsed in a heap on Joffreys bed. All three fell asleep immediately, there naked bodies neatly laid side by side all face down with each of Joffrey's hands resting on each plump beauties soft fat booties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the morning before any of the three woke up Joffreys servants had already started spreading the news of the threesome throughout the castle. In her quarters, Cersei quietly chuckled, knowing that her plan was well under way to working.</span></div></div>",

The formerly slender, beautiful rose of Highgarden, had since lost much of her formerly svelte body to Joffrey's fattening ways, who was also being egged on by his mother Cersei, who bad more sinister motives than Joffrey. It had been weeks since Margaery and Joffrey had officially consummated their marriage and Margaery was breaking her fast alone as Joffrey was attending a meeting of the small council discussing matters important to the realm. As of late, the furthered effects of constant indulgence was on full display on her new figure. As Margaery continued to indulge on her breakfast, her stomach, already somewhat swollen from weeks of excess consumption was further distended by the enormous amount of food that she had consumed. Margaery had already eaten a whole pound of pork sausage, as well as a half dozen eggs and several glasses of fine wine to wash it all down and all of it showed in the way that the queens normally soft stomach  was now once again a hard dome of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It was now later in the evening, Margaery and Joffrey were in their respective bed chambers. Joffrey was pacing around his bedside worried about what to do about his lust for Sansa Stark, but at the same time lust and obligation to Margaery, he had achieved one night of inconspicuous lust on the night of his bedding ceremony, where nobody suspected a thing because they had believed that the official ceremony had taken place days before. But since that night, Joffrey had been searching for a valid reason to summon both Margaery and Sansa to his bed chambers. Joffrey had no delusions of Sansa's disdain for him, with that in mind, Joffrey played with the idea if using force to achieve his desires, but he then realized that without everybody in the kingdom suffering from hangover from the days of partying, that his antics of lust would be the topic of many innuendo and jokes amongst the numerous vassals. There was another way Joffrey had thought of to make his antics possible while maintaining a kingdom, but he knew he would need to consolidate much power for this to be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile in Margaery's chambers  she too was pacing around the bedside, but instead of an internal struggle of lust, Margaery was having an internal power struggle. On one hand Margaery had dreamed of becoming queen and controlling the seven kingdoms since she was a little girl, trotting through the halls of Highgarden, and her current position was the closest she had ever been to total power of Essos. On the other hand her figure had suffered so much from incessant stuffing for the pleasure of Joffrey. She stopped in front of her mirrors to see her body in full, she sighed, her once beautiful body, was long passed the threshold of beauty, Margaery's stomach, which had been a hard knot of food just that morning, had since digested its enormous meal and distributed it as fat all over her body. Margaery stood stagnant for ages, remembering how many possibilities laid in her path. All had been narrowed to one by the act of putting on so much weight. Margaery no longer had the same ability she once did at seducing men to do her bidding. Her ever growing stomach was past the point of chubby and nearing in on being in the threshold of fat. Margaery could do nothing except for stare herself down with a sullen sadness of the fact that her figure and health would only deteriorate from this point. She played with her new gut, squeezing it and watching as the fat pushed between her fingers. Her formerly toned buttocks was now full of fat, her slender cheekswere beginning to swell outwards, her sharp pronounced chin was becoming soft and a second was beginning to show. Her once ample breast were now large jiggling sacs of fat, much to the lust of Joffrey, Margaery knew that she had chosen her course and could not change it again.</span></div></div>",

The kings royal soldier handed her a note with the Kings royal seal on it. The knight left mumbling \"from his royal majest King Joffrey Baratheon, First of his Name, King of the Andals and Protector of the Realm\", but the knight, for some reason unknown to Margaery would not look her in the eye, or even so much as luck up at her, instead prefering the sight of the dirt covered orphanage floor to his ruling queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Despite this new peculiar development in the behavior from her guards, Margaery went to the kings hall as per the message requested and was met by none other that Joffrey, he was wearing his usual regal looking attire with his crown and his usual cocky smirk across his face. Margaery took a deep breath in, having a good idea of what was in store for her behind the closed doors to the palace kitchens. \"Hello my love, I have requested you to me for a special meal that we may share\".\"more like I eat entirely be myself while you sit and pick at a few scraps of food while<br>\r\nWatching me stuff my face\" thought Margaery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        As per what Margaery expected, numerous chefs brought out different entr\u00e9es from the kitchen, Margaery proceded to beg the question \"what is the special occasion for which we are supping tonight\". Joffrey declared \"we are supping tonight in celebration of my brave grandfather in the fields of battle winning key victories all across the Riverlands, as well as in thanks to lord Walder Frey in the Twins, for having slain the head of my foes army the 'Young Wolf'\". Joffrey continued \"let tonight be remembered as the true start to my unopposed rule of Westeros\". Margaery was elated to hear the news of great victories for her husbands forces because with him on the throne and enamoured with her, she would be in the highest place of power in all of Westeros. With her new found assurance of the dominion of her husband, Margaery was motivated to cater to his whims more fully, stuffing multiple plates of food into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        By the end of the meal Margaery was stuffed, her already lithe turned soft stomach was protruding even further with all of the food she had recently eaten. Margaery look around, just now realizing that the only two people in the hall were her and Joffrey, this put a seed of dread in her mind because that meant that there was no judging eye to hold back Jeffrey's desires. Joffrey spoke \"do you need help with your dress my lady, you look quite uncomfortable with it restricting you so much\". In fact Margaery was quite uncomfortable in her dress, but as of the moment didn't want Joffrey to undress her. Margaery replied \"no thank you your grace, I think I will return to my chambers and have my handmaidens assist me and then I will bathe and got rest\". And with that Margaery did exactly as she said, she clumsily with the aid of her handmaiden climbed out of her now too tight dress and into a hot bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery's stomach was still taught with the food she consumed in the hall and this drew the interest of a few questions from her handmaidens whilst they scrubbed the dirt from her day in the orphanage out. Margaery throughout her bath wrestled with the question of whether or not power was worth her body or not, to herself, by the end of the bath, Margaery decided that even though her figure was important to her, she would fulfill the vow she had made to herself as a child to rule westerns at all costs, that included her body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Margaret used this time to inspect the damage that had this far been done to her former slim and beautiful frame without the silently judging eye of her handmaidens looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery once again approached her three mirror set up and peered at her new body, since her last inspection some damage had be done to her frame. Margaery saw that her body from just weeks ago was no more, even since the 5 days had passed she had noticeably gained weight. Margaery looking at her naked reflection turned to look at her rear assets, her formerly slim but firm buttocks was expanded and now was jiggly and soft, for assurance Margaret grabbed and squeezed her rear end, watching as the soft skin squished in her hands. If she could say so herself, this part of her weight gain had to have been the best because as she felt her plum rear she realized that it was now much more grabbable for Joffrey when she did decide to actually consumate her marriage, she then turned back around to de her least favorite part of her gain, her stomach. She uneasily pushed into and squeezed her softening midsection. Since last night, her stomach had softened up quite a bit  becoming instead of a hard dome, her soft center that jiggled somewhat noticeably when she walked, the then looked a little higher and inspected another high note in her weight gain, he chest. When she started her climb to power, her chest was modest but perky, her breast retained much of their perkiness but now had a softer more wobbly feel to them, cupping each one in her hand, lifting, and releasing her breast, watching them bounce bouyantly on her frame, the other low point of her gain was in her hips and thighs, while she had never had to do any hard labour in her life, Margaret kept her legs in decent shape with regular strolls through the gardens of Highgarden. Now her previously slender thighs had some softness too them jiggly decently as she walked through the palace. Her hips had also spread wider, giving her a closer resemblance to The Mother of the seven, without having modern elastic her undergarments were made from less lenient silk which created a muffing top with extra fat from her hips protruding just over the side of her silk undergarment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at herself in some parts a new positivity and at others with a feeling of betrayal her handmaidens had begun to stir and Margaret began to dress</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arya had been so close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been so close to escaping. If only the guard that had been placed in front of the gate had not recognized her. She didn't know how he did it, but her best guess was that he had seen her next to her father during the tourney of the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently she was in her chambers, where a few maids had just finished bathing her and were dressing her for meeting the Queen. They were looking dissaprovingly at her hair, which had been cut by Yoren so she could pass as a boy, but evidently it hadn't been enough to get her out of the city. She didn't blame him for leaving her here, she knew that he had a duty to the Night's Watch. Jon certainly had instilled a sense of respect for them into her. The swords that had been promised to the ancient order for his discretion had of course helped his decision to leave her in the snake pit that was King's Landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the maids were done dressing her. Arya looked at herself in the mirror and hated to admit that the Lannister maids made a decent job at cleaning her up. She had been on the streets for a week or two before Yoren found her, so she was aware that even cut short her hair looked like a rat's nest. Not anymore, it was now a clean bob cut that hung to her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was brought before the Queen and Joffrey in the throne room, where the entire court was assembled. She saw a few familiar faces in the crowd, and her sight rested on Sansa a few moments. Her sister had apparently been crying a lot lately, because her eyes were red and puffy and it seemed like she hadn't slept a day in a fortnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya now stood in front of the Iron Throne where, behind her the entire court who were judging her, in front of her the Kingsguard who were watching her every move. There were only 5 in attendance, Jamie Lannister having run from the capital, and she hoped that Merwin Trant had been killed by Syrio and her dancing instructor escaped. Beyond the Kingsguard were Cersei and Joffrey, the Queen barely able to contain her giddiness at having both Stark girls under her control and Joffrey looking at her with a cruel glint in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eWell well, what do we have here? A little wolf pup all alone, abandoned by it\u2019s pack.\u201c The entire court laughed, most probably to get onto the Queens good side. Arya didn\u2019t react, she was used to ridicule. There were only a few people that didn\u2019t call her \u201eArya Horseface\u201c after all, and those who weren\u2019t related to her she could count on one hand. \"You sure are a feisty little girl. Running away, when I sent one of my Kingsguard to collect you, now that's not something a noble lady of the court would do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Arya was beginning to understand what would happen to her. She would be forced to attend court, to be shown of to Joffrey's followers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she wouldn't make it easy for him to show her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been caught again. It had been her third attempt to escape this week alone. Arya was sure that she would eventually succeed, because she had nearly unlimited time to plan her disappearance. But something was different this time, she wasn't led back to her room, but into the Queen's chambers. Cersei was waiting for her, looking smug as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest Stark girl had been a major headache for the golden haired Lannister. The older one, Sansa, was easily intimidated. A threat here, a suggestion there and the little bird sung to her tunes, but Arya had been stubborn. She didn't do what she was told and tried numerous times to escape. But no more, the Queen had enough. But Cersei was smart enough to know that no matter what the Stark girl did, short of murder of course, she couldn't lock her in a room and be done with it. But now Cersei had a plan which would surely prevent another escape attempt, and even if Arya would be successful she would easily be found again after Cersei was through with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave us. I wish to speak with the girl alone.\" The room's other occupants, maids and guards and even one of the Kingsguard immediately left the two women alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I to do with you. Will you ever get tired of running away?\" Cersei began with a motherly tone, one which Arya knew to be fake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't stop until you are dead. When Robb knocks on the cities walls, I will be the one to kill you.\" Arya answered without thinking. How dare this woman, no this witch use a tone that her own mother would normally use to berate her when escaping sewing lessons with Septa Mordane to train with the bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid you would say that, child. But you will find that you will be unable to run in a few months time.\" With that the Queen called for one of the maids, who immediately took her place behind Cersei. \"This is Tama. She will take care of you in the foreseeable future. In fact, why don't you start taking care of our dear Arya right now.\" With that the Queen gestured to a table that Arya hadn't seen before. It was absolutely loaded with all different kinds of food. The variety was great, but they all had one thing in common. They were extremely fattening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya was grabbed by two different maids, and held down in the chair that she was sitting in. She was panicking. What were they going to so to her? The answer came a second later, when the first maid, Tama, grabbed one of the many pastries on the table and crammed it into Arya's mouth. She tried to spit it out, but one of the other maids was preventing her from doing so by holding her mouth closed and forcing her to chew and swallow. She tried to break free, but the two maids holding her down were surprisingly strong and wouldn't budge, no matter how much she tried. A second pastry was forced down her throat, but this time she didn't make the mistake of opening her mouth again. But Tama simply pinched Arya's nose, so that she would have to open her mouth to breath, and in the moment Arya's opened her maw another baked goodie was shoved into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Cersei was watching with unadulterated glee. Here was the daughter of Ned Stark, who looked so much like Lyanna, the woman that was the reason for her unhappy marriage, suffering at her hands. In her mind it was the ultimate form of revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was foolproof. She had seen what obesity had done to Robert, he was incredibly slow, and through his sheer girth he could easily be identified in a crowd. The same logic could be applied to Arya, who once fattened up properly wouldn't be able to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the maids were done feeding Arya, the table had been cleared of all food. It was all in her belly, which looked as if she had swallowed two watermelon's whole and she felt nauseous and was close to tears. She was carried back to her bed by the maids previously holding her down, and when she finally slept she could only imagine what the next day would bring. </span></div></div>",

She would be woken up at dawn, be forced to eat an enormous breakfast, spend the next few hours in the gardens with her sister Sansa,  and use the opportunity to digest as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunchtime, Cersei would order her to her room, where she Arya would be filled to bursting with food again and again, being forced to drink a concoction, which according to the queen would aid her digestion whilst simultaneously slowing her metabolism, making the young Stark build fat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it did what the blonde Lannister said it would. During her stay in King's Landing she had nearly doubled her weight, going from a previously slim 105 pounds to a chubby 190 pounds. A fact that Cersei wouldn't stop reminding her of, making Arya wear too small dresses which threatened to break a seam at the slightest movement or roughly groping her gut while she was eating. The queen was obviously getting some sick pleasure out of ruining the youngest Stark's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei had even used her own hands once to stuff her for crying out loud!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe only good thing about King's Landing was that she was getting along with her sister, who had finally lost her attitude of a damsel in distress and started standing up for herself. The two Stark's had become very close while suffering together. In Winterfell they hadn't shared that many interests, but now they had no other choice but to work together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all it was two wolves against a whole city of Lions and Snakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Arya was lying in her bed, straddling her overstuffed stomach, which by now was big enough to rest on her thunder thighs when sitting. Most of her gain was centered below the waistline after all, her legs - which were thicker than the Mountain's arms - leading up to an ass that overflowed most chairs in the Red Keep. The rest of her hadn't become that much bigger, her arms and chin only developing a slight jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, at least she had boobs now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't anything special, but in the revealing dresses Cersei had her wear she didn't look too ridiculous, because she actually had cleavage now. Of course they were outshined by her massive behind, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately, she had noticed, that it was easier to stay awake after her daily stuffing, not that she told anybody that, because then they would just increase her food intake until she was comatose again. Arya looked around the room, and she noticed that she was alone and that the door wasn't closed. She stood up and, while cradling her stomach to stop it from bouncing, made her her way towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around into the hallway and saw that there was no one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange\u201d, Arya mused \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around the Keep, steadying her belly with her hands to prevent herself from vomiting, but much to her surprise there wasn't anyone there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her chance to escape!</span></div></div>",

At the moment Arya was clutching her stomach in pain, her hunger having grown with the size of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa didn't fare much better, but she at least was able to think clearly. The older Stark girl knew that if they didn't find food soon, then they would die of starvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished that thought Sansa spotted a building, and after dragging her fat sister closer to it they both saw that it was an inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were saved! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it wasn't the biggest they had ever seen, it was clearly owned by someone who was rather well off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they opened the door they were assaulted with some of the most heavenly smells there were. Baked goodies were laid out on one side of the great room they found themselves in, while on the other booths all along the wall. They sat down in one, and immediately a cute serving girl a bit older than Sansa came over and took their orders. While Sansa only wanted a bit, Arya placed down an order for the entire menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their food was brought before them Arya immediately went to scarfing down as much food as possible, while Sansa ate at a far more reasonable pace, but still quite fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finished eating Arya's stomach distended far enough to squeeze her into the booth, trapping her there for the moment until she digested. Even Sansa's belly was distended a few inches, having taken a few of the dishes Arya ordered for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they now had another problem to deal with. They didn't have any money to pay for the food, and their Stark honor forbade them from stealing. Even if it didn't, Arya seriously doubted she could escape in her condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the serving girl was quite understanding, and brought them to the owner of the Inn, a woman about the same age as their mother Catelyn. She offered them to work for her at her Inn, Sansa as an assistant in the Kitchen, because as it turned out the serving girl was the daughter of the owner and the only other employee had managed to set water on fire while attempting to cook, and Arya as a taste tester, tasting the owners baked goodies, and helping improve them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them accepted quickly, not expecting the expansion of their waists their employment would bring them. </span></div></div>",

They now shared a bed, but they had to be careful as by now they were fat enough to break it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa was still skinnier than Arya, who had started gaining weeks before the redhead, but she was by no means svelte. Her belly was the size of an overinflated beach ball, and on top of it rested breasts the size of watermelons. She had grown below the waist too, but not to the extent of her upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Arya had gotten so fat she was beginning to get tired when moving around too much. While Sansa had an apple shaped body, Arya had blown up all over. Her thighs truly deserved the moniker thunder thighs, and her belly was about twice the size of Sansa's. On top of it rested her breasts, each one bigger than her own head. Her ass had gotten so wide that she gets stuck in some of the narrower doorways and had to rely on Sansa to get her free, who used the opportunity to tease her sister about her growing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently the two were laying in bed, Sansa massaging her sister's belly, because the younger Stark had once again overdone it at dinner. Arya moaned, and gave Sansa a long, passionate kiss, which the other Stark eagerly returned. When they both ended the kiss their lips were connected by a thin trail of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do now?\" Sansa said, while kneading Arya's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Arya meanwhile busied herself by playing with Sansa's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't stay here forever, we have to go back home to Winterfell.\" The older girl replied \"We have to do it soon, because I doubt that you will be able to make the trip in a few weeks if you continue to gain weight as you do, and I don't have that long either until I'm too fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Arya couldn't fault her sister's logic, because she knew that she would not stop gaining weight, especially because Sansa was loving her growing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll leave tomorrow. We have made enough money working here to buy horses and enough food to last us the journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day they left the Inn. </span></div></div>",

Her dress, a gift Tommen had given to her just last week for her to grow into, was already stretched to it's limit, the stuffings she endured by day from the queen, and by night from Tommen providing her body with plenty of calories to grow wider. But she no longer saw her hundreds of pounds of flabby blubber as a burden to be carried, or something that made her undesireable. No, now she knew that her love would adore her even more with every added roll, every added inch. This alone made her hungrier than ever, even asking for even more food once as Cersei had stuffed her to the gills, enraging the blonde Queen as her 'punishment' for Arya had clearly turned into something she enjoyed massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, she was waiting for Tommen, alone as for one she was far too fat and slow to escape, and even if she did, a girl that weighed a few times what others her age weighed was VERY recognizable in King's Landing and it's surrounding area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, her prince arrived, carrying three large baskets filled to the brim with pastries, she could practically smell the lemon cakes from a few dozen feet away, bringing memories of her sister's love for the pastries to her mind. She wondered where Sansa was, as she had overheard Cersei talking about how the red-head still hadn't been sighted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommen put the baskets next to her, before leaning down, and capturing her lips in a passionate kiss, as Arya returned it. She felt a hand squeezing her belly, which by now was covering her entire lap and began crawling over her knees when she was sitting, as she wrapped her plump arms - each as wide as her waist a few short months ago, but far more jiggly and soft than it - around him, pulling him close. \"I've missed you, love...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment there was a rustling in the bushes...</span></div></div>",

Arya, i want to stuff you...ooh...i want to ..pant..see you clothes riiiip while you eeeat !\" she turned on her side and started kicking with her plump and naked legs\" and you Margaery aahh, whyyyy do you resist your gluttony ? pant.. why doesn't my brooother understands oooh how beautiful you are ? I want to see youuu ahhh get stuck in a door, aaah i want to grab that big fat ass of yours and push to set you freeeee, aaahhh! with a final scream the princess reached her climax and lost all her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence she finally came to a realization:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I want them both to be mine\"</span></div></div>",

The queen was happy to see how much her daughter had grown, however she noticed something that made her disappointed.<br>\r\n\"Myrcella, are you not eating well enough ? Your growth has stopped ?\"<br>\r\nThe princess smiled \" Arya is having problems to lift herself on her feet in the morning, soon she won't be able to leave her bed, i am exited, but i realized that to take care of her i need to keep my mobility, it's unfortunate but i can't gain as much as before.\"<br>\r\n\"But all this food will be wasted.\"<br>\r\n\"It won't be wasted, it just means that there is more for Arya, speaking of Arya, there she is\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen had heard voices of how much Arya Stark had been fattened up, but she had dismissed them as exaggerations, some rumors said that lady stark was so fat that she couldn't stand for long periods of time, some said that her gut dropped below her knees, that she was developing a fourth chin and that she was so addicted to food that she was unable to spend a few moments without stuffing something down her almost nonexistent gullet; only after seeing with her own eyes Cersei accepted the truth, those were not rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei amazement quickly turned into excitement \" she must weight more than 500 pounds, is this the fate that awaits Margaery ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She could detect beef, onions, and some kind of spice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for being patient with me, Bo. I haven't cooked this in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Lauren, though I hope you don't mind if I wolf it down.

She moaned at the taste and quickly set the spoon down, picking up the bowl in both hands and starting to slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren watched, entranced herself as she watched Bo gulp, the loud noises, the movement of the liquid and meat down her throat, the slight reddening of her lover's stomach as the bowl was steadily drained. Her mind analyzed the sensations assaulting her as she watched Bo finished off the bowl and ladle out an even larger second serving. Their eyes met and for a moment Bo blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm really hungry. I'll slow down if you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I mean...no honey, just eat as much as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo's eyes flashed a shade of blue as she watched the arousal spike in Lauren, the succubus smirking a bit as she realized just what was turning her on. \"As much as I want, huh?\" Lauren nodded and Bo picked up the bowl, pouring it into Lauren's empty bowl and then dragging the whole pot in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Lauren helped a stuffed Bo into bed, the succubus grimacing and letting fly a loud belch as she rubbed her stomach. \"Ugh...so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you shouldn't eat so much so quickly. It's not good for your digestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you like it when I do this to myself don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit I find it very...arousing, but that shouldn't mean you should endanger your body just to please me, Bo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's work out a system then, one that ensures my health and your pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might not be fitting into your skintight leather outfits for much longer, Bo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo cupped the right side of Lauren's face and kissed her deeply. \"I don't care. After everything we've been through we can finally be together and I can treat you like you deserve and if you want a little more of me, then I'm fine with it. Besides, you know I don't have the healthiest diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but tell me the instant you don't feel good about this, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise, now after I digest, let's have some fun and then maybe you can feed me some of that ice cream in the fridge, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a revamp, or possible revisitation, Kenzi falls prey to the Russian Hag again, except this time, Baba Yaga selects a girl that she wants to eat and then spends days, weeks, possibly even months fattening them up with regular and possibly enchanted meals until she thinks they're big enough to devour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a recurring episode, of course, Baba Yaga could influence everyone to fatten Kenzi up for her until she's big enough to be taken back to her realm, or perhaps the hag could enter the human realm in order to finish her off. After all, Kenzi had Baba Yaga thrown into her own oven, and why wouldn't an incredibly powerful being want revenge on the one who spited her power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr how about some other fantastical curse? Maybe Kenzi finding something in one of Trick's spellbooks that goes horribly wrong~?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The resident household of the succubus and sidekick was abuzz with activity as they returned from a shopping trip at the mall, the latest one in the last couple of weeks during downtime between cases. Recently, Kenzi had taken to going clothes shopping after every week or so, claiming that she needed a fresh new wardrobe and that now was the time to get it, most of her clothes being ruined by the Fae cases that the duo was known for. Bo didn't mind the shopping of course; it was a relatively fun way to spend time together, and with such crazy work involved most of the time, a good time to relax. She didn't, however, think that their job was the cause of Kenzi's mysteriously dwindling wardrobe. As she sat on the couch in their dilapidated-looking property, she heard the crinkle of a bag of chips, a smirk forming on her face as she watched her friend walk back into the room with it and her new bag of clothes in tow. \"Hey Kenz, did anyone tell you it's not a good idea to eat and try on new threads at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth-dressed Kenzi stopped for a minute, looking over at Bo as the succubs peeked over the edge of the couch. She had put the clothes on the floor, and her cheeks were covered with crumbs, one hand still in the bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. Chewing once more, she gulped down the entire mouthful before shoving her hand back in the bag, holding up a huge handful of tortilla chips and showing them to her best friend before shoveling them into her mouth with a playful smirk. \"Mmmph, do I ever take normal fashion advice? A couple handfuls of chips aren't going to ruin my fitting! Besides, I still got the receipts. WE can take them back if we need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. That 'couple handfuls' of chips goes quite nicely with the beer you had last night, the shots, then the three or four chili dogs you somehow managed to eat today...\" the brunette ticked off, grinning wider now as Kenzi wiped her mouth off with a sleeve, looking incredulous at her and putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your information, it was FIVE! And fries. Okay, maybe I did eat a lot more than I'm supposed to, but come on! They were having a sale!\" Kenzi pouted before turning around. Finishing up the bag of chips, she gulped down the last handful and started ruffling through the bag by her feet, looking for her new pants. Bo could swear she could hear seams popping as she bent over, and Kenzi DID look a little fleshier. In fact, she looked a good deal fleshier. Maybe not fifty pounds but at least twenty or thirty. Bo could almost reach out and pinch a rather substantial sliver of blubber that was poking out over the waistband of those stressed pants, seams popping as Kenzi seemed to grow with every moment, every mouthful of food contributing to bubbles of adipose appearing on her frame. The succubus caught herself as she realized her hand had snaked out, inches from that little bit of fat, Kenzi's butt filling her pants a little TOO nicely. She had been eating quite a bit more these last few weeks, and it had coincided with her starting to go shopping more frequently. It didn't help that with each new run, Bo started noticing Kenzi physically growing if she ate too much. Not just a stuffed gut either, but actual fat filling her frame out. Backing off, she watched with interest as her gothic friend tugged off her pants, sighing happily as that constrictor was let loose. \"Aaaaah...much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know you any better, I'd say you were getting thick, Kenz.\" The snark in that remark caused her to perk up. Standing up straight and turning her head to face her best friend, the Russian girl huffed, her full, pale backside to Bo. Her eyes dropped to Kenzie's pert, larger cheeks, pale moons as big as melons and clad in a pair of violet panties that tugged at her skin and sank into the plush flesh. Her eyes roamed about her fattened hips and even her calves, noting that they all looked a little fuller. Even the curve of a pudgy stomach couldn't escape her eye. Despite knowing Kenzi was straight, and knowing that this kind of weight gain was a bit worrisome, some nagging voice in the back of her mind said, <i>I think she could be a little bigger...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenzi huffed as she shook the embarrassment of having Bo's eyes gaze up and down, the knowledge that her friend was a succubus little comfort in those roaming eyes. Putting one slender foot through a pant leg and dropping the other one in with ease, it looked like it was going to be an easy fit. But disaster struck as the goth pulled them up her creamy thighs, the tight pants cinching themselves around her swollen legs. Gaping in shock, Kenzi tried to haul them up, jumping up and down to try and force them over, grunting and twirling about with the effort. \"HRRRRRNGH! Come on! I just bought these today and they FIT at the mall! Unless....ugh! I'm gonna kill that clerk! she switched the pant sizes, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo could only watch the display mutely, occasionally raising a finger to ask or answer a question, but quickly withdrawing any input. The brunette couldn't help but think that with each bounce, that nagging little voice in her head kept chanting, <i>Bigger...bigger...bigger!</i> Her mind clouded and she quickly tried to think resolutely of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in a dark corner of the house that had enough view of the antics going on, a decrepit hand slid out of a mirror, silent as the grave. A soft, sinister cackle floated in the air as a finger pointed at Kenzi, glowing subtly with an air of dark power. A mysterious symbol appeared in front of it before dissipating into nothingness, the soft cackle dying out as the hand slid back into the mirror. Kenzi let out a yelp as she heard the pant seams split slightly, Bo watching as lightly as she could while her face grew red from the disastrous fitting. \"DAMN IT! I swear, Bo, don't you dare laugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, at your imitation of a Native American rain dance?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A pair of bulky asscheeks contained in a barely-fitting set of black lingerie danced in front of her, coupled to thunderous thighs that quaked and quivered with every sensual step. The short heeled boots she wore squeaked and groaned at the weight of their owner, the seams popping softly as she moved her hips in a sultry fashion, pillars of soft flesh clad in a pair of dark, fine fishnets. A rolling, pale gut descended down over her crotch, the girth rumbling softly, almost asking to be fed as it sagged over her dimpled knees, the topmost roll clad in a black corset that stretched up to heft her rather large, but modest bust up. Bo was entranced, the succubus in her delighting in the display as she sat bound to a chair, hands and legs bound and the brunette unable to move. Kenzi's plump face gazed down, full enough get rid of that curve, while slightly thicker fingers tugged at the garters and straps that held up her fishnets. She bit her lip as her raven-haired friend moved closer, sashaying her mammoth width left and right and causing the floor to creak under her girth. Was it just her, or was the fat...<i>growing?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow and sensual, Kenzi reached Bo before sliding into place, moving her gigantic legs around the brunette and depositing her huge rear in her lap. The Russian girl's brilliant eyes flashed back before a smile curled on her lips, her body rumbling. <i>Come on, say it. That little word on your lips. What, cat got your tongue? Or is the Goodyear Blimp that awe-inspiring?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boots creaked, and Bo swore she could hear seams snap. The weight was huge, soft, almost like marshmallow or warm dough that washed over her. Kenzi was bulking up bigger still, that poor, sexy outfit trying hard not to give up the ghost. But that word! That teasing word that rippled through her mind all night. Her lips were dry, and she licked them, her voice caught in her throat at the 600-pound behemoth that rested on her frame. Kenzi may have been diminutive, but the blubber rectified that, and then some. The monstrous thighs swelled, and she could feel them pressing against her torso. Heat rose to her cheeks, and she felt that same warmth enter between her thighs. Oh, it made her so weak! And Kenzi was leaning closer, waiting for the barest whisper. Bo had to give it. She wanted it, all of it, just for herself. Her voice came out as dry as dust, but filled with lust and desire, <i>Bigger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surge of growth erupted and Bo gasped as the air was squeezed from her lungs, face growing red and her mind clouded.over again. That unbelievably cuddly flesh filled her vision, and the weight had grown even heavier, softer, and warmer on her figure. She heard the boots and garters snap softly, the bulging figure of her friend far too large to contain. Kenzi smirked. <i>Say it again. You know I'm nowhere near where you want.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo knew it. Her heart ached. Her mind seethed at her, begging to her to release that one simple phrase. Those lips parted, the tongue complying as her will bent. <i>BIGGER.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus gasped as the dream dissipated, eyes going wide in shock as it cleared from the fog of sleep. That heavy, obese figure of Kenzi's could still be felt on her lap, and she took deep, relieving breaths, trying to escape from what she just experienced. No way...Kenzi was straight as an arrow, and no matter WHAT Bo thought of her, cute and sexy and all, she was not going to violate that. That was especially true now, considering that she seemed to be ballooning and eating for four or five! She was lucky; her goth friend had passed out after a thrashing escapade with the clothes, each new outfit or garment seemingly too small for her once svelte frame. Eventually, she had gorged herself silly on some fudge brownie ice cream with Bo and passed out, and was sleeping soundly in the next room. Thank god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo's face went red as her thoughts traveled back to the dream, and saw the sun-eclipsing cheeks lower themselves, quivering softly, engorged with soft adipose and craving more. She couldn't bear it; Kenzi looked quite a bit better with a few more pounds in the right places, but that...for some reason, the sight of the Russian girl made huge liquefied her insides and made her crave something almost primal. It was worse than it was when she was with Dyson! Even Lauren couldn't hold a candle to this sort of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But she needs to be bigger...so much bigger. Maybe after this little growth episode is over, she might swing another way~?</i> The voice in her head rationalized. Bo shook her head again, rubbing at her temples and trying to shoo the voice away. It was still there and, despite barely holding any water, she was starting to cling to that little bit of hope. But, of course, something had to be done. This current state was reversible. She needed to make it not so for a great length of time. Couple months, maybe. No, more. She needed her to be the perfect size. No way six or seven hundred pounds was perfect. She needed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she thinking?! She hardly knew. Yet, her body knew what to do as her legs slid off the bed, the succubus drifting through the house down to the kitchen again. Kenzi was dead asleep, so she wouldn't hear a thing. Nor would she feel anything, if what her body was up to made any sense. First, her arm reached up and opened the freezer, grabbing the bucket of ice cream that Kenzi hadn't been able to finish. Next came something she thought was a bit odd: a small bottle labeled 'essence of A. Muscaria.' This, along with a spoon, she grabbed in order to take it up to Kenzi's room and perform a little bit of 'night feeding' for her growing friend. A pinch of this, the little voice nagged, and normally she'd be tripping. But a specially prepared liquefied form from a Fae apothecary? It had an enlarging effect in this state that would make Kenzi's current weight gain look like a celebrity crying over one or two pounds. Maybe not so extreme right off the bat, but given how it would increase the Russian girl's appetite as well as enhance the qualities of the food she ate? Well, Kenzi would be crying about how she couldn't find a decent pair of boots in stores yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding into Kenzi's room, the brunette found her bloated friend laying belly-up, another ten or so pounds giving the Russian girl a fuller gut. Currently, she was sleeping in a top that let her belly free, her panties swallowed underneath the bulging mound. Bo was about to lose it. Despite knowing Kenzi's preferences, something was pulling her forward, telling her to stroke that full surface and then suckle on toes that were obviously just a little plumper. Her face was beet red and she was panting heavily, hands shaking. She needed to finish this quickly. Putting the bucket of ice cream down, she unscrewed the cap of the essence bottle deftly before pouring it into the raven-haired girl's mouth, the bottle's contents sliding down without a trace. Sighing with relief,  she watched as Kenzi seemed to pork up just a bit more, stomach rumbling softly as it demanded a midnight meal. The succubus was more than willing to comply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the bucket of ice cream, she took out a large scoop and dipped it into Kenzi's mouth, worried that the cold might wake her up. The secondary effects of the essence, however, prevented such a thing from happening. The raven-haired troublemaker was sound asleep, blissful rest the only thing on her mind. Her body, however, was more than accepting of Bo's offering. When the spoon dipped into her mouth with a chunk of ice cream, her lips wrapped around it and quickly sucked off the frozen treat, her throat clenching and her throat humming as it was devoured. Bo watched in awe as her body seemed to grow ever so slightly, the sleepwear threads moaning softly at the increased bulk of its owner. The essence worked quickly, far more quickly than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dipped the spoon back into the fudge brownie mix, repeating the movements with barely-held excitement. This was perfect; just enough to make Kenzi shrug it off, but more than enough to make sure that it didn't just melt away at the end. Again, Kenzi's body eagerly accepted the proffered scoop of ice and that soft wave of new flesh appeared on her frame. Bo wanted to squeeze the newly-fattening belly, but held back; she didn't want to wake her friend amidst this lovely evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the spoon dove into the mix again, each spoonful lovingly ladled into Kenzi's awaiting mouth, to be gulped up in her sleep. By the morning, she might notice, but Bo had a backup plan indeed. One that involved a bit more shopping to keep this ruse up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fattened Kenzi groaned as her phone alarm went off at the usual-ish noon, the electronic device vibrating and ringing loud enough to wake the dead in her groggy opinion. A fat arm flopped against the bedspread as she reached a chubby hand over towards the offending item, the tips of her fingers touching the barest edge of the phone before she let out a groan of frustrated from between her chubby cheeks. Touching it twice more, she seethed before rolling over onto her plush side with a heave of force, slamming her plump palm on top of the phone triumphantly before keying in her password and shutting the irritating racket off. Black hair splayed all over her face, she huffed a little, brilliant eyes peering out from underneath strands of her bangs. She smacked her lips once, quirking them and lapping at the cusp, the Russian girl rousing a bit more. \"Man, that must've been some really strong fudge brownie ice cream...oh god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her swollen chest, clad in a snug shirt that highlighted them on her once trim frame, and her eyes set sight upon tubby arms which led into thickened forearms and her plusher palms. Her right hand moved back as she craned her head to look down at her bulging middle, a fattened pot belly pouring out from her waist and tinted the color of fresh dough, the chunky digits meeting the curve of her adipose-packed rear and causing her to gasp deeply in the horror of her revelation. Bulky thighs rubbed together as she drew them in, Kenzi sitting up as she took full stock of her ballooned figure. She could even tell that her feet had plumped, and her underwear fit far too snugly into the crest of her bloated hips and the hidden plain of her crotch, belly pouring over it. A rough estimate would put her around 250ish pounds...just how much did she eat yesterday?! \"Oh god I'm fat...maybe Bo's right...maybe I've been eating way too much...My svelte, adorable little frame! My cute button buns! My...well, I have to say the chest is an improvement, but still! My trim, flat tummy! I knew I had put on some weight, but come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...maybe I can get a return! Maybe I got a size too small this time...too small for marshmallow thighs anyway!\" Kenzi blurted as she swung her plump calves over, wincing as she felt her thighs wobble and her plump gut settle into her bulging lap. Staring at the bag of clothes from yesterday, the raven-haired woman slid a pair of socks on for her bootwear, muttered something about having balloon toes now thanks to her recently gained weight before standing up and walking over, her thighs brushing against one another but not quite enough for a waddle yet. Still, the feeling caused her to whimper as she began to dig through the bag, feeling a breeze tickle the bulk of her ripe rump as it quivered, her black panties starting to sink into the cleft between the two pale moons. Dragging out the pair of pants that she tried on before, she stared at the garment and eyed it up and down, rubbing the luxurious denim fabric between her fingers and biting her lip. \"Well...m-moment of truth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to slide the garment on, she shivered as the fabric rubbed against her overly generous thighs, waiting for the point where the too-small pants legs would seize upon her pillowy legs and refuse to budge any further. As she pulled them up past the halfway mark, however, there was no resistance at all. Her worried face quickly turned to one of shock as she felt the pants slide over her bulging legs and wrap itself around her waist, a perfect fit with room to move and the fabric more than stretchy enough to allow her newly acquired bulk to breathe. Looking down in disbelief, she pushed them down and pulled them up again, hiking them as high as she could before buttoning them perfectly beneath the round swell of her thick middle. Licking her lips for a minute as she tried to comprehend how this could've happened, considering she struggled so hard yesterday to get them even a third of the way up her thunderous thighs, Kenzi reached in the bag and grabbed one of her new tops, shimmying into it with a fervor to ensure she hadn't gone totally bonkers. Like before, the dark fabric hugged her newfound curves well, but was comfortable, allowing her fat to breath despite the clothes being in her normal vein of style which tended to constrict the body if they happened to be slightly too thick...\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving put on her magically-fitting outfit and even her beloved new boots with ease, Kenzi walked down the steps towards their open living room and dining area, a bit put off as she felt her thighs jiggle and quake with excess blubber. Her tummy was irritating too, a thick roll which just screamed 'fatty,' though she knew her lower half was a dead giveaway thanks to a quick peek in the mirror. Stepping onto the floor, she caught sight of Bo, who was busy thumbing away at the computer, a smile on her face as her raven-haired friend finally roused from sleep. The succubus folded her arms on the counter, leaning over with a smug grin, \"Afternoon, sunshine! I thought you'd never wake up after that fudge brownie coma you put yourself into. Did the Russian bear hibernate peacefully?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth stuck her tongue out as she came over, the smell of something delicious and familiar in the air dulling her senses for a moment as her stomach let out a low grumble of hunger. Sliding to the opposite side of the counter where Bo was, Kenzi folded her own arms, huffing. \"If you must know, the chocolate coma was really good, but I didn't like waking up to the Stay Puft marshmallow gut that I got overnight. I mean, you must've seen me! I'm HUGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been under a lot of stress, Kenz. Maybe your drinking binges managed to catch up to you,\" Bo offered, trying hard not to laugh as Kenzi snorted but quickly turned back to glaring. Seeing her occasionally turn around, trying to find the source of the familiar scent, the brunette smirked again as she pulled out a plate of bacon, eggs and freshly made buttermilk pancakes soaked with syrup, everything on the platter screaming 'OH MY GOD, EAT ME!' to the thickened girl. The goth's jaw dropped and she stared at the meal, then back to Bo, pointing at it and back to herself with a thicker finger. Bo snickered, before nodding, pushing the plate towards her. \"Think of it as an apology for all the jokes I'm going to hit you with today. And all the walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenzi immediately set on the bacon, stuffing a slice of the greasy fried pork into her mouth and moaning at the taste. Oh, it was brown sugar-soaked...! She was in heaven! Screw the fattiness, a dozen or so more pounds was more than worth the awesomeness of five strips of bacon. Rolling her eyes in bliss, she gulped down the mouthful, waving her hand, \"Oh Bo, all the fat jokes are on me today because this is absolutely fantastic and did I tell you how much I love you? God, this bacon is bacon-TASTIC, it's so good-wait. Walking? Muffintop shortstuff doesn't like the sound of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small printout was placed before Kenzi, detailing the loss of one valued pet...the likes of which was unheard of in the normal human realm. Looking at the page and the details, she looked up again at Bo as she snacked on another thick slice of pork, tugging at her pants slightly. \"We're going looking for some lady's mystical fae pet which could probably eat us alive or give us some horrible disease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It's our new job today. So as soon as you're finished, we're going to go investigating, and then we'll stop by the Dal on our way back,\" Bo answered, the grin growing wider as Kenzi made a displeased face as she scarfed down the meal. She could almost see the curve of her stomach as it fluffed up a bit more, the essence she gave her working wonders on her figure. She licked the corner of her lips, trying to make it seem she was just excited for the job, and being a bit mischievous at the raven-haired Russian's weighty misfortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but you owe me dinner for the amount of physical labor this is gonna entail! I don't want to admit it, but being thicker has the downside of getting tired out a LOT faster. On the upside, I can drink even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went fairly uneventfully...except for Kenzi's unequivocal snacking, which Bo was secretly more than happy to oblige for. At every corner stop across the city, the tubbified goth asked Bo for a snack to keep up her 'energy,' though it wasn't really a lie: being twice as heavy as she was before put a strain on her stamina, and she wasn't the greatest of trekkers before. Besides, the problem grew slightly worse as Kenzi plumped further, the essence working its way into her system and making her hunger rise with a bit more added weight on top for every morsel she consumed. Sitting at 270 pounds now, her clothes a bit more snug, Kenzi plopped onto a chair at the Dal Riata's bar, wincing a bit as the chair creaked. Trick, the bar's owner, raised an eyebrow at the thickened Kenzi before making his way over to her, wiping a glass out with a rag. He smiled at her, seeing her tired face and chuckling a little. \"Bo wore you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you have no idea...we spent all day chasing this crazy lady's pet...whatever it is. Like the computer couldn't even figure out what it was. She's coming, she's just finishing up a call with the client...\" Kenzi muttered, head laying on the counter. Her stomach rumbled and she blushed, Trick looking a bit taken aback. \"Sorry, Trickster. Been having cravings all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved it off, looking at her a bit worriedly. \"Well, after you've been around the town, I would think so. Want something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...mind getting me a couple huge bowls of those chili cheese fries you make? Or...maybe just make it a tossing bowl-sized order...and some beer? I need a cooler...\" Kenzi replied, looking up at Trick with puppy dog eyes that he couldn't bear to disappoint. He smiled again and nodded before heading back, a bit worried...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From what it looks like, those clothes fit this morning but they're already cinching up. Something's not right...\" The diminutive bartender mused, loathe to indulge what is clearly a problem that might have a connection to the Fae but finding that he really didn't have a choice. If she had been eating all day while they were out, it wouldn't have mattered what kind of food she was eating; she would've just eaten even more. \"I'll see if I can't get Bo to ask Lauren to examine her. She might've picked up something from their latest job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrepping Kenzi's absurdly large order with ease, it didn't take Trick too long to finish it, ladling on the well-known chili recipe for the Dal and adding a queso blend to the freshly fried spuds. He set the enormous bowl of chili cheese fries down on the counter, moving over to grab the Russian goth a tankard of good quality brew for her to guzzle down with the salty treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouldn't have left it unprotected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pipe rattled in the kitchen before letting out an ungainly hiss, a black miasma pouring from the minute break in the coupling before bleeding into the Dal. The telltale manifestation of Baba Yaga's power went unnoticed for the precious minutes Trick spent preparing Kenzi's drink, the old hag's spell detecting its target before diving towards the serving of fries. It soaked into food, working its malfested energy into the very substance of the meal, altering its properties so it was fit to fatten up Baba Yaga's greatest meal. Everything seemed to double or even triple in size, grease becoming evident as a film on the cheese and chili, the bowl once full now positively overflowing with even more of the fattening dish. The lightest wisp of smoke from the spell managed to cut itself off the process, knowing there was another part of the meal it could taint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wisp was barely noticeable by Trick, who stepped back into the kitchen with his brow furrowed. He thought he detected something unseemly with the warding on the Dal, but whatever it was had been too faint for him to really pinpoint its source. Seeing its opportunity, the wisp darted out towards the bar, finding the large tankard of beer the bar owner had set out for the intended victim and summarily dunking itself in with the barest hint of a splash. Unable to find the source of the disturbance, Trick grimaced before grabbing the even larger serving of chili fries, making a note that he should've cut down on Kenzi's portion anyway, even if she was still hungry afterwards. \"Alright Kenz, here you go. An extra-large helping of chili fries and a beer on the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bright eyes lit up with glee at the sight of the dish, stomach rumbling as she caught a whiff of the tainted meal. Famished eyes tracked the beer as it was planted next to the supersized serving, Kenzi licking her lips and trying her best not to snatch the food out of Trick's hands. He was giving her a meal on her tab today; she could be a little more patient. \"Thanks, Trick. God, I've been needing this all day. Come to mama-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a couple of cheese-and-chili-coated fries, bloated from the Russian Crone's magic and popped them into her mouth, the fries almost as thick as her chubby fingers. A soft moan escaped her lips as the tainted fries coated her tastebuds, the spell amplifying the flavor to almost ambrosial levels of goodness, hooking her slowly-transforming, gluttonous tongue on anything Baba Yaga corrupted. \"Mmmph, so goooood...Trick outdid himself this time! I don't know what he put in these, but they're <i>so</i> delicious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith not another word, the gothic woman began to stuff her face like she had been doing all day, except this time it was frantic and almost needy stuffing, hands grabbing three or four fries at a time before shoveling them between her plump lips, hardly pausing in the meantime for a spot of enchanted beer to wash away the saltiness. Kenzi gorged obsessively on the spuds, groaning with obvious delight as the fattening meal filled up her belly even further. And fill it did. While the pear-shaped troublemaker plowed into her cursed food, the curse put upon it by Baba Yaga began to show its true colors. Her tummy rumbled, and with a satisfied groan as another handful passed into her maw, her stomach lurched outwards and her clothes creaked, Kenzi starting to grow fatter with every morsel she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few chips, slathered in cheese and chili. A deep grumble grasped at her form, and it swelled outwards, already enormous thighs and hips beginning to inch over the side of the bar chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft moans of gluttonous satisfaction. A few threads snapping as her arms added a couple inches to their girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swig of beer. Her additional chin and cheeks thickened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavenous gulps and the delighted suckling of fingers. Her pants button popped, and her navel grew deeper as her gut rolled outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More.</i> Bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More!</i> Fatter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More!</i> Wider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't get enough!</i> Her belly smushed up against the bar counter and turgid upper arms split her shirt sleeves and hoodie, while great big rips erupted along the seam of per pants to let thick bubbles of pearly flesh spill through, steadily bulging out bigger and bigger as she devoured the cursed food. Her fingers grew thicker before her eyes, and yet she didn't stop, even as she felt her cheeks quiver a little more with every glorious bite she took. Her rapidly growing figure made a symphony of gurgles, creaks, and pops as her body rumbled with each wave of blubber added to her frame, boot buckles snapping as her calves grew too wide for the buckles to hold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was an apt description for the formerly dimunitive Russian girl, it would've been \"Balloon!\" Her ass swelled against the seat of her pants and spilled over the back of the bar chair, while girthy hips and bloated lovehandles began to wash over the sides, pouring outwards as she blew up with lard. She leaned back and gave a slightly stifled belch, her belly blubber quaking as it rose towards the lip of the bar. Grasping the beer in a thick hand, she guzzled the rest of it down like a man dying of thirst before shoving the last handful of between her bulging cheeks, chewing slowly with her face flush with the utter gratification of having a full gut, not caring as her bright eyes watched while her body puffed outwards and her heaving weight made the stool shriek in agony.The feeling of being glut like a pig was very, <i>very</i> enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until her weight bubbled out to a whopping three hundred and thirty pounds and the stool finally had enough. A particularly loud series of <b>SNAP!</b> was heard before her eyes grew as big as dinner plates, Kenzi latching onto her engorged belly with plumper hands sinking into full flesh. \"Uh-oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truly heavy weight goth yelped as her vast rear crashed loudly against the floor as she toppled the four feet from sitting, the flattened remains of the Dal Riata's seat underneath her hefty derriere. Jiggling for a moment, she let out a louder belch, the fall having jostled her insides, face going from red to the teensiest bit green. \"Urp...uh...Trick? Can you...can you put this on my tab too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the shadows a rather admiring gaze came from Bo, her electric blue eyes staring at Kenzi almost ravenously, a bead of sweat on her forehead. She just looked so delicious plumping up like that.... </span></div></div>",

Cat clapped her hands giddily, and even Jade's expression betrayed a hint of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auditions are this Friday in the auditorium, scripts will be provided, no need to prepare anything.\" Sikowitz told them. \"Best of luck to all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further questions were prevented by the discordant notes of the bell, signalling the end of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nUPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Can't believe I get to audition for Melissa Beaujolais! What a great opportunity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling: Blessed \ud83d\ude07<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I got the part?\" Tori asked, her eyes wide with surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, then said in a hushed tone. \"Could you follow me please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tori had arrived that morning, it seemed like the entire female population of Hollywood Arts was trying out. She had to wait in line for three hours, nervously going over the script they had handed her at the registration desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short monologue, featuring a young woman named Melody, who was struggling to rebuild her life after having a baby at age 17. Tori memorised it in ten minutes flat, and spent the rest of the time thinking about how she would perform it. After all the time waiting the audition itself felt like it was only a few seconds long, briefly stepping in and out of the spotlight on the darkened auditorium stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had only been off the stage a few seconds when Melissa's PA took her by the arm, telling her she had got the part. She barely had time to process this before she was whisked back into the school, down the bright corridors of Hollywood Arts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise the PA stopped right outside Sikowitz's classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would please wait in here, Melissa will be with you shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori nodded and thanked him, opening the door and stepping inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tori!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was sitting on the edge of the raised stage area, swinging her legs back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat? What are you doing in here?\" Tori asked, walking up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smiled. \"I got the part, so they asked me to wait in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori shook her head. \"No, Cat, you must have gotten confused. I got the part...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened, and they looked over at it. Jade walked in, a satisfied smile fading from her face as soon as she saw Cat and Tori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess.\" Tori said, piecing it together. \"You also got the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade just scowled, folding her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nUPDATE <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Good news- I got the part. Less good news- I wasn't the only one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling: Confused \ud83d\ude15<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was close to twenty minutes before Melissa Beaujolais finally appeared, bringing her PA with her. She was in her late twenties, cropped blonde hair and thick framed black glasses, and was wearing a black vest over a voluminous white blouse and ripped blue jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're all wondering what's going on.\" She said, apologetically, once they had introduced themselves and taken a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Jade said, unable to keep her annoyance in check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, the thing is...\" Melissa broke off, turning to her assistant. \"Where's the other one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other one?\" Jade and Tori said simultaneously, just as the door burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, your star is here! I just had to powder my nose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina bustled in and sat down before she even noticed the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you buttlicks doing here?\" She asked, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade snorted. \"Us? What are you doing here you no-talent b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, please!\" Melissa said, raising her voice. \"Trina, I was just about to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and began to pace around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were each told you got the part, and believe me, each time I genuinely meant it. When I saw your auditions, every time I thought 'we've found our Melody'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"You all brought such a different energy to the role. Cat, you really found Melody's innocence, while Jade, you give her this real undercurrent of darkness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat giggled bashfully and Jade smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Tori, you really understood Melody's sadness that she would never achieve her dreams. And of course, Trina, you just have this, I don't know, call it je ne sais quoi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori looked sideways at her sister. \"Yeah, I guess you could call it that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... who gets the part?\" Cat said, asking the obvious question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sat back down. \"I don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked lost in thought, until her assistant cleared his throat, snapping her out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're going to have another round of auditions, just the four of you, a month from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a month?\" Tori asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled. \"Well, there is another thing. You see, I really want this movie to be as realistic as possible. Now, in the movie, Melody has just had a baby, and is also struggling with depression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Trina said brusquely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, whoever gets the part, is going to need to put on some weight.\" Melissa told them. \"At least thirty to forty pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls had a similar reaction, jaws dropping and eyes popping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty to forty pounds?\" Tori asked incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded. \"It needs to look real. It needs to feel real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all looked at each other. This role could be the opportunity of a life time, but the cost had suddenly gotten much higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged. \"Look, I don't want to pressure anyone, but if you want the role, this is part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, pausing to shake each of their hands. \"I'll see you in a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she was gone, bringing her assistant with her. There was silence in the room for a minute and a half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw her.\" Jade said suddenly. \"I'm not getting fat just to maybe get a part in some movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Tori said, but without much conviction. She looked for more support. \"Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was nervously chewing her hair, and didn't seem to have heard the question. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina looked at them scornfully. \"Fine by me. If you all wimp out, it just makes it that much easier for me to get the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade growled menacingly, but Trina ignored her, flouncing out of the room with her head held high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three remaining girls shared a glance. What should they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had been a long day, and they weren't in the mood for singing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're definitely making the right decision.\" Tori said, unprompted, after a few minutes of silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure.\" Jade agreed. \"There'll be other parts, in other movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat nodded. \"Yeah, I'm sure another director will want to offer us all movie parts any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was being sincere, as only Cat could, but it suddenly caused the mood at the table to darken. Thankfully the waiter arrived to distract them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three diet colas, and the spicy salmon sharing platter, got it.\" He said once he had taken their order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Tori said, just as he turned to leave. \"You know what? Make mine a regular cola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade looked at her, tilting her head to the side. \"Sure, why not?\" She said, after a pause. \"Make mine a regular too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too please.\" Cat said, glancing from Tori to Jade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter nodded and scribbled something down on his pad, before moving briskly towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls all smiled at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot how much I love the food here.\" Tori said conversationally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, it's the best.\" Cat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade nodded. \"I might just order some of that Shrimp Yaki Yaki when the waiter gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls smiled at each other again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nUPDATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Hanging with my girls at Nozu. Can you really ever have too much sushi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling: Hungry \ud83d\ude0b<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ordered the Miso soup?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me!\" Tori called out, her mouth full of spicy tuna and rice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the Unagi Surprise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here!\" Jade said, clearing some space in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get another free refill?\" Cat asked, holding up her empty glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spicy salmon platter had barely lasted five minutes, the three girls attacking it in a frenzy of rapidly clicking chopsticks. There had been twenty five pieces of carefully prepared sushi, and Tori, Jade and Cat had gobbled down eight pieces each. The last piece had been the source of some dispute, until the waiter distracted them by arriving with the individual dishes they had ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was back with the third round of orders, his amazement growing at how much these three petite girls were packing away. By the time he returned with the redhead's refill, the other two were both holding out their own empty glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh, what desserts do you have tonight?\" Tori asked him with a slight hiccup, having already slurped down most of her soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, we have mochi, traditional Japanese ice-cream, in vanilla, strawberry and chocolate.\" He said, hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have one of each flavour.\" Jade ordered, spraying him with bits of half-chewed eel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, urp, too.\" Cat said with a small burp, handing him back her once again empty glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori, her mouth full of noodles, nodded to signal that she wanted the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the waiter had left, and the last few morsels of food were eaten, a relative calm descended on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls were feeling very full, their bloated stomachs making their clothes uncomfortably tight. <br>\r\nTori had a few grains of rice sticking to her chin, Jade's mouth was shiny with sauce and oil, and Cat's left eye was twitching from all the sugary soda she had consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade belched, clasping a hand to her mouth in embarrassment. Cat giggled, only to let out a belch of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori, carefully stifling a belch, was about to say something about how silly this whole thing was, when suddenly they all noticed the piece of sushi sitting at the centre of the table, the sole survivor of the original spicy sharing platter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shared intake of breath, all three girls grabbed for the sushi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of scrabbling and squawking, it was Tori who emerged the winner, clutching the slightly battered piece of sushi in her fist. She popped it in her mouth and chewed victoriously, licking some of the wasabi that had been smeared across her wrist in the scuffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter, who had watched this silently from three feet away, cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mochi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Turns out you can have too much sushi... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling: Queasy\ud83d\ude13<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good morning sleepyhead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori had woken up later than usual, having been kept up by the gurgling and groaning of her overstuffed stomach. Eventually she wandered downstairs, still wearing her blue pajamas, to find her family sitting around the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents were sipping coffee, their plates already emptied aside from a few crumbs. Trina was still eating, methodically working her way through a tall stack of pancakes, each bite drenched in maple syrup and melted butter. Tori, still half-asleep up to that point, suddenly remembered the events of yesterday evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter somehow cramming dessert into their painfully overstuffed bellies and paying the painfully large check, Tori, Cat and Jade had driven home in relative silence, aside from the occasional burp or moan. They dropped Tori off in her driveway, leaving her to stagger into her house alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she found Trina lounging on the couch nearest to the door, apparently asleep. Her eyes were shut, her head tilted back against a cushion, a thin string of drool hanging from her open mouth. There was an empty pizza box next to her, spotted with greasy residue and globs of congealed cheese. An empty two-liter bottle of soda lay crumpled on the floor in front of her. Her spangly silver top was pulled up, exposing the taut, tan skin of her hugely swollen stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori thought that she was about as bloated as a person could be, but her sister looked like she had swallowed a basketball. Judging by the size of the box and the size of her belly, that pizza must have been the size of a bicycle wheel. Unable to resist, Tori crept forward and poked Trina, just above her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started slightly but didn't woken up, so Tori was bold enough to place her whole hand on her sister's swollen stomach, feeling its warmth. It was tight as a drum, and she smacked it lightly. The noise it made was more like a thud than a boing, showing just how full Trina was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hand back down, she began to move it in small circles, marvelling at how smooth the skin felt. Trina let out a little noise in response, just a slightly elongated exhale. Intrigued, Tori rubbed some more, a little harder this time, drawing a moan from between Trina's parted lips. She spread her fingers out and squeezed gently, and this time Trina burped, the escaping gas bringing the scent of cheese and tomato sauce with it. Yet still she didn't wake up. Tori stifled a giggle, wrinkling her nose at the smell, and continued to rub and stroke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sound from outside that finally broke the spell. It was just a car passing by, but for a panicked second Tori thought it was her parent's coming home. Glancing up she caught her reflection in the darkened glass of the house's rear windows. There she was, practically massaging her sister's swollen gut, her own bloated belly jutting out over the waistband of her jeans. She blushed, very glad that her parents hadn't chosen that moment to come home. She had scurried upstairs as quickly as she could, which wasn't very quickly at all, leaving Trina on the couch, snoring softly, none the wiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tori? Sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's concerned tone brought her back to the present. She looked again at Trina, who was munching away unconcernedly at her breakfast. Seeing this, Tori felt a rumble in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any pancakes left?\" She asked hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey, your sister got the last batch.\" Her dad told her, before returning to his newspaper. Behind his back Trina looked up and smiled smugly, her cheeks bulging with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty of fruit.\" Her mom suggested. \"And there's some of that low-fat yoghurt in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori frowned, ignoring her mother as she began to look through the kitchen cabinets. Sugar cereal, some poptarts, maybe a banana or two to bulk it out a little... She had to catch up with Trina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe assembled her breakfast, using chocolate milk instead of skim on her cereal, and grabbing a jar of peanut butter. As she sat down at the table her parents exchanged a look but said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" her mom began as Tori spooned cereal into her mouth. \"Pretty exciting news about Trina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori looked up and swallowed. \"What news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got the part in that Melissa Beaujolais movie.\" Her mom said, patting Trina's arm proudly. \"Didn't she tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori shot her sister a withering glare. So that was how she wanted to play it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was a pretty big surprise to all of us.\" She said, after crunching down another mouthful of cereal. This would just make it all the sweeter when she got the part, not Trina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled even wider, probably having doubted the veracity of Trina's claims until Tori seemingly confirmed them. She patted Trina's arm again and gave Tori's shoulder a quick squeeze of consolation, before getting up and clearing her empty plate away. Their dad followed suit, adding an attagirl for Trina and a next time, kiddo for Tori. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone, the two sisters continued to eat. Tori finished her cereal and poured a second bowl, pausing to take a bite from a poptart. Trina was mopping the plate with her last bit of pancake, before popping it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" She said as she stood up. \"I am fu-ull!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori looked up at her sister's stomach. It was looking pretty round, she must have eaten plenty of pancakes, but it wasn't even half the size it had been last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a belly rub...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori's spoon froze halfway to her mouth, but Trina didn't even look at her, simply traipsing out of the kitchen, leaving her plate and cutlery for Tori to clean up. Had she been awake after all? Or was it just a coincidence? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori decided to ignore it. She had bigger things to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Three bowls of cereal, five poptarts, two bananas and three cups of coffee.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tori wasn't feeling great when she arrived at Hollywood Arts on Monday morning. The weekend had passed in a blur of eating, napping, snacking, lazing around, and even more eating. Her stomach was constantly bloated, pressing against the inside of her shirts and the waistband of her pants. Every time she felt like giving up or even just taking a break, there was Trina, somehow still happily gorging away on whatever she could get her hands on. Their mother had gone grocery shopping on Sunday morning, and by my hat evening found there was no food left to make dinner with. They had ended up ordering Chinese food,, with Tori matching Trina bite for bite, egg roll for egg roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for what? Tori had stepped in the scales that morning, wrapped in just a towel, and found out she had only gained a pound and a half. When she got downstairs she found her sister  devouring a huge  plate of bacon and eggs, and she could swear that Trina   already looked fatter. With a sigh she had piled her own plate high and dug in. She may not have gotten results yet but until she came up with a new strategy it  was better than nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just wondering how the others were finding it when she spotted Cat and Jade loitering by their lockers. Neither one looked any fatter, but maybe she was expecting too much. As she walked closer she did notice both girl's stomachs looked swollen, suggesting they had also been doing their best to put on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" Tori said  casually. \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible.\" Cat said with a pout. \"I only gained two pounds, and my tummy feels like it's going to explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade nodded sourly, her overstuffed belly letting out an angry  gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Tori said with a sigh. \"This is way harder than I thought it would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stood there commiserating, Trina strutted past, chomping down a breakfast burrito roughly the size of a football. All three of the younger girls stared at her, and her hugely bloated stomach, with a mixture of anger and amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that even possible?\" Jade asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori frowned. \"She's always been incredibly driven and also incredibly greedy. I guess those two personality traits just aligned perfectly for this incredibly bizarre situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discordant school bells rang suddenly, and the overstuffed trio continued to grumble as they hurried to class, making an extended stop at the vending machines along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Never thought I'd be wishing class would last longer so I wouldn't have to go to go to lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling: Full \ud83d\ude23<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the days went by, each of the girls began to devise their own strategies for gaining weight, with varying degrees of success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat decided quickly that her poor little tummy couldn't handle the vast amount of food she'd been trying to force into it, and that she hated the feeling of being so full. Instead she switched to a mostly liquid diet, and was rarely seen without an extra-large Big Slurp filled with some sort of sweet and fattening soda. She would still get full, but she preferred the feeling of a sloshing stomach to one packed with food, and the constant sugar rush helped too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the most effective method of putting on weight, and by the end of the week she had only gained a few more pounds, rounding her flat stomach out slightly. And that wasn't the only drawback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Yonders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollywood Arts history teacher sighed, as her explanation of the Emancipation Proclamation was interrupted once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now Ms Grant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat smiled pleadingly. \"I have to go the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Yonders shook her head. \"No way, you've already been three times in the last half hour. I don't know what you're playing at but it ends now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat bit her lip as class resumed. She wasn't playing at anything, she really did have to go, just like the last three times. It probably didn't help that every trip to the bathroom included a stop at a vending machine to chug a few more cans of Wahoo Punch. Now her bloated belly was pressing against the edge of her desk, while the haze of high fructose corn syrup made it impossible to pay attention to the lesson. She tried to focus, but she was too aware of everything around her,  from the ticking of the clock to the gurgling of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted in her seat, pressing her slim thighs together tightly under her skirt, trying to keep her breathing regular. The pressure was growing inside her with every passing second, and she started making quiet little noises of distress. Mrs Yonders didn't seem to notice, continuing to give her lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so, while it was originally intended as a mere stopgap solution, the Emancipation Proclamation took on a much greater meaning, as a signal of freedom, a great relaxation of tension, a long-awaited release.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat couldn't take it anymore and jumped to her feet, knocking her desk back into the row behind her. She ran for the door, as fast as she could with her legs still held together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorrysorrysorrygottagobye!\" She yelled as she barrelled out of the door, leaving Mrs Yonders shaking her head in bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat waddled awkwardly towards the girl's bathroom. If she didn't get there soon, at least she had a spare pair of panties in her gym locker.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade was already tired of needing to eat all the time, so decided instead to simply have one meal a day, as long as it was an absolutely huge one. A pan of lasagne with garlic bread and a gallon of ice-cream one night. A roast chicken with buttery mashed potatoes and an entire apple pie the next. Then half a dozen spicy burritos with extra beans, extra cheese and extra guacamole. Supplemented with a few snacks during the day, she figured she would soon start packing on the pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jade's idea was sound, it was the execution that let her down. Try as she might she just couldn't manage to pack away all the food she set out for herself in just one sitting. The pan was still half full of lasagne when she finally dropped her fork, and she barely made a dent in the ice-cream. She finished most of the chicken but blanched at the potatoes, and felt sick two slices into the pie. She just about  managed to finish four of the burritos, then spent the whole night tossing and turning, trying to relieve the pressure in her bubbling gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving hardly gained any weight all week, Jade realised she was going to need some outside help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to say, as your boyfriend, I'm not a big fan of this.\" Beck said as they pulled into an empty parking spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just to say, as your girlfriend, shut up.\" Jade responded. \"You said you'd help me get this part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeck sighed. \"I thought that meant helping you run lines or something, not helping you eat a dozen cheeseburgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Friday night, and they were in Jade's car, having just pulled out of the Inside-Out Burger drivethru. Two paper bags practically bulging with burgers sat in Beck's lap, along with a tray holding two extra-large sodas and two extra-large milkshakes. All of it was for Jade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Jade repeated, turning the engine off and unbuckling her seatbelt. \"Now give me the first burger. And remember, I have to eat all of them, don't let me stop. If you do, I'll n-urmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by Beck shoving the unwrapped burger into her mouth, causing her cheeks to balloon outwards. She shot him a glare but still chewed and swallowed, grabbing it out his hand before taking another bite. Beck smiled, despite himself. At least as long as she was eating, she wasn't ordering him around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade made slow but steady progress through the first bag of burgers, washing each one down with a gulp of soda or milkshake. Her stomach grew steadily too, as the solid mass of food inside it swelled bigger and bigger with each bite. Beck watched with a curiosity that occasionally crossed over into fascination, especially when she reached down and undid her jeans, giving her belly more room to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the seventh burger, Jade was starting to flag, chewing more slowly and taking longer between each bite. The eighth burger took even longer, and when Beck tried to hand her the ninth she just sat there, breathing heavily and gingerly rubbing her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Beck said, unable to hide an amused smirk. \"Just four more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade didn't reply, just shooting him a venomous glare, followed by an equally toxic belch. Beck, after cracking a window, was willing to just let it go, but then he hesitated. Jade might be mad now, but he figured she'd be even madder tomorrow if he didn't make her finish all of the burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, let's just get out of h-urmph!\" Jade began, before she was interrupted for the second time by her boyfriend shoving a burger into her mouth. Her eyes bulged in surprise, and for a second Beck thought he may have made a mistake, until she began to chew. Having swallowed the mouthful she opened her mouth even wider, allowing him to stuff even more in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this manner they worked through the remaining burgers, Beck hand feeding her until grease was running down her chin and dripping on to her incredibly bloated belly. He even started to enjoy himself a little, though he couldn't quite say why. When the last shred of cheese laden beef was finally consumed, Jade's stomach was the size of a basketball, her pale skin pulled painfully taut. She was moaning as she massaged her rigid gut, and once again Beck felt oddly compelled by the situation. He decided to lend a hand, reaching over and rubbing her stomach softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\" he asked,half joking, half serious. \"Where do you want to go for dessert?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unlike her friends, Tori didn't waste any time trying to formulate a strategy for her weight gain. She just ate everything she could get her hands on, until she couldn't eat another bite, then eating some more anyway. This meant snacking all day long, when she was getting ready in the mornings, on the way to school, between classes, during rehearsals, on the way home, while she did her homework, when she got ready for bed... And all that was on top of three large meals a day. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't particularly fun, but as plans went it at least had the benefit of simplicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only complicating factor was Trina, who was engaging in a very similar tactic. Their had always been a rivalry, spoken and unspoken, between the two sisters. They always felt the need to compete with each other, whether it was something important or just a game. If Tori was being honest, she felt like she was usually the one who came out on top in these competitions, but when it came to trying to gain weight she suddenly felt like she was at a significant disadvantage. Trina had always had the fuller figure, needing to watch what she ate to avoid getting chubby, while Tori had always been slim, and able to eat whatever she liked. Now that excellent metabolism was becoming an annoyance, meaning she had to work twice as hard to overcome it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the week, Tori had gained just four more pounds, bringing her up to a total of six. Looking in the mirror she couldn't really see any difference, but the snugness of her pants told her most of it had gone to her ass. Trina meanwhile looked to have gained at least ten pounds, maybe more, giving her a noticeable belly and rounding out her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf wanted to get ahead, she'd have to get creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Nothing better than a little midnight snack.

She didn't want to wake up her parents, and she definitely didn't want to wake up Trina. She was planning to get a head start on the day's eating, hopefully grab a few high-calorie items before Trina could get her hands on them. She had helped her mother with the groceries earlier, and had stashed some chocolate pudding in the vegetable crisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was halfway down the stairs before she noticed the light coming from the kitchen. The fridge door was hanging open, bathing the room in a pale yellow glow. Tori's heart sank, and her suspicions were confirmed as she moved across the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina had pulled a chair right up the fridge, and was currently working her way through the last of the pudding cups. Judging by the stains around her mouth and the size of her belly bulging out from under her pajama top, she had been there for some time. She didn't even look surprised when she noticed Tori standing in the half light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow, little sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, displaying both her chocolate covered teeth and her slight double chin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even so, it had been less than two weeks since she had started her new 'diet' and pretty soon she was going to have to dip into her savings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCramming a few fries into her mouth, she scanned the courtyard until she spotted Cat and Jade at one of the circular metal tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Tori said as she sat down, dropping her backpack and letting her tray land on the table with a thud. She winced as she felt her panties work their way up into her buttcrack for the umpteenth time since breakfast. She had taken it as a sign of progress at first, but now it was just getting annoying. \"We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must we?\" Jade asked wearily, sprinkling her half-eaten burrito with a liberal amount of hot sauce. It had been five days since that night at Inside-Out Burger, and with Beck's surprisingly enthusiastic help she had finally managed to reach the ten pound mark. The straining buttons of her red flannel shirt showed where most of the extra weight had settled, her snug bra giving her a deep valley of cleavage, which distracted from her small but growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat, who was sitting across the table slurping down Joke-A-Cola through a bright pink crazy straw, had also started seeing some results, as the vast amounts of sugar she had consumed over the past week was quickly being converted into jiggling fat. Her stomach was now noticeably round even when it wasn't filled with soda, and it was a struggle to keep it from peeking out under her floral tank top. Her face had also gotten slightly chubbier, with rounder cheeks and a softer chin. She looked like she was going to say something, but when she opened her mouth all that came out was a fizzy sounding belch, followed by Cat's usual lilting laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about Trina.\" Tori continued, after pausing to scarf down a burger and some fries. She nibbled on a pizza slice as she began to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this morning I was in my bedroom, getting dressed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact she had been standing in front of her full length mirror, craning her head around to try and get a good look at her butt. Her jeans were only pulled up to her mid-thigh, leaving the full swell of her expanded ass exposed. Pinching and poking it, was clear that it had taken the brunt of her 13 pound weight gain, which wasn't a bad thing. If she ignored her thicker thighs and sucked in the slight potbelly pressing against her zebra-print top, she thought she looked pretty great. She was actually considering taking a selfie when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...when Trina starts hollering for me to come into the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had reflexively hitched up her pants when Trina called her name, inadvertently giving herself her first wedgie of the day. She picked it out as she made the short trip to the bathroom, reluctantly opening the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wouldn't shut up, so eventually I go in, and she's just standing there on the scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided not to mention that Trina had only been wearing underwear, a lacy white bra and pink panties. Or that she had been practically bursting out of them. Aside from her gut, which was so packed from breakfast it was practically spherical, she was clearly developing a decidedly hourglass figure, with her added weight distributed between her hips and breasts. Trina had always been the bustier of the Vega sisters, but when Tori saw her threatening to burst out of her bra she had felt a pang of jealousy mixed with a strange feeling of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Tori?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori blinked, suddenly realising she hadn't said anything for almost a minute. Cat and Jade were both looking at her quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She said, a slight flush tinging her cheeks. \"So, yeah, she's standing there and she says that she can't read the scale, can I tell her what it says?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer exact words had been: \"Tori, be a good little sister and tell me what the scale says. I can't quite make it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these last words she had patted her belly and let out a little moan of discomfort. Tori didn't say anything, but she did step a little closer, slowly leaning down until her face was level with her sister's swollen belly. She had to resist reaching out and touching it, instead leaning in a little closer and peering down at the dial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" Trina asked again, speaking causing her taut gut to vibrate almost imperceptibly. <br>\r\nGlancing up, Tori could barely see her face over the bloated sphere of her stomach. She mumbled something, her voice catching in her throat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Speak up!\" Trina commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"146 pounds!\" Tori said incredulously, taking another bite of pizza. \"She's gained 25 pounds in less than two weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was relieved to see Cat and Jade were also perturbed by the news, that she wasn't just overreacting. They sat in silence for a minute, aside from the sound of Tori chewing her pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can we do about it?\" Cat asked, shrugging her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could poison her.\" Jade suggested, casually reapplying her dark lipstick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori nearly choked, thumping her chest to force down a lump of cheese and pepperoni. \"We are not going to poison my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little sister!\" Trina announced, placing special emphasis on the word 'little'. \"Are you and your friends enjoying your snacks?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori, Cat and Jade all glared at the older girl, whose outfit proudly emphasised her recent weight gain. Her broad hips were muffining over the waistband of her denim shorts, which had the top button undone to accommodate her protruding gut, itself only half covered by her pale yellow t-shirt, through which the cups of her straining bra were clearly visible. Tori doubted if she could even zip the pink tracksuit top draped around her shoulders all the way up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full already?\" Trina asked, looking at Tori's half-eaten lunch. \"Let me help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tori could react Trina had snatched the slice of chocolate cake off of her tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Tori snapped, standing up quickly and nearly tripping over her own backpack. She managed to stay on her feet by grabbing on to the table, but was horrified to hear the sound of fabric ripping. There were a few laughs and one or two whistles as she clapped her hands to her butt, trying to cover the gaping hole that had appeared in the seat of her pants. She could feel the bunched cotton of her underwear and the smooth flesh of her buttcheeks bulging through the tear, as well as the hot flush rising in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina was nearly doubled over with laughter, while Cat was stifling giggles and even Jade was smirking as Tori sat back down with as much dignity as she could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Tori?\" Trina said, still wheezing with laughter. \"You really don't need dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still chortling as she sauntered away, hips swinging as she munched on the stolen cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori waited until she was out of earshot, then locked eyes with Jade. \"Alright. Let's poison her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: This school has an entire Wardrobe Department, and the only pants I can find are bell-bottoms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling: Groovy \u270c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day passed slowly, or at least it seemed that way to Tori. Everywhere she went people seemed to be giggling behind her back, though she couldn't be sure whether they knew about her splitting her jeans or if it was just the sight of the bell bottoms she had found in the school's Wardrobe Department. While the flared pants might have been unfashionable, Tori had to admit that the rich red velour and elasticated waistband at least meant they were comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when the final bell rang Tori still couldn't go home, as they were running rehearsals for Sikowitz's latest one act play, a story of love and betrayal on an Art Deco space station. She only had a minor role, as the satellite's onboard computer, but that meant she had to work backstage as well. She quickly assigned herself the role of assistant costume designer, letting Cat do all the actual work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring a break necessitated by a small electrical fire, they were taking Jade's measurements while she went over her lines. She was the play's lead, and needed to be fitted for a retro style space suit. Cat wielded the tape, calling out the numbers for Tori to take down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bust, uh, 38.\" Cat said, double checking the tape was taut around her friend's ample assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"38.\" Tori repeated, making a note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waist... 28, no, 30.\" Cat continued, leaning forward and slipping the tape down until it was just above Jade's hips, pressing it against the underside of her potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori's pencil scratched again. \"30.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hips... Oh!\" Cat said suddenly, as something crossed her mind. She looked up at Jade. \"I forgot, I meant to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Jade said instantly, without looking away from her script. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't even tell you what it was yet.\" Cat said, sounding slightly hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade glanced down at her, unsmilingly. \"Okay, go ahead, tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat frowned warily. \"Are you still just going to say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask, and find out.\" Jade told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to my Nona's house for dinner after school, and I'm supposed to bring a friend.\" Cat explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's nice.\" Jade said. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat pouted, her lower lip trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori rolled her eyes. \"I'll go with you Cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead turned to look at her, her sadness instantly replaced with joy. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori shrugged. \"Sure, why not? You said there would be dinner right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tori dear, would you like some more Mac and Cheese and Cheese and Cheese and Cheese?\" Nona asked, already digging a spoon into the steaming dish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori was so stuffed that all she could do was nod as Cat's grandmother scooped more of the incredibly rich pasta on to her plate, which was already loaded with fried chicken. Next to her, Cat was in a similar state of satiety, moaning softly as she rubbed her swollen stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNona smiled as Tori resumed eating, holding a piece of chicken in one hand and a fork in the other. <br>\r\nFrom the moment they had arrived, after a brief introduction where she complimented Tori's bell bottoms, she had been serving them up a variety of snacks, sweet and savoury, and insisting that they try every single one, not that they needed much encouragement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nice to see young ladies with a healthy appetite.\" She kept repeating as Cat and Tori ate everything she put in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap Cat!\" Tori said in a whisper when her grandmother had retreated to the kitchen area. \"Does she always feed you like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had nodded, still crunching down a handful of potato doodles. \"She says I'm too skinny, that I need more 'meat on my bones'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate we'll have caught up with Trina in no time.\" Tori had laughed, licking barbecue sauce from her hands before tucking into another rack of ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been almost two hours and an entire ham ago, and Tori wasn't laughing anymore. Her stomach took up almost half her lap, making her looking heavily pregnant. Every bite she took caused her a twinge of pain, yet the food was just too good to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat must have agreed, because after letting out a few impressively resonant belches she resumed eating, bypassing a plate and eating straight from the dish of cheesy macaroni. Between them they finished off the last few morsels of chicken and pasta, before collapsing back in their chairs with a simultaneous moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Nona simply clapped her hands and told them to sit tight while she got dessert ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat...\" Tori wheezed, her breathing heavy. \"I think... I think I'm going to explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat just groaned in response, followed by a weary hiccup. Her tank top had actually torn along the sides as it stretched to accommodate her expanding stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their protestations, both girls sluggishly tucked in when Nona returned with two huge brownies, layered with chocolate fudge and covered in freshly whipped cream. Tori ignored her cutlery picked hers up in two hands, crumbs cascading down on to her shirt and exposed stomach as she ate. Cat took the opposite approach, bringing her head down to the level of the plate and shoving the fudgy confection in the direction of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Tori gasped when she had finally swallowed the last of the thick brownie. She tried to push her chair back from the table, causing the legs to creak ominously. She couldn't even think about standing up, her tightly packed gut was literally pinning her to her seat. She rubbed it tenderly, feeling the taut surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone ate a little too much.\" Nona chided jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori looked up as if to say 'no duh', then realised she was referring to Cat, who appeared to have passed out face down in her dessert, mouth still full of half-chewed chocolate, a dab of whipped cream on the tip her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nona guided the dazed Cat in the direction of her apartment's spare bed, Tori recovered enough to haul herself to her feet, nearly toppling forward with the weight of her distended stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe staggered as far as the couch, leaning heavily on the back of it. Her striped shirt had rolled up to just above her belly-button, leaving the bottom half of her stomach exposed. On a whim, she hiked it up the rest of the way and took out her PearPhone. Holding it at chest height, she snapped a photo of her bloated belly, the tips of her shoes just peeking out underneath it. She tapped a few times, paused momentarily, then hit send. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that couch folds out, if you'd like to stay over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori nearly dropped her phone at Nona's sudden reappearance, trying to surreptitiously pull her shirt back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um, no, I should really get home.\" She said, slipping her phone back into her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNona smiled, walking over and taking Tori by the hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, when I told Cat to bring her special friend over for dinner, I admit I was expecting to meet a handsome young man.\" The elderly woman said kindly. \"But you seem like a lovely girl, and as long as Cat is happy, I'm happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori's confusion quickly gave way to understanding, and she groaned inwardly. Of course Cat would misunderstand what her grandmother meant when she said 'special friend'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, that's really sweet, but-\" Tori began to explain, but Nona cut her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course, you're welcome to come over to dinner any time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori hesitated as she considered this new information, resting her hands on her tightly packed gut. It didn't take her long to come to a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori Vega: Is it wrong to date someone just to get free food?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Friday morning was rapidly becoming the worst part of Tori's week, as straight after home room she had a double Phys. Ed. class. It hadn't been so bad when they were playing soccer and she could just avoid getting anywhere near the ball, but this week they were running laps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valentine! Vega! Let's see some hustle!\" Coach Davis barked, followed by a shrill blast of his whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori and Cat, who had been practically strolling around the track, reluctantly broke into a jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks.\" Tori grumbled, feeling her crimson gym shorts riding further up her butt crack. \"Why can't we do something easy for Phys. Ed., like disk golf or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat didn't respond beyond a murmur, already short of breath from the light pace. She had never been in great shape, and now her belly was bouncing freely under her  white 'Hollywood Arts Athletics' t-shirt, tiring her out even faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey loped less than a hundred yards before they figured it was safe to slow down again, Coach Davis' attention returning to his clipboard. Cat was wheezing from the exertion, and the tops of Tori's thighs were burning where they rubbed off one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks.\" Tori repeated, wedging her hand between her legs and rubbing the tender flesh. \"How did Jade get out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was still breathing hard, sweat rolling down her chubby face. \"She said she... had to go the nurse... lady problems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori snorted, imagining how quickly former linebacker and ex-Marine Coach Davis had excused her when he heard that. Maybe she could try it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valentine! Vega! Get your butts moving!\" Coach Davis yelled. \"Don't make me tell you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat squealed and ran, followed by a reluctant Tori. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Davis shook his head as he watched them. Hollywood Arts couldn't boast any great athletes, despite his best efforts, but most of the students at least made an effort to stay in shape. Those two, on the hand, were quickly becoming real little porkers. Valentine was already flagging visibly, clutching her side, and Vega was more waddling than running, her round ass wiggling from side to side in her tight shorts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly looked back down to his clipboard, suddenly deciding he should double check the attendance. Glancing down the list, the only student missing was Jade West, who now that he thought about it had also been looking a little plump, practically spilling out of her low-cut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shapiro!\" He said loudly, shaking his head as though to clear the thought from his head. \"What did I tell you about that puppet?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Tori and Cat continued to hobble and limp around the track, Jade was in the nurse's office, leaning against the padded examination table, sucking on a lollipop from the large glass jar on the desk. She hadn't even gotten changed for Phys. Ed., still wearing a fishnet top over her black corset, with a dark grey skirt and her usual black leather boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Kotter, wearing a pink cardigan over her scrubs, was crouching down and looking through the bottom drawer of a grey filing cabinet. The school's nurse was in her mid thirties, but she had been blessed with a youthful complexion, and in fact wore her strawberry blonde hair bobbed to make herself appear more mature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jade, how are you feeling today?\" She asked as she stood up, having retrieved the Manila folder labelled 'WEST'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was feeling sick, but now I'm not, so if you just sign me a class absence slip I'll get out of here.\" Jade told her, not bothering to stifle a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Nurse Kotter replied, looking the young woman up and down. \"Well, I'm glad you're feeling better, but I notice in your file that you missed your annual physical assessment this year.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade narrowed her eyes but didn't say anything, so Nurse Kotter continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're missing class anyway, how about we do the physical now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade scowled, unable to think of an excuse. She had been planning to meet Beck and drive to Inside-Out Burger, getting back just in time for third period. All she could do was shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Nurse Kotter said with a smile, flipping open the file and clicking her pen. \"If you just want to strip down, we can get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Jade began to undress, sitting down on the padded table and pulling off her boots, and unleashing the smell of her slightly sweaty feet, before slipping her skirt down her legs, revealing her lacy black panties. She had slipped off her mesh top and was about to unlace her snug corset before she remembered  that she wasn't wearing a bra. She had gotten sick of having to readjust every few minutes to stop the straps from pinching her, so she had finally decided to just go without. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe momentarily hesitated, then resumed undoing the knots and removing the stiff paneled garment, exposing her pale potbelly as well as her large dark nipples.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been hoping for a reaction, but Nurse Kotter didn't appear fazed, simply telling her to stand against the height chart on the wall. She did so, reflexively crossing her arms across her chest until Nurse Kotter asked her to stand up straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five foot, seven inches.\" She said as she marked it down. \"You've grown a whole inch taller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade didn't return the nurse's smile, not appreciating being treated like a child. He mood soured further once she had stepped on the scale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"146 pounds, let's see that's, oh my, 14 pounds heavier than last year.\" Nurse Kotter said with a slight frown. \"Seems like gym is the last class you could afford to miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blinked, almost not believing what she had heard. To her amazement, Nurse Kotter actually poked her pudgy stomach with the end of her pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what kind of breakfast did you have this morning?\" She asked, either ignoring or failing to notice her patient's flared nostrils and death glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I skipped it.\" Jade told her through gritted teeth. She had been planning to breakfast on bacon double cheeseburgers, so she had slept in late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Kotter tutted. \"You should always eat breakfast, it kickstarts the metabolism. Try some whole grains and fresh fruit, and plenty of water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we done?\" Jade asked brusquely, stepping off the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few quick tests.\" Nurse Kotter told her, making another note. \"Could you please touch your toes for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade, pausing just long enough to indicate her disdain for the task, sighed and bent down, reaching for her toes. She couldn't suppress a grunt as she felt her belly being compressed, while her bare breasts flopped down heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your legs straight.\" Nurse Kotter reminded her as she stretched, the tips of her fingers only just reaching below her knees. With a gasp she gave up, standing back upright with feigned nonchalance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school nurse made another small noise of disapproval as she marked the result down. \"Flexibility is an important indicator of overall health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for some time, with Nurse Kotter assigning tasks and then quietly denigrating Jade's poor performance. She could barely manage ten sit-ups, not even half as many push-ups, and even her balance seemed off as she wobbled on one foot for thirty seconds. The only test she passed convincingly was the eye exam. Finally she was allowed to catch her breath, although she had to listen to Nurse Kotter lecture her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're at the upper limits of a healthy weight for a girl your age, and your fitness level is frankly appalling.\" She said sternly, holding Jade by the wrist in order to check her pulse. \"If you don't make some changes soon-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah yeah.\" Jade said, having recovered her breath and some of her bravado. \"We can't all be flat-chested twigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe refrained from adding 'like you', but it was clear from Nurse Kotter's drawn expression that the implied insult had been understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we done here?\" Jade asked, unable to conceal a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Kotter didn't respond for a few seconds, then shook her head. \"One last test. I need to check your aerobic recovery rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's smirk disappeared as Nurse Kotter retrieved a sturdy wooden box from under her desk and laying it on the floor, explaining as she did so. \"You need to step up and down off this block for three minutes, then I'm going to see how long it takes your pulse to return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade reluctantly took up a position in front of the box, and on a signal from Nurse Kotter began to step up and down as she had been told. By the end of the first minute she was breathing hard, holding an arm across her chest to try and stop her breasts from bouncing. By the end of the second minute her face had turned red from exertion, her body coated in a thin sheen of sweat. By the end of the third minute she was gasping for breath, each step accompanied by a groan of discomfort. Nurse Kotter tried to conceal her grin as they approached the end of the fourth minute. Maybe that would teach the little cow not to try and skip class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to put Jade out of her misery, the door suddenly burst open. Cat was standing in the doorway with one arm around Robbie's shoulders, using him to support her rapidly swelling ankle. Both stared open mouthed at the sight of Jade standing half-naked in front of them. Equally startled by their sudden appearance, Jade lost her footing on the block. After a second of comical teetering, she fell backwards, landing on her ass and letting out a yelp as pain shot up her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thirty seconds were total chaos. Nurse Kotter yelled and tried to shut the door, inadvertently slamming it into Cat's injured ankle, causing her to cry out. Robbie, after a few seconds of shocked ogling, recovered his senses enough to shut his eyes and begin apologising fervently, backing away just as Nurse Kotter was trying to bring the limping Cat inside.  Throughout it all Jade was sprawled on the floor, alternating between cursing at them and moaning in pain as she clutched her tailbone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually order was restored and Robbie, still apologising, was sent back to class. Cat and Jade sat side by side on the padded examination table, a blanket draped around the latter's shoulders. Nurse Kotter was rooting through her cabinets for supplies to tend to Cat's ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Jade asked sullenly, not looking her friend in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat shrugged. \"I fell and hurt my ankle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Kotter returned before Jade could press any further, her arms filled with rolls of gauze and medical tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ms. West, I think we can finish this another time. If you'd like to get dressed you can go back to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade narrowed her eyes. \"I don't know if I can go back to class, I might be too hurt. I might need to be excused for the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Kotter began to speak, but then she caught the look in the teenager's eye.  The door should have been locked during the physical, and Jade knew it. She swallowed and nodded her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose... that might be for the best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade smiled and stood up, leaving Nurse Kotter to tend to Cat's ankle while she got dressed. As she squeezed back into her skirt and laced up her corset she noticed Beck had sent her multiple text, asking where she was. She typed a reply with one hand as she slipped on her boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the Hollywood Arts campus, Beck's eyes widened as he read the text, then smiled as he read it again. He might get in trouble if he ditched school, but if Jade was serious, it would definitely be worth it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was David Vega's birthday, and to mark the occasion the whole family  were enjoying dinner at Maestro's, one of the city's finest and fanciest restaurants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say,\" the Vega patriarch began, looking around the table, \"just getting to spend time with my three favourite girls is the greatest birthday present I could ever get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh David, that's so sweet.\" Holly Vega said, leaning over and kissing her husband on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daughters were too busy stuffing their faces with the contents of the complementary bread basket to acknowledge the sentiment. They had matched each other roll for roll since they had sat down, only pausing to slather each one with butter. Their parents shared a concerned glance, leading their mother to clear her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Tori, Trina, maybe you should save some room for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori swallowed the mouthful of bread she had been chewing and smiled apologetically. \"Oh, um, sorry, I just really love the food here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina took advantage of her sister's distraction to snatch the last piece of bread from the basket. She shot her a triumphant glance as she crammed it into her mouth. Tori ignored her, taking a sip of the wine her parents had allowed her to order as a special treat, while surreptitiously readjusting her dress, a long-sleeved zebra print number decorated with red roses. It was one of her favourites, but what had been fashionably tight over fifteen pounds ago was now decidedly snug, especially around the middle, clinging tightly to her rounded stomach. Even worse, the extra few inches of fabric need to cover her expanded rear end meant the dress had gone from just north of the knee to decidedly risqu\u00e9 mid-thigh, forcing her to keep pulling the skirt back down. It was far from ideal, but it had taken so long to squeeze herself into it that she hadn't had time to change before dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, gotta pee.\" Trina announced abruptly, standing up from the table. Tori had to admit that her sister had done a much better job choosing an outfit. Her deep blue dress was a much looser fit on her thicker frame, and she had accessorised it with a broad black leather belt, which served to disguise her belly while emphasising her voluptuous hips and chest. Watching her walk towards the restrooms, she noticed a few heads turning to do the same, prompting one woman to jab an elbow into her husband's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori got a jolt herself when someone suddenly tapped her on the shoulder. She whipped her head around and tried to not to spit out her wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Vega?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the hostess who had shown them to their table. With her she had an ice bucket which held a bottle of expensive-looking champagne, which she placed at the side of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift from the owner.\" The hostess explained, as a waiter brought over four champagne flutes and began to open the bottle. \"He was wondering if you might be interested in singing for us again tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori smiled, remembering the night she and Andr\u00e9 had literally sang for their supper, then blanched at the idea of performing in her constricting, revealing dress. She stammered an excuse. \"Um, n-no, uh, thank you, but not tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now Tori, don't be shy all of a sudden.\" Holly Vega told her, clearly impressed by the free booze, eagerly taking her glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just figured this is supposed to be dad's special day, not mine.\" Tori said, nervously tugging at the hem of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could be more special than a song from my little girl?\" David Vega countered, clinking his flute against his wife's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori could feel herself starting to sweat, then inspiration struck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I do, Trina might want to sing a song as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents didn't quite cringe, not exactly, but it was clear she had convinced them. There was no way Trina wouldn't insist on singing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another time maybe.\" Holly Vega said, to an empathic nod of agreement from David and a sigh of relief from Tori. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess left and Trina returned shortly after, gulping down her champagne just as their waiter returned to top up their wine glasses and ask if they had decided on what they would like to eat. David chose the lobster bisque to start, followed by a medium-well t-bone, while Holly plumped for the Cobb salad and the veal cutlets. Then it was Trina's turn to order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the seafood risotto and the garlic bread to start, then I want the 24 ounce porterhouse, medium rare, with an extra side of mashed potatoes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter looked slightly taken aback by her substantial order, as did her parents. Their surprise was only magnified when Tori snapped her menu shut and said that she would have the same thing. The waiter glanced at Holly and David to see if they would object, but seeing only bemusement, simply nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An, uh, excellent choice.\" He added, before hurriedly going to place the order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you girls sure are hungry, huh?\" David ventured after a few moments of silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori slugged back her champagne to avoid having to answer, while Trina just shrugged. Conversation remained stilted until their starters arrived, when it was completely abandoned in favour of enthusiastic eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seafood risotto was creamy and delicious, but also surprisingly spicy, and Tori drained two glasses of wine before she finished the generous helping, mopping up the remnants with a slice of garlic bread. The waiter refilled her glass every time she emptied it, and her parents didn't seem to notice how much she was drinking, probably distracted by how much she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina demolished her risotto and garlic bread, and the half block of parmasaen cheese she had grated on top of them, in a similar manner to Tori, though she was slightly messier, catching crumbs and the occasional grain of sticky rice in her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief wait between the courses threatened to lapse into the same awkward silence, until Holly decided to reveal David's birthday present: tickets for a two week cruise to Hawaii, all expenses paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow mom, that's amazing!\" Trina said, beaming. \"When do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief, pregnant pause. Tori, anticipating what was coming, winced and slugged back some more wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We leave on Monday.\" Holly said, quietly but firmly. \"Just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina, taking a deep breath, was about to launch into one of her trademark tantrums when she was interrupted by the arrival of the main course, her rage temporarily forgotten at the sight of a steak so large it could barely fit on the plate, accompanied by a veritable mountain of buttery mashed potatoes. After a brief moment of anticipation she tucked in, knife and fork hacking into the huge slab of beef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her own dish arrived, Tori was slightly overwhelmed by the sheer size of it, but quickly set about her task, feeling confident she could manage it. It helped that the meat was perfectly cooked, each bite almost melting in her mouth. And that she was ever so slightly drunk, even if she didn't realise it. The only real problem was her dress. Under the napkin spread across her lap, her dress had retreated even further up her legs, inching slowly higher as her stomach continued to swell outwards. She really could have used a trip to the ladies' room, but she wasn't sure what would happen if she stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina, halfway through her steak, was having wardrobe issues of her own. Her belt, already cinched tight, was straining across her bloated belly, getting tighter with each mouthful. She tried to adjust it, moving it up and down, but eventually gave up and released the ornate buckle, the belt popping open as her stomach surged forward. Her parents raised their eyebrows but made no comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth David and Holly had long finished their meals by the time Trina dropped her cutlery with a clatter, followed half a moment later by Tori. It was with a mixture of fascination and trepidation that the waiter asked, once their empty plates had been cleared away, if they would care for anything from the dessert cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their visibly bulging stomachs, Trina and Tori both nodded eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I don't think-\" Holly tried to say, but Trina interrupted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, mom, if you and dad are going to go on vacation without us, we should at least get some dess-URRRPPP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina's cacophonous belch carried on for a full five seconds, briefly quieting the hubbub of the restaurant. The first sound to break the silence was Tori's stifled giggle, which soon broke out into an unrestrained laugh. She couldn't help it, the whole thing was just too funny. Soon Trina was laughing too, pounding the table with her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trina! Tori!\" Holly hissed, as the other restaurant patrons began to murmur, but her stern expression only made them laugh harder. David quickly signalled to the waiter to bring the cheque. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here before you embarrass yourselves any further.\" Holly said, standing up and pulling Tori to her feet, which was harder than it used to be. There were a few gasps, and one or two laughs, and Holly quickly saw why.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTori's dress, already struggling to accommodate her larger derri\u00e8re, had been completely overwhelmed by her slowly expanding stomach. It now barely brushed the tops of her legs, giving the restaurant a full view of her chubby thighs along with glimpses of the lower half of her ass and the crotch of her purple thong. The sight of this set Trina to laughing even harder, which, along with the large amount of wine she had consumed, allowed Tori to see the funny side too, despite her embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Holly staring in disbelief at her giggling, gluttonous daughters, it fell to David to finish paying the cheque and quietly shepherd his family members out to their car. He left a generous tip, despite a suspicion this would be the Vega family's last trip to Maestro's. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Okay this is basically like my other story except this one is about real women off T.V. Here are the only rules of the story -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo male expansion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo slob stuff (farting etc) though burping is okay<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing to do with poop or urine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo popping or death<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo vore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything else is fine, so have fun! Also I would like to add that force feeding, and generally gaining against the victims will is encouraged but by no means mandatory. I would also like to add that though I'm not a particularly skilled writer, I would also prefer that all additions are written relatively well, with no sudden jumps in weight (the characters should go from skinny to chubby to fat) or complete deviations from the story which make no sense. But yes, please add and remember... Have fun :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please note, the 'inflation' option can mean any form of inflation you can think of; such as Blueberry, or inflating specific body parts, or any others!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
