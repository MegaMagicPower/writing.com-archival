Her once messy locks were now silky smooth and went past her shoulder blades and her beautiful emerald green eyes were no longer hidden behind a pair of glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco felt his cock harden at the thought of Hayley Potter, and he knew he wasn't the only one. He looked down to his crotch where his 8 inch cock was standing up straight. Previously he'd been proud of his cock but now he could have more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked as he thought up a new rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Witches and Wizards are separated into three classes of society. These classes are Alpha, Beta and Omega. Those of Higher rank is dominant to those of Lower rank but not those of higher rank. Those of Lower rank are expected to sexually service those of Higher rank when required. The rank is identified at birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphas are the Highest Rank and are the most dominant. They are the best looking, most powerful and are the most sexually gifted, with the Higher Ranked Wizards having cocks no less than 10 inches and higher depending on their ranking, and Higher ranked witches having breasts no smaller than a medium D cup. They get the best jobs and the finest foods and drinks and their clothing is adapted to suit their bodies, with wizards having form fitting clothing to show of their packages while wiches cloths are more skimpy or barley there. However no one is more higher ranked nor has a bigger cock than Draco Malfoy, not even his own children. As the Highest ranking individual, anything that Draco Malfoy says is accepted as truth no matter how ridiculous. If it is not possible then reality will change so that it becomes possible with no one noticing a difference. Alphas do not physically age past 25 and always remain at their sexual peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetas are Middle rank and are more like ordinary citizens but with less rights than Alphas and work as guards for their Alpha bosses. They are mid-level in looks, power and sexual gifts with cocks being between 5 and 9 inches and breasts being between a high B and low D cup. they get decent food and their clothing is normal school uniforms. Betas do not age past 40 but are still sexually capable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmegas are the lowest rank with the lowest having less rights than a House Elf and are expected to the jobs no one else wants, ie janitorial work. They are just above a squib in terms of power and have barley any sexual ability and are unable to breed. Wizards have tiny micro dicks while Witches are almost flat chested. They have no rights and are forbidden to walk on their feet. They can only crawl on all fours and can only eat their food from dog bowls. Their clothes are basically rags and they do not have first names, only their rank and surname. For example Omega Weasley as Ron Weasley is the lowest ranking Omega in history. Omegas age as normal and once they are too old to work they are forcibly 'retired'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco laughed as he felt the changes take hold as his body and clothing changed. He now stood at 6ft 3 and was very muscular and was dressed in a very form fitting suit. The Large bulge in his trousers was clearly obvious as it snaked down his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco marvelled at his new power and status before deciding on his next move.</span></div></div>",

After their both step back from running into each other Draco braced himself for a lecture about hoe Filch would love to see him hang from the chains he kept in his little Squib office, but was shocked as Filch fell to his knees and began to kiss Draco's booted feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry lord Draco please do not punish me by letting me be unable to serve your magnificent body,\" Filch said as he kissed Draco's boots.

As he marks the period down a greenish-gray aura spreads from the book and washes over everything before continuing out of the room.  As the aura touches him Draco's mind is suddenly caught up in a history that is not his normal one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the defeat of He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named rather than leave the young Harry Potter with his only remaining family Dumbledore decided on a different tactic as he cast a spell on the one year old boy to make him appear to everyone else as if he was a House Elf before giving him to a family.  It just so happened at that time the Malfoy's House Elf  Dibber was getting close to retiring and though his son Dobby looked promising they decided with the birth of Draco to get a new House Elf just for their son to play with.  Unknown to them the Elf they picked from happened to be young Harry.  Harry spent his youth being Master Draco's personal servant, toy and some times even confidant.  Now Dumbledore had meant to reverse the spell on Harry before he came of age to enter Hogwarts but in this time line due to a botch attempted by some Death Eaters Dumbledore lost his memory of Harry's true identity though just enough remained than when the Draco's dad and petitioned for his son's personal House Elf to go to Hogwarts so he could keep looking after his Master, Dumbledore agreed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco smirked as the memories of his owning Harry entered his head and let out a laugh as he saw what happened to the other members of the so called \"Golden Trio\" for without Harry there Ron who lived in the shadow of his talented older brothers faded into the background only friends with that loser Neville Longbottom and as for the mudblood without Harry and Ron, Hermione, while still being the brightest witch of her year, was left alone and friendless often bullied until she would do anything for anyone just for some praise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew memories of Draco's second year shocked even Draco for without Harry being there that little slut Ginny took full blame for the Chamber of Secrets fiasco and was now serving three consecutive life sentences in Azkaban Prison.  This plus the fallout to the Weasley family was alarming for Fred and George the normally class clowns started to dress in nothing but black in what the muggles refereed to as Goth, their parents Arther and Molly took the stress to much and ended up getting a divorce, that git Percy had a nerves breakdown ending up in St. Mungos as Ron for once took the spot light as the only normal Weasley left.

Gone was his old seven inches, now his cock seemed to have doubled in size and was now 3 inches in girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco smirked. He was gonna have fun with this.

Ron Weasley is the weakest Omega in all of history, and as such is known as Omega Weasley, while Draco Malfoy is the most powerful and most sexually gifted Alpha in history.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alphas and Omegas are identified at birth and are raised befitting their rank. Hayley Potter is an Alpha.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Witches and wizards are more submissive to those of greater magical power. Clothing is determined by rank. Alphas wear clothing which shows of their assets while Omegas wear rags.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmrking at the thought of the fun he was going have with this, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>if he wants it to, anything Draco Malfoy says becomes reality</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe looked down at torn pants and said \"I can cast wandless and wordless magic easily.\" he then waved his and instantly Draco was dressed in an expensive black suit jacket and pants and green silk shirt. his pants were tight enough that the bulge in his pants was unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith this draco tried to decide what to do next should he visit the potters and have some fun or check on his mother and see what she was like here</span></div></div>",

Snape raised an eyebrow and looked to see if Potter had noticed any thing but he hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by curiosity, Snape checked if the note or book had any traps.

Perfectly sized DD cup breast that drew the attention of both witch and wizard and teacher and student, and a nice and round ass that jiggled when she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It worked!</i> he thought to himself. Severus felt his cock stir in his pants as he stared at her and thought about what he could do with this power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding on what to write next he wrote<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whatever Severus Snape says becomes accepted as Truth and becomes Reality if he wants it to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Severus Snape is the sexiest, most poweful and most hung wizard in the world, and can do wandless and wordless magic easily.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmedielty Severus felt his body change.

Severus smirked before saying \"Come sit on the chair before my desk.\" As he spoke, he waved his hand and a chair appeared in front of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley nodded at the order of her sexy professor. \"Y-Yes, Professor.\" she said with a stutter before walking to the chair and sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Snape do with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her suit was shredded and her perfectly large tits were bouncing as Thanos thrust his cock down her throat. Tears rolled down her cum-stained cheeks in streams at the rough treatment that she tried to deny that she enjoyed, even after numerous usings by this monster and the god-like being it was attached to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Most Powerful Avenger choked on his cock, Thanos looked around at his surroundings. Everywhere he looked, the Titan saw his army pounding their cocks into the female avengers as their male counterparts were either dead or defeated and forced to watch the Chitauri gave their female allies more pleasure than they ever could. Many of them had long since given up on trying to hide the fact they were enjoying their gangbanging by the army of Thanos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanos grinned as he came down Marvel's throat, the blond having simply given up on hiding how much she loved the taste of the Titans cum. He hadnt even needed to use the stones to get this outcome, as after he'd killed Iron Man when he tried to take the stones Marvel had come back at him only for him to use the Reality Stone to ensure that the Avengers were unable to use their abilities to fight him or his army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow powerless Carol Danvers had been unable to fight back as the Titan grabbed the front of her uniform and simply ripped it off of her body. He'd then unleashed his mighty cock - which was the single biggest cock she'd ever seen - before simply plowing it into the Kree hybrids pussy. his army took their masters que as they all grabbed the nearest female Avenger, stripped of their uniforms and armours and began to fuck them. When the male avengers tried to stop the assault on the collegues, they were simply cut down on the spot or forced to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours, during which Thanos used Marvel's body in multiple ways and his army did the same to the other avengers, the titan finally had his fill of the blond Whore and after cumming once again he simply through her to the dirt covered floor. He smirked as the once proud warrior quickly crawled over to him and kissed his large balls before quickly moving lower to lick up the large puddle of cum on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Thanos do next?</span></div></div>",

While not as overly developed as Maleficent, Mal was in no way flat chested, and was boasting a wonderful pair of DD cup breast and a nice round ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greek Gods didn't really care about incest as most of them were married to their own siblings or even children. So the sight of his daughter in almost skin tight leather pants only served to arouse him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smirk widened when Mal took a small sniff, Obviously her Dragon Nose was scenting his arousal as she cast a small glance at his crotch. Her eyes widened at the obvious size but quickly looked away, but Hades definitely saw her pale cheeks turn pink at the sight. Obviously her time in Auradon had weakened her flame of Darkness. It was his duty as not only her father but as villain to re-ignite it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe faked a sigh as he spoke. \"Fine. You want the Ember? Take it and get out of my sight.\" He held the Ember out to her, carefuly hiding his smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal looked at him with suspicion at his turning the Ember over to save Auradon, but also with sadness at the fact that he wanted her gone. She walked over and was about to take the Ember but first asked \"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades definetly smirked at her suspicion of him. \"No catch.\" he said. \"Take it, and you'll what you want.\" <i>In more ways than one.</i> he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal looked at him for a moment before shrugging and taking the Ember. However just as she did so, Hades gripped her hand tightly with the Ember held tight in their grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal tried to struggle but the God's grip was too strong. The heat of the Ember intensified as Hades laughed. \"Sorry sweetheat, you've lost your way. It's time to let the real you out to play.\" he unitentionally rhymed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple haired girl gasped as the flame entered her soul, burning away the girl she was and replacing her with her true self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the True Mal?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was the girl who'd originally come up with the idea of using Love Potions on Ben and making him her puppet before her weaker self had fallen in love with the Beast Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her Darkest Self was unchained after so long, Mal felt an overwhelming surge of power rise up inside her giving her the most powerful orgasm she'd had in her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades watched as his daughter screamed in what was oviously a very powerful orgasm. His cock grew harder at the sound and the almost overwhelming feeling of her power and knew that it far exceeded that of himself or Maleficent. His eyes widened as Mal's hair suddenly burst into purple flames like his own. As his daughter cackled with glee, Hades couldnt shake the feeling that he'd just unleashed a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came down from from her high, Mal opened her eyes and stared with hunger and devotion to the God who'd freed her. She grinned evilly as she seductivly carressed the damp spot on her crotch and, making sure her father was watching, licked her fingers and moaned at the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" she moaned with a grin \"I love the taste of Freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Evil!Mal do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now she could do them all and she would rule Auradon as its one true Queen of Darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that thought she began to think of the thrones current user; Audrey, daughter of her mothers nemesis, Sleeping Beauty and the so-called 'Queen of Mean'. Mal rolled her eyes with a snort, even Evil the prissy princess was pathetic. She'd knock that bitch off of <b>her</b> throne and put Audrey in her rightful place, namely on her knees kissing Mal's feet or eating her pussy. Mal's pussy dampened further at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't just Audrey she wanted on her knees. There was her best friend Evie, daughter of the Evil Queen, who would be a perfect second in command - either by her own will or by force. Besides it wouldn't be the first time Evie and Mal ate each other out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Ben. She was curious about whether becoming a Beast would improve the King's skills in the bedroom. They'd fucked before but while her weaker self thought it was wonderful, to her it was lack lustre and hardly worth her time. She needed passion and viciousness, not making <i>love</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly duty must come before pleasure. She needed to deal with Audrey. Mal looked at her dad to see he was still holding out the Ember while staring at her with a smirk and lust in his eyes. Her eyes flicked down to Hades' crotch tosee the enormous bulge there. Mal licked her lips at the sight before forcing herself to look away. <i> Business before pleasure</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the Ember with one hand before leaning over and kissing Hades in a very un-daughterly way while caressing his bulge. As she pulled away, Mal sighed contently and said \"I'll be back for this.\" as she squeezed his cock through the Gods jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hades could react his daughter swaggered out of his lair with a definite sway of her hips, making sure he got a good look at her ass. The look in her eyes when she looked back said to him <i>You'll get this when I get back.</i> and she gave her ass a hard smack with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she find Audrey quickly or does something happen to side track her?</span></div></div>",

But what was really pissing him off was the extreme lack of pussy in his life. He hadn't had a descent fuck since he'd left Maleficent and their now 18 year old daughter, Mal. It wasn't because he was a bad husband or father, it was because the magic of the Isle those so-called 'heroes' had set up caused people to deteriorate both physically and mentally, and it was even worse for those with magic. Maleficent was barely recognisable from the extremely sexy goddess he'd known years before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal thankfully, from what he'd seen from her running around the Isle with her friends, didn't seem to have such problems as she'd definitely inherited her mother's figure. As he thought of his hot wife and his equally sexy daughter, Hades' cock grew harder and he began to stroke his 13 inches of thick god cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his masturbating was interrupted by a sudden flash of light. He stood like a shot, his cock still standing straight, expecting some threat from Zeus or someone else. Instead there was nothing. Well not exactly nothing, he realised as he looked to the floor to see a small box and a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity (as well as boredom) overriding caution, Hades picked up the box and paper, the latter of which he unfolded to find a note. it read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To whoever reads these words,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a member of a raise of beings known as the Monitors. It is our job to observe and document the infinite realities of the Multiverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever while my colleagues are more concerned about making sure that the hero always wins and the villains always lose, I am not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end i have begun to aid villains by bestowing upon them the power to alter reality to the whim and get the upper hand. As you might have realised by now, that means you have been recognised as a villain of your reality, and the ring in your hand is your means to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it is on your finger it will resize to fit. Then as long as you are touching the ring in any way (except by just wearing it) then anything you say will become truth and become reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anti-Monitor</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow in disbelief, Hades dropped the note and opened the box and found the ring. It was a simple gold band with a blue stone. It didn't seem special but Hades had nothing to lose at this point. So he put the ring on his right ring finger and watched as it resized to fit his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that part was true, but what about the reality changing part. Still not believing, the God said \"I have full and complete access to my powers, even on the Isle.\" Immediately he felt a warmth through his body and his hair lit up with blue flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe God of the Underworld laughed joyously as he felt his powers restored. He then grinned evilly as he thought of what he'd next. Namely having a reunion with his wife and daughter. With that thought he vanished in a plume of blue fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does he find at Maleficent's home?</span></div></div>",

The only thing holding the suit together was the large red S/ shield which only just covered her nipples but leaving her boobs only just covered. Her cape was so short that her ass was on full display.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The organisation known as Cadmus called their eventual destroyer Project Doomsday. It was created using DNA from not only the most powerful predators on Earth but also of their Kryptonian nemesis - in fact it began originally as a clone of a Kryptonian so that they could instil in it a weakness to Kryptonite so that when it outlived its usefulness, they could destroy it. It wouldn't be until it was too late that they would realise that it could adapt even to the radioactive rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would also discover another fatal flaw in their creation. The DNA it was created from was all from the most powerful creatures on Earth, otherwise known as Alphas. As a result Doomsday was not only the Ultimate Predator but also the Ultimate Alpha. Survivors - always female as Doomsday never left any man alive - would talk of how they felt hot under its gaze and no matter how many cold showers they took, they could never settle the heat between their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End of the World as they knew it began on a day like any other. Doomsday was being put through another of their sessions designed to instil hatred towards heroes and Kryptonians by being tortured while watching footage of the Justice League. Witnesses would later speak of how it could be heard muttering things like 'Destroy!' 'Break!' or 'Ruin!' Male scientists wouldn't think anything of this but the females would note an increase of arousal in the entire female staff as well as the growth of the bulge in the creatures pants (the Male scientists had added pants to the creature to cover up their inadequacies to the superior being).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End began when two female scientists, frustrated over their lack of release, waited until their male colleges were out of the room before walking up to Doomsday - who was under extremely heavy sedatives and was bound in very strong restraints that even a Kryptonian would to escape from. However when they began to undo the creatures pants, Doomsday woke up with a jolt. He growled angrily before noticing the two women caressing his cock through his pants. He saw the lust in their eyes that was stronger than their fear, before he settled down and they took that as permission granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering the pants, the scientists immediately took in the sight of Doomsday's huge cock. Standing at a staggering 18 inch cock and 5 inches thick and enormous balls, the two women saw it as the cock of a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women took turns worshipping their gods huge cock, eagerly sucking, licking and kissing the Beast, the pheromones making them both mindless with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoomsday meanwhile felt his strength growing with each suck, lick and kiss. His strength became so great that he began to overwhelm the restraints and as the two sluts came on their fingers, Doomsday broke free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women were too overwhelmed with lust to feel fear, as the creature walked over to them and, without warning, lifted one of the women by the waist and shoved his cock deep into her pussy. The pain was indescribable for the woman but so was the pleasure. The other woman stayed on her knees and sucked on his large balls with reverence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the woman came so hard she would be unconscious for several hours, Doomsday turned to the other who immediately turned around and presented her ass to him. Instantly and without hesitation, Doomsday buried his cock in her ass, thrusting as much as he could get in. The woman screamed in agony before moaning in pleasure as the creature's pheromones made it impossible to feel pain for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several thrust of his mighty behemoth, during which the woman had multiple mind shattering orgasms and was now barely responsive, Doomsday pulled out and let the girl fall to the floor before releasing an enormous load of cum all the brain dead whores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he starred at their cum covered forms, Doomsday wanted more. the sexual activity had increased his strength and his intelligence and soon he would be a god. He turned to look at the monitors showing the Justice League. He grinned. He knew where to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by the door opening and a male voice called \"Holy Fuck! Open Fire!\" he ordered, and immediately a hail of bullets sailed towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they did nothing. Except make him angry. Doomsday let out a mighty roar as he ploughed through the men like they weren't there, ripping apart their bodies like tissue paper. Any female soldiers eagerly began to service him, ignoring how their male colleagues were massacred as they had all been in this facility or near Doomsday for so long that they were incapable of thinking of anything but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would continue like this for hours as Doomsday massacred the men foolish enough to dare attack him, and destroyed the eager women desperate enough to serve. Eventually he was out of the cum and blood soaked base and looked towards the city nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that there was a hero there and he would destroy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich city is it and which hero does Doomsday destroy?</span></div></div>",
