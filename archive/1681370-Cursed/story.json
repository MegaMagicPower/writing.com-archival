The glow -- thank goodness -- is beginning to fade, and you can finally see what has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water hasn't drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see that the bath-pool is still full of hot water. You, however, are half in, half out of the soapy mix. Your abdominal muscles are cut deeply into your stomach, and your chest muscles are broad and strong-looking. Your arms are powerful and stick into the water, but you can see that they're perfectly proportioned, muscular and tough. Feeling your face with a massive palm, you feel an angular chin and last night's stubble sitting on a broad and strong neck. Getting out of the water, you look down to see perfectly set legs, lean and thick, ending in large feet. Your thing is also big, but you've never really thought much about it and didn't do so this time. Why bother obsessing over something God gave you? Still, you acknowledge its growth with a nod and a little pat. Walking over to the mirror, you flex your new, giant muscles and smile broadly, revealing white, beautiful teeth centered straight beneath your nose.</span></div></div>",

Virtually anything can happen as a result of the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamples I'll give are physical changing, bad luck, and ethereal revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you can also be bewitched. It all depends on what you do at the beginning of the narrative. Helping the witch will result in physical changing, good luck, or ethereal kindness. There are more options for both categories, but putting them here is not my idea of a good time. So, I'll let you figure out what happens next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, use real English and keep the storyline relevant. This story is about the unnamed hero, in a word \"You\", not Jane the Housekeeper who, oddly enough, is the spectator to an unusual event.
