In all the confusion to make it quick so that you didn't collect too many absences, you had accidentally been accepted into an all-girl school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your first day came, the faculty were outraged. They began working to get you back into your old school, but they had to allow you to go to class until you were transferred back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd at first, being the only guy in your classes full of incredibly pretty girls your age. Seeing all of them, you realized that the best, hottest girls must have all come to this school. The rest must have ended up at your old school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, though, you had discovered that they were taking a field trip to a nearby candy factory. You'd found yourself squished between two girls on the ride over: a bombshell-blonde freshman named Miranda, and a sweet brunette by the name of Janesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd found out that the local factory actually made a knock-off of M&amp;M's, called D&amp;D's. You had been allowed to explore a little bit, but were warned very sternly not to enter a room with a \"Authorized Personnel Only\" sign on it. After spacing out while looking down at the D&amp;D's candy-making machines from the platform you stood on though, your entire class seemed to have disappeared. However, there weren't any employees telling you where and where not go, either. You decided to sneak off into the dark room behind the forbidden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking only a few steps, a bright light had shined through the room from a faraway wall, blinding you completely. It seemed to pierce your body and sent an odd sensation through you until you lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you found yourself surrounded by giant D&amp;D's candies inside of a package. It took you a minute to realize it, but you really believed that you were now shrunken and in a bag of this chocolate candy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that worried you most, though, was where you and the other future snacks were headed. Obviously, somebody had the package of D&amp;D's, but who??</span></div></div>",

Were you going to be cooked alive and eaten merely as an experimental dessert for Miranda's mom? You gulped hard, hearing the bus come to a halt. Within seconds, the girls all scrambled to get out of the bus. After they got off, they all left to go home. They'd been dismissed for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miranda got home, she kicked off her shoes and walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" she said to herself. \"Mom won't be home 'til 5:00. I bet I can make this and still finish my homework in time to go hang out at Hanna's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the candy on the counter and pulled out pots and pans from different counters. She also gathered various ingredients, ranging from sugar to peanuts, and began melting a mixture on the stove. She poured all of the ingredients into a large bowl and when the time came, she opened the bag of candy. Her phone then began to ring, so she picked up and started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Oh, hey! Yeah, I'm still coming over. I'm just finishing up a new recipe I made. Do you think I can do my homework at your house, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talked on the phone, she dumped the contents of the bag into the bowl and began stirring it around. She didn't even see you, because she looked up at a nearby clock as she stirred. By the time she looked into the bowl to see if it was mixed well, you were coated and hidden in melted chocolate, Rice Krispies, and peanuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up, Miranda began to spoon dessert into a large rectangular pan. Now came your worst moment of fear yet. Was she going to put you into the oven, where you would slowly be cooked to your death? The thought of it made you tremble...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as she shuts the door, you begin to feel the 350 degree temperature inside. You start to worry as well when you still can't move underneath your chocolate coating. Is this really the way you are going to end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, your entire body is soaking in sweat. Everything is going red, plus your insides are so hot from beginning to boil that it pains you like nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes pass and Miranda checks on the dessert. She does not see anything out of the ordinary, and closes the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes of cooking, Miranda returns to the kitchen one final time. She dons oven mitts and pulls the pan from the oven. After testing it with a toothpick, she turns off the oven and walks to the other side of the kitchen. She takes a pencil and opens up a notebook, writing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you a treat - Enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, Miranda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves the note by the pan and then grabs her books before heading out the door.

She then pulls one out and moves a crumbling half of it before it falls to the floor. She savors its taste and tries to think of all that is inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Tastes like peanuts, M&amp;M's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts the rest of the bar into her mouth and chews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm! I can't tell what's in this piece!

Brushing yourself off of D&amp;D debris that had clung to your clothing beforehand, you look around at the candy that actually dwarfed you in size. By your own comparison estimate to the piece of candy, you were about an eighth of an inch tall... which was staggering, to put it mildly.

To your surprise, the girl hasn't stooped over yet to pick them up, even though it was clear she noticed them drop. To think how much you must resemble one of the pieces, and that she wouldn't have suspected in a million years that her new, currently miniaturized friend was among them. You almost feel yourself sliding as you try to adjust to the floor, which although not rough to the touch wasn't as smooth to you at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was incredible how much was revealed to you about things when you were close enough, and small enough, to witness their nuances firsthand. It was like looking through a microscope. You are jarred from your thoughts, suddenly, as a thunderous sound like some kind of high-level tremor ripped through your eardrums. Jerking your head back you realize that was merely the sound generated by an idle step from Miranda, which placed her foot just inches from where you now ran. this causes you to skid to a halt, taking in the full horror of the situation. True, you had to keep running to survive, but would the girl actually crush you unwittingly if you went ahead now? It might be better to allow Miranda to pass you now and spare you the paranoia of wondering if the next step would result in her crushing you. </span></div></div>",

However, she was no such thing, so you'd escaped. Unfortunately, your escape did not last long before you were once again whisked off by somebody else. You'd landed down inside of someone's bookbag, falling and rolling around inside as he or she walked to their parents' car to leave school. After the person throws their bag across the back seat of the car and takes a seat, you discover who has \"saved\" you when your hear her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad,\" the brown-haired girl from the bus said, her voice very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Janesa,\" her mom replied. \"How was your day at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. The field trip was okay; it was kinda boring,\" she told them, undoing the band around her ponytail to let her hair down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled her face in your mind, her beautiful, cool-natured features with her doe-like brown eyes and pleasant, pink lips. She had a smile that had raised your stomach into your throat whenever you saw it, and her face lit up when she seemed to acknowledge the fact that she could remain cool and in control of you while you could hardly manage a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then her pretty face left your head as you remembered that you were, in fact, still in danger. Would Valerie and Ms. Ducasse really just let you go? And what had happened to Miranda, your other hot new friend? More than likely, the cruel women had kept their promise, and Miranda could be completely gone from the world at this point. But, you didn't want to think about that. Instead, you filled your mind with the last words she'd said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we'll see each other again. I really hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pretty smile, the way she'd closed her eyes and looked happy as she said it... You would not allow yourself to believe that she'd sacrificed herself to save you.</span></div></div>",

Wanting to seek protection from the looming textbooks waiting to crush you, you seek solace in a small pencil box. After laying in there like a coffin, you decide to make the most of your situation and laid your head on a block eraser and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fates wouldn't let you sleep peacefully, though. When you woke up, you were laying on the floor of the principal's office. However, you weren't quite yourself... you felt like you were being controlled by something, as if you were on some sort of autopilot or something. You took a quick glance downwards and you noticed that you really weren't yourself. You had girl parts! This blows that dream where you were running around the school naked out of the water! However, before you could think anymore about the subject, you were picked up by smooth fingers, only to look into the face of Ms. Ducasse! \"She's awake, Valerie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time! Why didn't you just stomp her while you could?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, it's much more fun to see her reaction while she's awake. She wouldn't squirm a lot if she were still unconscious, would she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was the whole point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, you did a really good job at keeping that boy away from me Miranda. I should congratulate you. Was it really worth it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice wavered as you said in Miranda's voice, \"I couldn't let you hurt him. What you're doing is wrong, and you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Ducasse laughed. \"Oh, I know that it's wrong, but that hasn't stopped me! What's really wrong is that that bumbling buffoon is principal of this cesspool, while I spent six years on getting a Master's degree in physics just to teach bratty bimbos how to tie their own shoes! You see, she got that way purely because she was lucky, and a favorite of the superintendent, while I slaved away in college for six long years! In other words, life's not fair. Why don't you think about that as you wither away in my stomach acids?\" With that, Ms. Ducasse opened her mouth and extended her tongue. You started sobbing and pleading and begging for your life, but she was still dangling you over her open mouth, eager to drop you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still a shame that we can't get that boy. He's going to be a real thorn in your side until we find him.\" Valerie said, thinking aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our side, Valerie. OUR side! You're in this too, you know. As for the boy, that's water under the bridge. It's too late to do anything about it now. Now both of you, shut up. Miranda here, is about to learn a biology lesson she'll never forget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and prepare for the worst. Instead of being coated in saliva or your body being ripped in half, you hear Valerie yell, \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came up with an idea to get that boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Ducasse stopped dangling you over her mouth and started paying attention to Valerie. \"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know that boys can't resist saving the beautiful maiden, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Ducasse had a look of disbelief. \"You've been reading too many fairy tales lately, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really. He'll be looking for a way to save her, or at the very least, avenge her death. Well, what if we used her as bait to lure him back here! We'll have both our witnesses and we'll have no one left to stop us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Ducasse was pondering the idea. \"Fine.\" She said, and tossed you to Valerie. \"Keep her in your office. You've got until Friday for him to show up. After that, I want her either in your gut, or in the carpet! Ms. Ducasse then walked out of the room while Valerie has a hint of uneasiness in her face and covered you up with her other hand as the world faded into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up back in the pencil box. There must have been a reason for you have gotten this dream. Most importantly, Miranda was still alive! But only until Friday. You tried to remember what day it was, and you remembered that today was Tuesday. After today, that gives you only three days for you to find Miranda and get back to normal size! Before you can start planning, the box floods with light, and a girl shrieks in terror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes went wide as you gaze upwards at Ms. Ducasse's foot. The buzzing sensation that came from the adrenaline of falling helped you remember all the things of your dreams. This was a dream come true, you couldn't take it anymore and reached out to- HOLD IT! You take a deep breath and try to lower your heart rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was clearly foolish. Sure this was the opportunity of a lifetime, but it would likely result in your death. Her toes were bigger than you are, a single wrong move and you'll be paste! For the first time you lower your eyes away from her foot. Her amazing, perfect foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches your attention again. It was a smell. It was like...vanilla. You raise your head again and sniff in a few directions. When you find which direction it was coming from you couldn't help but make a smile. It was coming from Ms. Ducasse's foot. Taking a step closer, you get a better smell. She must use some kind of vanilla scented lotion. There was also a bit of sweat you could smell, probably from walking around for the day, but it was meager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the monolith in front of you shifted. Surprised, you fell back on your butt and watched as she shifted her legs. They became crossed and she began dangling one of her heels. From this perspective you could see the heel of her bare foot and it was waving the smell towards you in waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I am not going to do it!\" you say to yourself. You began to breathe through your mouth and look away. Repeating it over and over in your head, you convince yourself to not give in. \"Oops\" you hear above you. Looking up you see a black heel falling towards you like a meteor! You began to scramble away as it makes its way directly upon you. You run as fast as you can muster. You can hear it falling above you, driving you to move faster. Finally, you hear it crash down behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back and it was only a few of your feet behind you. Taking a couple of steps you come up to the entrance of the shoe. There was a lingering smell of feet and vanilla. You look back up and your heart misses a couple of beats. Directly above you is Ms. Ducasse's, the young and beautiful teacher, bare foot. You could see her part of her smooth sole, her flexing toes with black polish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it. You can't take anymore. You crawl inside of her heel. The insole is warm and moist to the touch. You move towards the arch section, figuring it would be the best place to survive. Since it's on the side, you have to wait for it to be turned back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up again, you see giant hands reach down and pick up the shoe. As it turns upright, you lay down on the insole looking up. Ms. Ducasse brings the shoe up towards her bare foot, giving you an even better view every second. Then she begins to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes pass over your head as they move towards their section. You reach a hand up and feel her smooth skin as it glides by. Silk was sandpaper compared to her. Then the massive wall of skin moved downwards onto you. To anyone else it looked like the teacher was placing on a lost shoe, but to you it was like heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot placed onto you, applying a bit of pressure onto you. Your arms were spread open, so it kinda felt like you were hugging her sole. The smell of her lotion was mixed with feet and much stronger. Curiosity got the best of you and you plant a small kiss on the foot. It really did taste like vanilla.</span></div></div>",

I'll be just a minute, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary turns away from Claire and enters into a room behind her. Unfortunately, the minute that the door closed, Claire realized what she might've just done. Sadly, that would be the last moment she would ever see her older brother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room, the secretary takes the gum from her mouth and speaks to you in a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sad that you must end this way, but we can't take the risk of returning you to normal only to sue us or go public with our secrets. So, it's necessary that rare incidents like you are taken care of personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to protest, but she covers your entire body with the piece of gum. Then, before you can try to struggle and get free, she places the gum back into her mouth. Her fresh breath greets you as you are planted inside, then her tongue pushes you across to her teeth, where she proceeds to combine you with her gum. Your body is crunched apart, stuck inside the gum, and eventually is virtually indiscernible from the gum itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you still in her gum, the secretary leaves the room and returns to her desk. She smiles at Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother has been taken care of. We've made sure that he has gotten the attention that he deserves, but it may be a while before you hear back from him, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire says nothing at first, but nods and accepts the secretary's answer. She then exits through the doors, unaware that her brother was still being chomped on by the pretty, deceptive secretary. When the door closed, she even blew a large bubble, with pieces of you blended in. Claire had turned her head, still not convinced by the secretary's words, and saw the bubble. She vaguely saw little spots upon it, but thought little of it until the secretary returned her glance and winked back with a cool smile. Claire swallowed hard as the secretary burst the bubble, but she continued walking away from the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing Claire could do but pray that the secretary had meant what she said about you.</span></div></div>",

She puts you up to her ear, where you can whisper without being overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll warn you if something doesn't seem right,\" you tell her. \"We have to avoid going into the room that I shrunk in, or they might try and shrink you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems surprised that you were thinking something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary leads Claire down a hallway before stopping in front of a door marked 'Office.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please go inside,\" she tells Claire. \"Mr. Harrington will be right with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press down on your sister's hand before she opens the door and she quickly realizes the potential danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go in first, please,\" Claire tells the secretary. Suddenly, the control shifts into your and Claire's hands. The secretary, with her attempt to get rid of the both of you foiled, looks even more stunned than before. She stands still for a moment, trying to think of what to do, and then turns to knock on the door, pretending that someone might actually be inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Mr. Harrington? Are you in there?\" she asks, trying to sound convincing. \"Hm.. I guess he's not in there after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I don't know what you're trying to pull,\" Claire says strongly to the secretary. \"But if you don't return my brother to normal right this instant, there's going to be a lot of trouble when I take this to the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary finally gives up her act. With a sly smile, she replies, \"You don't really think the police will believe you, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll believe whatever they hear when they see a shrunken kid,\" Claire retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up with a new sense of respect for your sister. She'd always been a little bit passive, tending to avoid confrontations, but now she was pushing this secretary around like a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" the secretary says. \"Follow me. This time for real, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nods and walks with the secretary again. However, you begin to notice very familiar sights. In fact, after turning a corner down the hall, you find that you and Claire have both been guided back onto the platform where, across the way and above the large candy-making machines, was the door to the room where you'd originally been shrunk. Things were about to get serious.</span></div></div>",

You quickly warn Claire with a press against her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the room!\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and looks up at it. You scan the surroundings as well, realizing now how you'd been put into the candy that was eventually nearly eaten by Claire. Just below the forbidden room was a large vat of finished D&amp;D's candies. Whatever was inside of that room had more than likely dumped you into that vat, then proceeded to move you through the procedure which had bagged you up with the candy and then shipped you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here,\" the secretary began, as she pointed to the door marked 'Authorized Personnel Only,' \"is where <i></i>you<i></i> were shrunk, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you as she asks, and you nod defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here is also where we can return anything we've shrunken back to its normal size. It's something we try to keep secret because if the government knew we had something that could do this, it'd be taken away and our factory would more than likely be shut down, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have something that can shrink people?\" Claire asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the secretary laughs. \"We don't usually plan on having people shrunken inside there. Unfortunately, sometimes we graciously allow school field trips to come here, only to have some dumb kid who can't read trip inside and find himself shrunken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason we have it is because Mr. Harrington has always had the concept for a machine that shrinks people in his head, but never had the opportunity to create such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's a machine, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he first founded this factory, he could use funds to make his dream-machine, but he could use the cover-up of a candy-making factory whenever the nosy government popped in to try to regulate the place. He's been able to work on this forbidden machine for many years, but it's too advanced for the culture to accept yet. For whatever reason, people don't think having a size-changing machine would be a good thing. At least, the government doesn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is she telling us this stuff, you wonder. By doing this, you and Claire could take this to the authorities and have the company exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it isn't when you use it for bad things like you've done to my brother!\" Claire tells the secretary. \"His life has been in danger several times because of your machine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, sometimes we have visitors that are too curious for their own good,\" she replies. \"Here, I'll return your brother back to normal, and I'll even come inside with you if it makes you feel better. But, there's one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't tell anything I've told you to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press down on Claire's hand before she speaks too soon. In these past few days, you've become wiser. There's always a catch for something that seems too good to be true. However, you need a moment to think about it. Why has this secretary who has gone from probably trying to kill off the both of them by having them enter a room by themselves suddenly decided to tell them all of the company's secrets before giving you what you want? Is she trying to help you out and also put an end to this evil company as well? Or, has she been trying to gain your and Claire's trust by telling you all of these things? After all, out of the three of them, the secretary was the one most likely to know what was in the room and how to use it to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be no good if you went in only to share your fate with Claire and probably be finished off easier later. But, if you didn't go into the room with her, would you ever return to normal?</span></div></div>",

When you step on the floor switch, whatever the wall switch is set to - whether that be shrink or grow - the floor switch does. So, when you stepped on it, the wall switch was set to shrink. That's why you shrank when you stepped on the floor switch. But, if I set the wall switch to grow, you can step on the floor switch and return to normal size. There isn't really any variation yet, but Mr. Harrington is working on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the switches at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary points to their locations, but you can't see well enough inside the pitch-black room to tell if she's lying or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Claire keeps going, though, you add, \"Wait. How do we know that you aren't setting the wall switch to shrink instead of grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there really isn't. We don't label the switches, trying to make them obvious to everybody. But you'll have to trust me. We really do want the best for you, but Mr. Harrington can't keep working on this great new machine if you tell people about it. All his hard work will go down the drain, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and wipe away the sweat on your forehead. You gaze into the room once more, but still see nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you finally nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire follows the secretary closely, and they both watch her back as closely as they can in the dark room. However, the secretary stops a few steps in and talks to them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the floor switch is a little bit further ahead. You'll both have to step on it in order for it to work, so just hold him like you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't I grow too, though?\" Claire asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the secretary replies. \"Once you get closer, if you notice, there's a top to the machine. If something in there is bigger than so many feet, it can only be shrunken. On the other hand, if something is shorter than that height, it can only grow. It's a flaw in the machine, still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire steps closer to the floor-switch, hands above her, and verifies the secretary's statement by feeling the top of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I set the wall-switch to grow, so when both feet touch the floor-switch, your brother should grow back to normal size. You, the girl, won't get any bigger, though. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp hard and Claire waits for your signal. With one last final fruitless gaze into the darkness ahead, you press her hand and she steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant that both feet touch the floor-switch, the bright light returns, filling up the room instantly. You managed to squint your eyes in order to see that far ahead of you was a tall wall with a long cone-like pole sticking out of it horizontally, aimed at your and Claire. It seemed to be shooting the beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you saw the secretary standing behind a safety wall next to the small wall-switch, but she was smiling mischievously. You quickly look over at your sister, only to find that she is being shrunken as well. Unfortunately, the secretary had led you both right into a trap, as she'd wanted. Sadly, you'd now drawn your own sister into your predicament as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light dimmed down, the room fell dark again. You and Claire were both unconscious, even though you had not changed size a bit. Deep in your sleep, you had no clue that the secretary's fingers were wrapping around you and your sister. Unfortunately, neither of you would ever wake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary that had tricked you and Claire raised you up from the floor and slipped you both into her mouth. To make sure there would never be trouble from either of you again, she grinded the pair of you between her teeth until you'd both been combined into a mush inside of her mouth. Then with one final swallow, you both fell into the secretary's slender stomach, where you were never heard from - except by the secretary - again.</span></div></div>",

Her tongue pushed the piece of you that left her teeth back between them as they once again grinded you apart. This proceeded for a moment until nothing was left of you but hundreds of smashed and mulched morsels of your body. Claire got once final taste of her chewed up brother upon her smooth tongue before she swallowed and sent you down even further, pushing you into her stomach where she cremated you inside of her slim midsection a few hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, you realized in the next world, it was going to be quite the story to explain to her, having to explain how you up and disappeared one day and never came back.</span></div></div>",

It isn't long before you hear whispering above. You can't make out the words, but the voices sound sharp. You frown a little and feel a little awkward at what you're doing. However, your entire world receives a huge awakening when Ms. Ducasse suddenly rips her purse off the floor, sending you on your side and underneath all of the other contents inside. You hear her heels clicking below and feel the swing of the purse as she moves, which is a little bit rapidly - as if mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves the theater and you hear her enter her car. She throws the purse in the passenger seat, spilling several things out of it. You are tossed around inside of it, but aren't pushed out. You hear the engine start and she drives off. With a gulp, you wonder what might happen if she were to find you, especially if she really was mad right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick around in the purse until you're once again sent on a roller coaster ride when she picks it back up. After being tossed around for a while, it all ends when she throws it on the floor of her apartment and shuts the front door. You hear her walk off, but then things get really quiet. After a minute, you decide it's time to move. You climb out of the purse and see that you're in a small living room, with an open kitchen interconnected. There are two doors in the living room, but they're both closed, and Ms. Ducasse is nowhere in view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you find the floor, you wonder where to go.</span></div></div>",

She slowly walks over to the TV, and you start waving your arms. Her muddied eyes open wide when they see you. She even puts her face inches from you just to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you're... You're the new boy!\" she says in awe to you. \"W-why are you so small?

Actually, I don't think anyone knows I'm shrunken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister?\" she says a bit mindlessly. She spaces off for a moment, lost in thought. Her eyes cloud over a little, but you just watch her delicate, beautiful face and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Ducasse?\" you ask, but she doesn't hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she looks back over at you, this time with an odd look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And nobody knows you're shrunken, or here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... No,\" you answer, a little bit hesitant to reply. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up and comes closer to you, then picks you up in her soft, damp hand. She then takes you over towards her bed, which she sits down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here,\" she tells you as she puts you down on the end table. You nod and then she heads off into her bathroom, one room over. You hear water running for a minute, then some rustling around, but she doesn't return for nearly fifteen minute. When she comes back into the bedroom, you're stunned. She comes back in nothing but blue panties and a matching bra. You swallow hard and also notice that she's cleaned up her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Ducasse?\" you ask again, feeling sweat form on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits back down on the bed and looks at you, then laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she tells you, letting her laughter dwindle. \"I guess I should explain. I've been crying because my boyfriend broke up with me tonight. He asked me out to a movie, made-out, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trails off, leaving an angry look in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay then?\" you ask her, trying to be sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so sweet,\" she says to you. Then she picks you back up and slips her legs under her blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask awkwardly, unsure of if you should emphasize anger or confusion in your voice, so it comes out as a bad mixture of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need this tonight, I'm sorry,\" she apologizes again. \"It helps me get to sleep, and I don't like pills...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin freaking out, but it's too late. She stops talking and moves her hand - and you - underneath her covers. With her other hand, you see her remove her underwear, and you understand what's going on. She closes her eyes and her lips part, and she breathes in sharply as you enter her. She turns off the lamp with her free hand and then proceeds to have at it with your own body. You protest loudly, but she says nothing. She begins to moan after a while, pushing harder and faster, until after several minutes, she relaxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooohhhhh,\" she sighs contently. She pulls you free and holds you in her hand as it hangs over the side of her bed. She falls asleep and her grip loosens on you. However, the body that falls from her hand has long since lost its life and drops limply to the carpet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day you wake up to the bright light of the door opening. You blink and hold your arm over your eyes to shield them. The shoes you're in are picked up, startling you, but you squint and see that it's not Ms. Ducasse holding them. Instead, it's a young girl of about 13. She has the same shade of brown hair as Ms. Ducasse, even styled similarly, but with a different face. She's very cute and has nothing but a pair of jeans and a bra on. She places the pumps on the floor, at which point you realize that she's barefoot and that there are two other people with her. One is another girl about her age with straight brown hair in a ponytail and the other is probably one of their grandmothers, if not both of theirs. The grandma is sitting on Ms. Ducasse's couch watching TV, glancing at the two girls with only vague interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Aunt Valerie usually let you play dress up with her shoes girls?\" she asks the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" the first girl replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then puts her left foot into a matching pump, which doesn't even fill the whole shoe. Next, you see her other bare foot entering the pump that you're at the bottom of. Her glittery, multi-colored toes reach out towards you and then plant themselves on top of you. Her feet are a little bit warm, and she wiggles her toes on you playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna be a fancy teacher when I grow up!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be quieter, Maddie,\" the grandma says, trying to hear the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try, let me try!\" the other girl pipes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get another pair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to wear the red ones! Give 'em here!\" she persists. When Maddie crosses her arms and shakes her head defiantly, the other girl kneels down and starts pulling the pumps off of her. Both girls fall to the floor, and the shoes go up into the air. You and your shoe fly past the TV, near the front door, and Maddie catches the other one. Then both girls scramble over to get the other shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the collision of the flying shoe sent you tumbling out beside it, onto the wooden floor and out into the open. You rub your head and try to clear the dizziness you feel, but you never recover. With the rush of the two girls coming towards you, Maddie accidentally steps on and smashes you. She gets the other shoe, but you are now flattened on the wooden floor near the front door, devoid of any life whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Ms. Ducasse returns home later, you are picked up on the bottom of her bare feet as she walks inside with her shoes in her hands. She doesn't notice that she's gathered you into the other dirt and dust that are on her feet, but she goes to sleep with you, one of her students, on the sole of her foot.</span></div></div>",

She drops you off at the counter a good distance away from the sink so you don't fall in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, first of all wash your hands well. Second, tell me what ingredients you have. We'll make a single portion since I will consume much less than you will.\" You order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" says Anna. She washes her hands at the sink then checks out the refrigerator. \"We've got some cooking oil, potatoes, pizza sauce, eggs, tomatoes, leftover beef, some pancake batter and some herbs and spices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can cook up the potatoes with the oil, season them with the herbs, coat them in pizza sauce and heat up some of the beef as a side dish.\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" she says. \"How do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start by turning the gas up, but do mind the smell!\" you joke, pointing at your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna is visibly annoyed at the comment you made at the expense of her earlier fart. \"Haha, so funny.\" she says sarcastically, turning on the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pour about a cap's worth of cooking oil on the pan and start heating it up a bit, then start cutting the potatoes into thin slices and put 'em on the pan.\" you instruct, walking closer to her to inspect her cutting. Ahead of you is a drop of dish soap.</span></div></div>",

Now what?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guide her through the following steps and about 30 minutes later you've got a plate full of delicious-looking potatoes covered in a variety of herbs and pizza sauce and a small bowl with shredded beef to dip the potatoes in. Anna carries both you and the food to the dinner table and sits opposite of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's served!\" exclaims Anna. The two of you dig in, one more literally than the other. Anna always remains careful and makes sure to not accidentally eat you. Dinner goes by without a mishap. Anna leans back against her chair and you lie down on the table, both sighing in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious! Thanks for teaching me how make that.\" she says gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" you answer, glad that you were able to eat for the first time since breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looks at her sweaty clothes and declares \"I need a shower.\" You look at your own sweaty clothes and agree with the sentiment. \"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too small to bathe on your own.\" she says, looking away and blushing. \"I guess I could let you shower with me as thanks for the food. B-but only if you promise not to think perverted thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\" you said, hoping to not get a boner when you see her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna carries you to the bathroom and leaves you in the tub. You hand her your tiny clothes and she puts them in a cup with some detergent. \"L-look away.\" she says as she begins to take off her clothes. You look away, but then look back when she turns around. You see the sides of her breasts bouncing as she takes off her top and bra, her cute pink and white striped panties when she takes off her jeans and her gorgeous ass when she takes her panties off. You quickly turn around again just before she turns to face you. \"Y-you can look.\" she says. You turn around and see her stunning body before you, topped off with her cute blushing expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you look nice.\" you say, trying to think clean thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks.\" replies Anna. She extends her hand towards you and keeps you away from the tub floor as she begins to fill it with water. She keeps her left hand extended with you in her palm at chest height, giving you a chance to ogle at her boobs. She suddenly realizes this and shrieks, lifting you up to face level and looking at you with an angry and embarrassed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry.\" you say while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just stay on my shoulder, then.\" she says, placing you on her right shoulder. You slip and tumble down her back, being saved from the fall by her cheeks pinching you in place once you reach her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you okay?\" she asks shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay. Just don't eat any chips.\" you answer playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna blushes and feels indignation at that comment. \"Look, if you're gonna keep making fun of my fart then I'll leave you in my butt and see how you like it in there!\" she shouts while grabbing you out from her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you say. \"I wasn't trying to offend you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's okay. Sorry, I overreacted.\" her blushing made you feel embarrassed too, making you blush as well. \"W-why are you blushing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i'm blushing because you're blushing!\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower continues without either of you talking to one another. Once the bath is over, she puts your tiny clothes in the dryer. \"They should be easy to find, the only other clothes in there are my own.\" She brushes her teeth then puts on a nightgown and takes you up to her room. \"I don't have anything your size. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Thanks for even helping me.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiles and says \"Don't worry about it!\" She leans towards you and gives you a kiss. Your body sticks to her lips and falls in her tongue. It doesn't smell bad but feels scary. At the same time, you feel as though you are in ecstasy. Her tongue inadvertently tickles your member and makes you cum. You manage to crawl out of her mouth. She shrieks when she realizes what she had done and apologizes. \"I'm so sorry!\" she begs, face down on her bed. You walk towards her face and give her a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. It actually felt good.\" you tell her. She blushes. \"R-really?\" she asks. \"I want to do something in return for you.\" you tell her. She blushes and asks <br>\r\n\"W-w-what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to please you the way you pleased me.\" you tell her. She says \"A-a-a-absolutely not!\" fidgeting with her legs.\" You gently touch her right knee and say \"Are you sure? I'll be gentle and when you want me out just say so and I'll crawl out of your vagina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...\" she begins...</span></div></div>",

Apparently, neither of them had realized that she'd accidentally taken the wrong shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Lizzie enter her car, then feel the pressure of her toes on your legs as she presses her foot against the gas. She starts the engine up and begins driving, pressing more upon your lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her foot to the brakes as she nears a corner, then returns it to the gas. However, this time she begins pushing even harder on the gas, and puts a lot more weight on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer car accelerates loudly and roars off, apparently down the highway near your house. As the pressure on you from her foot builds, though, you realize that the Interstate is nearby. Worry fills your thoughts as you start to feel this was a bad idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie moves you over to the brakes and presses down, then she turns the car onto the Interstate. However, she tries to be gutsy and pull ahead of a nearby semi-truck, when she should wait. However, there is a line of cars beyond it, so she slams down as hard as she can on the gas. Without warning, your legs are reduced to pancake form underneath her toes, sending your own blood rushing down her foot. She feels its moisture through her thin socks, and wiggles her toes a little, dropping the rest of your immobilized body beneath her foot completely. With the pressure of her foot against the gas pedal, your upper half is slowly smashed into the sole of her foot, ending your painful experience for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiler?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices the feeling you make after being crushed, but she forgets about you by the time she gets home because her socks have dried.</span></div></div>",

There was one selling strictly food and another selling only drinks. Dollar bills were uncrumpled and straightened out in the girls' hands, and then they entered the machines as the girls made their selections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of voices outside that you could hear. As you realized your bag was moving and you were being purchased, you couldn't discern who was buying you. Not that it would've mattered, since you didn't know any of the girls outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peppy senior, a fit blonde with a pretty face and confident eyes, held you within her hand as she brought you back with her to class. Her fingernails were altermately painted the orange and yellow colors of Reese's Pieces, ironically enough. She had a cheerful laugh, bright smile, and a bounce in her step as she walked back with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you guys tried this new pop?\" one girl, a cheerleader, asked. \"It's called Cherry Cascade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" another responded. \"You shouldn't be drinking that anyway! It's bad for your figure, Jess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise! You've had Cherry Cascade before, haven't you?\" Jess asked your new owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope never,\" she answered as she popped a D&amp;D between her lips. \"Doesn't Orlando Bloom drink that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, does he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" another girl pops in. \"You know, you know, the commercial that goes, \"Cherrrrryyyyy Cassssscaaaaadeeee,\" and then Orlando Bloom sighs! That one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Elise exclaims. \"I LOVE Cherry Cascade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looks at her and frowns, but a mischievous glance out of the side of Elise's eyes turns Jess's lips back around. They both smile as they enter the classroom again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone sits back down, you realize that your time is coming. Elise's fingers are getting closer and closer to you. You'd been trying your best to escape her grasp, but you knew your time was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she was ready to finish her breakfast snack and flipped the bag upside down above her open mouth. You and the last three D&amp;Ds fell to her smooth tongue, but you were propelled further on, sliding down into her throat, where she was forced to swallow you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a choke and a hard cough, Elise caught the attention of her class. She grabbed her throat with one hand, but smile with one closed eye at her classmates reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, just a tricky piece.\"</span></div></div>",

However, we noticed something... unusual, on your X-ray.

Thinking you a bug feeling up her foot, she has stopped the car on the side of the street and now has a flip-flop in her hand. She looks around for you, spotting you instantly. Your eyes meet, hers unrecognizing towards you. She doesn't realize who you are, not that it would matter with the creeping creature she thinks you are. You see her, a giantess compared to you, with a look of pure killing intent. You suddenly feel like a spider, those curious little bugs that accidentally find themselves spotted by humans and then are smothered into mush due to unnecessary fear. Now, you were in the spider's place. All those spiders you ever killed, now you were about to be crushed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid bug,\" your mom says at you, flip-flop in hand. \"I'll kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even react, her flip-flop is upon you. She smashes you underneath it...</span></div></div>",

Unable to move, you looked up your sister's long legs, seeing her wide breasts and pretty face. Her friend was not bad looking at all, either. But, as if to be punished for looking at the girls that way, you suddenly found your sister's bare foot, extending out of her flip-flops, right towards you. It descended down upon you, her smooth sole and sleek red-nailed toes, until you were buried underneath her foot. She rolled it on top of you playfully, thinking you a knot in the carpet. Then, you found yourself suddenly caught between her toes, trapped. It was an amazing experience, with Claire lifting her feet to the couch where she wrapped her arms around her knees and pressed you and her feet against the cushion.

With that thought, you were deafened from a loud, indistinguishable sound coming all around you, coming at the same rates as the blasts of air hitting you. Your small form was choking poor Samantha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Sam?\" a voice, feminine but young, asked. Sam unfortunately wasn't able to answer. \"Oh my God, Sam's choking!\" You feel a steady rumbling, that is slowly moving you back up, but Sam is still choking. Suddenly, the air blasts got stronger, and stronger, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*COUGH* *HACK* *COUGH* *HAAAAAAAACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blinded by the sudden torrent of light as you careened out of Samantha's mouth like a human cannonball! You rebounded off back of the passenger seat, then off of Samantha's chest and onto her skirt. You feel... well, you don't feel too hot right now. Your vision is starting to go fuzzy. Another young girl, slightly younger, beside the one who just inhaled you asked again, \"You alright, Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had regained her breathing and replied, \"Yeah, I'm fine Em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou black out, still drenched in the girl's saliva.

You were downright terrified. \"Oh, sorry!\" She said quietly, \"I didn't mean to scare you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in your surroundings. Samantha was wearing her glasses, apparently prescription, as she was in pajamas now. She must have been about to go to bed. A semi-dim light was coming from a lamp on your right side. She was lying in a single bed while you were on her chest. Not too far behind you on both sides were two blue mounds the size of a large hill. Your head rested on a button on a floating piece of fabric that bridged between them. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our family got a hotel. We're staying here for the night, then moving on. I'm curious, how did you get that small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Samantha everything that had happened to you, from the school field trip, to you being shrunk and bagged, and finally to you nearly getting eaten by her, but saved your life by threatening hers.\"Wow, that's quite a story you've got there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can you please help me? I need you to take me back to the D&amp;D's factory so I can get back to my original size. Will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was deep in thought. \"Mm, sure. I think I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to hug her breast, but your tiny arm span couldn't hope to encompass it. \"Thank you, you have no idea how much this means to me.\" You look back to here where she has an odd look on her face. Embarrassed, you awkwardly said, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone matching her face, she said, \"I'll ignore that for now. Anyways, I need to find a place for you to sleep. I don't think can keep you anywhere else. I might lose you, or someone may see you. If I put you on my bed I might accidentally crush you. I think I'll have to keep you on my person somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to protest. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading your mind, Sam replies, \" Oh, don't worry. I don't roll around in my sleep that much. Now where should I put you?\" She thinks thoroughly. Finally, Sam sighs like she was going to regret what she was about to do. She placed you on the night stand and opened her suitcase and retrieved a bra. She unbuttoned the first few buttons on her pajama top and said, \"Here, sleep in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to sleep in your bra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nononononononono, I'll manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed into one of the cups as Sam slipped it down her shirt. \"I'm going to have a lot of explaining to do when everyone else sees that I'm wearing a bra to bed in the morning.\" You started snuggling into Sam's soft breasts, where her steady heartbeat was lulling you to sleep. It was a tight fit, but you'll manage. It was real odd that a total stranger was being this kind to you. But hey, when are you ever going to get another chance like this again? Maybe you could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I catch you playing with something you shouldn't, I'll squash you like a grape.\" Sam went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed put. Never mind.</span></div></div>",

As you were hanging onto her hair, you heard the zipping and rustling of clothes beneath you. After what seemed like hours, you heard the creak of a door and movement. You took this opportunity to climb back up. You saw Sam gazing at her reflection. This was the first time, you had actually got a good look at Sam. She was in a blue bikini, and her skin was the same shade as fine silk. Her hair was the color of mahogany, and her squinty eyes were complimented by her freckles on each cheek. If you were normal sized, you never would never have given this girl the time of day, because she wasn't as developed in other areas. But somehow, you were being drawn to her. Maybe it was the kindness she showed you... well, at first, and your new perspective on things.

One, stay away from food, or else you might end up being someone's lunch.\" Sam started to crack a smile. \"And two, stay close to someone who can protect you. At this point, looks don't matter to me. I'm just lucky that I found someone as pretty as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's freckled cheeks turned a rosy shade as she picked you up and placed you in her palm. \"Thank you,\" she said. I'm glad you think that way.\" With her free hand, she unzipped a duffel bag with her clothes inside. \"This is your last chance, you can stay there while I'm out here. You'll be much safer in there.\" She holds her hand above the open bag, so all you have to do is jump.</span></div></div>",

You discretely climbed down her hair just like you planned and into her cleavage. Sam winced and blushed a bit as you landed, but didn't take her eyes off her puzzle. As the secretary called for the next tour, everyone walked to the door. During this chaos, she walked up to Sam and started parting her hair. \"What are you doing?\" Sam asked innocently and sarcastic at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise inspection.\" The secretary lied. \"We don't want you taking any thing we don't want in the factory.\" As she ended that sentence, her face was peering down Sam's breasts. You slid down further to hope that you would escape detection. Then, your feet slipped off Sam's bra and you were holding on with just your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making me feel weird.\" Sam said, noting the implications. Embarrassed, and not wanting to attract attention, the secretary fled back to the desk. You were safe, but you couldn't pull yourself back up.

Of course, you were still enrolled at the all-girls school (they stopped working on your transfer when you were missing). Most of your classmates were happy to see you again. Though, most of the teachers, especially Ms. Ducasse, the one who chaperoned the field trip in the first place, were not so happy. You had a bad feeling about her, but before either of you could do anything, you were transferred back to your old school. You had to admit that you were going to miss it there. You did friend Samantha on Facebook, but the two of you never talked much after that. However, as it turned out, you DID end up seeing her again, during a chain of events including shrink rays, drugged candies, growth elixir, and brainwash formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's another story...</span></div></div>",

You then untangle yourself from the carpet fibers and get back onto your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that hits you is the smell of feet. You look around you and see Samantha has her feet removed from her blue canvas flats and Emily is wearing dirty flip flops. You then look over at the people in the driver and passenger seats. Unknown to you, the woman in the passenger seat is the mother named Margaret. She is in her mid 50's but looks more in her early 40's. She has a pillow behind her head and seems to be napping during the drive. The driver is much younger. She is actually Samantha's Oldest sister named Lucy. Lucy is 31 years old and is their driver because their mother never learned how to drive and she needed somebody to drive the rest of the family. Lucy is driving barefoot and left her sandals resting between the driver and passenger seat. Which are blocking your way should you want to get to the front of the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decide what you should do next. You could try and pound the nearest foot. Which is Samanthas. Tho it is dangerous because you could be mistaken for a bug and killed. Or, you could make your way to the people in the front instead. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

After all the longer you wait by these other D&amp;D piece's the more danger you could be in to be thrown out, or if they aren't grossed out by the floor.... eaten. Raising your arm you struck Samantha's heel with a mighty blow, witnessing no result. A second blow was thrown, followed by a third, and again to no prevail. You looked up at Samantha to see if any effect could be seen on her face, but instead she seem to be chiding her sister for spilling all the candy. You would need to do something else this isn't working.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   Adapting tactics once again you figured that you should more aggressively attempt to get her attention. Taking a running start you lunged bashing your shoulder into her heel with near full force. From your view you could see a ripple effect spread across her foot. Samantha was also looking down at the floor looking in your general direction. It worked! Now just one good hit like that will hopefully help get you noticed! You prepared yourself, eyes locked, position set, and plan in mind. With a running jump and a shoulder impact she will surely have to investigate, and you will be able to escape from this precarious position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The form was perfect. The spring was perfect. The angle was perfect. What was not perfect was her moving her left foot up to see if something was hitting it, before you made contact. That was unexpected... and instead of hitting her heel you were sent careening over that spot in the air, and into her flats. The smell was absolutely unbearable, and considering how close you already were to her feet, that's really saying something. This setback was not great, but it only proceeded to get worse as one of the worse sounds you could have heard at the time came was heard. -Creeak-  At first you did not recognize this mechanical sound that pervaded your ears, but soon you caught on to what it was, the breaks of the car, and the sound of the parking gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Soon after it dawned on to you what that sound was you were greeted by an even more unwelcoming realization in the form of a foot's shadow engulfing you. With panic surging through your body you attempt to revault over the side of the flat. With her putting her flats on however you found that she was raising the with her foot to meet the heel, rather then putting the heel down to meet the shoe. So as soon as you jumped the floor raised and you found yourself embracing the wall of the shoe, and then shortly after her heel. Being pushed up into the heel, rather then down into the shoe, was no less painful as you found a tremendous force pinning you to her foot. Slowly though you found yourself falling down ever  so slightly to the shoe proper, and if was there you got to see the unique image of a skin ceiling come down onto you crushing you to death. In the end you were flattened to death by Sam in her appropriately name flats. And that dear viewers leads us to....</span></div></div>",

Stacy finishes the last few pieces of cereal, then begins to lift the bowl up to her face.

After watching her go about her business in the room, you decide that you need to take action. You can hear feet coming down the stairs, and are able to ascertain that it is one of Stacy's daughters. She probably goes to your new school, so catching a ride on her would bring you one step closer to getting back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bag is near the front door, and it's safe to say she'll be taking it with her to school. On the other hand, you might not make it all the way to the front door in time, so a more passive approach might be considerably wiser, and more convenient.</span></div></div>",

The smell becomes significantly stronger, as the milk-acid mixture produces the unpleasant odour of spoiled milk. The stomach, recognising the ease of which the cereal breaks down, expedites the process of digestion and progresses onward toward the next stage. You feel the levels of liquid slowly drop, but can't see anything. You can only assume that the contents of Stacy's stomach are flowing onward into the small intestine, and you are about to follow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel a strong tug at your feet. You realise you are standing directly on top of the sphincter that leads to the intestine, and are being forced into the next stage. You are pulled down, and milk begins to cover your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to hold your breath. The seconds tick by, and your lungs burn for oxygen. You gasp for air, but find none.

Her lips shut behind you, sealing all light from the cavern you now occupy. The cereal has become soggy, giving Kelley no reason to chew. The spoon slides from beneath you, as the motion of her retracting it and her mouth moving you towards her throat begins you on your journey. Head over heels, you tumble in the saliva-cereal-milk mixture towards her throat. Your size amounts to nothing, as you fall down her throat instead of actually being swalllowed. Only stands of saliva manage to slow your hellish decent, as you land in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager's stomach is in overdrive, as it gladly accepts its first meal since the previous night. Digestive juices begin mixing with the cocktail of terror you traveled with, and the effects are noticable. The soggy cereal bits become almost nothing, as their weakened states make their breakdowns much faster than yours will be. It takes several minutes before your skin starts to itch: a sign that the acids are begining to take effect. You continue to sit in darkness, as the movement of Kelley walking around and her stomach trying to break you down toss you to and fro. The itching intensifies, and your flesh begins to peel.
