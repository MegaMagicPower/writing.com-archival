They saw Count Dracula's castle straight ahead and prepared to land. As they landed Phanty couldn't help but take in all of the Gothic <br>\r\n<br>\r\nscenery of the castle and the grounds that surrounded it. \"Wow, fancy\" she said out loud. \"Indeed\" replied Phantom. \"Now I want you to be on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour best behavior while we're here. Dracula is a very close friend and I don't want you to do anything to embarrass me, understand\"? he said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfirmly. \"Yes daddy\" she said rolling her eyes (without him noticing of course). Phantom knocked loudly on the door. After a short wait the door <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncreaked open and they were met by one of Dracula's many servants. \"Ah, hello and good afternoon Mr. Phantom, we have been expecting <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou. Please come in\" said the small and shrill man. They made their way into the main corridor and were greeted by the man they (or at least <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhantom) had come to see. \"Phantom! You transparent bastard, it's good to see you\" said Dracula jokingly as he made his way over to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhantom to give him a hug. \"Good to see you to you sorry sack of flesh\" replied Phantom sarcastically as the two hugged and began <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreminiscing. 'Sheesh, and he's worried about ME embarrassing HIM' thought Phanty to herself. \"My Phantasma, how you've grown\" said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracula breaking her train of thought. \"You're growing into such a beautiful young woman\". \"Thank you sir\" she replied politely. \"Sibella is in her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nroom and Alucard is out by the garden if you wish to see them\" Dracula continued. \"Oh that would be great sir, thank you\" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, Egor\"! He shouted, calling upon another one of his servants. A deformed looking man made his way over to them. \"Yes sire\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nreplied the man with a bow. \"Escort Ms. Phantasma anywhere she wishes to go so Phantom and I can discuss business\" said Dracula. \"As <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou wish sire\" replied Egor with another bow. \"Where   would you like to go Ms. Phantasma\"?</span></div></div>",
