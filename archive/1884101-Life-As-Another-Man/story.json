Soon the chef came out and started to cook our dinner as he did like last time we watched the amazing tricks that danced around our eyes. \"Ohhh Ahhh\" we all said as the flames burst around the food. He started dishing out the food one by one and the aromas of the different meats began to make my mouth water. I looked at the delicious Steak on plate i wanted to grab the entire thing and engulfed in my Greg mouth it was kind of weird that my mind started to show me how Greg eats\u2019 it showed me he eats\u2019 in big bites and uses only little manners when eating, I tried copying how Greg ate from the images in my head as everyone else eat their food it was Delicious everyone loved what they ordered after we finished our plates the bill came out as 75 dollars it was a bit cheaper than last time Greg wife took out her wallet and fished out her credit card and then we left.<br>\r\nWe arrived back at home around 10ish after dinner and we all sat in the living room talking about ho great that restaurant \u2018\u2019So dad how you like that Steak\u2019\u2019 Kelly said as she stared at me \u2018\u2019Ohh it was cool it wasn\u2019t bad\u2019\u2019 i said as I shrugged  \u2018\u2019Well anyways Greg honey I think you should go up stairs and take a shower and go to bed the Thomas called 2 days ago saying that they need you to go to work soon \u2018Greg wife said  as she looked at me \u2018\u2019Wait they want me to go to work so soon I just got out of the hospital though \u2018I said i couldn\u2019t believe it I\u2019m still recovering and they want me to go to work it\u2019s hard enough to be a good Greg at his home but at work will be even harder to act as a good cop \u2018\u2019I really don\u2019t like it either i told them you should recovering a bit more but they said they need you cause there having problems with some cops at different placements and some cops are complaining they were doing  triple the work they were doing before\u2019\u2019 Kris sighed \u2018\u2019I wanted daddy to stay home for a while so he can play with me\u2019\u2019 Kris said \u2018\u2019Hey don\u2019t let it bum you down sport will have plenty of time when i come home besides you have school tomorrow anyways\u2019\u2019 I said Greg wife came up to me and gave me a kiss on the check \u2018\u2019I\u2019ll meet you upstairs .<br>\r\nI walked up to the master bed washroom to see Greg face in the mirror \u2018\u2019When will this nightmare end\u2019\u2019  I said i looked in the drawer for some pyjamas  i couldn\u2019t find a clean shirt or any some pyjamas and then remembered all of the undershirts or pyjama shirts where used when i was in the hospital \u2018\u2019 ohh well\u2019\u2019 i locked the bathroom door and got undressed feeling weird to see i different person naked body i headed into the shower feeling instantly relieved. The steam of the water relaxed me as I washed myself and I let out a sigh from being so stressed about the powers given to me.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I opened the door back to master bedroom and i quickly opened the drawers to look again for something to wear ''No sweatpants i know there no pyjamas  ''  as i rushed to look inside'' I can't find anything to wear '' Suddenly The door opened and Greg wife came in looking at your naked body she then opened the underwear drawer and took out what seemed like a Speedo and left for the shower room ,I felt violated that she was looking at you naked but she probably looked at Greg body Naked before I quickly put on the Speedo and then and looked in the mirror it actually wasn't bad it had room for Greg junk or my new junk it wasn't to tight and even though it's for guy's with worked out muscles it didn't look half bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to the bed and just dropped on from exhaustion  i heard the shower go knowing Greg wife was in  the shower ,I looked in the bedside table for something ''Come on where is it'' finally I got it I found Greg cell phone , it wasn't a cheap call phone it was a I phone 4s and it was just right i quickly dialed Shannon number and waited for a response ''H..ello Shannon speaking'' Shannon sounded tired but it was only 11:00 pm she couldn't be that tired ''Shannon it's me Mark'' i hoped that she remembered Greg deep voice ''Ohh mark'' she yawned for a second ''Sorry about that anyways how are you i heard you got out of the hospital today but still stuck  in Greg body are you Mark'' Shannon said ''I know im still in Greg body now i have to go to work tomorrow as Greg but that isn't the least of worry's ''I blurted out into the Iphone ''What do you mean Mark how can there be anything worse then being In Greg body ''shannon said quickly ''I don't know but i think his wife want's to have sex with me tonight'' i could hear Shannon being quiet for a few seconds ''Mark i don't know what to say but have you had sex before''i quickly think ''I did kiss Rebecca Johnston on a couple of times but i didn't have full on sex before'' i could hear shannon thinking ''So you have no sex experience but Greg has experience it   Mark maybe you could look into Greg mind to find how he handles his sex it's kinda weird but it's worth a shot '' it was tue i could look into his mind ''Okay Shannon i'll try and do that I'll see if i can visit you tomorrow if i can talk to you soon shanshan'' i heard here laugh ''Okay bye mark good luck''.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was really hoping she wasn't thinking what i was thinking.But I had to concentrate if i have Greg body I should be able to do it ,I heard the shower turn off ''Ohh gosh what to do''I said to myself ,I pulled the covers over my head hoping I could hide from her but i knew I had to eventually do it .The door opened and there walked Greg wife in a bathrobe with a towel covering her hair ,I could feel Greg wife attractiveness showering over me but I knew it was Greg body ,I tried to resist Greg temptations but i still couldn't resist his penis already went into erect and the speedo made it worse .She dressed in pajama bottoms and  tank top  and then climbed into the bed with me ''So honey  why do you look so tense and nervous???''Greg wife said she was on to me I had to make a lie ''Ohh nothing just thinking about work that's all''I yawn i was still very uncomfortable with Greg wife there  sleeping with Greg's wife ,She then turns off the lights and lay's down on the pillow and starts to cuddle with me then says ''I love you honey im so glad your okay'' It couldn't get any weirder but at least she was showing she cares I thought on what would Greg on in this situation then said ''I love you to honey can i have a good night kiss '' she then plant's her lips on mine like we did a 2 weeks ago and she keeps it there before rolling back and started to fall asleep and then in a sweet soft voice she says ''Good night Hun'' so i reply ''Good night' . I close my eyes thinking why Greg loved her so much but I only  understand a little but it started to come clear to me that Greg and his wife are both happy and married for 14 years so at least and Greg loved every single day but now I had to carry that burden and keep there Marriage together at least until i know how to deposses him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head started to hurt as I tossed and turned in the bed ,The cause of it was my Dream  that was a very happy memory but then turned into a nightmare at first I was happily dreaming of me in my original body having fun with Shannon as kids playing in the park it was when we first met but then in a instant i changed back into Greg and I was in a white place and someone stood in front of me but i couldn't tell who but then i came to realize it was my own self my original body that stood in front of me ,It came closer to me and then punch me in the gut and then said ''I've been watching you Mark and one day very soon i will have my old life back'' and then the rest was blank. RINNNGGGGG. The alarm clock goes off as suddenly my eyes open on its own as I let out a moan and turned it off ,I thought to myself that Dream was so bizarre especially what my original body said  I thought on what he meant  ''I've been watching you Mark and one day very soon i will have my old life back'' It could've been Greg taking form in my body just to say that ,I remove the thought of it from my mind I knew i was in full control of Greg and I was trying my best to deposses him I knew he would understand . I slipped out of bed walking towards the bathroom urning on the switch as the light burned my eyes while I squinted into the mirror. Greg's reflection squints back at me as I suddenly find my self needing to use the toiler real badly. I looked downwards thinking i'd have to look at it eventually and it wasen't that bad it was bigger then mine in my body I walked to the sink and splashed myself with cold water and then  I brush my teeth I then  head back into the bedroom, and Greg's wife is yawning and getting out of bed as well. \"Good morning\" I say cheerfully as I begin to take out the needed clothes Greg wears for work. \"Good morning to you too\" she says getting out bed and gives me a kiss on the cheek before  walking into  the bathroom shutting the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look through the Drawers finding only some black socks but No uniform ,I walk to the bathroom door and open a it a little bit and say ''honey where's my uniform '' she open's the door fully and says ''Greg All of the laundry is downstairs in the basement your uniform is probably there '' i walk back and turn and thank her before descending down the stairs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I descend the stairs shivering from how cold it was until I realized I was still only wearing the speedo ''Brrr-rrrr why didn't I put on a bathrobe or something'', The basement wasen't bad it was fully fixed with dry wall and floor everything ,It had a wooden gas fireplace sitting in a wall in front of you then just to the right was a flat screen TV with a surround sound and everything ,you guessed that Greg probably watched the sports network If he did on that TV .You walked to the laundry room that was connected beside it and there sat laundry basket full of clothes including a Fresh pair of  stripped boxers and a police uniform ''Aha ''I exclaimed,I first take off the speedo leaving myself fully naked and very cold then Put the stripped boxers in it's place I grab his undershirt and placed it on I put on the police shirt and pants while looking in tho the mirror. ''Looking sharp Greg im actually starting to like being in your body''after putting the uniform on. I begin to buckle his shirt and tuck it in and I look back into the mirror and I smile 'Im starting to be more like Greg everyday''I slip on some dress socks and then walk up stairs to a table with a mirror in near the front door and here was Greg police badge and ID walk over and button his police badge and ID and pin it to the clean pair that I am wearing. I grab his hat and place it on top of my head and I look back into the smile in the mirror .<br>\r\nSuddenly Greg wife came downstairs wearing a skirt and a cardigan covering a white button up shirt I realized she had to go to work as well ''So my handsome police officer found his uniform that's good'' she say's giving me a kiss ''Greg honey today im going to be late a bit when I come home the office called a few minutes ago and said if I can stay unitl 7:00 pm so you will have to amke dinner okay'' i didn't know how to cook and it seemed that Greg doesn't have experience either I take a gulp ''Yes honey''  she kisses me again '' Good bye Honey i love you'' she say's I slip on Greg's black dress shoes and wave at her and then I head out feeling a cool breeze of a summer morning. I unlock Greg's car and I drive out of the drive way and I sigh driving back to the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI Enter the bustling office as people are just coming in from home while some are leaving after their night shifts. My stomach started to grumble ''Well a little snack should do the trick'' I walk to the break room as I casually walked in to find a egg mick muffin  laying on the table.I couldn't resist the temptation I grabbed one and then on my way out I grab 2 apples this time,I walk into Greg's office and  I ate the apples first followed by the Egg mick muffin I here a knock on the door and see Thomas peering into my office.\"Hello Thomas\" and he asks \"Mind if I come in\" and I reply \", sure\" as I let him walk in shutting the door behind him.''Im happy your recovering well I didn't think you actually come this early he says''Well My wife said that you called and needed me to come back so I just came '' Thomas nodded and sat down ''Yes I did call because we have more info on the box case '' I reply ''I'm listening'' I wondered what he found out did Shannon tell anything or did that guy Joe know something ''Well the FBi has just recently found the body of Mark Lore washed up and he's still alive he spoke a bit to the docters'' I was confused when I became a ghost I completely saw my clothes and backpack on the ground I started to wonder if this had anything to do with Greg'' So where is the boy Thomas'' I say ''He is know recovering at the closest hospital at that place St.Mary hospital his parents are already been contacted and I want you to get over there and get as much info as possible ''  This couldn't be happening this day was getting weirder and weirder i reply ''ok-a-y''in a nervous voice ,I walk to my police car and start it up  and I grab his cell phone and dial Shannon number and wait until she picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hello Shannon speaking''she said ''Shannon it's me Mark still in Greg but never mind that we have a crisis''I say''Mark what is it'' i reply ''The Fbi found my real body but I don't know how because when i became a ghost my body dissapered and my body spoke ''she was silent for a moment ''Mark how is that possible besides you took control of Greg  so nothing else should be inside that body'' it was true but maybe this had something to do with Greg and that dream ''Shannon i think it's Greg that's in my body'' she fell silent again ''Mark that's impossible '' i replied ''Shannon it's not impossible I think it's connected some how to why I can't leave his body and why I had a dream about myself last night''  she sounded confused ''What dream?'' I explined about the dream last night on how my original body came up to me and called me by my real name even though I was in Greg ''I've been watching you Mark and one day very soon i will have my old life back ''Shannon recalled ''Maybe your right Mark maybe it is Greg''I reply ''It could be''she ask''Where are they keeping him right now'' I reply ''Stmary hospital ''she quickly replays ''Let's go then ''.</span></div></div>",

While driving to Shannons I stop at a stop light noticing 2 cars zooming past a Red light almost making a multiple car collision I finally notice they where having  a race i turn on the siren and drive after them Zooming by other cars, the speeding cars still won't care and even went faster ,I had to call some back up I grabbed the radio walkies talkie ''We have a race on Vinevalley street near the highway iI need back up please''I say ,I put the radio walkie takie down and focus trying to catch them until i hear it says ''Copy that Greg''says a voice,After a few minutes trying to catch them I see 2 cop cars blocking there way So i speed a bit more and slow down before they finally reach to a stop .I rest my head on the steering wheel ''being a cop is harder then i thought ''I say ,I get out of the car and and the other cops Call me ''Hey Greg nice chase out there ''said  one of them  ''Yea Greg your getting better everyday my friend''The other cop says ,I reply ''Im just trying to do my job guys''.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 2 walk over to one car and i walk over to the other ,it was a normal car it was a 2006 corolla with rusted sidings ,I knock on the window and the person who was driving rolled down the window  ''He--llo officer'' the driver says timidly ,I  looked down at the driver he was just a teen probably  a bit older then I was  I sigh and say \"You know what you did wrong correct?'' he nodded's and says in a very weak sad voice ''I broke the law by speeding and racing '' I look down at him and he reaches his files so I can look him up ,''Listin'' I looked down at his Papers and see his name is Chris ''Listen Chris you could have killed alot of people but since Im in a rush you won't go to jail or receive a tickit but you will lose 10 of your demerit points''He rises his head up and ''T--han--k y-ou officer thats completely fair this will never happen again'' I smile and give him back his files ''You can go''<br>\r\n I walk back in the police car watching him pull off slowly driving down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knock on Shannon's door and she comes out wearing a leather jacket with jeans and some sneakers ''Hey Mark''she shuts the door behind us.''So ready to go''she says and i smile ''Yup after you'' ,We walk over to the police car and get inside and we start to drive off ''So Mark what are you going to do when you see the supposedly real Greg''.''Well im not  really sure I guess I gotta tell him the truth and hope for the best''I continue driving as i enter the highway that leads to the hospital and she says''I guess that's the best approach like we can't just tell him anything he might tell the truth and you might go into real jail or scientist might start studying you or something'' and I sigh \", I know\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrive at the hospital and i park at the front before Me and Shannon walk to the front desk of the building ''Can I help you Officer''says a lady behind the desk  ''Im looking for the room of Mark Lore''I say ,she looks through her computer then through a stack of papers ''Aha here it is Mark Lore 3rd floor Pediatric intensive care unit room 105 '' She smiles and i thank her before walking to Shannon and we rid the elevator to the 3rd floor .We opened the door to room 105 and it was a one bedroom with the curtains a bit closed with wilting flowers on the desk and on to of the chairs sat my parents it seemed that they took a break from drugs ,They looked sad and depressed especially my Mother who was crying and then in the bed was Me with bandages over my fore head with my eyes open ''Excuse me Mr and Mrs lore im Officer Greg smith'' I say ,my Mother looks at me and Shannon ''Ohh Hello officer ohh and Shannon did you come to visit Mark'' Shannon smiles ''Ya Officer Smith here needed to talk to Mark anyways so he gave me a lift'' My dad turns around he looked very tired with gray bags under his eyes ''Officer do you want me and my wife to leave for a

my assitents I have no choice but to help out .Besides  i don't want greg and his family to find out that I lost his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got out of the car I heard something in the distance ,it was faint but it was coming fast ,I ignored it and walk over to the peak of the cliff ,I overlooked the view towards me ,endless miles after miles of the untapped wilderness faraway from the usual buildings that replaces the wilderness I remember thinking about before  it happened ,I remembered Shannon smile  and the sun beating on our skin ,I suddenly remembered something about the box ,I remember it falling out of the sky from an airplane and then crashing somewhere ,I looked over the cliff and searched for airplane I tried my best  to look for the landing site  .As I turned to the let I saw some fallen trees ''i bet anything that's where it landed''I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly behind me I could hear the faint sound from before growing louder and LOUDER !! ,I could start to picture what that sound was ,it sounded like a motorcycle .I walked over to the road where I parked the car ,And I was right I could see a motorcycle coming from a distance ''Is that Steven ''I thought .The motorcycle rushed through then as it grew closer to me the motorist pressed on the brake pedal and the motorcycle screeched    ,I covered my ears trying to block the sound off rubber on asphalt.When it came to a complete stop I looked at the cyclist and saw a person with a officer uniform ,and helmet on his head .He took off the helmet and then put the bike on park ,I got a good picture of his face ,he had spikey blond hair that spiked at his bangs and green eyes and remembering from Greg information he did look like a 40 year old ''Hey Greg sorry for being late,Stupid driver I pulled over wouldn't show me there Driver license ,turns out they weren't even from this country''Steven laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No worry's I caught a few people myself''I replied ,we fist pounded then he walked with me to the cliff ''So Greg what's this investigation about anyways''Steven said we got to the cliff and I pointed at the landing site ''You see recently We arrested a man by the name off Joe ,he pushed off a boy named Mark Lore and he presumably murdered until recently a hiker found him clinging to life near the river here , Now Shannon, Mark friend has told us she saw a plane crash nearby ,but apparently there was no record of planes crashing except until now that I've spotted the landing site over there''I replied ,It felt weird talking about my own case like that .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Steven as he nooded ''I see ,but shouldn't this investigation be for those guys who Check on plane crashes''He replied ,I shrugged ''I don't know probably but the police are inlisted for this case maybe because they think the information is fake''I said ,He nodded again ''I see ,Greg you seem different today ''He said .I almost gasped ,I couldn't believe he could figure out that I wasn't the real Greg ,I had to say something ''Well I....I just got out of the Hospital only a 2 days ago ...Sooooo ..Im just a bit tired and just trying to get use to work again ''I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nudge me ''Ha hah nice excuse ''Steven said ''Anyways let's get down there already'',I nodded and we He followed me down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------<br>\r\n<i><b>The path</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked down ,we started to talk about our life and what's been going on .Of course I said I was in the hospital ,I really didn't have anything interesting to say ,and I didn't feel comfortable talking about how me and Lucy had Sex last night.''So Greg man can I tell you something?''Steven asked ,''Sure ?''I replied ,''Well me and Nicole are kinda having a baby''Steven said .I stopped and started clap ''Way to go man''I said ,I started to pat him on the back ,I suddenly realized that I never do that to people .''Thanks Greg ,the reason I told you this is that me and Nicole decided we want you and Lucy to be the child God parents''Steven replied .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Me a god parent''I said ,''Well yea besides it's only natural that since your my best friend and you have kid's of your own that you would be this child's god parent''He said .<br>\r\nWe started to notice the trees around us where kinda burnt ''Where close ,I think?''Steven said ,I looked around and saw something in the distance ,something that stood out from the others ''Yea we are ''I said ''Look over there''I pointed .''holy that's big ,let's go see it''Steven said .He ran towards it jumping over fallen trees and rocks in his way ,I ran after him hoping to catch him.Normally in my body I'd be able to catch him no problem ,but in Greg It felt hard just to run ,I tried to pace myself so I wouldn't run out of breath but I quickly did So I stopped immediately to gasp for air ''Hey Steven wait up man''I said ''Come on Greg don't be a push over just run''He said .Steven was right even as Greg I shouldn't give up ,besides this would help greg to become more in shape ,that he probably love to be in once we switch back .I started to run again and eventually I caught up with Steven ''That's the way ,anyways where already here''He said ,We both stopped and saw the plane on the ground ,It was white and had a red stipe covering it's windows ''Check for body's I said ,We split up ,Steven checked outside I checked inside .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>The plane</i> </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took out my gun just in case ,I felt nervous ,this was really my first case in Greg body,I kicked the door to the plane and pointed my gun ,I looked inside from my view ,everything seemed perfectly fine.I continued inside and went into the passenger seat to find them all empty  ''this really weird ?''I said ,''Maybe it was one of those delivery planes''I <br>\r\nI walked into the cabin to find no captain or any body's anywhere,but there was a huge crack in the window ,I quickly took out  out me walie talkie and held the button ''Officer Steven tacks do you read me ,check in the north side in front of the plane for the body of the captain'' buzzz .....buzzzzz ....buzzz ''Roger'' .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked in the files of the plane and folded them and stuff them into my pockets ,I then walked out of the plane and checked the outisde myself.To my surprise the wings and the rudder seemed okay but the plane carried giant scorch marks it's body ,I took out my phone and took a picture of the plane.Suddenly my walkie talkie started to buzzz ,buzzzzz......buzzzzz .I picked it up ''Reading''I said ,it started to buzz again , buzzzz.........buzzzzzz ''Greg get the hell out of there and run to the northside and hurry!!!!'' ,I immediately reacted and ran as Quickly as I could to the north ,I ran and ran not stopping ''I hope Steven is playing a joke''I thought ,Suddenly I saw Steven in the distance on his knees ''Steven what's the problem''I yelled ,''GET DOWN''he yelled ,I fell to the ground behind a rock and as I did I heard an explosion ,I looked up a bit and saw a gigantic blaze upon the forest  in the direction of the plane ''Holy Crap!!'I yelled .I turned to Steven and noticed him carrying a man on his shoulders ''Get back to the cars!!''He said ,I ran towards him and brought one arm of the man on my shoulder and we carried him to the car as we walked the fire grew closer to us and I wasn't careful one of the ashs touched my arm and burnt it a bit ,IO tried to clutch my arm but we where carrying the man''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<i><b>Back at the cliff </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got back to the cliff and eventually the car and motorcycle we placed the man inside the car ''Greg you need to get im to the Hosptial ,I'll stay and explain the situation to the firefighters and paramedic and the other officer when they arrive ,If they ask anything on this investigation tell them I'll explain''He said .I noded and we fist pounded then I got into the car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The hospital</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drove as fast as I could especially with my experience ,I turned on the siren and everything just trying to get this man to the Hospital ''You okay man''I said ,'<sub>'I'm starving that's all please help me'</sub>'He whispered ''Yea your going to be okay just hold on''I said .<br>\r\nWe finally arrived at the hospital ,I drove into th emergency area and stopped th car immediately,As I quickly got out of the car ,a nurse rushed over to me ''Officer what is the meaning of this ''She said ,''Im sorry mam but this man is terribly injured ,I had no time to call the ambulance and he needs attention immediately''I opened the door and showed her the man ,I immediately got him by the arm adn carried him to a wheel chair which she pushed inside ''Thank you officer ,will take it from here''She said .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cold water pours onto my stolen skin. The cold fades away as warm water replaces it. I feel myself begin to relax. The muscles in My arms, legs and abdomen begin to release.I grab some body wash, and begin to clean off the filth from my body. As I spread the lather, I took sometime to check out how much Greg body has changed.My hands work their way down towards the crotch.It's changed for with the rest of the body,It was much bigger .Again that feeling begins to creep up on you, only worse now that its accompanied by morning wood. Standing in the shower, you begin to pump your cock again. Faster, and quicker this time, the soap and water providing a lubricant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rubbing my crotch for a bit I stop before reaching my climax and I turn off the water and I start to dry myself.Lucy then comes in \"Lucy!!\"I said,even after weeks of being naked with the woman It felt weird just seeing her look at me naked.\"Sorry hun\"She says giving me a kiss.She looks at my body \"Greg I think I like the man I see right now,for some reason before the accident you've changed drastically,whether you hit your head or something I like you like this\"she then takes the towel off my waist which I tried to cover and smiles before walking out.Lucy just confessed that she like me better,She liked me as Greg and not the real Greg,how was I going to say this to Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk out of the bathroom naked since my towel was gone,I notice a new outfit was on the bed,It was a blue polo with a black leather,a pair of jeans that would look great on a young person,some boxers and white socks and some running shoes .\"I guess Lucy bought this for me\"I said,I slip the boxers on first followed by the jeans.The boxer fit great and seemed to have contained my new package just nicely.Next I pulled the polo over on and then I buttoned up the jeans pulling a belt on aswell,I slip on the socks and pulled the runners on.With the new clothes on I felt like a new person again,I pull over the <br>\r\nWith the children at Steven\u2019s and all the luggage packed into the car,I drove towards the Airport.There we boarded the plane which would take us to Paris,Our seat was right beside the window and was in the very back.As the plane ascended I used the complementary headphones and started to listen to music as we travelled to paris.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Honestly, it's been a while since I have made something, especially for my own wife. Usually I would impress my own wife by making regular food on occasion, but I don't know much about Greg's wife or family. Maybe I can buy some random restaurant food for them and hope the kids or Greg's wife doesn't bother me. It would be a pain to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dad, can you make us something? I'm really hungry.\" Kris says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm starving.\" Kelly tells me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all are looking up to me as though I am some kind of magic man. I'm really not, and if I were, that would be a joke in itself. Seeing Kelly and Kris around, I realize that I shouldn't spook them over the fact that I am not their father. After all, I can't just go and say 'look kids, I am not your dad, so leave me alone and I'll buy you ice cream.' I'm not that cruel. Even though I can't just tell them who I am, that doesn't mean I am free from responsibility over what I do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, okay, I can make toast when we get home for dinner.\" I say to them. \"Breakfast is good after all, and it's the most important meal of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to not like my answer, even when I am telling her the truth. Her face shows how confused she is as she says. \"Are you...wait what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, I can at least make some toast.\" I tell her. \"It's heathy stuff you know, you know? That's, uh, why its a special on, uh, bars and restaurants, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her expression, Greg's wife did not seem to like my answer. Especially after hearing that it was healthy and all. Even glancing at the kids, they seem to not take kindly to my actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's wife tilts her head at me and gives a strange expression. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
