He had snuck some cheese before leaving home this morning and it was kicking in his lactose intolerance. He kept playing in the sand, but the bubbles only increases. Soon a pressure was at his but and he couldn\u2019t hold it any more. </span></div></div>",

It made no sound, but the resulting smell was horrible. Max didn\u2019t mind the smell, but as the wind blew, the smell soon covered the whole play ground. The other kids and the caretakers looked sick. So he wouldn\u2019t be immediately noticed as the one who did it he covered his nose and acted like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome did look his way, as if they knew, but others fell for it. Once the air cleared the caretakers had a diaper check to see who had done it. Max was next when the pup in front of him was found with a dirty pull-up.
