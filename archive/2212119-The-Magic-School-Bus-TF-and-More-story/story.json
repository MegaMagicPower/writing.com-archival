She was by herself for the time being as her mother had taken her little brother William to the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda had stayed behind and was allowed to have one of her friends over for the afternoon. She'd invited Phoebe Terese over and was waiting for Phoebe to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Surrender or I'll destroy your castle'!\" She was saying in a rather good deep voice as she held the villain action figure up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'No, we'll never surrender, ya weasley wimp'!\" Wanda shouted in her normal voice, holding up a heroine action figure. \"'Fine. Firing squad, prepare to'...\" Wanda was saying in that same deep voice when, something surprising happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hiccup!* Wanda let out a big hiccup. \"'Firing squad, prepare to fi...'\" she tried again. *Hic!* Another hiccup stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Fi-' *Hiccup!*\" Wanda began, only for a third hiccup to escape. \"Wow. I've got *hic* hiccups.\" she remarked as a fourth hiccup came out. Then, before she knew what was happening, she started to hiccup like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hiccup* Hiccup* *Hic* *Hic* *Hiccup* *Hic* *Hiccup* *Hic* *Hic* *Hic* *Hiccup* *Hiccup* *Hiccup* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh *hic* man.

Then, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hiccup!* She let out a giant hiccup. \"Nope.

Then, it darkened to blue and finally to deep, deep purple. As she neared 78, Phoebe noticed Wanda's pained expression and purple face and finished quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"99... 100!\" She called quickly.

Confused, Wanda watched as Phoebe picked up the garden hose and brought it over to Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been told by DA that drinking tons of water might help with hiccups.\" Phoebe explained. Well, by now, Wanda was willing to try anything. \"Okay. *hic* but try and *hiccup* take it *hic* *hiccup* easy.\" she agreed, taking the hose and holding it to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Phoebe turned the faucet and water began coming out into Wanda's mouth. *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* Wanda began chugging loudly. Soon, her belly started pushing out as it filled with the cold water from the hose. Slowly, it started bulging over the waistband of Wanda's pants and becoming heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Phoebe quickly turned the water off and moved up to the bloated and waterlogged Wanda. \"It worked, Pheebs! It really worked! My hiccups're gone!\" Wanda cheered, her belly sloshing as she jiggled it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd I tell you?\" Phoebe smiled. \"You might be a genius, Phoebe! A real-\" Wanda started to say when. *HICCUP!* She let out one of her biggest hiccups yet. This caused her belly to slosh violently. Once it settled, it let out an ominous rumble and gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe not a genius.\" Phoebe confessed. After a moment, Wanda realized something. \"Wait... I'm not hiccupping now. My hiccups really are gone!\" Wanda realized in delight. Then, her tummy made that rumble/gurgle sound again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Wanda started waddling towards her house, making sloshing noises with each step. \"Now I've gotta go to the potty.\" she explained to Phoebe. It ultimately took Wanda two hours to pee herself back to her normal self. After that, she and Phoebe hung out and neither of them hiccupped once as they played in Wanda's bedroom until dinner.</span></div></div>",

With a quick jump, she managed to grab the edge and climb in. \"OOoommph!\" Wanda grunted as she landed on something soft and squishy in a wrapper.

In addition to the Mallowblaster, there was also a creampuff, a cupcake, two sandwiches, a bag of chips, a second Mallowblaster and a juice bottle. \"I'm sure Ralphie won't mind if I help myself.\" she smiled as she unwrapped the Mallowblaster after hopping off it. \"This is gonna be yummy!\" Wanda giggled as she started eating the large dessert rather loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finishes the Mallowblaster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't finish it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich will you pick?</span></div></div>",

Her stomach gurgled with pleasure as she then stood up, a hand on her tummy as it rumbled again. \"Having filled up on rations, explorer Wanda goes in search of a way to get back to normal.\" she beamed. Being small was pretty fun but now it really was time to get back to her normal height again before the others returned. Certain Ralphie wouldn't notice a tiny rip in his bag, she made one and wiggled out, barely avoiding making the rip bigger than needed. She ran back to the closet and found the Port-a-Shrinker from where she had dropped it while shrinking. \"Okay. Now to find the reverse button.\" She smiled as she started looking. Soon, she had found it and activated it, barely making it in front of the Port-a-Shrinker in time to be bathed in the blue light again. A second later, she was her normal size and height again. \"Man, that was awesome!\" she giggled as she quickly placed the device back where it belonged. Things went back to normal after that, though Wanda barely managed to keep from laughing when Ralphie freaked out over one of his beloved Mallowblasters being stolen. She didn't know why, but she felt she should keep her tiny adventure secret, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",
