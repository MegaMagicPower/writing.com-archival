Hatate knew she'll get her and was about to leave until the girl went back and something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Defence mechanism, activate.\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n From the ground, a huge snake sprung and blocked aya. She was trying her best to get her but the snake was blocking her. Hatate looked at the girl, and she was nodding and both of them left the area. At hatates house, once they got in and hatate sat down, she looked at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"who are you? why did you defend me?\" Hatate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..I just felt like it.\" Girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then...</span></div></div>",

If nothing happen in 48 hours, the great heart of gensokyo will stop beating.\" The person from afar replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chris and mystia didn't know what it ment and then turned to the one carrying the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What does he mean!?\" Chris shouted. \"And why did you and nanami told me I'm the destined one?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The one carrying the two were silent for moment and then sighed. It then summoned the crystal ball and told the two to look deep. As they did, the vision showed the blurry image of yakumo yukari and hakurei reimu themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The human and the youkai does not even recognize that they are the vital points of the gensokyo themselves.\" The person said, \"They are infected with terrible disease and virus that not even the smartest doctor can do anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mystian knew what the person ment and gotten frightened.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You mean..even dr.yagokoro can't do anything?\" mystia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The person nodded and the vision went away. The two then turned to the one carrying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The fate have foresaw, that one human from outside world will emerge as a savior of gensokyo.

The person sighed and layed back as the giant worm with one eye appared behind the person, it dripped its acid saliva. It burned part of the hood and revealed a face of the person. The person was a women with long blond hair, only the half of them were as the other were completly skinless and eyeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The fate shall lead us.\" Person spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When light faded away, they were standing on outside.

Besides, she had a much better AND more humane way of getting revenge.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, realizing he had still not been digested long after the earth stopped moving, breathed a sigh of relief. Unfortunately it was premature, cuz shortly after the sigh left his lips, the organic cavern around him began to rapidly flash multiple psychadelic colors. After flashing several colors, Chris found himself staring unblinkingly at a pair of bright glowing red eyes in the middle of the psychadelic flash<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself completely unable to look away from the eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cYou dont want to leave my stomach,\u201d Reisen's voice echoes throughout the chamber while Chris is lost in a trance.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 dont want to leave your stomach,\u201d Chris responds in his trance.<br>\r\n\u201cYou love it here inside me,\u201d Reisen continues.<br>\r\n\u201cI love it here inside you,\u201d Chris obediently repeats.<br>\r\n\u201cYoure happy to be eaten by me,\u201d her voice resonates from the chamber of her belly right into the deepest corner of Chris's mind.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm happy to be eaten by you, Reisen,\u201d and just like that, Chris just stopped being mad at that colossal bunny ear who swallowed him for the silliest of reasons! By the time the eyes and the psychadelicness vanished, he had a whole new perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didnt hate being stuck inside this vast ghastly organic chamber! He loved being all nice and snug inside this beautiful wet squishy minimally lit up cavern of mysteries that was Reisen's tummy! It was warm, cozy, roomy, offered free food that dropped from the ceiling, extremely unlikely to experience a break-in robbery, and best of all, it was located deep within the confines of such a lovely colossal bunny girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, bunny GODDESS was more like it! It was truly a tremendous honor to be gulped down by a gorgeous bunny-eared deity like her. He was very lucky too. Rabbits are primarily vegetarians, so it's quite a rare feat that she'd devour a living creature, let alone without chewing him up or digesting him. How he managed to be shrunken down at the right place at the right time when Reisen decided she wanted a tiny person in her belly was a miracle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris became SO grateful of his fate, he literally fell to the floor and kissed the wet slimy ground he was walking on! He relished the taste of the stomach juice as he kissed the floor of his newbound Heaven over and over.<br>\r\nFinally hearing and feeling the inhabitant in her belly calm down, Reisen smiled with glee. Score one for the 'lunatic'. Hopefully, being an obedient worshiper of this lunatic will teach him some manners. She probably shouldnt use hypnosis on him too much, though. Eirin wont forgive her if she ended up giving her tiny patient permanent brain damage. Nah, just a little brain-washed worship should be enough for him. Hopefully, she'll be feeling him dancing in joy inside her really soon. In the meantime, there's a medicine closet that needs resorting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the bunny girl, Chris seemed to having the time of his life worshiping every inch of the vast dark chamber he was trapped in. He'd erect a statue of the bunny girl in honor of his host but he was kinda lacking supplies. He hoped she wouldnt be offended by that show of inconsideration.<br>\r\nAs he mused on the proper way to pay his bunny-giantess mistress tribute, he spouted what looked to be a small tight opening on the wall which would no doubt lead to the next chamber of Reisen's digestive system. The thought of exploring more of the deep mysterious reaches within the bunny giantess thrilled him with excitement. Considering the average length of the small intestine, he'd have plenty of mysterious reaches to explore and worship!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the opening, ready to journey further... until something held him back. Reisen only mentioned that she wanted him in her stomach. She never mentioned any other part of her. What if she finds out he went where he wasnt supposed to and she gets mad? She might never let him inside her again!<br>\r\n...Uh... and something about threatening his very life if he wasnt careful, but that just wasnt processing very well in Chris's head. Eh, it probably wasnt important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he press his luck and venture through that opening? Or should he play it safe and not risk his colossal captor's wrath again?</span></div></div>",

I found the way to revert his shrunkness but it will take couple of months to make it.\u201d Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was little blessing to Reisen as she could keep Chris inside her stomach until its finished. She told her the situation, and with hesitation eirin agreed to let Chris live inside reisens belly, and left to start making the antidotes. Back inside, chris was laying on the stomach floor then it gurgled little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey Chris, master told me it will take while to make a antidote, so your now a resident of my stomach!\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m..glad to hear that!\u201d Chris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect you from dangers, and I\u2019ll give you food and water through my esophagus.\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thanked her and your life inside her stomach begun..</span></div></div>",
