The reporter's finishing sentence was cut off as half the ceiling had collapsed luckily most of the news crew got out in time as a massive tremor could be heard echoing throughout the city you felt the whole house shake pictures fell off the walls,electric appliances exploded sending sparks everywhere and you struggled to maintain your balance as the floor beneath you cracked and just outside you could make out the terrified screams of your remaining neighbors as they panicked even more as the sky outside turned from blue,cloudless and sunny to pitch black as if the mother of all twisters were about to ravage through your town \"It's not longer safe in here I gotta to get out of the house before it collapses on me!\" You thought as quickly you manage to grab a few belongings and treasured items before bolting out the front door you witness your whole house collapsing in a heap of rubble \"Damn that's bad luck mom and dad will have a cow when they get home,good thing we have paid all the insurance on this house.\" But this was no time for humor as all around you things like cars,mailboxes and other people's homes were shaking,falling over or plain just exploding on the spot then the soft tremors became louder and louder as someone in the now thick crowd screamed \"Oh my God look there it is! The monster!\" You began pushing and shoving your way through the crowd as it was hard as hell to see anything(you were short what could you do?) then as you got to the front you saw a enormous pair of shoes but they weren't just any shoes they looked like they belonged to someone special a movie actor as they were sparkling bright and had to be the size of a full sized SUV itself! Then you kept on looking up and up and up to see something big,bright and red filled the whole street it had to be a dress of some kind so obliviously this monster whatever it was had to be female the footsteps and tremors stopped suddenly just before the crowd of people screaming,whispering and panicking then the titanic figure slowly bent over and people screamed like crazy several backed away as what stared back at them was some kind of circus clown,a girl about your age wearing the oddest outfit with a face of a angel she had a pale white face filled with what appeared to be the oddest amount of makeup,dark pretty brown eyes,short brown hair underneath a odd type of headdress those in the 15th century would wear but you couldn't think of any person or royalty from history who would dress like this but the more you stared at this monstrous girl,the more you felt like you knew her from somewhere \"She really looks familiar where have I seen her before?\" Thinking back to all the movies over the years you seen one stuck out Star Wars not the old original trilogy but the recent one that hit theaters earlier this summer(it was the year 1999) then it slowly dawned on you \"Wait a second this is...nah it can't be...there's no way but somehow it is....Queen Amidala from the Phantom Menace here on Earth as a Godzilla like giantess?\" It had to be a prank,a joke of some kind maybe some guys from Hollywood decided to get creative a create a lifelike mechanic prop of their favorite movie characters rampaging as Godzilla but deep down something told you this was the actual,real thing; this was a 70 foot Queen Amidala of Naboo in the flesh as she bent down further you were unsure whether she could even see any of you the crowd behind you panicked and ran for it screaming like crazy while you realized you were all alone with the giantess alien queen </span></div></div>",

Never heard of that planet before can you tell me about it?\" As she spoke a few people noticed finally she was beginning to move but then they realized she was about to sit down! And right beneath where she was about to sit was City Hall where the mayor and several government officials were panicking at the mere sight of her squatting down slowly \"Mayor what do we do? That alien girl,whatever she is is about to sit on us,somebody do something!\" A nearby police officer muttered \"I already informed the military mayor they're on their way now! Let's just hope they get here in.....Ahhhhhhhhh! Here she comes RUN FOR IT!\" As all in the main office bolted out the door and barely made it outside just as Ka-Pow! Amidala sat down directly and unknowingly on the whole building whatever remained of it was crushed under likes of her enormous red dress and massive behind leaving nothing intact or recognizable she breathed a sigh of relief as she sat down \"Ahhh what a relief my feet were killing me standing on them for too long....why are you all complaining and screaming like that for?\" She asked the people in her hand and on the ground,the mayor and his officials among them in shock several screamed \"Because you just sat on our government building,look beneath you!\" Curiously she did and gasped when she saw the amount of damage her assets had done to their once fair City Hall quickly she stood up and people dive for cover as piles of rocks and marble came crashing down all around them \"Oh my! I'm truly sorry about that! I didn't mean to do it!\" She whispered her free hand over her mouth she truly looked mournful and nearly tearful it was hard to tell though but before anyone could do anything the loud buzzing sounds of tanks and jets and helicopters filled the ground and air:the military had arrived to deal with this giant space Queen from another galaxy! </span></div></div>",

You and Amidala looked down to find two men in black suits and wearing sunglasses on their eyes. You soon found out that these men are agents from the CIA and are planning to put Amidala at a scientific facility to do some research on her. \"Who are you two?\" asked the giantess \"We're from the CIA and we're here to take you to a facility in order to do some research on your origins\" yelled one of the agnets. You look and see that they're accompanied by the military as backup for wether if the princess does something too destructive. \"Why? I said I'll never do anything to harm this planet\" said Amidala \"Of course not, since we don't know much about your exact origins, we now plan to try and study your species.\" said the agent as he soon ordered the military to surround you and Amidala to prevent any chance of escaping. \"I don't think that won't be necessary\" said Amidala \"I'll still might cause trouble for all of you if I got sent there and I won't be able to go home anymore\". \"So you refuse I believe \" replied the man \"In that case, we'll just have to capture you instead\". A whole swarm of helicopters appeared overhead and begin to fly towards the giantess as they pepared to shot a large net towards the giantess. \"Amidala I think they're planning to capture you with that large net.\" you yelled as they approach closer. \"Yes, but what shall I do? There's no way to get out of here\". she said as she look down and around the ground, trying to search for an escape route. You try to think of some ways to get you and Amidala out of here but sooner or later, you found a quick but risky looking way: between two large sets of buildings. You don't think that she's fit there, in fact she'll might end up getting stuck between them. You thought that maybe the best is walking through the military and escape as fast as you and Amidala can. You think harder and harder until finally came up with one solution and been to tell the giantess about this plan</span></div></div>",

That's what we been ordered to find yet from what I heard, the alien have quickly escaped somewhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy! I thought one was bad enough and now we have to deal with two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're still not sure if the new one's have some connection with the one we know, let's try to look over there and see if we can still find her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discovered who these people actually here, they are yet another members of the CIA still searching for Amidala but they did mentioned about another alien that have been discovered. You don't know who it is but you could guess it might been from the same planet as Amidala was. You begin thinking about wanting to do next.</span></div></div>",

Though her eyes contained curiosity, you couldn't see any destructive thought in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to look at you. I was looking for my husband, Harry, but I doubt I'll find that jerk anytime soon. In the meantime, I wanted to see a tiny human up close. I know that I'm also human, but my new size makes things interesting.\" She brought you closer to her eye.

She grinned and started to pet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not so bad yourself. Hm, I think I might replace Harry for you. You seem much nicer and more . . . Willing.\" You were a bit worried about what she meant. She looked for a clear spot in the grass and sat down. Nancy then smelled you, to her, you smelled like flowers. \"Yes, you seem perfect.

Though you were a little hesitant, you didn't want to upset her. You started by pulling garbage off. You were pulling rocks and paper and some things you weren't even sure what they were.

Once you saw no more trash, you knew what the next step was.You needed to wash her feet, but to do that, you would need to do something disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen, I want to finish cleaning your feet, however, I need to make contact with it using my mouth.

It didn't taste good at all, but you were pleased to get this close. If you had to be stuck here in this situation, you might as well make her happy. As you were doing this, tremors started to appear. Nancy was laughing a lot, she couldn't help it. All of the shaking made it hard to clean her foot, but you eventually got the job done.  You went to her other foot and started on that one. Nancy was in tears at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily cleaned her foot until she pushed you to the ground with it. She slowly caught her breath and picked you up with her newly cleaned foot, bringing you into the air.

Eventually, you decided you might as well, at least it wasn't hard to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to rub the smooth parts of her belly. She gave a slight chuckle, but it didn't seem to do much.

That's too bad, and I was so looking forward to giving it to you,\" she said in a fake disappointed tone. You didn't give up though. You started tickling the center of her bellybutton. You tickled as much as you could. Luckily, the center seemed to be the most sensitive spot. She started laughing quite a bit. Though she tried to contain her laughter, it was hard. \"Nope . . Not a . . .good. . . Jon hehe.\" She tried to say. You knew she was lying, but you knew you could get her to laugh hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept tickling as if your life depended on it. You tickled both the center and the walls of her bellybutton. Finally, Nancy couldn't take it anymore. She laughed as loud as she could. All of her laughing caused tremors, shaking the whole city. Cars moving, couldn't stay on a straight course and hit each other. Windows shattered to pieces. You had trouble sitting still as well. Nancy couldn't stop laughing, she remembered a moment like this that happened when she was a kid. Some boys tickled her making her laugh. She was humiliated in front of many students. However, now that she was older, it didn't humiliate her any more. When she calmed down, she grabbed you. You were really wondering what she was going to give you.

This is the program you spoke of?\" She gestured to the computer screen which as usual was showing numerous forms and formats of codes and computer glitches as was displayed on every computer connected to the Matrix he nodded \"Yes but as I said it could be incredibly dangerous none of us know how long this thing's been around the machine world obliviously doesn't know anything about it or otherwise they would have deleted it I wonder if the Arch...\" But Persephone wasn't paying attention to his words she was busy thinking if this particular and unknown program could indeed send one's essences back through time then there may be a chance to prevent the machines from taking over before any of these events occurred but more importantly to her there may be a chance for her to find actual true love again as she certainly wasn't going to find in this cold steel machine world so Persephone orders the man \"Quickly plug me into this program I want to see if it works for myself!\" The man was stunned as he screamed \"What? My lady didn't you just hear what I said it could be dangerous! We have no idea where this thing could lead to....you could never return...\" She gave a small smile \"That's the one thing I'm hoping for to happen!

You did this because neither of you had discussed the actual point of the expedition since she brought it to you, so wanted to ensure you hadn't mixed up any of the details, which given you were going to be documenting the discovery would be bad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Correct. The worshipers of Grima believed their goddess granted them incredible powers, most notably any who wielded her heard' the archaeologist notes, flicking her torch to a mural on the wall depicting the Goddess herself, an enormous woman with a full figure and a red gem resting in her large bosom. That was clearly the heart she was talking about, and if it was worn by normal humans it was clearly smaller than depicted, it better or the 2 of you weren't getting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If the writings are correct we should be coming to the central chamber pretty soon'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Which is where the heart should be' Lara finishes, turning a corner just as the cave opens into a huge arena sized chamber, with a raised platform in it's centre. Resting on what could best be described as a pedestal, was the blood red jewel, glistening in the light of your torches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The heart!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exactly where you'd expect it' Lara grins at you before running over to it, you following much more warily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sure it's safe to do that, the place could be booby-trapped' you ask to which she chuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This was a place of worship, they wouldn't risk harming a believer of angering their goddess. Everything her is perfectly safe' to prove her point she picks up the jewel and gently tosses it from hand to hand, then throwing it to you. Once your heart returns to a normal level you are enraptured by the glow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's magnificent' you whisper, to which Lara nods before reminding you they will need to snap some photos of the area so they can translate the scripts at your leisure rather than in a cave in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Later</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm, interesting' you muse, turning to see Lara modelling the amulet behind you 'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like my new look?' she grins, leaning forward to show of the red gem nestled in her bust just like the Goddess' mural 'So what did you find by the way?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and your brain needs a moment to turn on again 'Oh, there was some kind of prayer written around where the gem was rested' you answer, showing her your transcript, to which she hums and smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Very nice, think I should read it, I mean I'm already wearing it after all?' she asks, you shrug, not minding as you don't see any harm in doing so 'Let's go then. <i><b>Anata no ky\u014ddaina Grima o watashi ni ataete kudasai, watashitachi no teki ga watashi no ashimoto de yumi o furu kamo shiremasen</b></i>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next occurs rather quickly but also steadily, you watch in shock as the woman in front of you begins to grow, her outer clothes tearing and falling off, though for some reason her undergarments remained on her person, appearing to grow with her. Not all of her body grew at the same rate though, her breasts expanding nearly twice as fast as the rest of her, as you saw when she turned to you with a hungry smile. You tried to flee but her fingers quickly ensnare you and you rise up to her smiling face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't be afraid, you have given me this divine gift' she says, gently pressing you to her lips 'So I believe this will be an adequate reward for my first acolyte' she chuckles before lowering you down to her exposed breasts, her free hand parting them to show you a canyon of cleavage, which she securely nestles you within 'There, perfect' she says and you feel you have to agree; her breasts are soft and warm and even though they wrap around your entire body it feels like a hug rather than 2 hills trying to crush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You informed the leader of the hunting party who then patted you on the back and signaled for you all to get into positions. You've only just become a hunter so you were in the back position. Your job is to watch the surroundings and signal if there's any trouble. You've never hunted a beetle yet but you know that a simultaneous strike under its hard shell is the proper way to hunt it. You watch nervously as the part stealthily approaches the beetle and with one simultaneous strike successfully eliminates the prey. You sigh at relief and know that one day that will be you providing food for the village. As your pondering that you see within a instant a spider zip in and kill your leader. Terror sweeps over you as you recognize this as a wolf spider the terror of the jungle. Huge, fast, and deadly these beasts while rare spell absolute death to almost all who encounter them. Fighting is not a option the only way to survive is to hide or hope it just ignores you. As my comrades gave out their last breath I used that as a opportunity to hide under the closest thing I could find a gigantic boulder with a opening under it just big enough to fit me. Even this spider wouldn't be strong enough to move this I thought as I hide under it getting as far back as I could from the exit. I stayed there for what felt like a eternity and then in a instant I saw the spiders eyes looking at me through the opening. It's body was a blur as it kicked up dirt trying to widen the gap so that it could reach me. I could feel the earth shake underneath me, another earthquake i guess but that wont matter to me in a few minutes. As I sat there awaiting my doom I pondered why us humans would be born into I world with such dangerous creatures like this. It's unfair how something could be born with so many gifts. Within a instant before I could even process what was going on the gigantic boulder which was my roof disappeared above my head and in front of me where the spider once was stood something I couldn't fathom. A shoe not like the ones people in my village wear but still a shoe only it's bigger than my village. Looking up I couldn't see what lies beyond the shoe but looking behind me and seeing the shadow that it cast endlessly I know that there is something bigger than anything we've ever seen up there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gray smiled as he approached the machinery, he was in Jurassic World, sure it was to get him and his brother out of the house while his parents were finalising their divorce but this was a once in a life time chance. Also they got to see Claire their mom's (adopted) sister who ran the place, Gray expected her to be busy so wasn't as annoyed as his brother that she'd got them a 'babysitter' to keep an eye on them during the time she'd be at meetings, it helped she was really hot and wore open toed shoes. Still Claire had promised them an hour with her before she was whisked away to meetings and they had to make do with just Zara's company for the day but then got a call from her boss and slipped away, she was still within view but the hour was slipping away and the call didn't look like it was ending any time soon, so he saw no point in waiting for her to finish before getting what he wanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the console of 'Eyes in scales' a device that would shrink the subject to the size where they'd be eye level with certain smaller and younger dinosaurs as a chance to see this world as they do (If Ingen can make dinosaurs and the insanity that is the Indominous, why not a shrink device? Plus they greedy bastards would find a marketable use for it) quickly typing in the name of the smallest dinosaur he knew: the Compsognathus, feeling a little disappointed the animal was 10 inches tall, nowhere near small enough for what he wanted to do, luckily he was able to set it do a juvenile, making it 4 1/2 inches which would just have to do. Stepping into the tube he waited for the blue light as the world expanded around him, a much smaller door opening behind him when he reached his final height and he stepped through it, the 'Eyes to Scale' attraction was built with safety in mind it would seem, the section for the miniaturised people was separated from the regular park goers by what Gray assumed to be reinforced or else bulletproof glass, another <i>'spared no expense' </i>moment he remembered being Hammond's catchphrase. Still due to it's transparency he could see his new perspective gave him a better ability to look up skirts and straight at feet, as well as getting to see the comparatively larger boobs and butts of other park goers as they passed the attraction. He was enjoying the view of a blond in sandals and a bikini, when a familiar pair of open toed heels. Looking up Gray saw it to be Zara, Claire's assistant and their chaperone for today and if her (even more) stress (than before) expression was any indication Zach had run off and ditched them all. At least he knew she wasn't looking for him, when the 2 adults had told them to stay in the Innovation Centre he'd actually agreed, unlike Zach who just grunted. As the British woman sighed and leaned against the observation area massaging her temples, Gray was pleased to see at his size her butt was just as impressive as her bouncy breasts and super cute blue painted toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood back up and walked off Gray decided he'd had enough of safe observation, time to have some real fun. He made his way to the exit quickly and put his plan into action: the resizer had it's doors open at all times, only closing when the sensor is triggered by a shrunken park goer but the sensor was surprisingly small, if he skirted along the edge of the fixed glass wall he could just slip out with his current size intact and enjoy himself in his new height outside. Happy with having outsmarted the device's creator he began to pick a target, while theoretically he could pick any girl in the park, if he were realistic he wanted to get changed back eventually and that meant picking someone who he could trust and making sure he wasn't kidnapped and taking halfway across the world. That narrowed his options down to 2 beautiful choices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire: Not related by blood and beautiful in a prim and proper way, she rocked the heels and managed to show off her bust without it being distastefully all cleavage.<br>\r\nand Zara: Even more awesome she was an entire package deal for the young boy; big boobs, firm rear, and really sexy feet what wasn't to love? His one problem was he didn't know anything about the woman other than her being Claire's PA, was she trustworthy? Would she keep him safe? Would she decide to keep him small forever as her pet/toy (Gray was unsure whether that was a positive or a negative)? He just didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo: Claire or Zara?</span></div></div>",

Throughout the day he snuck glances at her, and sometimes launching surprise hugs from behind, secretly feeling her rear. Claire never suspected anything but a really clingy nephew.) Steadily creeping across the glass wall, he suddenly shrunk to 1.5 centimeters! Mustve been a malfunction in the shrinking device. Glitches DO happen after all.<br>\r\n      Gray smiled to himself. This made it much easier to avoid the sensors. And look at girls. The only drawback was that he would never be noticed. Which wasnt a bad thing. Feeling a rush of adrenline due to excitement(his 'little friend' was quite excited to), he finally made it across and bolted out to the innovation centre's entrance, evading feet and stealing one long last glance at his 'babysitter' The Almost-12-year-old bounded into the sunlight. He now started of towords where his aunt was, but then an idea appeared into his intelligent and perverted head: he could hitch a ride on a ferry leaving the park and travel the globe going places and checking out sexy chicks from all over. His rational side was very suppressed andwas almost completely gone. A dinosaur-sized grin spread across his face. This was going to be an awesome day.</span></div></div>",

The pre-teen carefully darted back to the device, and shrank himself to the height of a young microraptor: 3 inches tall. His size wasnt reduced by much, but he was smaller.

They are here for the dinosaurs, and so was he, but now he was here to peep under skirts, gawk at boobs, and stare at feet.<br>\r\nAs he reached her sandal, he decided what to do.

As she once more stopped her pacing Gray was glad he'd decided against stopping at her lovely arse, he'd rather not be crushed between it and the wall/glass/convenient surface she decided to lean against to try de-stress each time she stopped to de-stress. He was also glad her hands were idly tapping against the wall, rather than crossed over her chest or else he'd also be unable to reach her breasts either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt foot level and now at hip level for the most part the voices of the giants/normal sized people was a buzz of white noise to his tiny ears, except for Zara now he'd reached this point ''<b>...introduce as just your assistant. Seriously Claire this will come back to bite you before the weekend is out'</b>' she muttered to herself surprising Gray: was there relationship more than strictly business? Did Zara think Claire was her friend or something else? Either way it seemed to be one of the reasons the woman was annoyed so Gray decided to avoid the issue for as long as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shift from pants to shirt was a transition for Gray, using the jumper as his climbing frame as it seemed safer in her movements as he was gently bounced between the jumper and her upper body, rather than the potential plummet if he fell off her shirt. When he reached on level with her boobs he waited for the sway of her shirt and grabbed her shirt, pulling himself onto the hill that was her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found out something interesting though: Zara's chest did bounce slightly with each step and breath the PA took, but luckily for the shrunken Gray they only went up and down and didn't bounce around, something had made him think he could just sit (or even stand if he decided to for some stupid reason) on her breast and be safe and secure to rise and fall with her mounds. Though for now he was content to lie on top of them and rub as much of her enormous tits with his body as he could, his member aching to be released from captivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing came to his hormonal mind though: he didn't want to just be a little voyeur, he wanted to have some fun with a sexy giantess, so he would need to get Zara's attention at some point, hell he was sure the only reason she hadn't noticed him yet was she had no reason to look down at her own boobs. He had to get her to notice him somehow, give her a pinch? Grab one of the hairs that flopped on her chest and climb to her ear? Stand up and yell really loud, hoping she heard him? he wasn't sure but he'd come up with something soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

Gray crawled over to the digits and gently kissed the tip of each toe, glad Zara apparently didn't notice his lips and tongue on his skin. There was also the scent: Gray was glad Zara took good care of herself as her feet were clean and there was a rather fruity scent to her flesh which he appreciated greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he'd held back long enough Gray quickly stood removed his pants and underwear, freeing his dick from it's confines.

Even if she didn't feel his dick between her toes she should feel something under her foot.

As a child, she loved the Godzilla movies, but she always imagined herself to be Godzilla and to crush people. She still does it when she sees some ants in her garden and no one can see her. She begins to crush the ants. She looks on the toy box and an idea came to her. She goes there and grabs every plastic car and truck out which were small enough and also find some paper houses. She builds them up like the little child. When she was done she stand up and try to don't step on them. She stands now at the door from the room in front of a little toy town. She starts walking and she pretended she did not know about the city. After some a few crushed cars and one crushed house, she stands there and looks down. And says:\"Oh think a step on something. A tiny city.*giggles*\". After crushing every single toy she stands there and cleaned it up. She sits on the bed and starts thinking to use the liquid to grow her in a giantess. After 1 Hour she grabs it and starts drinking it.</span></div></div>",

Somehow Susan made it through without damaging too much stuff aside from stepping on a few cars while listening for sounds of approaching copters or tanks but none came \"Whew that's a relief!\" She thought \"Looks like they're busy searching another city or something now if only I can make it without any troub.........\" But now she heard a new sound and immediately felt her stomach area \"Wait a moment I'm starving! I haven't gotten to eat anything since this morning. There has to be something around here....\" It was easy enough to search around and sure enough she spotted a hotdog stand all abandoned,a overturned pie truck and even a lone fast food joint Susan didn't hesitate to scoff down all nearly all of it pigging out totally like a madwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after two hours the hotdog stand,pie truck and fast food joint were devoid completely of food and Susan was rubbing her slightly bloated stomach area \"Mmmmmmmmm that was delicious! Good thing my wedding dress is in tatters otherwise I wouldn't be able to fit into it!\" She giggled but was met with a new sensation,a gut wrenching literally gut related one as she felt that familiar amount of pressure in her stomach \"Uh oh oh boy!\" She thought and.............</span></div></div>",

And then there's you, to ensure it's actually safe for human use' she jabs it into your arm and you feel it flow through you like ice water, Maru watching passively as you twitch, seize and scream for 10 minutes before finally flopping forward limply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well you're alive, that's one good thing, now to test the actual point of the serum' Maru muses before attaching a device around your chest, pushing the button and you feel a moment of harsh squeezing which fades away in a few minutes 'Good, you are immune to blunt force damage, will make our side better in a fight' Maru notes in a neutral tone while writing in her journal 'Now to the fun' she attaches a breathing apparatus to your face as well as putting a canister beside the chair 'This will most likely knock you out if it doesn't kill you. I don't expect any useful information until you regain consciousness, provided you actually do of course' just as she turns the valve loud alarms blare throughout the base, though you just hear angry, what you assume is swearing in german before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my, what has she done to you?' you hear loudly, bringing you back to consciousness only to yelp and scurry back in fear. Towering above you is the massive face of Wonder Woman herself, looking concerned as she reaches out to pick you up, grabbing you with speed that shouldn't be possible at her size, but the size problem is actually you and besides she's basically a demi god so she can ignore things like that. She brings you up to her face and begins to question you, but you knew very little, and were actually ashamed about that, until WW places you in her hand and gently pets you 'Relax little one, you don't have to know everything, what you gave me I didn't already know so you helped, and so I'm going to keep you with me until I can find you a cure, seems fair after all' you blink and then grin, spending time with Wonder Woman sounds great, maybe the crazy Doc shrinking you was a good thing after all 'The only problem is my suit doesn't have pockets, I'm not Batman, I don't need pockets, so I'll just have to keep you... for now'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she put you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Between her breasts, planning to keep you a secret until she finds something/someone that could be used to restore your size<br>\r\n2) In her sandal under her foot, and due to rather liking the feel of you down there, follow her even when she switches from hero clothes to civilian wear.</span></div></div>",

You're only going to be here for a short time so enjoy it while you can.\" Diana gives you a small smile as you're finally sandwiched between those massive boobs of hers and she lets go of the chest plate and you let out a surprise outcry as you're literally forced back into the folds of the Amazon Princess' very thick skin,like the armor of a rhino only seemly tougher! But you can't complain at all you still can't believe you're actually contained within Wonder Woman's cleavage of all places,the only other place you can think she might be able to put you was into her skirt itself.....but your thoughts were quickly interrupted when you realized Diana was talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Did you hear me? I asked whether or not you're alright down there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah,yeah I'm fine.......\" You called back you didn't want to inform her that due to their massive size and due to her solid,muscular built Diana's breasts was crushing the very life out of you so you told a quick little lie that she ultimately brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright then well hang on and try to hold on tight because I'm about to move.....\" She stated as you felt your whole world turn 360 degrees the moment she began to walk at a sprinter's pace towards the would be super-villainess Maru aka Dr. Poison who wasn't paying any mind to what the heroine was doing prior instead she was yelling in German to the soldiers to evaluate the strong hold fortress <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder Woman is here you fools! Evaluate the facility,those of you who are standing guard shoot her on sight!!\" She ordered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for that Dr. Maru surrender!\" Diana ordered as she whipped out her sword and shield a few armed soldiers came charging into the room and shot at her but with her far superior superhuman reflexes not to mention unbreakable bracelets she blocked their attacks with ease and in a matter of minutes with her highly advanced Anazon training and martial art skills all the men were lying on the floor moaning in pain now it was only Dr. Poison left but much to the Amazon Princess' surprise Maru showed no amount of fear at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're as usual a thorn in my side Wonder Woman! But as always I'm always one step ahead.....see those gas canisters over there? They're rigged to release a very toxic poison over the city in a matter of minutes everyone within a 50 mile radius will be.....\" But before she could finish Diana leapt forward and grabbed hold of the super-villainess pinning her to the wall <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will never happen Maru! Surrender and return the young boy whom you have shrunken to his regular size!\" Diana ordered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!! Behold...\" With her free hand Maru pressed a button on the nearby wall panel and at once all the gas canisters in the vast room opened all at once Diana's pretty blue eyes widened as she saw the faint green vapor like smoke poring into every open vent and air duct in the facility <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Wh-What have you done?\" She bellowed frightfully only to have Maru laugh like crazy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My greatest achievement Wonder Woman! In a matter of minutes all of Boston(I'm basing this in the modern era by the way instead of the Wonder Woman film setting set in World War I) will be nothing but ruins.....\" But she didn't get to finish as one punch was all it took to knock her unconscious but now Diana was faced with a new problem how was she going to stop a dozens of poisonous gas from annihilating a entire population and at the same time protect a shrunken young man? </span></div></div>",

NO, BAD DIANA, you're meant to protect him and maybe get him back to normal not eat him. Anyway he was safe in her mouth as long as she didn't open it or swallow him while she was here, which meant she was free to find the main command centre of the base, as she expected the giant LexCorp logo told her exactly where to look. She was reminded mooks were hired because they were cheap as apposed to competent, as she was able to activate the self destruct simply by typing in 'Superman', giving her 2 minutes to get out of here before the building was consumed by an enormous fiery explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did make a slight detour to where she'd left Isabel, but the masked woman was gone, whether by her own power or by one of the soldiers fleeing the supposed to be death cloud she didn't know, nor did she care. It just meant she didn't need to slow down in order to keep a passenger uninjured when she made her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely unaware of any of this as no matter what way she moved you still bounced around, the only reprieve when you were manhandled under her tongue so she could swallow without you joining her saliva on the trip into her belly. Just as your eyes were properly adjusting to the darkness light entered your prison/bunker when Diana opened her mouth, you getting a glimpse of the rather ominous looking building you presumed you'd been held in... just before exploding into a bright green fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder woman reaches in and removes you, then smiles as you sit in her hand \"See, you were a big help to me little one, but I'm afraid I don't know how to change you back for the moment, meaning you'll need to stay with me for at least the next while\" you didn't see any problem with that, Wonder woman was lovely both in looks and personality, she clearly had your best interests in mind and from what you remember from the crazy mask lady's experiments you're basically immune to blunt force trauma so you won't be a burden on the hero during her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just one thing I need to do for the moment\" Diana says, more to herself than you before putting the shrunken young man in her _____ and changing into her Diana Prince clothes, heading to the museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere'd she put you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Back into her cleavage, she now knows you'll be okay there so why search for somewhere else?<br>\r\n2) Into her tight panties, you did help with dealing with Maru and the gas, you deserve some kind of reward.

Although you're more or less fine physically, it is still an intense pressure to fly up with every step of Wonder Woman and have her powerful smelling sole mash you on contact. But how many people would be displeased with being so close and personal with the Amazon princess of Themyscira? She also did save your life so you stay as still as you can, just trying to suck in air with every <i>stomp stomp stomp</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the walking ends and Diana starts to undo her sandal. After all the walking in the hot London summer, you stick to her sole with sweat and she takes a couple of seconds to realize you are glued to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little man, where are yo... Oh! Hahaha.\" She chuckles at your hot and sticky misfortune, then frees you from her foot and you fall onto a desk. Looking around, it looks like a private office with bookshelves and decorative exhibits on the wall. Must be part of her life as Diana Prince, the renowned art collector and philanthropist. You want to bond with the amazing giantess but even her superhero powers don't let her hear such pipsqueak sounds. She tries to listen then lets you know what is going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some mixed news. It is going to be awhile longer, I have no idea what Dr. Maru did to you and I need to get feedback from others on the team. For now it is just you and me, little man. I still can't believe your size!\" Diana smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, you smell like a foot. I need to get you cleaned up. But first, a little experiment.\" Wonder Woman pulls out what looks like golden floss and begins to unravel it, bringing it closer to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to climb up on it but as soon as it touches you and wraps around your arm, you feel the irresistible urge to yell up to the Amazon giantess your deepest desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Whoops, that's actually a miniature Lasso of.. What's that, you're yelling up at me, little man?\" </b></span></div></div>",

Her heels sit on the table like a pair of two massive buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I made the mini lasso to make sure you weren't actually a spy for Maru or the Legion of Doom. But <i>really</i>? You want to go back inside one of my shoes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wraps up the small lasso again and tucks it into one of her pockets. You are mortified with embarrassment that all your secret desires can just come out with her signature detector but what is said has been said. You shake your head with glassy eyes as Wonder Woman looks around, thinking of whether to indulge you or keep you elsewhere. Not like you're a threat in any way, shape, or form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little man, it must be terrible being so small. The least I can do for a harmless civilian like you is have you where you want to be - and keep my foot nice and relaxed.\" Wonder Woman scoops you up before you can really process what is happening. You see her body flash by you, the view of her bosom, her hips in the tight clothes, and the long legs that connect to the part of her body you will only be familiar with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These shoes are a hassle but maybe you can make it better for the both of us.\" Diana takes the heels from the desk and the next thing you see is the end of the shoe passing over you. She turns it over and you slip into it like a slide, tumbling down to the toe of the stylish black heels. It is less roomy than the sandals she was wearing before, the smell is stronger, and you can tell you'll be getting uncomfortably close to her toes when she slips the shoe on. You gasp as the shoe is moved around roughly some more, and then the light of the office is blocked by five colossal toes. </span></div></div>",

Wonder Woman glazed over you, examining your body for a second as though she was in a moment of deep contemplation, before a smile crept onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I have been pretty lonely, and I would hate to let you down.\" She said anxiously, as a nervous smile came from you. It wasn't on the table anymore, you had just convinced Diana to keep you as a pet, and there was no turning back from your new status under her care. \"Now let's get my new pet cleaned up, what do you think?\" She laughs, before plucking you off the ground with her thumb and index finger, setting you in her palm as she approached a sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She plugged the bowl at the bottom of the sink, and turned on the faucet as it filled with water, before she turned it off once the seemingly large pool of water was finished filling. She giggled as she dropped you into the ceramic lake, and a splash of water greeted you to the start of your swim. You floated up to the top, treading water as you stared up at the beautiful face of the Amazonian princess, and now your owner gazing down at you with a grin, before reaching over and grabbing a washcloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold still little one, I need to make sure my pet is clean.\" She boomed, before reaching down, an enormous hand plummeting in the water down below before rising right underneath you, scooping your body now soaked in water as opposed to sweat, and started rubbing with the washcloth. You could tell Diana was attempting to be gentle, but it still hurt pretty bad as the cloth was pressed against your skin and she scraped back and forward, but you didn't blame her for wanting to get rid of the stench of foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, she finished with your bath, and you were set on the counter, where she dried your tiny body off with a different washcloth.

Recovering from your fall, you turn to face the amazing goddess before you in all her glory. The redhead looking down at the insect you are states, <b>\"Seems to me you took interest in my feet little guy\"</b>. Proceeding after, she wiggles her toes in anticipation. <b>\"Now I expect a nice massage while you're down there worshiping your new master. Don't forget to use your tongue, my sweat is the only thing that'll be keeping you hydrated for the rest of your durability as my slave.\"</b> She then proceeds to yawn, and stretches out her legs and feet so they're inches from your face. In shock, but also in awe you stand there still as stone. After shaking the feeling off your body, you proceed to her feet and begin to lick. Your master seems to enjoy this as she let's out a slight moan in delight, this only encourages you to do your best as you press your entire body against her foot. Using your tongue you proceed to lick and clean every drop of sweat you can reach off of her feet. Afterwards your goddess commands you to stop, and say's <b>\"Alright slave, now that your hard work has paid off. Maybe you can visit some of my other... 'assets'.\"</b> She then proceeds to let out a deafening (to you) giggle that rings in your ears. \"So my little foot toy, you have a couple choices I'll let you pick between...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just failed to take into account just how quickly what to her was a giant could move, Jemma closing the gap between them in a step and her long fingers wrapping around the inhuman's body seconds later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Daisy? Oh my word it is you\" Jemma gasps, while Daisy squirmed to try get her arms free from the friend's grip, but her size meant it was like trying to escape the Hulk... pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah Jem it's me\" she replies with her signature smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How did this happen?\" the scientist asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I don't know, I touched some blue thing and it exploded all over me\" Daisy grumbles, luckily she was close enough to Jemma's face she could still hear her... and pinched the bridge of her nose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You broke it... of course you did. Well let's see what we had at the moment\" standing up again she walks over to the wall and pulls out their stock list for lack of a better term, looking for something she couldn't see right in front of her \"Got it, ah there's the problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Those were the prototype for Ant Man's shrinking discs, meant to be useable on things not protected in the suit.

You just said it was Ant Man tech, I'll be fine\" she waves it off until she squeaks from pain when Jemma's grip increased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Weren't you listening, I said it was a prototype, as in not the final device, there could be several unknown side effects\" at that she turns on her heels and marches to her room, the one place she knew they wouldn't be disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Strip\" Jemma says flatly, causing Daisy to stumble when she was placed on the desk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Seriously Jem, I'm not that easy a girl, you got to at least buy me dinner first\" Daisy jokes to hide her nerves, but Jemma is used to her tricks and just rolls her eyes with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll feed you later, right now we need to make sure your body is still medically sound before any complications make themselves known\" the doctors tone left no room for debate and so the shrunken inhuman removes her shirt and pants, leaving her in her deep red bra and panty set, as well as shucking her boots and socks along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh for the love of\" Jemma mutters before just picking up the shrunken woman \"I said strip, as in completely\" she sighs before using her own hands to remove Daisy's underwear, the girls attempts at resistance soundly beaten<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, stop it Jemma this is unnecessary\" Daisy shrieks as Jemma's cold hands explore her body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Actually this is all scientifically relevant\" Jemma counters, squeezing one of Daisy's breasts and watching the girl in her palm gasp breathlessly \"I need to make sure none of your body has been compressed to the point of crystallisation\" she explains just before pinching Daisy's supple ass cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Medically relevant my ass, you just wanted to feel me up, at least warm your fingers up before hand next time'</i> Daisy thinks as Jemma's caresses become a lot more sensual than they initially were and her breasts and butt kept getting poked, prodded and even her nipples were pinched by the scientist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What next?</span></div></div>",

Not that it matters all that much, at this size I'd be a good vibrator and that's it\" she grumbles, not quite hearing the English woman's amused 'quite'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well\" Jemma thinks aloud \"That's your external form stable, but I worry about the internal ones\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Internal? What the fuck is she ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" Daisy screams as Jemma's pinky slides down her crack before forcing it's way through her asshole, an unpleasant process for someone to go from an anal virgin to being stuffed with something larger than any sex toy she'd even thought about getting for herself. Luckily Jemma had bony fingers, and didn't just use her thumb but even the first knuckle was more than Daisy could bare in this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jemma hums \"It seems your internal structures are where they're supposed to be, thought your form is more malleable than it used to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmmmallleable?\" Daisy croaks, a shiver going down her spine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well for one, you're not bleeding from the anus, and I can do this...\" she wriggles her pinkie and Daisy gasps \"...without tearing you to shreds\" she chuckles before smacking her forehead with her free hand \"I can't believe I forgot, what kind of a scientist am I to miss out on such an important data point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Daisy realised a second too late what the scientist was thinking \"Please Jem don't put it theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere\" Daisy moans as Jemma's ring finger spreads her lips and vaginal walls, filling her to the brim when it hit her cervix like a battering ram. Through her bleary gaze she could still see the grin on her friend's face, before her eyes slam shut s she wriggles her finger tips, doing untold damage to Daisy's internal organs (or not). So this is it, after fighting Hydra, Ward, her mother and even Hyde, she dies from Jemma Simmons using 2 fingers to fuck her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh you are just delightful\" Jemma purrs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why go through the song and dance? If you were just planning to fuck me I mean?\" Daisy asks, not like she has any cards but Jemma wasn't her enemy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jemma chuckles \"I had to do the examination, that much was genuine, the thing is that running my hands all over that sexy body of yours and I just couldn't resist\" her smile becomes feral as the fingers of her other hand wrap around her waist \"As for fucking, thanks for the permission\" Daisy's face looses colour as she feels her inner muscles drag against the scientist's fingers, before being slammed back onto them. Jemma smiles as rather than complaints all Daisy was able to vocalise were \"Oh fuck\" \"Yes\" \"Jeeez!\" and animalisitic grunts when she pushes too far. Finally the moment arrives, one more thrust and Daisy screams, her orgasm running down Jemma's ring finger, gushing a little onto her palm once she finally removed her digits. Grinning at the panting inhuman she slips her fingers into her mouth, loudly sucking on the tips as Daisy watches<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I don't know about you but that was fun, unfortunately I didn't get the big bang myself, but luckily I have someone who can remedy that\" Jemma purrs before opening her pants and dropping Skye in, shouting \"Show me why you'd make a better tiny girlfriend than a sex toy\" before letting the fabric shut on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Where did Jemma put Daisy?</span></div></div>",

She reaches the top and grins as her target is in line of sight: Jemma's clitoris. Tangling her left hand in Jem's pubic hair for stability Daisy begins to wriggle her legs and other arm within the muscular cavern, while her lips part and envelop the engorged nub. She may have never done anal but she has given blow jobs, foot jobs and tit fucks, and right now Jemma's clit was the best thing she'd put in her mouth for one of these moments, running her tongue erratically along it's surface as she suckles, knowing it to be the bigger cause of the noises the giantess was making, though the rubbing and scratching her hands and feet were doing were contributing in their own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Daisy wonders if Jemma's vagina's pheromones were getting to her when she felt like a swarm of bees had made a nest in her chest, until she realised what it was, though you can't really blame her as she hadn't felt this since she first got her powers.... seems her powers were coming back just at the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grinning to herself Daisy released her mouth's hold on her clit with a slight pop, then pulled out her hand from Jemma's pussy, her legs continuing to kick and now she noticed very slightly vibrate. \"You wanted that big bang Jem\" Daisy says, mostly to herself but aimed at Jemma \"Well here it comes\" she grunts before her fingers wrap around the clit and she pushes a vibrational pulse through it. Jemma's scream and the shudder as she flopped onto her bed rocked Daisy and made her quite certain if she'd been closer to her face the shrunken inhuman would have either lost her hearing or be bleeding from the ears right about now. While protected from the sound there was one thing she had to face head on, whether she liked it or not: Jemma squirts. The deluge was stronger than Daisy's grip on the hairs, only lasting one pulse before sliding from her grip, though the cum may have made it much slicker and difficult to grasp Daisy didn't know as she was a little busy trying not to drown as she felt like she'd been tossed under a feminine smelling waterfall as gallons of cum pour over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At this point both women were panting slowly trying to regain their senses, something Daisy was happy about as she coughed up some of the cum she hadn't been quick enough to swallow and instead basically breathed in, as well as wiping enough off her face so she could actually see. Her vision had just about returned when she was momentarily blinded by the light as Jemma's panties were parted by her pale hand and her longer fingers wrapped around Daisy once more, pulling her out as the giantess sits up and tries look respectable, but given she knows EXACTLY what just happened it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Daisy, what was intense\" Jemma whistles \"The strongest orgasm I've ever had most like\" she grins and kisses the shrunken woman, which at least finished the job or removing the cum from her senses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Never would have guessed give I nearly drowned\" Daisy mutters before looking up \"So does this mean I passed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jemma laughs \"Passed? You're the best sex toy I've ever test ridden, if I could I'd leave you in my panties every day and every night\" the scientist says with a wide grin, while Daisy pales. The moment is broken by much more snorted chuckles \"Your face, you're fucking face\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey! Not cool Jem, I was worried there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jemma pouts, a move which made Daisy putty are regular size but was like being slammed by the hulk wielding Thor's hammer at her current size \"But I'm just teasing, am I not allowed have fun with my girlfriend, love?\" she asks and Daisy blusters before sighing and dropping her head on Jemma's fingers, she had nothing left that she could do, \"Great\" Jemma chirps, now we just need to clean you up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Reaching over to the wall Jemma blobs a dollop of shower gel onto a wriggling Daisy's belly and massaged it in, the ball of suds it produced amused her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeeema\" Daisy whines, barely able to see her through the bubbles, but she can see enough to know the look on her face was going to be unpleasant for her in a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had a great idea\" Jemma states, moving Daisy to one hand and rubbing her against the opposite arm, slowly soaping up her body. After sudding up her breasts (rubbing Daisy's face particularly hard into her stiffening nipples) Jemma rinses her off so they could talk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jemma, what the fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made such a poof ball of suds, I realised what a great loofah you'd make\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy looks unimpressed \"well you got it out of your system we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPLAT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma adds another blob, his time to the upper section of Daisy's torso and continues her progress, starting at her smooth stomach, and working her way down, adding more as she went along. When she reached her feet though Jemma made sure she rubbed Daisy's head or one of her limbs between each toe, clenched those lower digits and pulled back, she also couldn't resist a comparison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look darling, you told me that my feet were small and cute, but they're bigger than you are\" she giggles childishly, something she didn't normally do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy grimaces at the gut punch to her pride, not just the physical comparison, which had her face pressed into the wrinkled sole (admittedly there were worse times for her to do this, like being stuck in her shoe during/after a marathon), but when her pussy was ground against Jemma's rough heel, not enough to get her off but it got her motor running in the worst way possible. The same occurred on her left to the point Daisy didn't know if she wanted to kill the scientist or use her clit as a penis substitute again, this time for her own needy pussy instead of her hungry maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jemma brings her up to eye level, kissing her face, breasts and even a quick taste of her dripping pussy \"Almost done love, you feel so good against my body, this should be our routine\" she giggles and Daisy gulps \"So ready for the last part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go again\" Daisy mutters but apparently Jemma hears her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, I'm able to wash that perfectly fine myself, you'd just make it messier\" she teases, then begins slowly lowering the still slightly suddy girl down her body \"No, this is a treat I know you'll enjoy, I know you've been staring\" she singsongs as Daisy's jaw drops just before she's rubbed against Jemma's small but tight and perky ass cheeks, rubbed in circular motions, then slid into her ass crack, moaning lewdly as she grinds the inhuman's head against her puckering asshole \"Oh yes, that's good, right there pet, make me let you in\" Jemma moans and purrs releasing her sphincter and her ass swallows Daisy's scream, shortly followed by her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem came when she hears the door open, her mind seizing up in panic Jemma decides to just push, Daisy finding herself at least a finger (based on the nail poking her own sole) deep into Jemma's bowel's, and she wasn't looking forward to how she gets out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma tenses as another agent steps into the shower stall next to her, things were getting a lot more complicated than she had expected.

She didn't get anywhere until her nerves caused her body to start to vibrate softly once again, the original cause of her problem, but also a solution to her new one. \"You wanted a girlfriend who doubles as a sex toy, and you're the one who put me in here, let's see if you can handle it\" Daisy growls before pulsing her powers as hard as she could into Jemma's ass, actually causing the walls around her to hum against her own sex and nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma regrets her decision on where to put Daisy about 5 seconds after she activates her powers, her steely grip on the shower being the only thing keeping her jelly like legs from collapsing under her weight, her whimpers and moans getting louder and more noticeable, even if they weren't an agent of May's calibre<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jemma, what the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy\" Jemma whimpers, confusing the Asian woman \"There was an accident, Daisy shrunk to 5 inches tall, and right now, she's in my ass\" Jemma moans and to her embarrassment cums in front of the serious woman without even touching herself, her and May's breasts mashed together when she catches her to stop her falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ass huh?\" May whispers, palming the milky globe \"I'll need to investigate to confirm this information\" she smirks as Jemma's butt lets in her questing fingers, easily hooking themselves around Daisy's ankles and pulling the shrunken woman out. Daisy can barely blink in the light before a flat \"Explain\" is thrown to both of them, during which May, much more roughly than Jemma cleans the shrunken woman of Jemma' anal secretions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her predicament Daisy couldn't answer much, so Jemma did most of the talking, explaining how she broke one of the prototype shrink discs, Jemma examined her, the eventual double penetration, pussy playing and shower fun up to the anal diving<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" May asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that if we can't fix this, Daisy would make a lot of money as a feminine loofah or sex toy, as she made me cum harder than anything else that has ever entered either hole\" Jemma purrs \"You should try it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's lip curls into a smirk \"Don't mind if I do\" she says before rubbing the shrunken woman all over her wet body, something Daisy liked less as while Jemma was soft and curvy, May was more hard muscle, she was also rougher than the scientist as Daisy was sure if her form wasn't as durable/mallable she'd have broken her nose when she was rubbed headfirst into the senior agent's armpit, plus she had a feeling she'd have been more annoyed by being pinned under May's fleshy mountains if she wasn't so painfully aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished neck to hip May unexpectedly bats her eyes at Jemma and whispers \"Mind helping me with my back?\" passing Daisy back to her, before turning so she was facing away from them both<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jem, please get us out of here, you don't have to do this\" Daisy pleads, but Jemma just pets her head and begins rubbing her along May's spine, the older woman hums appreciatively as Daisy's small form was helping loosen some kinks in her back, meanwhile Jemma used her free hand to cup one of May's breasts and gently squeeze, liking the soft weight in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved lower Daisy's nerves grew, not helped when Jemma was basically fondling May's firm gluts with her tiny girlfriend as a buffer. Luckily even as she was inched closer to May's ass crack Jemma kept her mostly safe, sure she was rubbed against the older Asian woman's anus, which pulsed angrily as it tried to pull her in, but that was all, Jemma held firm, a little too firm given the thumb pressed into her vagina but at long as she was only flossed between May's ass cheeks she was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce May's back entrance was complete Jemma passed Daisy back to her, happy to get a small kiss in return. Now with Daisy back in hand May began to rub her all over her thighs and down her legs, reaching her feet which Daisy was worried about. Just like Jemma Daisy ended up getting her head squeezed between each of May's toes as she cleaned herself of dirt and sweat, though whether it was a dominance thing or just making sure she got everything she could only guess. Then there was her harder soles, which were once more rubbed against Daisy's hair trigger sex drive, mostly her sensitive nipples and cunt, to the point she came with a whimper all over May's foot just before the older woman finished her scrub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone enjoyed themselves\" Jemma teases lightly, watching Daisy form over May's shoulder \"But why should she be the only one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay smiles again \"Oh we definitely corrupted you\" she laughs and before Daisy could do anything she'd brought up to and pushed into May's hungry...</span></div></div>",

Neither ended up happening, but Daisy found herself pushed against May's crushing vaginal muscles a lot faster than she had before, the British woman now pumping her rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma guessed based on the way she squirmed that Daisy was okay, which was good because she was a little distracted when May uses one of her free hands to pull the woman into a kiss, while the other hand slides down her body, giving her breasts an appreciative squeeze, before shoving 3 fingers into her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that Jemma, you're clenching around my fingers\" May whispers before licking along her neck, nibbling on her pulse point as she pulls them out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha\" Jemma moans weakly \"One moment please\" she mumbles before kissing her way down May's body, flicking her tongue across her nipples a belly button before reaching the apex of her thighs. From there she gently retrieves Daisy from May's love tunnel, the inhuman spitting a mouth full of her juices on Jemma's cheek as she coughs and splutters her airways clear \"Hey, any chance you've got one more quake in you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy's response is an eyebrow raise and a tilt of her head \"You're asking me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma shrugs and smiles awkwardly \"Well you were enjoying things before right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy sighs and looks away \"Maybe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then give May the best orgasm like you did me then we're done\" Jemma smirks and licks her, moaning at the sweet taste \"Oh god if you don't quake her, my tongue is joining you in there\" Daisy swallows and nods, as Jemma pushes her back in, kissing along May's thighs before standing again \"You may want to hold onto something\" she purrs just before yelping when May grabs her ass and lifts her up, the surprised woman locking her legs around May's hips just before her back finds the shower wall and May continued to explore her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I'm not getting out on my own' Daisy thinks as unlike last time and much like when she'd been put in her ass Jemma had pushed her in completely, and May's vaginal muscles being as strong as the rest of hers meant Daisy was pretty much stuck \"Hope this works\" Daisy says to herself as she digs deep, her powers taking more out of her at this size, and pushes whatever else was in her tank outward, the erratic movements all around her the signal for something much more 'Ah crap' she thinks, holding her breath as the tsunami hits, shooting her out of May's pussy and onto the ground, the girl too tired to do more than look up at the goddess like beings above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's primal moan was swallowed by Jemma as they climaxed together, the almost fusing of their hips meaning Daisy's quake struck Jemma to the core just as hard. As her legs gave out and unhooked themselves from directly above the shelf of her ass, May's grip of Jemma's own rear allowed her to gently be put on her feet, the older woman breathing heavily but otherwise appeared fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right\" she said slowly \"Best fuck in a long time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma laughs \"I bet, we should probably grab Daisy before one of us step on her\" she says, looking down and giggling at the spaced out look on Daisy's face as she lies in the puddle of cum from both giantess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Ant Man's tech is designed to make the person stronger, she'd survive just fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma nods but still unsteadily bends down and picks her out of her puddle \"You look to be in such a mess, I suppose we could fix that\" Jemma teases, opening her mouth and dangling her over it, though at this point Daisy is too weak to fight back as Jemma placed the top half of her body into her mouth and sucked on it, her tongue playing with her breasts like marshmallows. What did have her react was when May's lips wrapped around her lower half, and her tongue speared it's way into her pussy, thrusting it's way to a shuddering orgasm on Daisy's part, which was swallowed with no problem (unlike the inhuman's interactions with the other 2's climaxes). Finally she was pulled out and placed between May's breasts, only her head sticking out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think that was enough fun in here, we should probably leave and dry up before we get pruney\" Jemma suggests, which has May smirk and Daisy nod tiredly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invite you back to my room, feel like taking it Simmons?\" May asks, the formality of the question amusing them after what they've just done<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girlfriend is using your cleavage as a bed, how can I refuse?\" Jemma asks with a chuckle while May's eyebrow quirks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend?\" there was a hint of ... disappointment in the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my girlfriend, but if you want you can join us, I certainly won't complain and neither would Daisy, plus you're a great lay and taste so good I could eat you any day of the week\" Jemma's fingers trace around May's nipples, still hard and pointy. The Asian shield agent takes her hands, pulls her forward and dominates a full kiss that devolved into a make out session, Daisy caught in the middle of their crashing breasts, though May's size and weight meant she was at least staying on the older woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little pinching and kissing as they dried off, May led Jemma into her chambers, and when they got into bed, Daisy found she wasn't the only one using the oldest member of their tentative triad as a pillow, Jemma's even breaths (usually with a minty feel to it, but currently making her think of May's pussy once more) washed over her as the scientist was pulled into a cuddling position alongside May, her arms wrapped around May's waist as she lay her head on her left tit. With no more fucking in store for her the adrenaline finally leaves her body and Daisy passes out within minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) May and Jemma decide to start the morning 'correctly', by using their tiny sextoy girlfriend to get all 3 of them off, then get to work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) While it would be fun keeping Daisy a secret, people will notice her disappearance very quickly, so they decide to tell everyone what happened the next day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Daisy wakes up with the other 2 still passed out in blissful contentment, so decides to take her chances and just run. Screw being a tiny naked lady she was getting away from the sex fiends, or at least going to try to...</span></div></div>",

The last thing he remembers was being pushed into some sort of portal in a vat of molten steel <br>\r\nat the steel mill. He had been caught by the subversives, the ones he\u2019d been hunting, or rather \u201cThe Doctor\u201d had been hunting. <br>\r\nHe had almost killed Jemma for killing his father, but none of that was real right? If none of it was real why did it feel real, why <br>\r\ncould remember an entire other life? Which one was the right one? Thought rushed through his head, he was remembering two<br>\r\n lives, and they were crowding his brain. He needed to focus on something else, something easier, something like where the hell <br>\r\nwas he, and how is he going to escape. It was dark, too dark to make out anything. He walked around feeling around, and came<br>\r\n to the conclusion he was in some kind of room with four walls with no door to speak of. This being the case he sat down so he <br>\r\ncould think up a plan. As he sat deep in concentration he heard something, something distant. He could hear sounds, but not <br>\r\njust any sounds voices, and as he continued to listen he realized they weren't just any voices they were the voices of Coulson and<br>\r\n May. Their voices were muffled by his prison, and they sounded far away. He could barely hear them. \u201cCoulson Fitz isn\u2019t here.\u201d <br>\r\nThat must be May Fitz though. \u201cHe was taken when we were where else could he be May?\u201d The voice which was obviously <br>\r\nCoulson said. He started screaming trying to let them know where he was. \u201cWe have a problem the Russian launched a torpedo <br>\r\nand it's heading straight for us we need to go.\u201d May said. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave Fitz May he\u2019s here somewhere he\u2019ll die if we leave him.<br>\r\n\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if he was stored here, but we do know we\u2019ll die if we stay here.\u201d said May. \u201cOkay, Okay let\u2019s go May\u201d Fitz <br>\r\nheart collapsed as he heard this, they were going to leave him. All of a sudden he heard another voice, much louder, and much <br>\r\ncloser, one he recognized all too well, Ophelia. \u201cYou see Leopold they choose to leave you to save themselves, I\u2019d never do that <br>\r\nto you because I love you. Don\u2019t worry i\u2019ll get us out of here.\u201d The next thing he knew his prison was shaking. Then he heard <br>\r\nanother sound he was all too familiar with. The sound of an inhuman teleporting, Ophelia to be exact, that had been one of the<br>\r\n powers he\u2019d given her. As soon as he heard the sound something else happened his prison started to shake rather violently. He<br>\r\n was tossed around hitting each wall, luckily there was some kind of padding so he didn\u2019t face any permanent injuries just some <br>\r\nbruises and a crazy headache. Just as suddenly as it had started the shaking stopped. He sat their in this dark Limbo wondering <br>\r\nwhat the fuck had just happened. Luckily or Unluckily for him he wouldn\u2019t have to wait long. All of a sudden the ceiling to his dark <br>\r\nprison lifted and light flooded in temporarily blinding him. When he could see again he almost passed out from what he saw. <br>\r\nOphelia\u2019s giant face looking down at him with a giant smile plastered on her face. Somehow he had shrunk to the size of what he<br>\r\n figured must be a mere two inches, and ended up in what he figured was some sort of box. Suddenly Ophelia spoke,\u201dOh Fitz thanks<br>\r\n to you i\u2019m alive, and can actually feel emotions, and right now I feel love. Now that i\u2019m free to make my own choices the first thing I <br>\r\nchose is you.\u201d As she finished talking her giant face disappeared and was replaced by her five giant fingers reaching in to grab him. He<br>\r\n could see there was no actual way to escape, she would get him in her hand eventually. So what does Fitz do? Submit and let her grab<br>\r\n him much to her happiness, or try to fight her fingers off(In vain) only managing to annoy her, or amuse her who knows with her.</div></span></div></div>",

This clusterfuck of thoughts lead to him sighing slightly and relaxing, allowing her to pick him up without any fear, she had never hurt him before, why would she hurt him now, she loved him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Leopold, how cute you've become in this new form, I could just eat you up but then we wouldn't get to do the more fun activities' she giggled, God she must be tripping balls with this cocktail of new sensations exploding in her mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AIDA' Fitz called and immediately a switch was flicked: her eyes darkened, muscled tensed and her jaw clenched, anger was not something you want to see in a woman when you're in such a vulnerable position 'Ophelia, please, can we just slow it down a little? please' he felt no regret to having whimpered the last word, for at least Ophelia calmed slightly, she still looked annoyed, anger was going to have to be something she learnt to let go of for everyone's sake, but she looked like he called her a silly nickname in public, rather than said another woman's name during sex (Neither version of Fitz having had that moment, but he assumed the looking like she wanted to crush the only person she loved into a bloody pulp between her deceptively strong fingers sounds about right)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I suppose it is for the best Leopold, I am getting overzealous with these new sensations, particularly as there are thing in the Framework I would very much like to replicate out here in the real world' she licked her lips and Fitz was torn between arousal and panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um maybe we could start small, my friends call me Fitz, Leopold always seemed so stiff and formal, not the way friendship or love should feel' he smiled at her, hoping for something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he started to worry as she frowned again, before it morphed into a pout, then a sigh 'If I must, Fitz then I will try be more looser and less stiff in my speech towards you. But you must do something for me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I desire a kiss. Can you do that for me <b>Fitz</b>?' she purred his name, getting just the response she hoped for<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh course, no problems with a simple kiss' he answered confidently, but still shook inside as she opened her palm and raised it up to her face, her lips on line with his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now Fitz, I want to remind you this is my first kiss as a human, think you can make it memorable for me?' Ophelia asks with a slight smile, making sure not to show any teeth or else she might scare him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'O-o-of course' she stuttered slightly before making his way to her large lips, kissing her lower lip gently and lovingly, getting a pleasant hum from her as he stepped back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not bad, not for my turn' before he could react his entire landscape tipped forward and he slid forward and was pressed against her lips in a much more active make out session, her lips parting not long after to allow her huge tongue to lather up his face, strong grunts and moans filtering from her throat below him as she held her tiny lover up against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes (thought for a partly oxygen starved... again... Fitz it probably felt longer) she levelled out her hand once more so he was left panting in her palm, his entire head and quite a bit of his upper torso soaked with her saliva, while Ophelia was hyperventilating, her pupils blown way out of proportion. Now normally Fitz would probably feel pride that he made a girl high as a kite simply by kissing..... getting kissed by her, but this was a woman who could eat him alive with almost no effort right now, he was going to be cautious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, ready for some more?' she asked with a grin<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Ophelia raised him up to her lips for another oxygen deficient kiss, there was a loud noise from the other room. It was the sound of a door being kicked down. It was S.H.I.E.L.D., Fitz wondered if they knew he was here. He looked up at his giant lover/captor to see a scary look on her face, the same look she had when he accidentally called her AIDA. She was no longer that overzealous lover she had been a second ago. She was experiencing her first bit of sexual pleasure as a human and SHIELD came along and ruined it, so she was pissed. luckily not at him, she'd wouldn't want to hurt him purposely especially after he'd just willingly  let her have her fun, and somewhat engaged in it. She would not, and could not lose the only other human that saw her as human. She wouldn't lose the only other human that cared about her. She had to hide him from SHIELD and fast, but where? Fitz could see Ophelia was thinking, but he couldn't tell what about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden she spoke \"Don't worry Fitz I won't let them find you and separate us. I'll hide you until I can get away. Somewhere close to me, somewhere I can know you're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would that be exactly Ophelia?\" She didn't respond to his question instead her hand started to move. He could do nothing as Ophelia moved her hand to deposit him in his temporary prison. He said goodbye to the outside world as she placed him in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The back of her panties. Not yet being fully familiar with the level of intimacy involved in that action she placed him there. She couldn't place him in her breasts because he's slip, and she couldn't place him in the front of her panties because from her knowledge that would stimulate her, and she couldn't have that happening right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Her boot. She knows that his new body is much more durable, and she dosen't quite understand how bad it could be for him under her foot with all the sweat, pressure, and the smell. She isn't intending on torturing him, but torture it will definitely be for him.</span></div></div>",

Your current form is much stronger than a normal human is, just like myself. This won't kill you, it won't even really injure you. Your safety is my top concern' with that she lets go and Fitz falls into her boots, bouncing slightly off her insole and rolling towards the toe end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow luckily for Fitz him and Radcliffe never designed AIDA to sweat, as if they had, given this is her original clothes from the very beginning he would be in Hell as they had never needed to change her clothes or footwear when she was an android. So right now there was just the musky smell of leather and slightly perfume/soapy smell he assumed was from AI...Ophelia (the less he thinks of AIDA the less likely he is to fuck up and call her it again). All in all it could be a lot worse, the darkness not helping matters and in fact getting worse when Ophelia puts back on the footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill retaining a robot's precision she was able to slide her foot in without jostling the boot, something Fitz would be happy about if not for the fact Ophelia planned her movements so he would end up trapped under her toes, held in what she saw to be a protective 'hug' by her toes, not a stifling grip that wedged him in the crevice between her toes and the rest of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go love, safe and sound. Now are you going to give my foot a kiss for being so accommodating to let you share it's place?' she cooed cutely (in any other situation) and Fitz blanched for a moment... was she serious? Realising she was and rationalising it was better now than later when her body would be pouring with sweat. Pluckng up his corage he pressed his head against the start of her sole and gave her foot a small peck of a kiss, already tasting salt, it would appear her little make-out/trying to eat him session had, had even stronger effect than he thought, heating her core and the rest of her body in time, his time of remaining dry was coming to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia moaned and clenched her toes, grinding Fitz harder between her foot and her boot 'That's perfect baby, maybe you can do more down there later' she smiles and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She does several rapid fire, globe trotting teleports to keep SHIELD off their tail. This leads to a nauseated, fearful and even a little angry Fitz, possibly complaining about her treatment of him<br>\r\n2. She zigs instead of zags in her jump, ending up back in SHIELD headquarters where she had to fight May, Daisy and or Jemma before getting away. With all her inhuman abilities she won't lose, but fighting experts like May, powerful inhumans like Daisy or even a human with an automatic weapon like Jemma can work up a sweat, increasing Fitz's torment by several magnitudes.</span></div></div>",

She knew the only way to do this was to make several teleports all over the world back to back. She knew it might be a little uncomfortable for Fitz, but she decided that it was worth it since this was to keep him safe from S.H.I.E.L.D. With her mind made up she made the first teleport.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n     Ophelia landed in what her memory from when she was an android told her was Rome. It was a very beautiful city, that she hoped she could see again one day. Under her foot Fitz was in a different situation, her teleporting had shaken him around and also heated her feet up a little. This lead sweat starting to seep from her pores and onto him. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    Unaware of her tiny passengers plight, Ophelia readied for the second teleport. She took in the view one last time, then teleported. She ended up in another famous city, she knew to be Paris, her records had called it the city of love. She hoped to come back here one day with her love, Fitz. Under her foot Fitz once again had been shaken up by the teleport, he was beginning to feel quit nauseous . To make things worse Ophelia was starting to sweat more, the salty liquid pouring onto him, and soaking him, and his clothes.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    Ophelia fantasized about her future trip here with Fitz. When she was done she prepared for the last and final teleport. The last teleport took her somewhere she knew it was an apartment meant to be familiar to Fitz. One that would calm him. There was no way S.H.I.E.L.D could track them here. Now that they were safe Ophelia could let Fitz out of her shoe, but first she wanted to have a little fun.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Ok we're safe and sound now, they'll never find us here my love. That means I can take you out of my shoe now, so go ahead and give my feet a goodbye kiss.\" Ophelia spoke down to Fitz. He couldn't believe what he had just heard, she expected him to kiss her foot after what she had just put him through. Knowing she was serious about it, he decided to just bite the bullet and kiss the monstrous toes that had tormented him for the past hour. He could taste the sweaty liquid enter his mouth with his kiss and had to resist throwing up. His giant captor/lover loved this though as he heard her moan and was subjected to yet another one of her toe \"hugs\".With that she took off her boot and removed the tiny Fitz.  She sits him down on a table then sits on the chair at the table.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"That was fun I think we just found your new travel place. I know my toes appreciated the company and the love.\" Ophelia said grinning,and slightly looking off into space, probably fantasizing about future fun ideas for her and Fitz. Fits had a much different reaction to that statement though.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Ophelia do you have any idea how horrible that was for me. I was battered by your toes and trapped as your sweat poured on me. You say you care about me, but your the only one getting anything out of this\"&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    All of a sudden Ophelia's emotions change drastically. Her giddy happiness was replaced with____________.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n1.Anger: She is angry at what he says, she tells him she did all this for them, that he will be with her forever one way or another. She then tells him that if he thinks she's so mean and dosen't care she'll show him. She then proceeds to treat him more like a pet/toy.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n2.Sadness: She breaks down crying not actually taken aback by his outburst. Fitzs will have to try to comfort a giant balling woman experiencing sadness for the first time.</span></div></div>",

I thought you <i>sniff</i> loved me Leopold!' Ophelia sniffled as little streams ran down her cheeks 'It hurts, inside' she whimpers, her hand rubbed just above her heart<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh shit'</i> Fitz thought, he used to have a hard enough time comforting Jemma when she was upset, what was he supposed to do to help a giant woman who was experiencing sadness for the very first time, and so strongly it was as if she had actually been physically injured by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he couldn't do anything from the table he took a number of steps back before running off the edge, jumping at the last second and landing on her knee, which was shaking with her sobs. Slowly he crawled along her leg, till he reached the edge of her shirt, looking up he couldn't see her face past her chest at his size, but he hoped even if she couldn't see him she would hear him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ophelia, Ophelia babe, calm down, I'm sorry I yelled, I was just sore and whoozy from all the bouncing around because of the teleporting. Please stop crying love, everything's fine' Fitz yelled up to her, running his hand along her stomach where he could reach, but she still cried, trying to wipe the rivers of tears which just continued to pour out. 'Damn it, can she even hear me down here? How do I provide comfort for someone so huge?' he wonders as he begins to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Fitz do to attempt to fix things<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. He continues to yell his apologies, promising he'd do whatever she wanted him to do in order to cheer her up<br>\r\n2.

He just had to get up to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew this was going to be difficult, not only because he would only be able to grip with his hands but also because the still crying woman while not noticeable at her size was shaking quite a bit from Fitz smaller perspective. Still it was probably safer than trying to climb the chair so he grabbed handfuls of her blouse and started to pull himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of him was glad her emotions seemed to numb her other senses at the present time, as he was sure she'd have swatted him by now otherwise, particularly when he hopped from her torso to her arm mid climb, as he knew he had no chance scaling her breasts, at least not without Mack or May's skills and endurance. Still he managed to make his way to her shoulder without incident on his part and so he just had to get to her head and things would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all his balance, Fitz shuffled his way from her shoulder to her collarbone/neck, placing his hand gently on the tear tread running along that side of her face, feeling terrible for causing this pain. His touch did get a response though, Ophelia tilts her head in his direction, not quite facing him but making it easier for him awkwardly side step his way to just in front of her lips. Even when she was so broken she still had beauty and her tooth mark imprinted lips were just as perfect to Fitz now as they had been earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he manages to kiss her she lets out a tearful wail and tilts her head back, causing him to lose his balance and fall backwards onto her breasts or more specifically into her cleavage, which had been 'enhanced' when she made the trip from android to human. Fearing for his life and both not trusting his luck to have Ophelia's bra break his fall as well as whether or not she was even wearing one the shrunken scientist flails around in the air until he can find something to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately all he had to grab onto was her breasts, the effect immediate when her crying was replaced with an almost obscene level of moaning, shortly followed by Fitz being crushed between 2 soft mountains as she mashed her breasts around his body. Eventually she finally released him, but nor before calling him '<b>Fitz</b>' enough times he was sure she'd never forget it, then he was finally able to look up see her grinning face peering down at him from the opening of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Leopold' she purred, smiling drunkenly as she batted her eyelashes at him, her pleasure high brain seeing his actions as him...</span></div></div>",

He could only imagine how fucked up her brain was right now, she had just experienced her first orgasm, and judging by the hungry look in her eyes she wanted more. She then plucks him from her breasts and holds him in the palm of her hand in front of her face.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n \"Ophelia I was mearly trying to make you feel better I...\" Fitz started before being cut off. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n \"And you succeeded I feel great, that was exactly what I needed. Perhaps we could do more stuff like that Fitz. You know to make me feel better.\" She said with a sly smile. Fitz was amazed she was already figuring out how to use her female charm to coerce him into pleasing her. He would try to argue with her logic, but then he realized that it was pointless, what was he going to do tell her no, that would go down one of two ways. Either she'd start crying again taking them back to square one, or she would get angry. Niether option looked appealing to Fitz so he made the obvious choice and gave in of course. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Ok Ophelia and what would you like to do exactly?\" As soon as he asked that he saw her eyes light up, she evened moaned a little. Her mind twisted by the influx of new emotions was getting off on the idea that Fitz loved her so much he was willing to go along with her plans. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n  &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n   \"I'm so glad you asked Fitz, I think it's time we took our relationship to the next level. I have memories of such great moments in the framework, but I want to recreate them now that I can feel.\"&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"What do you mean take our relationship to the next level?\" Fitz had a good idea where this was going, and he didn't like it. He was starting to regret playing along and letting her have her fantasies.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"My memory tells me that the next step since you have already played with my breasts would be for us to ingage in sexual intercourse.\" She said giddy. He could tell she had been dreaming of this moment.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Ophelia dear how would that even work we're not the same size\" Fitz says trying to dissuade her. Her face goes into a frown as she hears this, he has a point.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    *inside Ophelias emotion twisted brain*&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"So what can I do he's not the same size as me\" \"I could back to kissing or play with him with my breasts some more.\" \"No I want more\" Ah I have an idea my records show females use a device called a dildo to pleasure themselves in the lower regions. Fitz is about the same size as one of these dildos. Fitz had already proven he's do anything for me, so he will be okay with doing this for me.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    *back in reality only a couple seconds have passed*&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Don't worry Fitz I have an idea\" Ophelia says puring like a cat. Fitz was worried by this, he knew she'd never purposely hurt him, but at this point she may as well have been on drugs. She wasn't in control the emotions were primarily the emotion of pleasure.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Ophelia let's talk about this I ....\" \"Shhhh enough talk Fitz I want to some action\" and with that Ophelia lowered Fitz down to her pants, and lived them and her panties exposing her perfect vagina to him. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Now Fitz I want you to make my first time special for me okay.\" Before Fitz had a chance to argue she put him in and let go of her panties and pants, trapping him inside. For Fitz he had just been lowered into a humid damp environment wet from their earlier antics, and growing wetter by the minute. Directly in front of him was the lower lips of his goddess/captress. Above he heard Ophelia moan, apparently just his presence there was getting her off. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    \"Go on Fitz don't keep me waiting\" She was expecting him to please her down there. The only question is will he. Will he give in and pleasure her or will he refuse to participate in her twisted fantasy anymore.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n1. He pleases her making her very happy.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n2. He refuses to participate, so she takes matters into her own hands and practilly used him as a dildo. She might be angry later that he didn't do what she wanted.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n    &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't worry though I'll make sure you can still breath... for the most part' she grins and Fitz feel his heart drop, even before she begins lowering him to the bed, seeing her other hand spreading her vaginal lips in preparation for his <i>arrival</i>. 'Be sure to kick' was called from above, just before she slid his legs inside her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia moaned loudly as Fitz entered her tight tunnel, stopping at his hips to adjust to the new feeling. Fitz looks up at her, seeing the top of her head, eyes and the tip of her nose over her bust 'Ophelia, please stop this' he pleads but gets nothing helpful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Fitz, you've just not experienced enough, we're going further now' she coos before she grips him by his shoulders and pushes him deep inside, gasping and moaning as Fitz was the perfect sized dick for her pussy. Fitz on the other hand wasn't appreciating it the same way, he was wet, hot and covered in her juices and the only thing keeping him alive was the fact she was holding onto him and her fingers were still spreading herself for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him out to his ribs 'Enjoying things yet Fitz?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! This is wrong Ophelia, you can't just use me how you please'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then you're not trying hard enough, that can be arranged' her fingers gripped his upper torso firmly before pulling him out to his waist and beginning to pump him like a real masturbatory aid, her other hand alternating between squeezing and fondling her above average sized breasts and rubbing her clit, every sound out of the woman being a grunt, moan, gasp or '<b>Fitz</b>' while the guys own noises were unhearable by her own sex idled brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything her brain was telling him, Fitz's penis knew exactly where he was and reacted accordingly, all the rubbing making him painfully hard, not that he would tell Ophelia he was getting off on this, she may get even rougher if she knew. His dick finally reached it's peak along side Ophelia, her orgasm flooding her loins and pushing him out into a cum puddle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You made me come Leopold, just like I said you would' she said matter-of-factly, picking him up and sliding his lower body into her mouth to clean, her advanced senses tasting his own ejaculate in the relative gallons of her own 'And somebody enjoyed it, a lot'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What now Ophelia?' Fitz asked tiredly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm tired and it's time for bed Fitzy, but as you're more a boy toy than boyfriend at the moment Leopold, you will be staying...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere?</span></div></div>",

It didn't stop her noticing Daisy was approaching her quite quickly though it was the fact she was looking straight ahead and seemed to have no intension of stopping that top Jemma she hadn't seen her and was now as AIDA pointed out in danger of being crushed by her currently oblivious friend. A person who had her quaking at the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she didn't have long to see Madame Hydra before she glitched out of the bunker she had a much better view of Daisy and it was awe inspiring, the size and power of this girl made the scientist unexpectedly think of the gods of old, though Thor had nothing on Quake, the things she could do to Jemma at her size and she wouldn't even be able to put up a fight, nor was she sure she'd want to,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese daydreams though required her to be alive in order to experience them, which would have been difficult had one particular step nearly knocked her on her ass, spurring her to move and even the Daisy missed turning her into a crunch like a beetle on her boot by millimetres, which looked much less worrying to Jemma but still had her shuffle away on her rear as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Jem, you said we were to meet up here\" Daisy hisses as she stops then turns and begins to pace this section of the bunker unaware the source of her frustration was about 3 feet away from her at most, though she probably wasn't going to be getting any closer on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma whimpered as the rumble shock her entire body, due to the way Daisy's powers worked when she got upset or stressed she vibrated the very air around her, which has broken windows and fragile objects leading to her pacing only inside solid structures. This also in the real world only had a diameter of 1 foot from her body, leading Jemma to believe either AIDA didn't know this about Daisy's powers, or more likely she increased the radius to intimidate her as well as make things difficult for her, as she didn't know what an intense level of Quake's vibrational energy would do to her smaller form, especially as the highest were closest to Daisy's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then a simpler option came to mind, getting to higher ground. At floor level she was only going to be found if her body made a loud enough crunch under Daisy's boot that she looked to see what bug she stepped on. She needed to get higher where her voice might be heard, or her form more easily noticed by the inhuman's enhanced senses. Which was where the chair came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma ran and practically threw herself onto the chair leg, then began to slowly shimmy up, cursing her lax gym visits since leaving the academy, she really needed to get back in shape, not that she planned much chair climbing in the future [Wait till she finds out things in the FrameWork affect the real world... O_O]. Collapsing onto the seat she lies back and catches her breath, something that was clearly not a problem for Daisy who was still going strong in her pacing and impatient mumblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure that she was up for the challenge Jemma began to scream and shout while jumping up and down and waving her hands \"Daisy, Daisy I'm right here. AIDA shrunk me when I entered the FrameWork, I need your help\" and other such things until she was hoarse and panting 'Fuck, this isn't working is it?' she thinks to herself, though fells a bubble of hope when Daisy finally stops pacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Daisy is just tired of pacing and needs to take a break taking a seat on the nearest chair... and Jemma is pinned under her spacious ass. The tiny woman learns AIDA clearly wanted her to suffer when she doesn't pop like a grape and instead feels her friend's colossal mass bearing down on her puny form, unable to move and slowly being crushed and suffocated<br>\r\n2) Daisy hears odd squeaking sounds and see's something out the corner of her eye. Approaching the chair she see's it to be none other than Jemma all shrunk and adorable, she could just eat her up, or slide her into her bra/panties never to be seen again. But she couldn't do that, could she? This is after all just a virtual world, nothing's real here, right?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't a walk in the park by any means but if they could just get to the elevator they'd be able to make a clean getaway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was probably why AIDA/Madame Hydra/Whatever else she called herself as standing in the open doorway, wearing gloves that looked eirily similar to the ones she used to create the portal and manipulate the VR brain scans. Oddly enough she didn't look angry, instead a strange mix of amused and disappointed, it really freaked her out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'll be taking our leave now' Daisy said raising her hand to blast the android, but she only smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think not' the tips of her gloves were glowing with an orange light, swiping her hand May was flung against the wall, almost going right through it. Despite the shiver it brought down her spine Daisy tried to send her flying but AIDA's hands moved into several odd gestures so that when it did hit her she barely moved back a foot, before the entire shockwave dissipated completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You took my powers!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia laughed 'Oh I can do so much more...' the tips of her thumb and forefinger began to shine brightly '... this place became my world a LONG time ago, in here I am a goddess. You're attempt to take me down was ambitious and actually slightly amusing, but you were nothing more than a pest' as she finishes she brings her hand level with her face and touches the glowing tips together. Instantly a similar orange field surrounds Daisy and she watches in horror as the world expands around her, the now massive Madame Hydra walking slowly towards her, picking her up once the glow stopped as she reached 4 inches tall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You shrunk me! Are you going to kill me now too?' Daisy asks, Jemma saying their connection should sever and reboot if they were 'killed'  in he Framework but she had no proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kill you? No, as I said already you amused me, something that hasn't happened in a while. For that you earned the honour of being my pet, I'm sure there are many ways for you to continue to amuse me at your current size. And when my work in here is complete, you will serve as my pet and my toy back in the other world too' Ophelia grinned widely before placing Daisy in her .... and going to wake up May as well as re-write her memories  before returning to her office to play with her new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did she put Daisy?</span></div></div>",

A part of her did this to remember her friend who she believed perished in the explosion that had wrecked the building several months ago, but another did this because she was feeling like the least useful member of team Arrow, everyone else was a kickass badass, but she was simply the tech who would need to be saved if she was attacked.<br>\r\nSince the incident she'd manage to reconstruct and understand (at least theoretically) almost the entirety of the suits weapons and ability systems, now fiddling with what Ray had said was the most important part of the suit: The miniaturization system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wasn't known at the time was that the shrink and growth systems of the suit were only useable when they were both active and in synch, the explosion was caused because Ray tried to activate the shrink system with the growth system not only inactive but disconnected from the armour. It wouldn't be till much later that he would realise that the coding of the 2 systems stabilise each other and ensure the suit's complete functionality.<br>\r\nThis wasn't something Felicity knew as she continued to examine Ray's armour, accidentally activating the growth programs which caused the suit parts to start to flash and glow. Felicity stepped back, hoping to find a way a way to deactivate the device when the room was bathed in light. <br>\r\nWhen the light faded Felicity rubs her eyes to return focus to them, noticing her glasses were missing but she could still see (due to her still recovering vision being better than they had been without glasses) and she was sitting in the wreckage of (the once more destroyed) Palmer tech completely unharmed (though nude) and as she tried to stand realised what had happened, she had grown due to Ray's A.T.O.M. suit, and the reason she was unharmed when the building was wrecked was because her growth was the cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big is Felicity now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This feeling has changed when she meet Sara, they both shared a true love for each other. But now Sara was gone and came back to Starling city, and althought that Nyssa tried everything, Sara choose to stay. There were only one way left for Nyssa to force Sara to come back. The Forbbiden Power in the Dark Book she received as a gift when she was 10 years old. For her knowledges about magic, and not for her to use in any case. Her father was clear about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even if she could betray him and use the Book for her selfish will, how Sara will react ? Does her feeling for Nyssa will change if she tries to force Sara to stay with her ? Nyssa didn't know, the only thing she knows anyway is that someday she would need to get free from Ras'al Ghul. And the Spell from the Book she was thinking about was the best way to solve all her problems : The Growth Spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa remembered she often tried to imagine how it could be to be a giant when she discovered this part of the book in her childhood. She had some fantaisies about it, and she even asked some questions to Sara last year before their sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Flashback *</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" Sara. Can i ask you a question ? \"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" Sure love. Everything you want. \"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" what would you like to do if you were, a giantess ? \"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" seriously ? Is that your question ? \"</i> Sara laughed before she replied :<i> \" well. I guess, i would protect my friends, my family...and i would keep you all for myself. That's a weird question you know. But i like the idea of a tiny you, so i could put you in some special place i'm sure you would love to be in. And you'll never leave me </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>* end flashback *</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa smiled at this memorie and got her answer. When you love someone, you do everyhing you can to not let her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she just made her decision, Nyssa took the book and left Panda Narbat, making sure on the way that no one saw her. It took her two days to join Starling city, and once she has arrived, she decided to use the Growth Spell, aware of the panick she will create with her new size. It was not a problem as she would be invincible also. It was her last option.</span></div></div>",

Finally in this point in time Sara has come back from her LOT time jumping adventure, Laurel isn't dead [saying this might mean nothing soon enough but new Flash and Arrow haven't reached Ireland yet so as far as I know she's still dead in canon] )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa gasped as she rose from the Pit, smiling slightly as the water's much stronger glow washed over her before removing herself and wrapping up in a robe. She had performed her consummation act, her first as the new Ra's and a ritual all previous ones had also done: First they bathe in the Pit, allowing it's mystical energy to fill them and give them strength beyond any normal human. It was this boost which enabled many Ra's to rein for over a century. The second stage was that a vial of the waters were collected while it was still filled with her life essence and at it's most powerful and made into a powerful augmentation potion, anything the current Ra's desired. In the past there had been many who gained intellect, strength and strange abilities from the potions and elixirs the waters created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystics worked hard to fulfil Nyssa's '<i>unique</i>' request, given her heritage it came to no surprise Nyssa saw herself well above the rest, she had been raised heir to the most powerful man on the planet of course she was, but it was more the form which it took in her mind, she saw herself towering over the lands, staring down at the average human and crushing them like they were an insect. It was an intoxicating fantasy.<br>\r\nBut Nyssa was different that her predecessors, her father most of all, she knew nobody could be Ra's 24/7.She needed and deserved the ability to relax and release the vice like grip she had on control. It was one of the things that she loved about Sara: the girl could give as good as she took and on occasion was able to overpower her and take what she desired from the future Demon, not that Nyssa was helpless she could easily turn the tables, but she didn't want to. She knew she'd be fine and that her beloved wouldn't actually do anything she disapproved off, but it was simply the fact she could relax and let Sara take charge. She blamed the level of control she required on her father own control issues, and knew Sara would use her power over her much better than their previous holder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a month of work but finally it was completed, Nyssa held the deep red potion which would give her, her wish: to be able to alter her size anywhere between 400 ft and 5 inches tall. Her formal ''Ra's the Demon Lord'' robes were one of the few things that were capable of surviving her growth or shrinking down with her, as well as a set of formfitting armour, but she didn't care as they'd do for any serious reasons for her power use and if she was having fun she wouldn't need them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...</span></div></div>",

Plus in her mind it was a lot more fun to walk up to her unaware, grab her from behind and carry her to the nearest bedroom.<br>\r\nShe was still glad she'd chosen 1st class though, and her more relaxed expression showed that as she gave her passport to the security: of the many names she'd used for League business, Nyssa Raatko was the only one she'd never performed anything even potentially illegal with (other than it's existence in the first place), which given she was using her mother's maiden name, the only non-league member she'd ever cared about made sense (Sara doesn't count as she's LOA). It being essentially squeaky clean certainly meant things went by  lot faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a taxi (again, trying to have a normal holiday) she made it to her hotel and checked in, dropping off her belongings before trying to figure out just what to do first now she was actually in Star City<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)She decides to try this whole Hero business who beloved seems to enjoy (though it might more so be all the ass she gets to kick... in which case Nyssa will enjoy it just as much). Finding Team Arrow over run by Ghosts and Darhk, she uses her powers to even the odds as well as shock all but one of the group (she'd mentioned her fantasies and planned ascension gift to Sara before).<br>\r\n2)Nyssa and Sara were in a semi-open relationship: they loved each other with all their heart, but they did allow the other to at least give it a shot with people they aprove of, as apposed to any random chick off the street. Sara's approved list actually included all the females she'd worked with as a hero (practically all the important female characters in Flash, Arrow and LOT, but mainly Felicity, Thea &amp; Caitlyn) with the exceptions of Laurel which Nyssa understood as she wouldn't be confertable with Sara pursuing Talia either. Seeing as this entire vacation as to unwind, Nyssa thought it would be a wonderful chance to properly try out her shrinking abilites with some very beautiful and very willing volunteers, be that just Sara, one of the girls, or a crazy mixture of both.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing as it was late afternoon, Nyssa decided to go out in 'hero-wear' and find Sara and the others, partly because there would be no time to do anything if she didn't. Not really bothering to unpack she just pulled her armour (he usual LOA gear she wears in the show) and slipped out the window, forgoing a bow due to wanting to test out her powers in a real life setting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she found the team it was dark and they were getting to their usual night job: Kicking Ghost ass. Unfortunately tonight they were being overrun by the bastards as well as Darhk being there himself, his magic practically flinging them around. Nyssa frowned, then practically snarled when she saw Sara get thrown through one of the walls, deciding that unlike most League training to fuck subtly and use her power now. Breathing deeply Nyssa felt the energy build inside and her body quickly expanded till she was about 120ft tall. Grinning she stepped into the area very quickly getting the attention of everyone in the area, for once Darhk and Oliver having the same thoughts, mainly <i>'Oh shit' </i>while almost everyone else was silent in shock (Sara more being silent in awe). Darhk finally snaps out of it long enough to order the ghosts to target Nyssa, the brunette smirks before squatting and swinging her arm, sending several of them flying and making the others more worried about attacking her. Darhk sneers in annoyance and tries to use his magic on her, but one of the side effects of all the elixirs is a high resistance to most forms of magic. His distraction caused by focusing so hard on Nyssa meant he wasn't aware of Sara sneaking up behind him, though he did become aware when she cracked him over the head with her Bo staff. Seeing their boss fall, several of the Ghosts panicked, but were captured by Oliver, Laurel, Thea &amp; Diggle before they could get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nyssa'' Sara called up, the others staying far enough away as they were still a little afraid of the giantess, ''Hello beloved, seems you are having some fun'' ''Yeah, just until Darhk showed up then it just got painful'' Sara replied, giving the unconscious bastard an extra kick for good measure ''Well I'm glad I could help'' ''Yeah, thanks for that'' Oliver said sincerely and Nyssa smiled, before noticing Thea was staring at her enormous.... assets. Nyssa catches Sara's eye and flicks her own over to Thea. Sara grins up at Nyssa before giving the red archer a slight shove in her direction, Thea gulped in fear as the new Demon picked her up and brought her to her face ''I'm about to die, aren't I?'' she asked rhetorically, causing Nyssa to laugh before using a nail to remove her mask and let it tumble to the ground ''No darling, at least not anytime soon'' she says with a grin before dropping her down the front of her armour, catching the younger archer between her breasts. It wasn't long after that the police arrived, Lance as usual at the front, though even he had to stop and do a double take when he saw Darhk, several Ghosts, the vigilantes, and finally the giantess Nyssa. Worried for the health/heart of her beloved's father, Nyssa decided it was best to return to a reasonable height, quickly shrinking down to 5ft 5(Can't find actress's height, but presumed now she has the power, she'd like to be taller than her lover)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Damn another meta-human, well at least you got this bastard'' Lance said before like his daughter giving the blond a kick, when Nyssa gave him a confused look he answered ''He's been threatening my girls since he showed how much of a bastard he is'' Nyssa nods in understanding. ''Detective, we'll require some cuffs from you'' Oliver said to him, Lance just looks at him ''Darhk has powerful magic, his very touch seems to cause damage to people. Might as well let the people fully covered to do it.'' Sara answered, Oliver and Nyssa nodding in agreement ''Fine'' Lance sighed, before handing her the cuffs, which she immediately used to secure him while the Ghosts were taken away by the other officers. ''Detective, I am aware many people have managed to escape justice through exploiting the corruption inherent in this city, I need you to understand this can't happen with this man. You have to make sure this is done right, or else I will kill him myself for being an enemy of the League and more importantly for harming my beloved'' Nyssa whispers to him, the man paling slightly but he understood, part of him wanted to kill the man for everything he's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith things quieting down Nyssa slid over to Sara, the blond smiles feeling her lover pressed against her ''Just the armour?'' Sara asks in amusement ''It's the only thing that changes with me, well besides 'passengers' of course'' Nyssa answers with a wink watching Sara's pupil's dilate with distinct amusement ''You, me, the lair now!'' she growls shuffling the raven haired woman towards her motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...</span></div></div>",

Metahumans were already something difficult to live with, but being aware of aliens like dominators or even Supergirl was something he just couldn't accept deeply inside him. Of course after the last events, he trusted her somehow...<br>\r\nBut Oliver often wondered what he could possibly do to stop her if Kara was a vilain and decided to destroy his Earth. Absolutely nothing. That day when the legends were mind controlled by the Dominator, only Barry who was a meta human was able to do something to trick her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's pride was in pain and he needed to be stronger without becoming a metahuman or something, he just didn't know how. He had a lot of argues with diggle, felicity and the other as he decided to fight alone since now. The team got separated, except Felicity who was too much stubborn and wanted to keep an eye on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis night, Oliver as the Arrow was tracking Chien Na Wei from the former Triad. He knew her very well, and thought he stopped her several times, she always found a way to come back.This time he'll have to do things differently. Oliver sat in a roof corner at the Dock, where a business with Chien is about to happen. She was already here, standing near her car with several man by her side, nothing Oliver should worry about. She was waiting for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Felicity do you hear me ?\" Oliver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ooooh so, you need my help now ? I thought you told me 'if you wanna stay, fine but don't help ' \" Felicity replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. See you later \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAIT !! Ok i'll never understand you. Not that i ever did, but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I couldn't find out who is the one Chien will meet tonight, and how many they will be to fight \" Oliver cut her off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a second. I hope there will be enought guys to make you consider you'll need your team back ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver ignored her sarcasm. Felicity was...Felicity and he got used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver you hear me ?! Get out of there i suspect it's a trap ! She doesn't have any meeting with anyone !! \" Felicity said, while Oliver jumped from the roof  to start a fight with Chien's mens.  \"and of course...he goes right into it...\" Felicity commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the Arrow ! Put him down ! \" Chien yelled at her men who rushed to Oliver without any guns. Many other men came ouf from other hiding places, which prevented Oliver to focus on Chien. It took more times than expected to get rid of them all, but when Oliver finally punche the last guy, he felt something on his neck. A kind of sting and he fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's my gift for you. I owe you that\" Chien said. Everything became blur for Oliver before he fainted. Once he openned his eyes, only 2min had past. Things were clear now, but couldn't believe what he was seeing. Chien Na Wei was standing, calling someone on her phone but...she was big !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hell had just happenned ?!\" Oliver panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes i want you more of this now that we know it works. Oh i'll call you back he's awake\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver aimed his arrow to the now giant chinese woman who smirked at him. \" it's useless. You have been shrunk. What could you do possibly do now ? \" She said, reminding Oliver how he felt about meta humans and mainly Supergirl, or any other aliens with God' powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next ?</span></div></div>",

But she was too hight for the arrow to reach it and fell down before her face level. The giant woman wanted to enjoy the whole situation, but she also didn't want to somehow loose her unique chance to killl the Vigilante once and for all. \" i suppose it's time for you to die like a bug beneath my heel\" she just said while raising her shoes over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No way !! \" Oliver yelled in anger. He was not going to die like this ! He took an explosive arrow and...something unexpected happenned as the woman was brutally pushed several feet away (from normal perspective) from another personn who suddenly appeared. Oliver didn't need to look up as he recognized the giant red boot standing next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I tried to hold back, i think she's not dead\". Supergirl said then she looked down at the tiny figure who was Oliver. \" i think the two words you are looking for are 'thank you' \" she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver put back his explosive arrow in his case and started to walk toward Star City.  \"Okayyyyy....Where are you going with your size ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Find a way to fix my size. Felicity will call Ray palmer and he will probably find something. You can go home, thanks for your help\"  Oliver answered without a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on it will take you forever. I'm normal sized and i can fly. Is it so difficult to ask for help ?\" Kara put a step ahead to catch up a tiny Oliver who finally stopped walking to look up at the giant blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if you bring me back to Felicity, then you promise me you go back to your Earth ? \" Oliver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara raised her right hand and replied \" I swear ! Now shall we go ? \".  She bent down and placed or openned palm in front of the tiny heroe. Oliver didn't like that but he walked into the giant kryptonian hand and sat down while Kara brought him to her face level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If i didn't know you, i would say you have a BIG problem with women.\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not with women. Only with people with God's powers like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That doesn't explain why you like Barry and not me.Well let''s go.\" Kara gently closed her hand before Oliver could answer, and flight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my....Oliver get shrunk ?!\"  Felicity was shocked to see her ex-boyfriend dizzy in Kara's palm who put him in the desk.<br>\r\n\"How did it happen ?! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chien Na Wei had a sample of a shrinking virus or something. Another crazy thing that should not exist in our world anyway, but i know she is planning to get more. She was calling someone on the phone for that.\" Oliver explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara did you bring the phone with you ? \" Felicity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" In fact...it's broken. I tried to hold back when i saved Oliver, but i still had too much strenght in my fist so when she fell on the ground, it broke the phone on the way.\" Kara admitted a bit ashamed, to Oliver's satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's ok, we'll use another way and we'll stop them.\" Felicity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ?\" Oliver asked. Felicity glared at him as she approached the tiny guy. \" Listen to me. Nothing would have happenned if Diggle, Sara, Laurel, and Thea were with you ! So now, we'll fix your mess and you have no word to say to a woman of my size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver looked up at Felicity's full height, she looked creepy but she was right, for now Oliver couldn't say a thing. So he changed the subject while turning back to Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok now i think it's time for you Kara to go back in your world.

And how's that possible ? \" Oliver asked not sure to know where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's not possible. But you are free to try anytime you want.\" She laughed at him. Oliver knew how insignificant he was to this giant kryptonian, but she shouldn't underestimate him. That's what he was thinking on the moment at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and by the way my adoptive sister from the DEO has a list of criminal aliens in National city to stop, so if you wanna help...\"  Kara added sounding sarcastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing ? Is that your goal to humiliate me ? You know i can do nothing with my current size ! \" Ollie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No i'm just treating you for what you are, just like you did it to me. I'm just an alien and you're just a tiny little hero \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you know it's more complicate...\" Olliver started when the girl of steel changed her clothes back to be Kara Danvers and took her phone to call her sister, ignoring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis i'm back and i brought a little friend at home, so don't be shocked if you see him when you'll come back, see you !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Oliver, she said : \"i have to go to Catco for a while, Alex will probably come to check what i was talking about, i suggest you to try to be nice with her. She may just be a big human for you, but she's a great fighter and can get mad easily.\"<br>\r\nKara then rushed to the door ready to go \" Oh by the way she doesn't like the Green Arrow.

Then he noticed something useful: Kara had left her phone on the kitchen counter in her rush to head into CatCo, that could give him some insight into Kara's life, maybe find some weakness to exploit or a way to get her to send him home sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiring a grapple arrow he managed to get himself up onto the counter easily enough, then stepped up over to the phone and unlocking it, finding a messenger chat still open, having been done in the last half hour. Wondering if like Thea he'd learn anything about Kara outside of Supergirl he decided to read it, hoping it wasn't just her sexting her boy/girl/in-comprehendible gender friend. It wasn't... for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>KD: Hey guys do you know anything about shrinking people?</b><br>\r\n<u>AZ: I don't need to know about your weird sex plans Little One</u><br>\r\n<i>LL: Kara, I need context to these things</i><br>\r\n<b>KD: Geez Astra, I wouldn't be asking you if that was the case. Both of you, I was on Earth 1 and one of the other heroes got shrunk. The people over there do have some experience with it but it's usually the dwarf star/nanobots thing one of them actually uses for his heroing so it may take a while. The problem is he's kind of a deush and doesn't know how to take a break so I brought him over to our world where he won't do anything stupid like try take on his enemies at tiny size.</b><br>\r\n<i>LL: Oh, well the concept of miniaturisation involving quantum compression is something in the L-Corp R&amp;D archives, I could have it sent up and we could see if there's anything useful there</i><br>\r\n<u>AZ: Well there is that miniature city in the FOS, maybe there's something on the computer about how that was created which could help with the problem, plus there's Kalax.</u><br>\r\n<b>KD: Oh it's great to see my 2 favourite people working together, now we just need you to actually meet</b><br>\r\n<u>AZ: Might be best to wait for Al to be awakened from stasis first, I think she'd want to do the 'hurt my daughter I launch you into space' talk even though I know I'd have fun doing it.</u><br>\r\n<i>LL: Alex got there first</i><br>\r\n<b>KD: Why is my fam crazy?</b><br>\r\n<u>AZ: Do you really want that question answered Kiera?</u><br>\r\n<b>KD: O_O HI Ms Grant, how much did you see?</b><br>\r\n<u>AZ: All of it<br>\r\nAZ: I have retrieved my coms, all is well</u><br>\r\n<i>LL: One of these days I'll understand aliens, but it is not today</i><br>\r\n<b>KD: What about me?</b><br>\r\n<i>LL:I don't need to understand you to love you Kara</i><br>\r\n<u>AZ: Gag me</u><br>\r\n<b>KD: Astra, Cat, whoever it is....

Plus other than the one or two every obvious moments of alien-ness it didn't feel like anything he wouldn't see if Felicity was IMing Cisco and Ray about a tech issue, in fact now he thought about it she probably did have a similar conversation with the relevant techies of their respective teams about him getting shrunk. It was a moment where she felt more 'human', probably because he didn't have to see her in her super suit, flying or throwing trucks like bowling balls so he could push that information to the back of his mind. Also the potential sex thing only worried him slightly rather than traumatised him, mainly due to Kara not actually being his sister, though without her being right there he could see some of her in the determined, courageous, bull headed <i>'Girl of Steel'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he didn't get what he got up here to retrieve he did learn work was being done in both universes to try get him fixed, which was some 'small' comfort for the tiny vigilante. Now he just had to avoid the trigger happy, overprotective older sister (A position he on some level sympathised with, imagining that even if she wasn't some kind of party girl keeping Kara out of trouble was probably even harder than doing the same for Thea)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one downside to his size and his attempt at information gathering is he put himself out in the open and only realised he was about to receive company when he hears someone...</span></div></div>",

She was a tall brunette with the exception of a snow white streak, dressed in a black super suit similar in fit to Kara's, thought with a stylized 'Z' on her chest 'Hm, wonder where she would be, oh you must be her 'little' problem eh?' the alien reached the counter in a blur of speed, causing Oliver to fall back in surprise 'Hello, I'm Astra, Kara never gave us a name, so you are?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'O-Oliver Queen' Oliver introduced, wincing when her heard the stutter but who could blame him, from what he'd heard Kara had been saying pretty bad and unfortunately mostly accurate things about him, and this one could crush him when he was normal size, she could probably atomize him at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Mr. Queen, Astra In-Ze, last member of House Ze. I've heard you're a hero on your earth, and that you were kind of a dick to my niece' she replied and Oliver thought <i>'yep I'm fucked'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My only defence is my world had just been invaded by aliens and she was a complete unknown, I didn't know if I could trust her to keep my people safe. Also I'm not purposefully a dick, but it does come up in conversation every now and again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're slow to trust, and the middle of a fight isn't the best time to let loose an untested weapon. Makes sense'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Especially when her being mind controlled mean that if Barry hadn't lead her into crashing through the control device we'd have been melted by her heat vison and then the earth conquered'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra blinked 'Wait Kara never said anything about mind control, she tried to kill all her new friends?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, just me and Barry, the others had also been mind controlled at the time'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's even worse, Barry was already her friend and she tried to kill him. I'm surprised there wasn't a Dominator body count, with how mad she should be.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe there were, they were all over the planet so just because I didn't see any doesn't mean there weren't. Also if it's not too much of an ask, why are you here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Simple, after Kara finished out chat and I managed to canoodle Lena's number out of Cat I gave her a call and we realised that our work would be best done with you around to compare against all that we know, well mostly Lena she's the science one, I just hit things. So I came over to grab Kara and you, then hopefully if she's not too busy with CEO things we could get straight to work. But Kara's not here, so I guess I'm just grabbing you and leaving which by the way is very stupid thing for Kara to do'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um not that I'm going to miss not meeting the potentially crazy bitch but Kara said her sister would be over at some point, and to be on my best behaviour because she hates me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All the more reason to leave now before more people find out I'm not dead'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver blinked 'Wait what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dead tiny man, I got stabbed with a kryptonite machete, it's a miracle I survived at all. Kara was very helpful in getting me out of the DEO and my beloved was very good at keeping me off their radars'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, but what does that have to do with leaving right this minute?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra sighs and her eyes glow, but not the colour Kara's went before she used heat vision, more a silvery blue colour 'Alex isn't anywhere within a city block of this apartment so right this minute is unnecessary. To answer your actual question, we're trying to keep my continued existence on the down low'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But why hide it from Alex?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, because she's kind of the one who <i>'killed</i>' me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver felt a strange heat rumble within him, a feeling which needed to be let out quickly <b>'THAT HYPOCRITE</b>! She hates me because I've killed  but all the bad guys that died because of me deserved it and were unrepentant monsters, I would never hurt someone who was in any way important to my friends or family. Hell I do this to the detriment of my heroing, the world would be a better place without a Malcolm Merlyn but I can't kill my sister's biological father, but she kills the aunt of the girl she seems to care so much about? Fuck this' he rants and raves before sighing and plopping to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well that was the most impassioned defence I've ever heard, and I've heard Kara defend me' Astra comments with a smile, which Oliver returned awkwardly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry about that, it's just all I've heard about Alex is how she hates me for being dick to Kara and because I used to kill when needed. I guess I just sort of snapped hearing she has also killed'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not only that tiny man, she's an agent with a gun, she's killed quite a few times'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then why the fuck does she hate me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra laughs humourlessly 'She's human, raised on the virtues Superman and to a lesser extent Batman, 2 'thou shall not kill' heroes and assumes that means it's the only way to be a hero. She thinks you'll corrupt her sister, show her killing isn't always wrong, show he she isn't a terrible person for what she did to Non, what she wants to do to Lillian. It's another good reason we keep my survival a secret, she knows I'm a solider, a general, I know you can't always win with kid gloves on and nether her nor the Martian want Kara to realised that's an option' the elder Kryptonian explains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Does she know it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course she does, she just doesn't say anything because she knows if she does they'll think she's been Red K'd again and zap her'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Sigh.</i> You know it's weird how well this conversation is going, especially given...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That I'm an alien and you wouldn't even be a snack with my enhanced metabolism?' Astra offered with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sort of, but I don't see myself as anti alien or anything even thought as far as I know we don't have any on our earth, but this feels very different to when I speak to Kara, more normal somehow'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably because when Kara is Supergirl she's a being with the powers of a God wrapped in the enthusiasm of a 4 year old?' Astra suggests with a shrug, Oliver actually laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've just described all my problems with Supergirl in one sentence. All that power and pretty much no strategy, Just run in and hit it till it goes down'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra sighs 'She tries she really does try to use that genius level Kryptonian brain she has but I think it's been melted with all the time on earth. I'm not even the smart twin and I know y'all mother fuckers need science' Astra sat down, running her hand along her streak when she see's Oliver's confused and actually amused expression on his face 'What? When Kara and Cat aren't around all I can do is watch TV. Makes me glad Cat is on vacation, you don't know how much you missed your mate till you get her and don't see her for even a few days. I really don't know how Kara deals.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um mates?' Oliver asked, seeing as he wasn't going to be killed any time soon and his anger was vented his curiosity revealed itself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes mates, you humans call them soulmates. It's to do with the way Kryptonian's are made, we have a being we're meant to be with somewhere in the galaxy, once we find them nothing else really appeals to us, not like them. Humans on the other hand you seem to be able to bond with everything and anything, multiples somethings even. Makes me wonder how the bond would react if I managed to convince Cat or Lena got curious and decided to what's the earth expression 'mini eh trois' with Kara and a certain little one. But that's all speculation, the bond may have the same effect on them as us, you'd be a meh on their radar next to a supernova of awesome. Sorry more Kara-isms' Astra smiled before picking up the tiny Arrow 'Welp Lena's awaits' she slowly hovered off the floor before flying stealthily out the window without disturbing anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

But now, as he was laying on his bed,he could feel the Mirakuru throught every part of his body, doing something to him. He didn't know what, maybe he would turn into a kind of monster or something...All he knew was that it was not something good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, his body began to shake and all he could see was his room becoming bigger, althought that his sight was blur. He closed his eyes, expecting to die or at least to not have any conscious anymore, but suddenly it stopped. Roy didn't feel any change, the strenght of the Mirakuru was still in him, but beside it, everything seemed normal. That's what he thought at least, because when he openned his eyes, he realize that he just got shrunk to about 3 inches tall !<br>\r\nThe bed he was laying in seemed now as big as a whole stadium, and Roy quickly started to panick...what if he will shrink again...and again for the rest of his life ? He had no time to waste and had to find a cure by his own. He won't ask any help from anyone, Roy wanted to do this alone, taking advantage of his size and his strenght..althought that he didn't know yet if his new size has affected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy decided to punch something to check, when someone knocked at the door saying : <i>\" Roy i know you're there ! If you don't open that door i will come in ! \"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

Thea replied as she felt her tiny boyfriend moving in her bra as if he wanted to come out to show himself, so Thea put her hand on her chest to prevent him to do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" Yeah but it's more complicated as i said because of the other effects. Sorry, i can't tell you more about this. Everything related to the Arrow has to remain secret, so i'm asking you to not say anything about it to anyone\"</i> Sara said as she wondering why Thea was holding her chest like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sure.\" Thea replied. And with some last words, Sarah left the Mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Thea joined her room, she removed the tiny Roy from her bra, and opened the drawer of her desk to place him in it. <i>\" Sooo..it seems your best friend had been shrunk too.\"</i> she said with a satisfied look on her face. \" You really don't like the Arrow don't you ? I have told you, it was my choice to work with him.\".  \"let's don't argu e about that. Beside, he once hurt my mother. \". Thea replied putting an end to the conversation about the Arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" And why didn't you show me  to Sarah ?. Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Because i want you to stay with me until Queen Consolidated find a cure for you. I care about you Roy, and i know you care about me too. But it seems that if i don't take the lead of our relationship, you'll always find a stupid reason to leave me. Don't worry, i'll make sure you'll have fun with me, more than your job with the Arrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy knew she made a good point. He loved Thea althought they were both so different. But at the same time he didn't like to feel so helpless, or either to be ruled by a giant possessive girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I give you time to think while i'm going to see my mother in the living room \".

Roy asked from her bra ''Of course, but Nyssa looks about ready to take Sara on the desk right here and if Ollie interrupts her fun I think she'd probably kill everyone in the room, minus Sara of course and I don't want to die just because Oliver touched Sara's tits'' Thea explained as she slowly tiptoed to the doorway ''Oh, that makes sense, let's go then'' ''You got it little man, maybe we can find somewhere private ourselves'' Thea grinned and Roy was unsure whether to be worried or optimistic, he was already aroused though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo?</span></div></div>",

When his surroundings became much lighter he knew Nyssa had removed her pants and there was not much longer before she would find him. What was surprising was when a strong pressure hit him, pushing him into the hungry lips of Sara's pussy as it passed along. Oliver had considered when he first dropped in to climb inside Sara and wait it out, but didn't because he knew whatever punishment Nyssa would use on him for being in Sara's cleavage (and now panties) would be nothing compared to what she would do if he was discover inside her lover by the tongue or those long fingers of hers. He was sure the moment Sara's panties were removed Nyssa would kill him, seeing him tiny and trapped by her vaginal lips, where only the Demon's Heir should be allowed to touch, but he wasn't, his saving grace seemed to be how much Nyssa was savouring the moment, gnawing on the drenched fabric as she pulled it down the other woman's legs with her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the taster out of the way Nyssa began to remove the last article of clothing from her beloved, catching the hem between her teeth, her eyes rolled back as her mouth filled with Sara's essence, before slowly pulling the sodden fabric down her lover's long legs, knowing the blond wouldn't appreciate the teasing but believing it to be worth it for staying away from her for so long.

Nyssa said with annoyance in her tone. Oliver then started to realize how humiliating this experience will be for him, and tried to struggle to get free from Nyssa's hand, thought that his efforts were too weak to be noticed by her. The only reaction she had was to stand up and to walk toward her shoes. She took one, and dropped Oliver in it. <i>\" try to get used to this place while i'm going to dress up.\"</i>. She then left in there to prepare herself. Oliver didn't waste time and decided to climb up to the entrance, althought that sadly it was a boot so he had a long way to do to get out. Thanks to his skills as the Arrow, it took him less than 2 min to reach the edge of the boot entrance, but unfortunately, Nyssa was already back, wearing her assassin's clothes, and was not suprised to see his attempt to escape his fate. So she bent down and used her finger to push him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" the next time i'm putting you somewhere, you d'better stay if you know what's good for you\"</i> she warned Oliver with a cold tone. She then slide her barefoot inside, trapping Oliver under the arch. Oliver winced at this situation, as he was now forced to smell the strong scent of a giant Assassin. She then took some weapons with her, and left the room. Oliver didn't feel comfortable as Nyssa started to walk so he decided to move, something she didn't seem to appreciate as she suddenly raised her foot to slam it down with enought strenght to knock him. <i>\" STOP trying to move !!\"</i> she yelled at him with anger. <i>\"Damn, she places there against my will and now i should not complain ?!\"</i> Oliver said to himself. The thought that he even didn't deserve this, made things worst for him to accept his predicament. He was wondering for how long he will have to endure Nyssa's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to go now ?</span></div></div>",

Still she needed to check on Thea, as well as get away from Nyssa for at least a little while so she needed to find someone to direct her to the currently only likeable Queen she knew. Luckily the fact she'd referred to Thea as <i>Nyssa's guest</i> appeared to have spread throughout the complex before they'd even arrived, so a room had been prepared and the brunette had been directed there the moment she had left them. Sara didn't need to ask where she had to go, the facility wasn't exactly designed to facilitate non league members, so there were only 2 guest areas, which she hoped would only be occupied by Thea and not herself, though she knew Nyssa craved her touch even more than she did her... though the league did have at least 7 different paralytic agents, including one that allowed the victim to retain feeling but unable to move any voluntary muscles other than their eyes. Nyssa had jokingly referred to it when explaining it to her as the ''Doll maker''.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her mind from the potential end to her evening Sara shook her head and continued on her way to Thea's temporary quarters, pushing the door open and wishing she'd at least knocked; Thea was lying topless on the bed, Roy standing between the girls breasts rubbing them beautifully, if the brunette's groans were anything to go on. When her door was open, Thea turned her head, her eyes bulging before she shoots upright and tugs her shirt back over her breasts, Roy getting flung off her chest onto her lap ''Sara!'' Thea yelped in annoyance and embarrassment, the blond having turned herself around as she'd closed the door ''Sorry Thea'' she muttered ''What are you even here? Shouldn't you still be busy getting fucked into a coma by Nyssa?'' she asked, the loud groan telling her it was the wrong thing to ask ''Oh I was so close to a wonderful night, Nyssa's tongue was like an inch away but nope, your brother fucked things up like he usually does'' Sara complained, flopping onto the bed after Thea sat properly to accommodate her ''So do I even want to know what Ollie did?'' Thea asked, worried she really didn't want to know ''I left him in my bra, where I was sure he'd not do any damage, but the idiot decided to try escape, which eh couldn't even that properly. Nyssa found him... in my panties'' Sara sighed, as Thea turned a little green ''Oh Sara'' ''It's fine, Ollie took the blame for me'' ''You mean you tossed him under the bus'' Thea laughed at her rhetorical question ''Yeah. It kind of worked though so everything's fine... ish. But still I came here to check on you, and apparently ruined your moment too so sorry about that'' Thea waves her off ''It's fine, things were just heating up we'll probably get to it once you go'' Roy nodded in agreement, they had actually spent most of their time talking and probably only the last 5-10 minutes with the light petting/fondling ''Oh, well I'd better let you get back to it and see if I've been relegated to the couch or not. By the way Thea, Nyssa will be testing your potential in the morning, good luck'' she winked as she exited the room, hoping Nyssa was at least calm enough after whatever she's done to Oliver to be in a talkative mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her love no longer in their room she headed toward the only other place she'd be, the training quarters. She was right as when she reached the chambers Nyssa was fighting 7 league members and kicking their asses with her usual grace and skill, though Sara noticed Nyssa bounced around a lot more than she usually did. ''Hello beloved'' she says as she takes down her last opponent, a crooked grin on her face as she practically skipped over, even when she reached the blond she seemed to refuse to stay still ''Um do you need to pee or something?'' Sara asked awkwardly, causing Nyssa to tilt her head in confusion, her twisted grin still present ''Why would you think that beloved? I'm merely getting the most out of my time allocated to punished your defiler'' Sara rolled her eyes ''Speaking of which, where is Oliver?'' now it was Nyssa's turn to roll her eyes as she turned and kicked Sara catching her by the heel with an understandable look of shock and anger ''The Hell Nys, I know you're angry with me...'' ''You asked how Mr  Queen was doing, I decided to give him to you as much as his circumstances allowed'' the message sunk in ''He's in your boot! Can he even survive that?'' Nyssa snorted ''Of course beloved, the Mirakuru is a crude instrument compared to what the League is capable of'' Sara's eyes widened significantly ''The league as shrinking serums?'' ''Of course, it makes the job and the escape easier if the target or yourself respectively could be shrunken to a more manageable size. Oliver is lucky the Mirakuru more closely resembles the member variant or else he'd resemble my last job, a bloody smear all over my sole. Oh but it was glorious to feel him squish against my foot'' Sara was only half paying attention to the assassin's rambling, still processing the fact they have shrinking potions apparently readily available '' I-I-I-I...'' Nyssa pressed her finger to the blond's lips ''Yes love I've considered using it on you, both for bedroom reasons and during times when you irritate me, but I'm waiting till your, what the phrase... too big for you boots?'' Nyssa grinned and nuzzled into the crook of her neck, Sara having dropped her foot when she first mentioned the shrinking potions.<br>\r\nSo, what now?</span></div></div>",

Sara looked down at her stone cold assassin's loving treatment of her foot, her focus drowning out any protests Oliver was giving, watching the dark haired woman place the boot beside her own, then run her long fingers gently along her arch and ankle, a smile appeared on the blond's face when she felt the kiss that was placed on one of her small toes ''You know I wonder if I should be putting you at my feet instead of Oliver, I hear the league has some kind of shrinking potion around here somewhere'' she grinned as Nyssa rolled her eyes ''Thank you beloved but if I were to be shrunk I'd much more prefer to be imprisoned between you breasts, or...'' she smirks as she reaches up and cups Sara through her pants ''... under your gushing waterfall.

This isn't right, you can't just use me as a pawn to escape all the blame for not talking to your girlfriend'' ''But I can, so bu-bye'' Sara grinned as she dropped Oliver into the boot, before once again requiring Nyssa's assistance this time getting the boot on, the tight leather while a pain to put on and remove was brilliant in this moment as she felt any movement Oliver made while under her sole <i>''Well this wasn't how I thought this would turn out but I'm sure this could be described as being a plaything'' </i>Sara thought as Nyssa finished tugging the boot on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So I rather like you in this position, think you could stay a while?''

Sara yelped ''I'm having fun my love'' she replies ''I can see that but if I'm 'punishing' Ollie, shouldn't' my feet be on the ground?'' the blond asked before being unceremoniously plopped back onto her feet, and  getting a chest full of flying Nyssa who's leg's lock around the blond's hips and head rests on top her still mostly exposed breasts ''This is much better beloved, you really are a genius at times'' Nyssa says before nuzzling into Sara's cleavage, the blond fighting to stay standing ''Come on beloved, I'm aware your legs will only hold out so long'' Nyssa comments as she comes up fro air and a kiss, which spurs Sara on to make her way back to their room as fast as she possibly could (most likely making Oliver's hatred of them both increase almost exponentially)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what next?<br>\r\n1)Nyssa and Sara spar in the privacy of their own room, and if the rather painful beat down is anything to go by, this is <b>HER</b> punishment from Nyssa for keeping secrets that lead to what could be considered accidental cheating<br>\r\n2)Sara sits Nyssa down and actually explains what she was planning, how she wanted to make Oliver the couple's plaything, either until the cure was discovered, or even afterward if they decided they liked having him serve their purposes.</span></div></div>",

The shock was hard, and it took time for Sara to realize that the computers were all broken. Gideon couldn't help her anymore, and there was no way she could make the time ship fly again. \" Oh damn it...Well, let's hope i only get back in Star City.\" Sara said, not truly believe she could be so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left the ship, the world seemed familiar to her, yes...but it was huge ! The Time Ship was posed on the corner of a pavement, thanks god there were not some giant people walking around right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...so i got shrunk.

They were 4 inches at the most, and luckily there were all alone as even with their skills they would most likely be easily overpowered and reduced to playthings by any normal sized human, never mind a meta or alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shrugs 'Cisco's device must have malfunctioned, or else I pushed the wrong button then you ahem, distracted me, and we ended up in a Land of the Giants version of whatever city this is...' the device on her wrist, (handheld time-drive analyser like the one that determines where the Waverider was in Space/Time) answered those questions for her 'National City, that's where Surpergirl came from' Sara tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So if we find her we're good?'

I'm glad i've saved you but that was not my first purpose ! \" Nyssa replied with kind of anger in her tone.  \" Oh come on, you are too possessive sometimes ! just admit it, this..\"giant\" woman is really sexy !. \" the two woman began to argues, as Lena Luthor was talking on the phone. It took her a short time before her eyes catches the two little things on her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Guess what, i'll call you later \" Lena said and hung up the phone. Sara and Nyssa were now having a deep kiss, which was always their way to end a fight. They didn't realize on the moment that the giant woman was standing right behind them, so Lena had to let them know about her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" huuum ! What do you think you two are doing in my office ? and who are you ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa and Sara looked up at the giantess. Nyssa couldn't deny how beautiful she was, but still, Sara was hers and only hers. The blonde was the first to introduce herself : \" Sorry, i'm Sara we came here by accident, we're not from this world. \" She said while putting a knee on the ground, which annoyed Nyssa but made Lena smiled. After all she was a giant for them. Her eyes then looked at Nyssa.  \" My name is Nyssa, Daughter of Ra's al Ghul, Heir of the Demon. \". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see. \" the giantess replied, obviously disappointed to not having Nyssa bend the knee like Sara. \" I'm Lena Luthor, i don't know why you two appeared in my office and i suppose you don't know it either, but you should be glad i haven't decide to just step on you after seeing you both having your fun right in front of me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Nyssa to groan. Never in her life she would think to be powerless against a random woman, and threatenned to be stepped on just like a bug. \" So will you help us Lena ? At last for our size ? \" Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmmmm...i surely can. But it might take a long time to create a device to grow you back. You should stay with me on the meantime \" Lena replied with a smirk. She then leaned to pick them up in one fist, and lifted them to her face. Nyssa and Sara were facing each other in Lena's hand, which was arousing for the both of them to be forced by a sexy woman to be so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You know, i also have taste for women. But when they are cute and so small like you, this is difficult for me to resist....\" Lena said as she....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now her work was done and she had made it back to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down she first removed Sara and then Nyssa, depositing both down beside her hip, Nyssa once free of Lena's grip immediately pounced on Sara capturing her lips in  her own for a moment before frowning, tasting almost nothing but Lena on her beloved she dives further her tongue practically massaging the blond's tonsils but still Sara's scent and taste was mingled heavily with Lena's.

Still this didn't stop either of them from trying to get away as Lena slid them up to their necks in her cleavage, the ravenette groans as her sensitive bust is attacked by tiny, sexy, wriggling ladies 'See you later darlings, we can have more fun this evening' she teases as she kisses her finger and uses it to properly bury them and hide them in her tits.

Things were heating up and not just because Nyssa was now massaging her tongue with her own, she could smell it, getting stronger with each breath their giantess took, every bounce of her hill like breasts. It gave Sara a burst of pride to think this goddess of a woman, who played with them like toys and brought them both to stunning orgasms, was just as turned on as they were, that someone small enough to fit in her hand could bring so much pleasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stop thinking so hard beloved, or else I might worry that bitch has stolen you away from me' Nyssa grumbles as she nips at Sara's ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nys you know you enjoyed it just as much as I did, you hate your power and title, Lena ignored all that you are and made you a plaything in moments.

A little adjusting later and she had 2 little playthings for later, she just had to make it through the rest of the work day (oh joy)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa was conflicted: on the one hand she was separated from her beloved and this giantess was able to lay claim to her (as well as herself), but on the other hand BOOBIES! and by that she means she thought Sara's were big, Lena's were larger than their entire body, possibly both assassin's combined would be less mass than a single tit. It also gave her a strange heat deep inside her when this woman could so effortlessly control the Demon's Head as she does, groaning against the raven haired woman's nipple as it rubs against her abs. She moans as she inhales Lena's scent, sweet like Sara's but much more intense and arousing due to their size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara on the other hand was happy: she got to indulge herself in a rarely satisfied fetish of hers thanks to the sexy giantess, and she hoped Lena's casual dominate personality would unlock a little bit of a submissive side to her stubborn wife, the current Ra's was difficult to top, usually requiring Sara to take her out in a spar and quickly straddle her in order to do so, not so much fun when the previous action tires her immensely to achieve.

She was restraining her self from touching her soaked core in the office, mostly because if she did she wouldn't be far from simple shoving one of her playthings deep inside to explore her depths. Better to hold off on her lust til she was somewhere more private, those 2 were in for a wild night once she got back to her apartment, if they did good she might just <i>keep them</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what next?</span></div></div>",

Zari asks in surprise, not expecting it to be that easy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, we've dealt with a lot of weird shit in the past and future, why not a timeloop, besides the Waverider has all sorts of bell a whistles I don't know about maybe it has a reset protocol in case of it's destruction. Don't know why the size carried over though or how you got between my boobs...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She got all over you' Ava suggested, turning both of their attention to her 'She said he last death was when giant you killed her, not with the paper like Ray, but with your hand. Not only did her remains end up all over your palm but given the messy nature of the death bits of her probably went everywhere, on your face, in your hair, your uniform, even that rather delicious cleavage of yours' she blushes, Sara files that away for later but still smiles at the compliment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, but why does this matter?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'From the sound of things, every other time Zari died it was in the explosion, no need to completely reform a body just wake it up and hit the reset switch. This time it needed to reform a body as well as reset itself, the combination of which lead to Zari's tiny size and proximity to you. It doesn't work with amount of form or else she'd have appeared in your hand...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And as long as you didn't have in in Ava's pants at the time I'd have been fine with that' Zari mumbles, though only Sara heard her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...but instead in your cleavage, so it could be rather random as long as it is still on you' she lays out her theory, to which Sara nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Make sense, better explain this whole thing to me next time around' Sara says to Zari who looks really confused... but also worried 'What? There's no time to search he entire Waverider in the time we have left, so you'll have to try again next time around. But there's no way I'm letting you go without a little fun' she grins widely 'I know if I was stuck in a time loop and had access to Ray's shrink ray I'd have a lot of fun with you girls'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Big or small?' Ava asks, purely curious (yeah right)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Both really. Nyssa loved to have her Canary out of her cage, but she was also the only person to worship in my temple' Sara teases, then looks down to the tiny hacker 'Oh and Azri, I'm going to need your totem'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Relax you'll get it back during the reset' Sara waves off, Zari grumbles but snaps the cord and tosses it to Sara's other hand 'Thank you' she coos before tossing it into her mouth and swallowing, Zari feels a wave of pain in her chest, though due to her closed mouth doesn't see the jewel glow when it touches Sara's tongue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, what do you have planned?' Ava asks, leaning forward in her seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's a surprise, but  know you'll love it' Sara says before placing Zari directly between her and the screen and begins to remove her top<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sara!' both woman yelp, the blond just smiles widely, not worried about the stares at all, in fact welcoming them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I really needed this' she mumbled before Zari really regretted spying on her captain, as what would equate to several tons of jiggling mounds of boobage landed directly on her, crushing her into a thick red paste almost instantly. Ava bites her lip, both at the display and the still topless Sara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was intense' Sara moans, Ava's heavy breathing a form of agreement as the blond runs her finger through the remains of her newest team member 'I wish I could remember what happens, will make things easier to come with a list and no repeat myself' she mumbles, sucking her fingers with exaggerated moans and whines, making the other woman gulps. 'Want a try, might jog your memory next time you see her' she asks with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know, and aren't you worried she'll appear on ym if I do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shrugs 'This isn't Zari, it's what's left behind, she'' appear on me that's all I know' Ava's resistances crumbled and she was there in a snap, small hands greedily squeazing and playing with massive jugs, causing a pleased whimper from the blond's lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Next time lapse</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari once more finds herself trapped in fleshy darkness with a strong scent she was beginning to recognise as Sara's multiplied by at least a couple hundred due to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where the fuck did she go?' Sara growls angrily as Zari realises she'd gone back further, to the very beginning to the time loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sara calm down, I'll get some Camomile tea' Ray offers but Sara waves him away just before he trips on his boots<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's fine I'll take a drink on the way to my room. Don't bother me' she hisses, Zari's world shakes as the captain walks out of the main bridge, her heart sinking as she figures out where she was but also discovers her totem is missing, now sitting proudly on the swell o Sara's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is she this time?</span></div></div>",

This was more humiliating this time for the little legends, but it meant also that she will get more troubles once she'll be discovered by the giant captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara got her tea and went to the jump ship, taking a seat while receiving a call from Ava. Zari felt the brutal move of Sara as she sat on the chair, and decided it was the perfect time to climb up. With luck she won't be discovered this time. Unfortunately, it was not unnoticed by sara who felt something tickling her pussy in front of Ava, which was totally embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey what's wrong ? \" Ava asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...nothing. it's just...well forget it. \" Sara rubbed her feminine crotch with one hand, forcing her unaware captive to enter her vagina, making things worse for Sara who dropped her tea cup on the ground and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sara ! You're acting strangely are you sure you are okay ? \" Ava began to be worried, thought this was totally unexpected for her to see the blonde seemed to focus on something between her legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is this a way to tell me that you're getting...hot ? \" Ava had to ask it, which caused Sara to simply put off the screen .  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Damn it, is it a bug or something ?! \" Sara then slide her hand inside her pant, glad that Ava was not seeing this...And she got the little thing between her fingers, reaching it out and raised it to her face. The diminutive form of Zari could be recognized from the giant eye of the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Can't believe that !! \" She said loudly, shocked by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sara i can explain ! \" Zari begged, even thought she was held tight, her fear gave her strengh to make her hear what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hell yeah you d'better have a good explaination about this if you don't want to end up under my shoe ! \" Sara warned and placed Zari on her chair. The giant then crouched next to the chair looking angrily at Zari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now talk ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThought that Zari was bored to repeat the story once again, she had no choices. It was not pleasant to die and she needed sara to fix at last the problem of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So you're living a time loop, being shrunk and all around me right ? And from what you said, you now appear every time on me because i have some remain of you on different parts of my body, including my...well you know what. \" Sara said suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari knew it was a lost cause. No one would believe such a weird story like this. That's why she didn't expect sara to place her hand near her, as an invitation to zari to come in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Come here. \" Sara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari wasn't sure. \" What you're gonna do ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I gave you an order. I'm the captain, remember ? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari then obeyed and jumped into the cold giant palm of her \"captain\" as sara loved to call herself in front of her.

Did you like what you saw, yes or not ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari didn't know what was the good answer...yes, and she will be considered as an insane perverse or something. And no, Sara might feel offended. Anyway, Sara still didn't feel in mood to help her, and Zari had to prepare for a death which she hoped will be quick</span></div></div>",

Are you serious?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep. Now I suppose you could just not and learn to be bug sized, avoiding rats and spiders, not to mention if anyone saw you their first instinct would be to crush you into oblivion. Or you do this little thing for me and I make you bigger' Zari swears under her breath, that wasn't a choice, she had to get bigger or she was fucked beyond belief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine. I'm sorry for not following orders, for hacking Gideon to the point she'd kind of fucked right now, and for trying to cheat time when our job is to do the opposite. Also you are a good captain, a gaggle of idiots like us wouldn't be alive without you' she may be laying it on a little thick there but giving Sara's ego a stroke wouldn't hurt right now, she did hold all the cards after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara hummed before smiling 'I accept, time to go up in the world' she grins and activates the growth function on the gun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari closes her eyes, knowing from before the sensation of watching herself change size is off-putting, but was surprised by how quickly it was done, well until she opened her eyes 'Hey what gives I'm still tiny!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I wouldn't say that' Sara smiles, fingers wrapping around the smaller woman's body 'I'd say you're the perfect size now' she says as she sits down and unzips her pants, revealing her now drooling pussy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sara don't do this' Zari pleads<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You felt magical down there Zari, and now you're just the right size for me. Why did you think I moved us to my bedroom, if not to make your first time with a woman magical?' Sara says with almost starry eyes, before she introduces her newest teammate to her lower lips face first, pushing her in deep, till all that her slight grip on Zari's feet is all that would stop her being lost inside 'Yes, just like that' Sara moans, lying back on the bed 'No wait, squirm for me damn it, don't make me crush you in there' she growls, clenching her muscles till she felt the delicious movement<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari stood by her original assessment of being inside Sara's vagina: the heat was unbearable, she was soaked to the skin the moment she entered the cave and to make matters worse she needed to participate or else the muscular vice that Sara calls a vagina would crush her deep insider her, or simple smother her in it's squishy landscape. Seeing as she'd like to live at least long enough to reach the end of the countdown she began to follow Sara's wishes, rubbing her hands throughout what she could, pinching and squeezing any bundles or irregularities in the mostly uniformly smooth inner walls. It was when she found a particularly tightly packed bundle of nerves and sensitive nubs that Sara really began to work hard, her innards pulsing with her pleasure, Zari feeling she was damned either way when a spike in Sara's pleasure nearly crushed her arm when she tried to move out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough blind luck Zari found Sara's G-spot, not that the assassin cared right now, just that she hadn't had fun with a person Zari's size in years, before her resurrection at that. So when she finally cums and a river of her love juices practically shoots out she hopes Zari was okay, she had a lot more planned for her, maybe even a new job as a replacement for the sex toys she forgot back in 2018, or she could bring her to have a night of passion with Ava and Nyssa, oh the possibilities are endless<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I guess the big question is... what happened to Zari? Is she even still alive?</span></div></div>",

Also Nyssa and I used to spirit away really unimportant people to play with and amuse ourselves with. Want to clean up Zari like we used to?' she asks abd despite her mistrust she agrees.

Besides the obvious places' Sara asks, knowing several weapons and most of Ray's science equipment could be used to make explosives, as well as the drive core Zari had been working on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm a fucking idiot' Zari mutters, wondering why she didn't think to ask Gideon, the response of 'yes, yes you are' from Sara, Ava &amp; Gideon was unhelpful and unneeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Miss Lance, other than the expected places there is an unusual signature in the control hub'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thanks Gideon. We'll finish this later Ava, thanks for everything' she grins then looks back to her hand and Zari 'As for you, well this will have to do for the moment' she tilts her hand forward and Zari fall, landing back where she started the version of the time loop: Sara's cleavage. She was luckily too buried in Sara to see Ava grit her teeth and mentally swear a painful revenge, but Sara did and looked forward to the future. Hopping out of the jump ship she made her way to the command centre, searching for anything out of place, only finding the tape they'd retrieved from Napoleon, With little else to do she opens the device up and is greeted with a timer 'Found it' she thinks with a smile then a moment of panic before she heads down to the cargo bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gideon open the door, oh and Zari, try crawl to viewing distance you won't want to miss this' Sara orders then playfully teases<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Captain Lance we can't just open the door while in the...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just do it'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Captain' the AI answers with an implied sigh, which Sara acknowledges before throwing the bomb out the door. The unstable chronol energy shorted the sensitive trigger mechanism, while the time winds aged the bomb to dust as well as reverted it to non existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go, done on the first try' Sara winks at her boob buddy/shrunken former teammate/future pet for her and her potential girlfriend Ava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo does the simulation play out till the end of the day (as a kind of YOU DID IT! Yay!), giving Sara time to mess around with Zari for a while?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Gideon rescue Zari from her virtual fate, while also probably dooming her real one by informing Sara and Ava about everything that happened in the last time loop, ensuring she was going to be seeing those 2 a lot more and a lot bigger than she was used to?</span></div></div>",

Sara chuckles, Zari coughed, before slowly reaching for her totem... but before she could Sara slams her foot onto her 'Oh no you don't, that's not going to help you' she teases, lifting her up by her leg so it was close enough to her face she reach over and slip her finger into the chain, snapping it and flicking it onto the medical room's table 'There we go, no escape attempts for you' she chuckles before letting go and letting Zari drop once more, then began to rub her between her feet like a massage device or a pumice against her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoredom isn't something Sara saw coming in the near future, Zari was definitely going to be a fun little plaything for a LONG time.

It was then she noticed Ray's shrink ray 'What's this doing here?' she thinks aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ray made a second device for medical emergencies' Sara replies, practically leaping to her side (and for once trying to ignore the feeling of Zari squirming under her toes, she needed all her mental faculties for this) as she comes up with a convincing story 'I mean we've needed Ray to shrink before to help with a couple of issues (don't remember the episode, think it was season 1), and now he's made the shrink ray anyone can do it if another procedure is required rather than find Ray, or even if ray's the one who needs to be operated on'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmaya blinks 'I wasn't here for that, was I?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, that was back with the original team, back when we had, Rip, Snart and the Hawks.

Snow White,<br>\r\nCharming, Pinocchio...Well, for now the main problem was about Regina who was actually the Evil Queen, and got her power back with the magic. People from Storybrook who recovered their memories were now heading to the Mayor's house to make Regina pay for what she did to them. Emma had to stop them before Regina decides to use her power against them !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to pick her yellow car, she felt an hand on her shoulder and turned back to see... \" <i>Jefferson ?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" Emma. It's good you can see things clearly now. Let me give you something i grab throught my Hat since the magic is back...This will help you to stop Regina. You have to eat it. Farewell, Emma. \"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" Jefferson, wait ! \" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jefferson left. Emma looked at the mushroom he just gave to her, but she didn't know if she could trust him or not. She took a seat in her car and tried to remember her first meet with Jefferson. He seemed crazy to her, but now...he was that guy from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> even it sounded weird in Emma's mind. But if it was true, and if he has suggested to eat the mushroom, then...it means that it's something to make Emma shrinks or grow !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"hmmm...guess he already had a chance to kill me and he didn't do. So, maybe i can try to eat it and see. God this is weird.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, she threw the mushroom into her mouth and swallowed it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does happen ??<br>\r\n(sorry same options as the previous chapter, but with a little story to start)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once she swallowed, Emma had barely enough time to yelp before everything shot up around her, as she found herself shrinking to 5 inches tall, in the driver seat of her car. It was at this moment Emma was glad she hadn't shut her door yet, as otherwise she'd have been trapped in her car, unfortunately while her clothes did shrink with her, she'd left her phone on the dashboard so it was both normal sized and way out of reach. This meant she couldn't get in touch with Henry, Snow or any of the others, she was on her own for this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma just sat there for a little while, wondering why Jefferson gave her a shrinking mushroom, especially if she was supposed to eat it, it'd have made more sense if he'd told her to slip it in something of Regina's to eat and then they'd have a 5 inch woman who was no danger to anyone (then again I think the fairies are even smaller and they're a pain in the ass) It was then an idea hit her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could use her new size to spy on Regina, see if she was plotting anything or not, sure she probably couldn't do anything to stop her if she was at this size and if she was discovered she'd most likely end up becoming either a plaything or slave (sexual or otherwise) to the now giant brunette, but Emma wasn't someone who planned, or even really thought things through, as eating the magic mushroom while still in her car proved.<br>\r\nGently as she could, she hopped from the seat to the floor of her bug, then climbed over the edge of the doorway and dropped onto the road below. Luckily there were at most 2 streets between her current location and Regina's house, though while they could be done in a matter of minutes for the reasonably fit Sherriff/Saviour on a normal day, at her current size even mostly jogging it'd take up to an hour, which upon realising made Emma already regret this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she couldn't give up now, she'd already fucked up everything else and she'd left the car so she couldn't even wait for someone to notice she was stuck in there. Sighing she started to make her way in the direction of Mifflin lane and Regina's home, where she'd probably be spending the next while shadowing Regina.</span></div></div>",

Once she arrived, there were a group of mad people standing in front of Regina's house, yelling at her to come out. Emma had to find another entrance to be sure she won't be stepped on by trying to go throught the group. She then slided under the door to finally reach the inside, when suddenly a light shined just behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What was that ? \" Emma wondered. But then she heard the familiar voice of Regina saying : \" this spell should be enough to protect my home from them. I won't allow anyone to come in ! \". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's my lucky day. I guess i can't come out either now..\" Emma thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw the gigantic Regina walking to the kitchen, so Emma decided to follow her to see what she was doing. From what she could see, Regina was...eating. <br>\r\n\"Everyone wants to see her dead, and she's just eating in her kitchen ?! Come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Making my lasagna for myself is pointless. I really hope Henry will come back soon..\" Regina said, wiping her mouth with a tissue. For some reason, Emma tried to get closer and walked under the table toward Regina. She still didn't know how to stop her with her current size, but Regina won't stay forever in that kitchen and Emma was tired to run around a giant environnement, so she could see a way to travel throught the giant woman herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Maybe if i can climb her shoe...Oh this is so weird.\" Emma thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait a minute...I can feel some magic close to me. A different magic which is not mine ! \" Regina stood up so suddenly that her chair fell on the ground, and Emma could imagine that this \"magic\" she was talking about was...her size !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let's be calm ! \" Emma thought. \" If i don't move, she will have no reason to check under the table ! \". Unfortunately, this was the first thing that Regina did, and she quickly found and recognized the tiny blonde woman with her red jacket.  \" OH..MY....GOD ! Seems this is my lucky day ! Emma Swan, the incredible tiny savior\"  the giantess said with an evil smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" W...wait i can explain ! \" the blonde started. \" I don't care about how this happenned. All i can see is finally MY happy ending ! \" . Regina then openned the palm of her hand, and before Emma could realize it, she disappeared in a smoke only to appear in this giant palm of the former Evil Queen who then closed her fingers around the blonde. Emma was trapped in Regina's hand with no possibility to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" PUT ME DOWN !\" she yelled, which of course made Regina smiled. \"No way Mrs Swan. I have a lot of plans for you. But first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't worry Em-Ma, when I'm done with you you'll be enjoying yourself as much as I am... or be screaming about wanting to die, currently 50:50 on that, this is what happens when I don't make lists'' she sighed before sitting back down, placing Emma on the lap of her suit pants, and (more or less) dropped her magic onto the 5 inch woman, forming a little cocoon around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hm, whatever magic shrunk you is of the semi-permanent sort: it sticks around until something acts on it to reverse the effect'' Regina mused as Emma's heart sank, Jefferson had only given her a piece to shrink, she had no way of growing back, even if she had controllable magic. Satisfied with the answer Regina waved her hand to dispel the magic, when she was reminded of something very important: magic works differently here, though even in the old world 3 forms of magic (Regina's, Emma's leaking potential and the mushroom) mingling so closely together would be a bad thing. The smoky cocoon of magic flashed several times before erupting in energy, a deep blue cloud filling the entire kitchen for about a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well never doing that again'' Regina muttered as she rubbed her head, getting back into a seated position she realised there was something very wrong. Not even looking at what she was sitting/lying on she looked more or less straight up into the grinning face of the giant blond that was previously in her lap about to become her... Regina hadn't really decided, anything from lover or sex toy to insole or seat cushion. A small part of her mind was very glad she'd actually swapped places as well as size rather than simply she shrunk while Emma grew as at least she could be seen on Emma's lap rather than being crushed under Emma's oblivious, large, round, ass, probably stuck to a cheek while the blond idiot fruitlessly searches the mansion for her. Still Emma's expression filled her with worry and even a little fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know...'' Emma boomed, her smile getting wider ''..I can definitely see the appeal, and maybe after all the shit I've gone through both outside and in this crazy town, this is<b> my </b><i>'happy ending'</i>. I like that idea'' Emma chuckled to herself as her hand reaches out and begins to stroke Regina, the witch trying very hard to resist the wandering fingers ''And I can see you do too''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

The most codescending personn Emma ever knew was now in her hand, trembling with fear as she was stroking her with her fingers. \"Oh Regina...I'm going to take a good care of you but first, we need to get out of there. You have so many ennemies about to break your door, do you hear them ? \" Emma said as she could hear the scream of angry people hitting the door of Regina's mansion.<br>\r\nEmma stood up, her captive in one hand while unbuttonning her pant with the other. \" Ms Swan...what the hell are you doing ?! \" Regina asked. \"we don't want them to find you so i'm gonna hide you in my panties, is that a problem ?\" Emma replied, making Regina both shocked by excitement and scared at the the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to wait for an answer, Emma quickly slipped the Mayor of Storybrook and former Evil Queen...right into th front her panties ! Emma smirked before a few people managed to enter the room, with Grumpy as the leader.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma Swan ?! Where's the Queen ?! it's time for justice tell me where is she ! \" He yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" she's gone. It seems she has left Storybrook ! \" Emma replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What?

I'm still the Sheriff, remember ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumpy glanced at Emma before he left the Mansion followed by the other. \"all right, i managed to get some times.\" Emma sighed.

The boy was probably worried about both his mothers especially if the mob was as vocal before they attacked Regina's house as during. With that in mind and Regina's current condition Emma ran as quickly as someone in her position could back to her bug (just as she thought it took barely a couple of minutes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to Henry's school could've been worse, Regina's wriggling was stoking her desire but luckily not enough for Emma to actually need to 'participate' or anything just yet. She found him easily though, sitting outside the school with his storybook on his lap waving over as her as she got out of her bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom!' the 10 year old yelled as her barrelled into his blond parent Emma lightly grunting at the impact<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey kid, I need to talk to you for a minute'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why?' Henry asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's about Regina, she's gone away fro a while with all the people after her...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom you have to find her right away, before she casts another curse to undo all the work you've done. You have to stop her quickly' Henry practically screamed and Emma's heart sank, sure Regina was kind of a bitch to her and Snow (who if the book is anything to go on at least deserves that) but Regina had been nothing but nice to Henry his entire life and he still can't see the woman as anything but evil. She really hopes Regina can't hear the outside world while in she's trapped in her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the universe is an arse (particularly if your name is Regina), while heavily muffled Regina could still hear most of what was said between Emma and Henry and her heart broke at her son's words, the pain growing inside her until her only thoughts were to curl herself into as tight a ball as possible and cry, regardless of her surroundings, or the growing amount of female juices soaking her clothes and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay Henry, that's actually why I'm talking to you I need to go find your mother so you're going to stay in Mary Margret's apartment for a few days to a couple of weeks while I do that'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I get to stay with grandma and grandpa? Awesome' the boy cheered and Emma sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well see you soon kid' Emma said as she ruffled his hair and headed back to her car. Once there she had a moment of though on her next move. She considered trekking around Storybrooke for a while, give the idiot locals the illusion that she was looking for Regina, but she realised spending a large amount of time with Regina hidden in her sex while out and about was a bad idea so decided to just return to the mansion and have her way with the delectable witch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the mansion she hopped the stairs 2 at a time in her haste to enter the master bedroom, her mind rationalising that she already had the woman inside her, she might as well do it on her bed. So after stripping herself bare and finding a comfortable position on Regina's bed she slid her fingers into her vagina, finding Regina easily and slowly sliding her out getting much less resistance than she expected. Pulling Regina from her she held the woman limply by her leg a little confused by the lack of a response from her, which was the actual reason that she then leg go and the brunette landed on her bare breast with a wet plop. Emma assumed that of anything would get an angry response from Regina but all she did was turn her head from her flat position so she could look Emma in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was starting to get strange, it's like the fire was extinguished and the snark had been sucked out, the only side benefit was that Emma discovered that Regina drenched in her pussy juices was a mouth watering sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

Once she was settled on Regina's bed she loosened her grip and gave the former queen a proper once over, biting her lip as she does 'Regina, always looking so immaculate in those pantsuits, well time to get more than teasing glimpses at the treasures beneath' she licks her lips as the size difference allows her to easily remove Regina's shirt and pants, exposing the barely there covering her lingerie has on her bulging breasts and buttocks 'Perfect' she whispers before diving right in, her tongue covering Regina's entire bosom and coating it in sticky saliva in a matter of seconds, the roughness of her tongue shredding Regina's silky bra with almost no time to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ms Swaaann' Regina groans as she tries to protest her treatment, to which the blond giantess smirks and pulls back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's Emma, Regina, I know you can say it' she plants a quick kiss on Regina's chest 'Now I know you taste as good as you look, why don't you contribute to this and play with those big titties for me, bounce those knockers around'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina looks annoyed when she yells back 'Emma I will not degra...' she squeaks when Emma's grip tightens<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Look I don't need you to do anything, I can get off from your tiny self alone I bet you'd feel really good squirming in my shoe or under my ass, maybe even IN my ass. Hm, feet first or head first, your choice' she states, rather enjoying watching Regina gulp and pale ever so slightly 'So are we willing now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina groans but wasn't going to let the saviour beat her: huffing loudly she runs her hands along her body, internally grimacing as thanks to Emma her entire torso is wet and sticky, palming her large breasts the former queen of seduction does as she was asked, bouncing and fondling the soft mounds as Emma's eyes darken with arousal, getting a small smirk from Regina despite herself before she lowering her head to run her tongue along her nipple, just before capturing it in her mouth, getting a groan from her captor and a mouth full of sweetness for herself due to Emma's saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now you're getting into it, I think someone deserves a reward' Emma coos, and Regina worries, even more so when she gets raised closer to Emma open mouth, yelping when Emma slides her lower body into her mouth and began to lick and suck. Similar to her bra her panties didn't last long to Emma's tongue lashing, exposing her vagina and asshole to the aggressively wriggling organ, while the rest of her lower half was basically experiencing the strangest Jacuzzi in existence, Emma's tongue had Regina's eyes rolling back in her head, curling back on her face and rubbing her spit covered tits all over her nose, which Emma didn't seem to have a problem with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Emmmma,..... sttop' Regina whined, trying to stop herself bucking against Ms Swan's tongue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm' Emma hummed, the vibrations coursing through her body and lighting everything on fire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit! Never mind, don't you dark stop Ms Swan, don't you dare!' Regina hisses, rubbing her breasts harder against the bridge of Emma's nose as her only form of enticement, which seemed to work as the blond decided to spear her pussy on the tip of her wet organ, it takng less than 10 thrusts before Regina came, collapsing limply on Emma's face, her giggles giving little aftershocks before finally removing her from her mouth. 'And what was so funny dear?' the naked witch asked her, seeing the sheriff grinning with her in one hand and the other down her pants playing with herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's grin widened 'It's just that even your cum tastes of apples Gina' she laughs when Regina blushes 'Now I think it's your turn to do the work, your turn to make me cum' Regina gulps as it was definitely going to be harder for her than it had been for Emma to do her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Emma have Regina do?</span></div></div>",

Emma couldn't help but ask ''Because she wouldn't have made it to this point, she'd have died not far from the car. To use your words, I'd have stepped on her like a bug, but not just that, I'd have stepped on her just to break her legs, then I'd remove my shoe and step on her again just to feel her head squish between my toes'' Regina laughed when she saw Emma's horrified expression ''Honestly I blame Mal for those thoughts, the woman always had little things in her castle and they never survived more than a day, I think only me and Aurora managed to live through her <i><b>'games'</b></i> while anyone and everyone else ended up a bloody mess on her heels, ass, cleavage and those pointed teeth of hers, I'm sure I should be disgusted by just the thought of, never mind actually kissing her after that but being on the outside and inside of a Mal/mini/lover kiss is intoxicating and they don't taste that bad'' Regina had obviously gone off on a tangent but so had Emma, thinking she was glad she'd killed the bitch as a dragon so as not to be a bloody smear or snack for the woman later (not knowing about the urn full of dragon ash Regina had collected in her basement just waiting to be revived).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how's it going to work?<br>\r\n1) She binds Emma to her/Daniel's ring, using a similar enchantment to the one which bound the Dark One to his/her dagger (amazing what you find looking through the Queen of Hearts, Mistress of all Evil and  Dark One's libraries of Dark Magic)<br>\r\n2) She uses a ritual she learnt from Maleficent, which essentially would claim Emma (body &amp; soul) as hers, though it would involve (among other things) pleasuring herself with the 5 inch blond, something she had hoped to eventually get around to anyway. She knew it worked as she'd witnessed Mal shrink and claim Aurora (and had heard Mulan had just as eagerly been claimed by Aurora), willingly on the brunette's part, and she's now happily walking around Storybrooke carrying Mal's babies like a good dragon mate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Regina will probably never admit it but she is someone who craves affection, it's probably why even after everything she still follows mommies orders, what this has to do with anything is how it fits in with her form of binding Emma: with the Dark One binding Emma would fight her every step of the way, even more so if she wasn't wearing the ring, but with the true binding Mal had used for her dragorican mate (Aurora seeming happy to see her when Regina came to check on her, even after the curse broke, waddling over to the Queen despite the twins being a month away) Emma would want her and she would finally have a companion worthy of the Evil Queen, plus as long as she kept her smaller than half her size there was no way Emma could go against her unless having a little kinky fun. And even if the woman had been a pain in the ass quite often, Regina couldn't stop herself wanting the blond, she looked delicious and when she wasn't wanting to strangle her she seemed like a very nice person so extra points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way Regina set to work making the potion she needed to create the symbols that would need to be inked onto Emma's skin in order to do the ritual, the blond thankfully keeping silent in the hopes Regina forgets about her (No way in Hell) or she becomes busy enough that escape in a viable option. Neither of these occur as Regina only needs 5 minute to mix up the silver liquid, as well as the smallest writing implement she could find to paint it on Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying the 2 on the table beside her Regina set to work revealing her canvas, trying her hand at removing Emma's clothes manually and managing to get both her jacket and shirt off easily, it was the lower half that was a problem. This led to a smug Emma Swan grinning up at her in her jeans and bra... until Regina simply poofs her down to her birthday suit, freezing her in place before she can try to cover up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gentle handling of a porcelain doll Regina picks the former saviour and Sherriff up and examines her: nice set of breasts, nowhere near her size but enough to show there was a good bit of magic in the blond, pale, blemish free skin, a shaved pubic region and a plump rear (most likely due to all the bear claws) Regina would have fun messing with later, giving it a light flick just to see Emma's reaction, the instantly widening eyes were intoxicating. With no further stalling she picks up the brush and begins painting on the runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, despite the spell put on her Emma occasionally twitched and squirmed, leading Regina to assume she had found sensitive/ticklish spots on the woman, filling them away for later in case she ever wanted to try that on her. Once that was done the ink merged with her skin, forming an intricate runic array that was going to remain there as if it were a tattoo rather than rub off the second she enters her new mistress. With that part out of the way Regina poof them both up to her room in the mansion, placing the still frozen Emma on a pillow, manoeuvring her into a comfortable position before the next phase<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope you enjoy this as much as I do' she smiles almost sweetly and begins to remove her pantsuit, slowly and seductively so Emma would at least be aroused and horny even if not 100% willing to do her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Emma things were a little different: Regina freezes her, strips her, spanks her (Emma wasn't going to admit anything to anyone), then she began painting something on her and running the brush over every sensitive or ticklish spot on the saviour's body, before finally poofing them to her bedroom and giving her a strip tease? She was so confused but also damn Regina was hot, the Latina has that dark feel that always seemed to draw her in, and now she was shrunken and at her mercy things could be...interesting. Plus she was damn hot, that ass Emma wouldn't mind diving into, cute feet and those tits, each one was at least an inch larger than her just in height, she could hide quite comfortably in that canyon she calls cleavage. Finally, dressed only in a silky bra and panty set Regina crawls along the bed before stopping with her colossal bosom hovering overhead and releases the blond from her paralysis and purrs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ready for my idea of a good time Ms Swan?' she wriggles her fingers and her underwear fades like smoke, exposing herself to her future bonded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we go now?</span></div></div>",

Reaching down to pick up her heel she held it under a confused Emma before letting go of the shrunken blond. Emma yelps as she flops onto the insole ''Regi...'' ''Hush'' Regina hisses as with a curl of her finger Emma was paralyzed in everyway bar her eyes and breathing ability ''See you later darling, have fun''' Regina singsongs as she first places the heel back on the road, then slides her stocking clad foot in, rubbing the entirety of Emma's frozen body with it as she pushes it deeper into her shoe. She smiles when the blond ends up exactly where she wanted her, with her head nestled between her first 2 toes, she playfully clenched her toes mostly to further squish Emma's head into the crevice between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina grinned mainly because she was almost certain (having never asked) Emma had a thing for feet, or at least her feet given how much the blonde's attention was on her heels and feet, though there were times when she was focused on the brunette's ass and tits too so maybe she was just physically attracted to her. The other reason was a magical one: as well as the paralysis spell she also cast one that enhanced the senses such as for example the sense of smell. She knew that with Emma's head trapped between her toes without the forced petrification she'd either be panicking and flailing underfoot, or humping her sole and she wanted to save all that energy for later that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDealing with the morons was actually easier than she'd expected: she walked up to the angry mob and essentially force choked Victor, flung several peasants and dwarves off her lawn and told everyone (using small words for Snow, Charming and the fairies minus Astrid) that they were to back the fuck off, and not come near her unless they had a death wish. Somehow it actually worked, especially as she was immune to Snow's stupid <i>''I forgive you, now do what I say''</i> look which luckily ended when she threatened her with a fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smiled for the first time in a while as she flopped onto her sofa, contently squeezing and rubbing Emma with her foot at a relaxed pace. After about 15 minutes Regina decided to try something, she gently released the paralysis spell mostly to see what she was going to do. Rather than squirm and try get her to move like Regina expected, Emma instead continued her even nasal breath against her stockings, not reacting at all to her new freedom of movement. This proved to Regina her thoughts that Emma had an attraction for her, or possibly just her feet, and seemed to like the (due to the enhanced senses spell) intense, possibly overpowering scent she was receiving with her nose crushed up against the gap between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Regina do with Emma?</span></div></div>",

Something else that was annoying her was her heels which were beginning to become rather uncomfortable and she really needed to get out of. Regina noted this would mean she'd have to break her agreement with Emma, but with how little effort the blond was putting into it she didn't mind, especially as she'd come up with a far better plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding to her full height, Regina tugged at her stockings so they'd slide down, keeping one side at her knees but sliding the other (the side containing Emma) down to the heel before sitting down, and unstrapping both heels and slipping her feet out. Emma blinked at the light as Regina's foot was removed from it's confines, pouting for a moment before schooling her features, something she was glad of as Regina's still grinning face came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Regina, are you letting me go?'' Emma asked and Regina noticed that while her voice sounded hopeful her eyes were filled with disappointment ''Oh my sweet na\u00efve saviour, I'm only letting you out because spending the rest of the day in my heels will make your massages pointless'' she says plucking Emma from the heel and dropping her between her one bare and one still stocking clad feet ''Instead I'm going to have you continue to rub, sniff and worship my foot directly on my skin'' she says gently nudging her with a toe. Emma blanched and then blushed ''R-r-regina this is insane, I don't even want to be near your damn feet'' she stuttered out ''Oh Emma, don't lie to me. This wasn't just a means to torment you, I've seen you staring at my feet as well as my breasts and hips but mostly my feet, you like them, I bet if you were full size you'd want to stick my petite feet in that big mouth of yours, but I guess now you'll have to settle for kissing my toes'' she laughed as she used her left foot to knock her woman over, then pinned her lower body under her right foot, toes pawing at her leather jacket ''Just admit it Swan, you like my feet, you find them sexy and enjoy your practically unbreakable body being crushed under them. And don't try to lie to me Em-ma, I'll know''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma breathed heavily as she tried to process, wishing Regina would let her clear the air and get some fresh air away from her intoxicating scent, not that it would matter if she were even in another room: the problem with her position in Regina's shoe had been that every drop of sweat trickled down to her and soaked her through, and while the brunette hadn't done much walking with the saviour underfoot they had both done a lot of running around trying to save Henry so it made sense she was coated in sweat. This fact meant the scent of <i>eau de Mills</i> was here to stay, the smell had permeated her clothes and was even in her hair, it wasn't going anywhere soon. Sighing she tilted her head down her body, looking at the mayor's foot with it's toes bigger than her head and their cute purple coloured painted nails and made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Emma do?</span></div></div>",

Still didn't explain why she was behaving so nicely to her. ''Why are you acting like this? We've never really spoken much?''

Sighing heavily she wondered if mother would notice her leave when she felt eyes on her, turning to her left she found a woman with platinum blond hair dressed completely in black leather and a cloak smiling at her (Yeah, past Emma looks like Dark Swan Emma. The original creators didn't use her right, might as well do something useful with her) ''Hello princess'' she greeted with a musical tone and Ingrid felt drawn to but managed to hide it ''Hello, um'' ''Emma darling. Care to dance?'' Emma smirked as Ingrid looked nervous and a little afraid ''Calm down princess, you're in no danger'' ''It's not me I'm worried about'' Ingrid mutters but Emma still hears her ''If it's your magic don't worry I have some of my own'' Ingrid's head shoots up to meet her eyes and Emma smiles before raising a hand and making it glow an emerald green, then clicking her fingers, producing a small flame the same colour ''You're an elemental too? Mother said they're really rare'' Ingrid squeaked ''No darling, but all mages have an affinity, mine just happens to be fire. Jadis is known for having a heart of ice, inaccurate but most likely referring to her affinity for water, and her preference towards cryotic magic.

They may not have seen the flash of magic around each other, but they sure felt it's effects ''Holy crap, did you feel that?'' ''What was that?'' Ingrid asked ''I think our magic is telling us we're compatible'' Emma joked ''It means much more than that'' both women turn to she the newest arrival on the balcony, Ingrid's mother Jadis herself ''Oh it's a wonderful thing to see, especially on ones so young, Oh Malcolm, our baby girl has fond true love, isn't it wonderful?'' King Malcolm smiles as he follows his wife onto the balcony, before pulling his eldest into a hug ''My little girl has found happiness, what more could I ask for?'' he strokes her cheek ''True Love?'' Ingrid still is in shock, she never thought she'd experience the greatest magic in the land, it was a fairy tale, something she'd wish for her sisters but never experience for herself, but here she is, a recipient of TLK, all because she took a chance with someone she found nice ''Yes Darling, true love'' Emma answers as she slides her hand into Ingrid's ''I'm not going anywhere''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Forwards</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know there is a perfectly good pillow up here Emma?'' Ingrid asked with mock annoyance as her love curled up beside her, resting her head on the cryo's large breasts ''I can't help it, they're just perfect and hey keep getting bigger'' Emma smirks before playfully nipping at an exposed nipple, and getting a slap on the nose ''Behave, if you keep doing that they'll be too sensitive when the baby arrives'' Ingrid scolds her ''Sorry, you know you didn't need to carry the first one right?'' Emma asked gently rubbing the nearest mound as she shuffles up to her head ''I know love, but I'm fine with this. Also I know you're going to spoil your our baby girl and treat her like a princess, might as well be official'' Emma chuckles and nuzzles into her neck ''I hope I can be a good daddy...'' ''Mother, Emma, you will be as much a mother as myself'' ''Okay, mother. But I know one thing, I love you and I'll love baby Elsa right here just as much'' she says thoughtfully as she gently rubs the slight bump on Ingrid's pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Forwards again</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sat in the gazebo awaiting whatever surprise Ingrid had prepared for her, she was to sit here until Ingrid came for her to show her this wonder, though considering her and Helga had been out shopping while she cared for little Elsa she assumed it was a new outfit for both mother and baby (the cute kind for Elsa and the sexy kind for Ingrid). She was so lost in her own mind she didn't immediately realise she wasn't alone, she did eventually notice the count of Ferretberg (she knew the real name but enjoyed missing off the little shit) staring at her well more leering, she may not have asset's like her partner, but she was stunning in her own right, especially given her usual attire of black or white leather with runes for warmth on the inside so they could remain practical even in Arendelle winters. ''Yes?'' Emma said tiredly ''It must have taken quite a lot of effort to bed the little freak'' he sneered and Emma tensed ''That is my wife and the mother of my child you're talking about'' she hissed but the count continued ''Are you sure? I mean the princess has quite a nice rack but you obviously don't know what your missing, how it feels to lay with a real man'' his clammy hand finds its way to her wrist and the only thing that has stopped her performing a heart rip is that he's Helga's boyfriend and as Ingrid's biological and favourite sister (Sorry, I like Elsanna, might as well make them not related) so didn't want to make her sad, so she just snorts and replies ''Oh well tell me when you find one. Dragon's don't count even the ones with dicks are female'' she laughs as she pulls her arm from his grip, noting his face turning an interesting shade of red ''DON'T MOCK ME!'' he yells, shoving her, unfortunately due to it being late early winter the ground was slippery and Emma as expected slipped, smashing the side of her head of one of the decorative bird statues on the edges of the gazebo columns. Ferret scampered off right quick, but not before running into Ingrid who he shoved aside in his need to escape, leaving the princess to find her love lying on the ground, blood pouring from her shattered skull<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Emma!'' Ingrid screams, cradling the blond's head on her lap, trying to force her magic to even attempt to heal her love despite them both knowing her magic was simply incompatible with most healing spells. ''Ingrid'' Emma whispered ''Yes love?'' Ingrid said taking one of Emma's hands into her own ''I made you a promise, to love you forever'' ''And I you, there will never be another'' Ingrid whimpered, and despite herself Emma smiled very slightly ''I know snowflake, take care of Elsa for me, we'll see each other again and be one happy family like we're supposed to, someday'' Emma's eyes closed and her hand dropped to the ground, leaving a sobbing Ingrid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>End of flashbacks</u></i> (For anyone who is unsatisfied by Emma's death that's fine, I just needed her to die for story reasons besides why not have all the shit happen in one day, Emma dies, the Hilda dies because Ingrid tries going postal on her boyfriend, then she gets trapped in a magic urn. Also Weaselberg guy is an extra dollop of arse here, really just needed someone to kill Emma and Ingrid was going to try kill him anyway why not make it justified in universe)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma gasped as she came too, blinking her vison into focus as her previous memories meshed with her current ones (her childhood memories also came through, but there's no change between canon and this world) looking up to Ingrid and feeling the love her past life felt for the woman return in full ''Emma?'' Ingrid whispered, worried about the woman who had been unconscious for the last 20 minutes ''Hi darling'' Emma replied with a crooked grin and was grabbed and pulled into a kiss that covered her entire head ''You're back!'' Ingrid squeals ''I told you I would'' Emma smiles before turning serious ''Ingrid, about Elsa...'' ''When you died I was trapped in the urn, and wasn't released until slightly before Regina's curse was cast and our daughter was a grown woman. There were ... issues in Arendelle, and Elsa ended up being trapped in the urn and stolen by Rumpelstiltskin'' ''Damn and I thought missing 10 years of Henry's life was fucked.... oh shit Henry, Ingrid...'' ''I know love, it's okay you didn't remember me and Henry's a good kid'' ''Yeah, but that's more Regina's doing than mine'' Ingrid nodded ''That's fine, besides we're going to need her help to get Elsa back'' ''What?!'' ''We need more magic than just me, even with your memories returned, you're too small to do anything worthwhile in a fight and I wouldn't want you to be in that much danger'' Emma sighed from Ingrid's palm ''Fine'' she mutters ''Good, now we should head to Regina's and get back our daughter'' Emma nodded and despite herself smiled as she was dropped back into Ingrid's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

Regina looked about ready to separate the two, even if it meant suffering Maleficent's wrath when her front room was filled with white smoke and the temperature plummeted in a matter of seconds. When the smoke cleared Ingrid was standing in the middle of Regina's sitting room. ''Well at least they've stopped, what do you want?'' Regina asked, still slightly annoyed ''It's a long story'' Ingrid says ''Don't worry, we're in no hurry'' Aurora says as she moves to sit beside Maleficent rather than on her lap ''Okay''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>10 minutes later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So almost immediately after being released you'd killed some ginger guy, found out your daughter is all grown up and nearly kill her girlfriend?

''I'm not entirely sure, I don't think I have anything he would want to make a deal for her, and alone I'm not powerful enough to convince him myself to release her to the 2 of us'' ''So you came here for Regina's help'' Aurora stated rather than asked ''Yes, and seeing as she's here too maybe Maleficent could help too'' Ingrid said hopefully, the 2 mages eyes flicking between one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who wants to help Ingrid?</span></div></div>",

''like your own family issues?'' Maleficent offers, causing Gold to twitch slightly ''Actually yes, I'm going on a little trip.

Ingrid began ''.. neither of us knew she was your daughter, when I knew her in her previous life she was alone, I hadn't thought about who her new parents could even be. Besides if I'd known you were her mother don't you think I'd have told you already, not that you needed any convincing but there's no way you'd have said no to rescuing your grand daughter from Rumpelstiltskin'' Ingrid watches the older woman fold internally, then physically when Aurora wraps her arms around her thin waist ''She's alive, and now she's within reach love. We can be reunited once more'' she whispered into the dragon's ear, who purred in contentment, though that might have more to do with Mulan's fingers running up and down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fine, but I want to see my little girl, my Lilith'' Mal said quietly, stepping back slightly ''Little is right at the moment'' Ingrid mutters before reaching into her dress and pulling out Emma, gently placing her on the counter, the glow still surrounding her shrunken form. ''That's not possible'' Regina gasped when she recognised the blond on the table ''Emma's the child of the 2 idiots'' she mutters to herself angrily ''It would seem she isn't'' Maleficent says with a wide grin before stepping well into Emma's personal space, one of her long bony fingers running along her head ''Hello child, it's nice to see my Lilith all grown up even though it pains me to see how much I've missed out on'' she says all this lowly, unsure what level of noise could hurt the smaller woman's ears. There was something that bothered/confused both imp and queen ''You seem to be taking this very well Miss Swan...'' ''Technically it's Adaar Regina'' Maleficent interrupted ''Yes but just like Emma, she's been a Swan for most of hr life, so until she says otherwise it's the only thing I know she'll respond to'' Regina explains ''What did you want to know Regina?'' Emma asks, glad the mayor caused a distraction to get away from the dragon's pawing, though at least she could tell it was purely affectionate ''You seem to be taking it well that you're actually the daughter of the Dragon Queen and... what's this world's title for your quote unquote father, oh yes Sleeping Beauty. It took Henry a while to get you to even consider you were Snow and Shepard's sprog and I still wasn't sure you were actually convince and just wanted him to shut up'' Emma nodded ''You're right, I didn't believe him and I'm taking a wait and see approach to this. The fact of the matter is it' just as possible I'm Mal and Aurora's kid as I am Mary Margaret and David's, well they don't have a magic spell at seeks out blood relatives so I guess Team Sleeping Dragon are winning in that regard'' Emma smiled up at her possible parents, Mal trying to hide some hurt but Aurora and Mulan nodding in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I have an idea'' the warrior announced with a grin ''What?'' ''Ms Swan I want you to smile, don't make it forced and fake, try make it real and genuine, thing of Henry, Ingrid, maybe even Elsa, just find some real happiness inside'' Emma was surprised by the request but had a go, her mind picturing her family all together, Henry trying to show Elsa how to play a game Regina had gotten him for his birthday, while Mal supervised, Aurora and Ingrid trying to prepare food for the lot of them, while Emma tried not get her ass kicked to badly by Mulan &amp; Regina. ''There it is'' Emma opened her eyes and found both Mulan and Regina grinning while the others all had looks of confusion on their faces, even the newly arrived Belle who had been silenced until they could explain what was going on ''What?'' she asked ''It's her smile, You have Mal's hair and eyes...'' Regina begins ''...but aurora's cheek bones and smile'' Mulan finishes. ''I don't think that counts as conclusive proof but it works for you guys so what the Hell'' Emma laughs as she shrugs her shoulders ''So love, are we letting the kid out now?'' Emma asked, causing Ingrid to blink owlishly before practically leaping over to the urn containing the younger cryokinetic ''Let's do it then, full family reunion'' she says as she removes the lid, blue gloop pouring out of the container, slowly forming a humanoid shape before becoming more defined to that of a pale blond woman with expressive green eyes and a cute pout. The woman spins with a look of confusion at where she is , until she finds a teary eyed Ingrid staring at her ''Mother'' she calls and she is pulled into a tight hug as the older woman cried softly against her ''Oh Elsa, I finally have you again'' Ingrid says as she lets go and hold the ice mage at arm's length ''And guess what? I found your other mother'' Elsa's eyes widened, she'd heard stories from Ingrid about the blond mage who stole her mother's heart, and how they made her through True Love's magic ''Really, where is she?'' at this Elsa noticed her mother suddenly turn shy and awkward, wringing her hands ''You see there was some kind of incident...'' she began but stopped noticing something behind Elsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi kiddo'' a small voice said behind her and Elsa turned, surprised to see a 5 inch woman in the cupped hands of an older blond woman in a suit, the ice mage noticing spiral horns almost completely hidden by a mix of her hair and the fedora, waving at her with a nervous smile ''Mama?'' Elsa squeaked and a memory flashed through Emma's mind, a small girl with frost coloured hair in her arms reaching up to her babbling for the most part but one word was legible 'mama'. ''Yes Elsa, mama's here'' the supposed saviour teared up as she was finally reunited with her daughter, now all grown up, and so was surprised when she was picked up from Mal's hands and pulled into a hug, Emma crushed against the cryo's chest. Mal laughed for a moment before getting the smaller girl's attention ''Hey darling, can you let your mama breathe and give nana a hug?'' the dragon grinned at the look of shock and then joy and filtered through the girl's big green eyes before she placed Emma on the table and flung herself at the dragon. Aurora and Mulan laughed while even Regina smiled at her best friend finally getting her happiness, her lovers and daughter, and now even a grandchild. Belle was practically gushing t how beautiful the whole thing was and while he wasn't going to show it Rumple was also happy to see a family reunited, it gave him hope he'd find and reunite with Baelfire soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now what?<br>\r\n1)Emma decides to show Henry his family, even though it's definitely not the one he was hoping for<br>\r\n2)Emma has some family bonding time with her parents: Maleficent, Aurora and even Mulan, while Ingrid is in New York helping Rumple find his son.</span></div></div>",

She smiled and quickly had the smaller woman in her long, bony fingered hand, raised to eye level which was the moment the pieces fit for Emma: she'd seen those eyes before, but they were even larger now than they had been before. Staring at her with interest were the bright green eyes of the dragon she'd just killed, Maleficent, apparently resurrection was easy for a dragon, or maybe they could just turn to ash at will Emma wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hello, little one'' Mal greeted with a smirk, Emma flinching when her face shifted: overall shape more angular, mouth now reaching just before her ears and eyes that were no longer green but twin abyss of black. She quickly shifted back, pointed tongue flicking across triangular teeth ''What to do with you? You are such a little morsel'' she joked with a scarily toothy grin 'Please don't kill me'' Emma pleaded, surprised to get a laugh from the larger woman ''Kill you? Where's the fun in that? No, I have no intention of killing you darling'' Mal answered her long tongue flicking out and slapping across Emma's face ''You do taste exquisite thought, surprised Regina hasn't already had a taste' Mal mussed, enjoying the look of fear (and very slight arousal) on Emma's little face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please just let me go'' ''Oh not a chance darling, I don't know if you were ever told this but dragons are highly possessive creatures and <b>you are MINE!</b>' Maleficent hissed before opening her mouth wider than humanly possible and Emma found herself up to her hips in dragon. The blond squeaked when Mal's tongue slipped it's way into her shirt and between her breasts, snapping her bra during it's exploration. It didn't stay long before withdrawing, slapping across Emma's face like a fishtail and slammed into her back pushing her under the fleshy organ and continuing to lather her in saliva. Just when Emma thought she was going to drown she was pulled out with a pop as a very happy Maleficent swallowed. ''The fuck was that for?'' Emma asked angrily ''For this'' Maleficent answered as her hand momentarily turned blue, Emma glowing the same colour and grimacing in pain: something was burning up inside her, spreading through her veins. It subsided after about a minute leaving a panting former saviour and a smiling dragon. ''What was that?'' ''That was me claiming you, usually I'd use  more personal source of bodily fluid but I don't want to scare you away with that until you can't go anywhere. It's especially fun when used on other magicals, as their own magic enforces the claim as much as mine does. I'm sure the next time you find yourself sans clothing you'll see a lovely little mark on your back...'' she explained waving her other hand and a spectre of her dragon form appeared from the smoke, green eyes and all ''... it's my claim on you. My mate wears it proudly over her heart, as I do hers. But enough of this, I believe it is time to break you in properly'' the witch's eyes sparkle with mirth and lust and Emma gulps as near black smoke envelops them<br>\r\nSo where is Mal going? To her mate Aurora, already swelling from her hatchlings growing within? or Regina the dragon's one exception (Aurora's in Mulan if anyone's wondering, not that the duo are opposed to a little mix and match between the 4 of them)</span></div></div>",

You could see your now giant car crashed near to you, but couldn't understand how you got shrunk.<br>\r\nThe road was on your left and you could see several cars just arrived, some ambulances and two other cars you recognized.<br>\r\n The car of the Mayor Regina, and also a yellow car which belonged to new Sheriff, Emma Swan. You didn't know her very well, <br>\r\nbut you knew Regina. She was a conceited woman, and for some reasons you always hated liked her. So you definetely didn't want<br>\r\nto be found by her, and you tried to hide under a leaf near to you as both of Regina and Emma were the first to walk toward your <br>\r\naccidented car (and you) followed bysome ambulances-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I still don't understand why the mayor herself had to come ! \" Emma said, angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I need to keep an eye on you Miss Swan. A first mistake and i'll make sure to find a new Sheriff to replace you !\" Regina replied;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard them argue for some minutes while Emma was checking your car deeper to find out what happenned. You couldn't see <br>\r\nanything under your leaf but you knew that Regina was just right behind you, so you knew this was really not your lucky day ! And<br>\r\nthings got worse as the leaf suddenly disappeared from your body, you quickly realized that...Regina just removed it by a gesture <br>\r\nwith her foot. And to your horror, she was looking down at you with a smirk not saying any words. Because of her expression and that<br>\r\nshe was not surprised to see a bug sized man at her feet, you knew that she was probably the one who shrunk you somehow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now ?</span></div></div>",

The airbag went off in the crash so he's probably injured, at least severally enough he couldn't just walk away''<br>\r\n''The window is broken, they could've climbed/crawled out that way?'' Emma countered, hating Regina's smug 'I'm always right' look so much <br>\r\n''If that were true there would be blood, which there isn't'' Emma quickly scanned around the driver's seat, door and the immediate area and found she was correct <br>\r\n''And there are no high tech do-dads in the driver area so there had to physically be a driver'' ''Are do-dads a technical term?'' ''Very technical, you learn that first day of sheriff training'' <br>\r\nRegina sighs once more ''Basically Sheriff, where's your victim?'' She gives the blond a humourless smile before heading back to her car, Emma cursing under her breath as she reaches into the car and removes the keys, unlocks the car and opened the driver's side door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now let's see what's in here'' Emma says out loud rooting through the front of the car 'Yay ID! Hm, Donal Crocker. You're either the owner of the car, my disappearing victim, or both. I really hope it's both as this is the only useful thing I can find in here'' Emma wishes out loud, glad when she looked back that Emma had dismissed the ambulance and other services, she'd just need to ring Tillman to get the car moved.<br>\r\nSo what happened to you?</span></div></div>",

After a short amount of time you saw light again, and you were level with the sheriff's (to you) massive face, you watched her eyes bulge in surprise and there was blur and darkness locked in a tight grip just below painful, you assume from her trying to get away from you but being in her hand she closed it to stop you flying off. You felt movement again but it was much slower<br>\r\nEmma was freaking out now, the bug she picked up, it looked human but tiny. Now in a normal town this would be weird enough but in a town where your son loudly proclaims everyone is a fairy tale character it was too much for her rational thoughts. Unfortunately she couldn't just throw the thing away, if it was a little person it was still murder even if it would be easier to clean up. Taking a few breathes to calm herself Emma brought her hand close to her face and slowly opened it, now she was thinking clearly she noted that the guy in her hand rather closely resembled her missing person: same facial structure, same facial hair, he was too small for her to check eye colour but she assumed they would be green, his hair was shorter but he probably had it cut since the photo was taken, this almost had to be her guy. The only thing she could now do was ask.<br>\r\n''You're Donal Crocker right?'' You nod ''Great, I was just about to go looking for you, man you could've been hard to find at this size'' Emma jokes and you join in hoping not to irritate her seeing as the last giantess kicked you into the path of this one, who then stomped on and nearly killed you.<br>\r\n''Well you obviously didn't start out this size, so what happened?'' You quickly tell her everything you knew: how you were leaving town when you blacked out (which was probably the reason for the accident), how you woke up this size, Emma was rightly so angry when she heard what Regina did (or tried to do) to you, as well as looking quite embarrassed that she didn't even notice she'd crushed you. While this was going on Emma was slowly making her way back to her car, while also checking you for any damage, interestingly despite everything that had happened there appeared to be nothing wrong with you now (apparently whatever shrunk you and stopped you from dying via shoe also makes you able to heal <i>like magic</i>)<br>\r\nEmma slides into the still open door of her car, depositing you to her lap just long enough to remove her gloves, before transferring you once more into her much warmer palms, being raised to her face so you can continue this conversation properly ''So to recap cutie; you don't know how you shrunk, just that it happened when you tried to leave, Regina appears to know something and tried to use me to kill you, but doesn't know everything about this otherwise she'd know you would survive your crushing and have just taken you from the crime scene or more likely stepped on you herself so you'd be stuck to her shoe and be much easier to move'' you could tell Emma was just thinking out loud but the thought of being in Madame Mayor's hands rather than Ms Swan's filled you with dread, then relief that the nice one had found you.<br>\r\nSo what does Emma want to do now?</span></div></div>",

Though considering I'm holding a bug sized man in my hands it doesn't sound so crazy right now'' she mutters the last part as she closes the door of her bug and starts the engine before once again turning her attention to you ''Where to put you, you can't stay in my hand I need both of them to drive, plus it'd look really weird me talking to my hand where I'm going if anyone's actually there'' she sighs then gains a smirk that would be more at home on Regina's face ''I think you'll like this D''<br>\r\nWithout warning her hand turned and you started to fall; directly into her half open shirt, getting caught by her pale breasts. Luckily you fell mostly the right way up, meaning your head was sticking out of her cleavage and you could breathe easily which was preferable to being suffocated by her hill like mounds. Looking up you could see her close her blouse and hear her driving away ''Don't worry little guy this is just temporary until I get back to my apartment, then I'll let you out. It sure is lucky you're so small other wise I'd have to crush you into my sole again to get you into the house'' Emma laughs at her joke, her bouncing breasts covering your shudder at being stepped on again, even if it was by Emma and you know she would've been as gentle as she could.<br>\r\nThe drive felt much longer for you than it probably was, with nothing to see but flesh and blouse, coupled with the adrenaline leaving your system you actually felt yourself beginning to droop between Emma's boobs. Luckily just before you actually fell asleep the car stopped and everything around you started moving. You could only guess what Emma was doing, hearing what you assume to be Emma running up stairs followed by the turning of a key, it was another few minutes before light re-entered your field of vision, momentarily blotted out when Emma plucked you from her cleavage and placing you on her counter with a rather old looking book.<br>\r\n''You were remarkably easy to find after all this, I'd expected you to take advantage of your situation, either your gay or you have stronger will than I do'' You weren't going to tell Emma it was fear of her anger that stopped you from 'doing' anything, her attention had obviously gone from him back to the book she began scanning through ''What are you looking for?'' you ask curiously ''According to Henry this book is every one in town back before they were cursed to Storybrooke, if I can find you in here, we might find out what happened to you''<br>\r\nIt took 2 hours for Emma to finish her search (and really glad Henry and MM were still in school, she really had no strategy to stop them seeing Donal other than <b>'back in my shirt you go'</b>).<br>\r\nWhat were her findings?</span></div></div>",

She entered her Bentley and drove in the direction of the cemetery.<br>\r\nOnce there she entered the Mills family crypt and pushed the coffin out of the way of a set of stairs (really putting her back into as you felt yourself being crushed between the stone and her breasts). When you were finally removed Regina had chucked you onto a table, covered in a pentagram with large purple crystals at each point, if you weren't so worried you'd probably have found it amusing how much it looks like someone who googled witch and rolled with it.<br>\r\nRegina then began rooting through a set of shelves above you ''Now usually magic can be drawn through the blood, but at your size it would kill you and I don't want to do that, besides I have so many plans for you later'' you don't need to look to know she's smiling at that, not that you'd be able to see her face from your current position anyway so you instead stare at her navel, which was exposed from the stretching she's doing. ''Where the fuck.. got it!'' she took a step back and grinned holding what looked to you to be a glassy marble sized orb with deep purple veiny patterns all over it.<br>\r\nRegina knocked you over with her hand and placed the ball onto your chest, pinning you down with it's weight and her hand still on it ''Now I'd tell you this won't hurt but I've reached my quota for lying to my friends for this week. On the other hand you aren't really him, other than your current size of course. You'll be absolutely fine'' Regina's smile terrified you as she pressed harder onto the ball and your ribs, noticing her eyes flash purple for a second before it hits you. Pain courses through you like being stabbed with a live wire, your eyes too blurred to see anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for what felt like hours, (though it was really a few minutes) until Regina took the pressure off the ball and it rolled off your chest as you cough and try to fill your lungs with air. ''Well you managed to produce quite a bit of magic, and survive. Good job'' Regina said with a smirk as she examines the orb, now filled with a deep blue smoke. ''You got what you wanted, are you going to let me go now?'' ''Oh God no, you're going to be my toy forever. In fact I think my little man deserves a reward for 'donating' so much magic to me'' her smile turns predatory and you pale in fear as the witch grabs you and slides you between her large breasts ''Get used to this little man, I always get what I want in this case: You, Miss Swan your size or a little bigger, and people stop screwing around with my happiness. That last one will be done once Miss Swan is dealt with'' Regina says as she attaches the orb to a necklace to create some sort of pendant. She wrapped the item around her neck, moaning as the magical energy flowed into her at such speed even you could feel the pulse of magic within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in a much better mood Regina made her way home, but instead of sleeping she began to set up for her plans to remove Emma Swan as a threat. You wonder if the woman ever sleeps as you are continuously rocked by her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later (as in it's actually what normal people consider morning)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Miss Swan if you could be so kind as to come to see me when you're done bringing Henry to the bus, there are a few things we need to discuss'' she ends the call and smiles into the mirror ''Not much longer dearie and you'll soon have someone your scale'' she mumbled into her cleavage/ at you. She then got up properly and went about her morning routine: making breakfast for herself and Henry, being ignored by the little shit (you know she's crazy and evil but the kid's still being a dick), before he's out the door like a light to his blond mother who's standing at the gate. Regina slumps into the seat with a sigh, before remembering this would be the last time this happened and smiled, all that was left was for Emma to come back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Regina, you wanted to see me?'' Emma asked surprised by the suddenness and unsure of the reason for it (usually she'd done something to irritate the woman for something like this to happen) ''Oh nothing much, just taking care of a problem'' Regina answered clutching at the pendent, before throwing her hand out in Emma's direction. Within seconds the blond is enveloped in azure coloured smoke, which dispersed to reveal an Emma now only a couple of inches tall. ''Oh shit'' Emma blurted before being grabbed by Regina and lifted up to her grinning face ''Oh it would be so easy for me to end you like this'' she said licking her lips and smirking at Emma's shudder of fear ''But first I think I need to thank the person who's magic was vital to shrinking you'' Regina chirps and opens her blouse, Emma not even trying to look away as she reaches into her cleavage and pulls you out surprised to see her in Regina's other hand ''Donal you were a vital, though unfortunately non willing part of my plan, which as you can see went perfectly. Now, what to do with you both?'' Regina mused, having already decided but enjoying yours and Emma's looks of panic too much to resist.</span></div></div>",

And about you...well, as this scale was your normal size, it' s only fair you serve the whims of the bigger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Regina i know you don't like me but this is going too far !!

The little blonde felt disgusted but couldn't even wip the redlipstick mixed with the saliva from her face, as her arms were held all along her body in Regina's fist. The giant woman then put you in the hand with Emma, so she had one hand free. She then licked a fingertip from her free hand and put it on Emma's face to remove the lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's done, Regina looked at her watch. \" Oh i still have work to do...but don't think i'm gonna put somewhere in my home while i'm working.

She walked toward a desk and took the handbag from it, then she put you inside and closed the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad to be free again, your body started to get warm and wet for being held for so long in Regina's hand.

That's not a common day !\". She shouted.

While in there she remembered MM had interrupted you guys planning your sleeping arrangements, so Emma thinking as quickly as possible came up with a temporary solution for at least tonight, which would let you both sleep easy and keep your body warm (she'd read somewhere that smaller creatures lose heat quicker than larger ones, and she wasn't about to test the theory)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removes her panties, wraps your <i>'so deep you're out fucking cold</i>' sleeping body in them, securely but loose enough you can breathe easily in them,  before pulling out a shoe box and putting your bundle between the only pair of high heels she owns. She then puts back on the lid and continues stripping into her own sleep wear and getting into bed herself, able to sleep easy knowing you were safe and secure, though she did have one dream where she'd put the panties back on instead of putting them in the shoe box.</span></div></div>",

At this point you had both gotten used to it and Emma even managed to sneak you a piece of the <i><b>''We're so glad you're not a whore, home wrecker &amp; a murderer''</b></i> cake as well as a more unintentional taster when a blob of icing fell down her shirt, though you did wait till you were alone before licking it off her breasts. All in all you now had a routine: during the week because MM was in school Emma left you in the main room if you weren't spending the day with her, while on weekends she'd lock her door and you'd usually read through Henry's storybook (which he'd left there in a not so subtle attempt to make Emma believe. You knew Regina was more subtle than that but Emma was potentially that blunt, so chalk one up to nature instead of nurture)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You'll never guess what happened today'' Emma said to you as she entered the apartment ''What?'' You ask as she picks you up and places you on the table ''Regina was actually quite civil, she even gave me a turnover'' Emma answered opening the plastic container the kitchen area is engulfed in an apple-y scent ''Well it's definitely Regina's cooking'' you comment to which Emma raises an eyebrow in question after retrieving a knife ''And you know that because?'' ''Red apples have a softer, sweet scent and taste, green apples are sharper'' you answer watching her cut the tip off the turnover.<br>\r\n''Well I say we share this lovely gift from Henry's mom, head out for a week and come back hopefully with less crazy in this town'' Emma offers, pushing the smaller piece towards you. You smile and nod thinking it sounds like a good idea.<br>\r\nJust as Henry arrives to stop them...</span></div></div>",

You also managed to get to sleep without being crushed by her cheeks or slipping inside her arse, mostly by once again trying not to move and remain calm till the rhythm of Emma's body lulled you into unconsciousness (surprisingly it did work)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Next morning</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma woke up feeling much better than when she fell asleep, though in her still groggy state of play almost yelped when she felt something nudge against her asshole... then the previous day came back (friendly reminder, everything in this section of the interactive took place over 1 day, 1 day and everything in Emma's life turns on it's head): missing person, finding him shrunk, Donal is Tom Thumb, Henry's book is real, D makes an nice ass cushion, oh yeah she left him in her panties. Slowly Emma reaches behind her and pulls your still sleeping/unconscious, sweat soaked body out of her ass crack and laid you on her palm, the light causing you to groan in pain and sit up.

She noticed Emma's attention was particularly focus on her but it made quite a bit of sense. She'd given herself access to Miss Swan's internet history quite a while back and it was filled with giant brunettes, particularly those of the busty variety (a box she'd ticked even before her growth spurt). It was then she realised Miss Swan might make a good pet/plaything for when she was done destroying her nemesis, someone to amuse herself with and to take care of Henry when he was in places she would be unable to go. It probably wouldn't be that difficult, Hell if she offered the blond her tits she might turn <i>'Team Regina' in </i>front of her own parents. While on this train of thought she made a mental note to extend a similar offer to Ruby, as the lanky wolf had made up a number of her fantasies, most of whom involved calling her to her office and fucking her on the desk (at least until Emma showed up, then she became the only person Regina mentally threw onto her desk, spanked repeatedly and then humped her face to completion)<br>\r\n''Mom'' Henry yelled somewhere from the crowd breaking Regina from her thoughts, as she crouched into a frog like position to better see the idiots at her door, when she heard him she snorted <b>''Mom?

Emma went up the stairs as far as she could, up until the roof prevented ascension ''This looks like it's moveable, just need to push the right way... oh crap'' when she tried to move the lid to the right the entire area turned a violent shade of purple and Emma found herself on her back at the bottom of the stairs <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ow' Emma groaned rubbing the back of her head ''It seems mom doesn't want us leaving right now does she?'' Emma was unsure if Henry was joking or not so just nodded in agreement, then noticed the worried frown on his face ''Hey kid, what's wrong?''<br>\r\n''Mom is going to hurt people again isn't she?'' he asked timidly surprising the blond ''Yes Henry, she is. But as far as I can tell there was a war with Regina on one side...'' ''and your parent's on the other'' Henry finished reminding Emma of the fact that yes Snow White &amp; Price charming were her parents, who shoved her in a tree when she was born so she would grow up to save their asses.<br>\r\n''Yes they were on the other side. Now this isn't a justification for what any of them are doing but while Regina did do bad things to them, they also must have done bad things to her. Basically let's stay out of this, don't know why she let me sit this one out, thought she'd love a free pass to <i>'accidentally crush me'' </i>Emma wondered aloud, even air quoting accidentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rather confused by Henry's muffled laughter, which upon turning around was due to him covering his mouth in an attempt to contain it <br>\r\n''What's so funny kid?'' Henry gave a grin that was 100% Regina <br>\r\n''You can't see it can you Ma? Mom likes you'' Emma's eyes widened in shock and disbelief <br>\r\n''Are you kidding me kid, she fucking hates me!'' <br>\r\n''No she thinks you were going to take her away from her, other than that she thinks you're pretty okay'' <br>\r\n''Then why does she insult me every chance she gets?'' <br>\r\n''She insults everyone bar me, even Archie is the best at 'woolly touchy feely crap' in Mom's words'' <br>\r\n''So your mom actually likes me?'' Henry rolls his eyes in another distinctively Regina like fashion <br>\r\n''She poofed you in here with me, she definitely likes you''<br>\r\nEmma thought this new information and a smile graced her features too, maybe things weren't so one sided between them after all, she was sure there was some rather heavy flirting between the 2 of them in between arguing over Henry, and she was also almost certain several of the meeting they'd had both in her office and the Sheriff's department contained eye-sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now back with Regina now she has those she cared about safe behind a magical barrier (which given her new more powerful magic would be difficult for even the Dark One to break through) how does she deal with her enemies?</span></div></div>",

No offense Henry but that's pretty stupid. I mean from the little bits I've seen of this town it didn't really seem like everyone was miserable. As well everyone does bad things and maybe some of the people she killed were not as innocent as you may think.

Maybe your just saying this because she has killed someone close to you.\" Morgan said causing Henry to bite his lip before replying. \"Actually she's my adopted mom.\" \"Then you of all people should know that she isn't evil since she raised you, what evil person adopts a child and raises them?\" Morgan asked to Henry \"Well what about you, when the people you knew become giants did they become evil?\" Henry asked avoiding the question. \"No they didn't become evil but it would be difficult for them to live because it would require immense amounts of food as well shelter large enough to fit them.\" Morgan explained finding it funny that if the women he knew did become evil as well he would of obviously told Henry right off the bat. The boys continued walking in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Fe Dimension.<br>\r\n \"Robin when will be able to go back Ylisse?\" Lissa asked to her towering sister in law. \"Not until Morgan gets back to fix our size, thankfully Chrom won't be to suspicious since we are in the female only camping trip.\" Robin, who was a little over Regina's current height replied. \"Well I hope he gets here soon because if I go any longer without food I'm gonna eat someone.\" Lissa grumbled but was gently smacked in the head by Robin. \"Don't joke like that\" \"But you eat Morgan I don't know how many times.\" Lissa said rubbing her head \"That's because whenever Morgan gets eaten he's under a shrink spell that makes him invincible.\" Robin explained to Morgan thinking back to how all this began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (insert small number) days earlier<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone  this marks the first female only camp out of the shepherds.\" Robin announced standing in front of all the shepherds who were able to make it (basically everyone except Flavia, Anna, and Say'ri) \"Now this week is supposed be fun, so after we get all our tents set up go play games or what not.\" Robin said before the crowd separated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was reading a book in her tent which she shared with Lucina. \"Uh Robin, I think I need to tell you something.\" Robin looked up to see Severa, \"Sure what is it?\" \"Well while I was in the castle I saw that Morgan's door was opened a bit so I looked in and saw that Aversa shrunk Morgan and put him in her.... pillows.\" Severa said blushing a bit, Robin sighing in response. \"Thank you for telling me this, have you told anyone else yet?\" Robin asked standing up, \"No, because than Lucina would find out and this was supposed to be the day I was going to ask Lucina out since she wouldn't end up focusing on Morgan.\" Severa explained blushing once she realized what she said. \"Did you say ask out Lucina?\" \"Uh, yeah speaking of which do you know if she's gay or not?\" Severa asked Robin only shrugging in response before leaving the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aversa, we need to talk\" Robin said as she walked up behind Aversa's back putting a hand on her shoulder. \"What is it sister dearest?\" Aversa asked to turning to face the woman. \"You have Morgan in you cleavage don't you?\" Robin asked Aversa biting her lip in response. \"Yes I do\" Aversa said meekly which was very rare, Robin sighing. \"Normally I wouldn't mind this, but this is supposed to be females only, why did you do this?\" Robin asked Aversa now tearing up. \"I was worried you or Lucina wouldn't want to hand out with me and Morgan is the only other person who likes me. He's still asleep so I can get on my Pegasus and take him back since I know Chrom was planning on doing father son stuff with him.\" Aversa explained more tears streaming down her face. \"He can stay just don't tell anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan unfortunately was discovered as he was unshrunk so he could go relieve himself and was seen by Kjelle as he was walking back to Aversa's tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA valmese dark mage who had learned that her father was killed by Robin during the war and was bent in revenge, hidden behind a bush she cast a supposed death curse, smiling when Robin hit the ground screaming in pain while on her knees. The smile was soon replaced with a grimace as she saw pink dust go over the queen now becoming a giant but her eyes were flickering between red and brown still screaming in pain but not from the curse. Eventually Robin had enough slamming her balled up hands on the ground the shockwave somehow causing the other female shepherds to become giant, thankfully afterwords Robin was fine. Sully had ended up finding the Valmese and drop kicked her. The shepherds tried to carry on as normal believing that the spell would wear off. Eventually Severa begged Morgan to try and do something the boy saying he was going to try and find a cure, and ran off into the forest yet to been seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made it, lets go inside.\" Morgan said as he and Henry walked into the vault<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Morgan stops when he hears Regina gasp 'Hmm?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You said Grima right? Of the shadow triad? Fell, Kaos and Cipher?' Regina asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um probably, but in Plegia she's known as the dragon goddess, her bloodline producing the strongest and most beautiful mages and leaders in their county's history. Mom doesn't talk about it much but Aunt V and Tharja are practicing Grimleal so I learnt all this directly from them'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Grima's magic protected your mother and somehow grew all of the women in the area?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, don't know what the witch that attacked mom was trying to do, Aversa wasn't exactly gentle with her after trying to kill her sister, plus Grima's power definitely supercharged her dark magic, there was a KABOOM and everything' Morgan finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dark magic?' Regina asked, surprised such an innocent boy could talk about it so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, Aversa and Tharja are practitioners, mom is a former practitioner since becoming Queen of Ylsie as they're wary of stuff like that,  and my best friend is an apprentice of both her dark mage parents. It's just another school of magic back home, which I'm guessing it isn't over here, which is too bad as you have all the markers of a sorceress, and a Plegian too, you'd fit right in'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'd fit right in ay?' Regina seemed interested by the sound of that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep you're a dark mage, tall and magically powerful, what was it Uncle Gregor called Aversa..... <b>rocking tits</b> was Gaius and that sounds bad, oh yeah the <i><b>'A Plegian ideal, the peak of fertility'</b></i> which from what I can tell fits you too as if you were blond I'd think you were Aunt Aversa, well minus the Grimleal tattoo over her bosom but I can't see that part of you so maybe you have something there too' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina laughs 'You are a strange little boy with an even stranger world over the horizon. I wish I could see that place when this is all over. My curse was meant to be 1 part revenge to 10 parts fresh start but that's all gone to shit with the curse breaking' she grumbles the last part forgetting her size meant both boys heard her clearly Morgan sympathetic while Henry feeling guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why don't you come back with me? You get a new beginning you always wanted, somewhere people will respect you and all the baggage can stay in this realm' Morgan suggested 'Henry could come too, it'd be nice to have someone my age around'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't go, I can't leave Emma after all the time it took to find her and I don't want to abandon her like everyone else has' Henry answers sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm afraid my decision will be similar thought it does sound like a wonderful option. I can't lose my son, not when I fought so hard to bring him back to me' Regina says as Morgan adopts a <i>'thinking face'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Morgan's idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) <i><b>'Then Emma can come too'</b></i> With the curse broken everyone Emma knew has been revealed to have never really existed... except Regina and Henry. Morgan suggests asking Emma if she would come with them, maybe have a chance to start a real family where there are no Evil Queens or Saviours to get in the way.<br>\r\n2) <i><b>'Anna could make a waypoint'</b></i> When all this is over Morgan could get Anna to construct a portal linking FE to OUAT, allowing Regina to get her fresh start and Henry to keep Emma sane, while also alternating between both realities and therefore both of his mothers.</span></div></div>",

So Emma is probably now in a town full of strangers... and you guys, and this is probably me talking but choosing between a world of strangers and a town of strangers that look just like people you've known for over a year is no contest. Clean break if you will'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Makes sense' Regina says after a few minutes, surprised how well thought out this apparently on the spot idea was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Emma?' Regina chuckles when Henry tries to give her a puppy dog pout (Something she was sure the cute but stubborn blond taught him)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll bring her here, much easier than causing more panic' she says as she sits down before with a flick of her wrist another cloud of smoke appears beside them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Meanwhile thousands of miles away..... just kidding. Wherever Emma is</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma groaned as she sat in the background, head between her legs and praying nobody was looking for her: this day was the roller-coaster from Hell, first she thought Regina was finally calming the fuck down and understanding she wasn't trying to steal their kid from her, she even got desert which was always a bonus, but then Henry ate some and he fell into a coma, she tossed Regina around a little in a medical closet, found out the world was a lie, was nearly killed by a dragon she was pretty sure was also Regina's ex, killed said dragon with a fucking sword, her son 'died' then woke up when she kissed his forehead, accidentally broke a curse, and now she's stuck in a room with the people who abandoned her in another reality to come save their asses, plotting to kill Henry's mother who had suddenly become a super hot giantess, as well as expected to play happy families with her own mother as if nothing happened at all. She wished she could see even a hint of her friend in the pixie cut haired woman but there was nothing, just Queen Snow of the White Kingdom, enemy of the Evil Queen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You alright there pup?' Emma tilted her head to see the currently only tolerable person in this room, at least Ruby had changed very little besides her mannerisms... okay Red was a Hell of a lot calmer than Ruby ever could be and she used canine terms like pup, pack, mate, and litter (that last one aimed at the brunette that came in when David summoned Mr. Gold and Mother Superior to assist them with dealing with Regina) but she could see Regina's curse did very little to change her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why do you ask, Snow fishing again?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was chosen as your godmother Emma, I'm allowed worry' Red smiles and Emma chuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You do realise I'm older than you right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, but that doesn't not make you part of my pack. I may not be your mate and I can smell you're not mine, but I can worry about you just as much until we find them' the lanky werewolf ruffles her hair affectionately, Emma smiling as she attempts to stop her... until she sighs and stands up, it seems the dwarves were tired of waiting and were trying to make a stand against Regina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oy stop right there!' she yells, standing in front of the newly forming mob<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Step aside sister, this is between us and the Queen. We need to take her down before she does something to destroy us once and for all' the leader of the mob, this time Leroy/Grumpy rather than Whale grunted as her tried stepping past her, but Emma wouldn't budge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, for one there is no chance of you guys doing anything against her right now considering all you have are pitchforks and rocks... I don't even want to know where you got them from. We need to take a deep breath ...' Emma was interrupted when she was taken in a plume of purple smoke, Ruby sneaking out in the confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'.... and calm the fuck down. Wait where am I?' Emma asks, turning repeatedly in a circle in confusion, Morgan trying to hold in the giggles while he looked up at Regina's grinning face and saw she was in agreement. It was this moment the witch found a reason to agree with Henry that Emma was like Supergirl, both were adorable blond puppies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey mom I think you broke her' Henry calls up, drawing everyone's attention to him as he was pulled into a hug by his birth mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HENRY! Oh I'm so glad to see you, I mean I knew Regina would never hurt you but I still worry' she rambled as she held him close, her mind skipping a side effect of her magic... one both Regina and Morgan were well aware of<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So magic affect's the body in that way over here too huh?' Morgan muses and Regina has to agree, Emma's chest had practically ballooned since this morning, and while not at Aversa's level or even Tharja or Robin's (of which Regina is part of), the young tactician guessed they were on par with his sister Lucina or not so secret crush Noire.... so still quite big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I'm actually surprised her shirt could survive that much rapid grow... hey wait a minute that's one of mine' Regina complained half heartedly, Morgan could tell there was no bite to them, like when Severa acts offended to something Lucina, Noire, Kjelle or himself says playfully. 'In all seriousness we need to get her to let go before she suffocates him' Regina says and Morgan nods in agreement 'Ms Swan!' she yells 'While I'm sure your breasts are quite impressive, I don't think our son needs to see them that closely'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment has the expected result, Emma immediately lets go with a bright red blush, while Henry falls to the ground drawing in lungful's of oxygen greedily, his face also red in a mix of embarrassment and asphyxia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Emma darling, we have a proposition for you... well Morgan does' this draws the blond's eyes to the small blue haired boy in the strange but well made and maintained coat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm listening'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sure you know how badly things are for Regina at the moment?' nod 'Well I need her help in shrinking the rest of my family, friends and my mom's friends and offered to take her back with me to stay when we were done. Plegia and to a lessor sense Ylisse would love a mage of Regina's calibre and without anyone from her old world she can get the real fresh start she wanted. The problem is that Regina won't leave without Henry and Henry won't leave without you. So to get to the pont of the argument, I'm inviting you to take a short trip to another world, with your son and Regina' Morgan explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh kid, I don't know what you've heard but me and Regina don't exactly get along' Emma sighed, she had thought they were getting better but then the whole turnover of death incident happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True but would you have gotten into any fights with Regina if she hadn't have gone all protective mama bear? Is there anything about Regina that you have a problem with other than her over reaction to you being with her son?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, Hell she's the kind of person I'd always wished would adopt me back then I was a kid, she's a wonderful mother to Henry, just a little bat sh.... little crazy at times' Emma corrects mid sentence, remembering there were kids present<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And if you weren't destined to break my curse and I reflexively lashed out in the hopes you'd leave, I'd have had no problem with you either' Regina admitted, surprising both Emma and Henry'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Emma, want to come with us to my world?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Note: If Emma says yes, can Ruby/Red come? She's probably one of the few people in town Emma can put up with right now, and it's a win-win for everyone, Emma gets her friend and Ruby gets to both leave Storybrooke and stay close to her pup]</span></div></div>",

Better making giant steak than them eating the villagers like Grima used to in the Ylssian stories' Severa explains, leaning back against Lucina's bust as she pokes at Morgan, the little guy squirming cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh okay. Hey I sort of invited some people into our reality, think Mom will be okay? Most of them are normal sized but one is about Tharja or mom's height with Aversa's cup size' Morgan announces, hoping his new friends will be accepted by his old friends and family, especially after saying to Regina that she'd be treated better here than back in Storybrooke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It should be fine, you're a great judge of character and...... she's a dark mage isn't she?' Lucina asks with a sigh Morgan always had a soft spot for those skilled in <b>that</b> school of magic, made obvious when you remember his favourite Shepherds are 3 practicing Grimleal witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um...yes' Morgan answers, Severa chuckles as she sees Lucina's eye roll out the corner of her own<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So when will they be here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Back in Storybrooke</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Everyone ready to go? Given how easily the portal was opened we should be able to return if we actually need anything but still' Regina asks, her 3 '<i>passengers</i>' sitting pretty in the palms of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're ready mom, let's go!' Henry cheers, Emma rolling her eyes as she wraps her arms around her son, Ruby giggling behind her as she links arms with Emma, pushing her perky chest into the blonde's spine, and her chin now resting on her unofficial cub's shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighs before psyching herself up 'Now I'm unfamiliar with this branch of magic, so I have no idea how this will work' she says as confidently as she could, stepping gently into the area that contained the portal's magic, which flowed up her leg and enveloped the group in electric blue smoke, all of them feeling the tremors of crossing the dimensional barriers within their very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry came too in a position he had found himself in only a little while previous, with his head nestled between Emma's still expanding breasts. After some squirming and wriggling he managed to awaken Emma who loosened her grip enough for him to pull himself free and breathe fresh air, sweet apple scented air...ah crap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um mom, where are we?' her asked Emma who smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well kid I'm currently somewhere similar to where you were a second ago' her grin just grew as Henry tilted his head above Emma to see the bottom of Regina's jaw 'The good news is they're firm and just a perky as I imagined' Henry's cray of <b>'Mom!'</b> had the former saviour laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Finally awake my prince?' Regina's voice boomed in it's proximity startling him 'Oh and Miss Swan, I can hear everything' Henry noticed Emma gulp nervously 'Of course they're soft, firm and perky, they're that size because of my magical level, they don't sag for that same reason' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, well... good to know. Hey where's Ruby?' Emma asked, Regina's cleavage may be spacious but they'd notice a 3rd occupant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Give me a moment' Regina answers, the duo bouncing a little as she breasts react to the movement of the rest of her body 'There we go' she says, dropping Ruby onto her breast, the were grinning drunkenly at the mother son duo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey guys. Regina let me tell you your ass is a perfect 10, but these tits are at least 11star loveliness' she rubs the mound she was lying on affectionately 'You guys are so lucky' she grins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well enough admiring me, let's find Morgan' Regina announces, then she sniffs, her eyes glow and her nose twitches 'There he is'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow I'm a wolf and my senses aren't that good' Ruby notes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I am aware of his magical signature, he's just over there, not difficult for an accomplished mage' Regina explains/brags<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh can I try?'

Emma blushes in embarrassment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey look, giant women and a little blue thing in a fancy coat, that them?' Ruby asks, acting as lookout for the other small people as they couldn't see much over Regina's blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan is this your friend?' Lucina asks as she stands up, Severa reluctantly following with Morgan on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep. Hi Regina, where are the others? Morgan calls then asks, Regina smiling slightly before pointing to her breasts, Severa actually being the one to laugh before Morgan did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh she's definitely a Plegian in the making, not just physically but the mind-set as well' she says, Lucina and Morgan both quietly agreeing with her, the others not sure what the redhead meant by it so couldn't comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

I don't know about everyone but I'm sure you'll get along great with the Plegians' Morgan suggests hopping onto Lucina's shoulder and pointing out to the distance, gently tugging on her hair to get her to move<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I suppose, you ready?' Regina peeks down to her normal sized companions who nodded, Ruby crawling up to Regina's shoulder, sitting against her neck to watch the journey<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey took about 20 minutes before there was anything worth seeing, but wow was it an impressive one. The castle was huge even by Regina's current scale, done tastefully with familiar feelings to her own castle in the enchanted forest. She listened to Ruby describing the sights as the duo were too deep in Regina's cleavage and covered by the witch's blouse, while Morgan chatted in her direction about how everyone was going to react to a new arrival while Severa was not so subtly staring at her with suspicion in her eyes, Lucina at least having the job of leading them to their home so was too busy to glare at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Welcome Ms Mills and co, to the goddess palace, or at least that's the current title for the moment according to Aversa' Lucina waves her hand when they reach the entrance to the castle, the keeps walking through. 'Mother, Morgan's back and he brought company' she yells 'You stay here, we'll be right back with the others' she say to Regina, before the 2 FE giantess disappear within the castle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighs as she sits in one of the chairs she finds, removing Emma and Henry from her bra and placing them on her lap, Ruby sliding down her arm to join them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're really pretty' a cute, slightly high pitched voice says, Regina turned to see a short (compared to her) girl with blond hair and pointed ears, her chest barely covered but luckily there was little to cover 'I'm Nowi, who are you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Regina Mills, I was invited to this world by Morgan...' Regina begins to elain but the girl bouncing around stops her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan's back! Yay!' Nowi cheers happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, now little one, calm down'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes mother, act your age for once'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group look behind Nowi to see an older looking woman with green hair along side a sullen looking red head with features similar to Nowi, who was currently pouting like the child she appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nah Morgan's back, isn't that great?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For Noire maybe, my boyfriend didn't go into another dimension to get away from me' the red head snarked, a rabbit looking creature peaking out of her hair at the comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did somebody mention me?' it asked, cooing when Nah picks him up and stokes him in her hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well it appears you're already met the manaketes, good work' a wise sounding voice said with an audible smile. Regina turned and stood, scooping up the others as she did. The room was now host to a much larger group, but other than Lucina and Severa (as well as a couple people who bared slight resemblances to either) the rest were all strangers, though she could tell the woman wearing a cloak identical except scale to Morgan was A) the speaker and B) his mom. It was confirmed when her eyes caught a little blue on her bust which turned out to be a relaxed and smiling Morgan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello everyone, I am Regina Mills, my companions are Henry, my son, Emma his birth mother, and Ruby a werewolf and friend of Emma's family' Regina greets, as well as gently placing the others on a table that Morgan had just been moved to (though he seemed less happy about it than Henry and co were).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Regina, I am Robin and I'm sure you already met my children, Morgan and Lucina. My son was telling me about your situation and I welcome you to our home' Robin smiled in greeting, and pulled Regina into a hug, Henry and Emma glad they'd been moved or else the collision of that much bounciness would, have been suffocating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Be nice to have another mage other than Tharja and golem' was muttered by the woman Regina noticed was taller than the rest and had a magical aura that felt like a mix of Rumple and Maleficent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aversa behave' Robin hissed and Aversa just grinned widely 'You'll need to forgive my sister, she's not great with people'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina waves it off with a laugh 'It's fine Robin. I think we'll get along well, she reminds me of an old friend' she explains and Robin nods while Aversa smirks in amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anyway you've already met the manakete trio, Nowi, Tiki and Nah, the latter of which is the daughter of the first.... don't get me to explain manakete aging it confuses me' Robin points to the 3 dragon girls (well 2 dragon girls and one dragon lady)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Next we have Sully, former knight of Ylisse, probably future when things calm down, and her daughter Kjelle'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sup bitch' the tomboyish red head greets with a smirk, while the turquoise haired girl nods politely, though Regina notices she has a surprisingly thin frame for someone at least partly wearing the armour of a high class knight of the kingdom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Be glad she wasn't fully equipped when we grew, the doors wouldn't allow her girth then' a seductively dressed and dark aura'd woman teased, the white haired, bony-minus-boobs framed girl behind her blushed as all eyes focused on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mother!' she hissed while Kjelle just shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's right though, the shoulder pads in the armour is huge' she states with a much smoky/gravely voice than Regina expected<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighs 'The snark fairy is my friend Tharja, her daughter Noire is the tall one trying to hide behind her mother' Robin supplied the names to Regina who nodded and they continued on 'Next we have my sister in law Lissa and her friend Marribelle' 2 blond women nod, Regina could see they were nobility though only the right one actually acted like it, the other behaving like a mix of idiot Snow and herself pre Daniel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then we have Cynthia and her mother Sumia' she pointed to an energetic looking girl and a light haired woman in white/pinkish armour<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Miss Mills it's lovely to meet whoa!' Sumia greets but trips as she tries to shake her hand, being caught by Robin, Regina and Lucina, luckily before she could hit the ground or knock over the table the normal sized people were standing on'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And that is why she's confined to the castle' a red head Regina knew instantly was Severa's mother commented, a woman with....rabbit ears? snorted, though whether it was amusement or a sign she was giving up was anyone's guess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah there you guys are, glad you actually join us. This is Cordelia, Severa's mother, and Panne, the last female Taguel, or rabbit shifter' Cordelia nods while Panne sneer's baring her teeth at the strange woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh great, here we go again' the rabbit formerly in Nah's arms, now the table groaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lastly we have Cherche, interestingly the only rider in our group whose mount grew with them, her wyvern Minerva is now the size of a true dragon. Personally I suspect it's due to the familiar bond but we just don't know' Robin shrugged while the pink haired girl smiled at Regina and the others<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A hem' a throat clearing drew everyone attention to the woman sitting in Regina's chair with a book in hand and stereotypical witch's hat on her head 'You forgot someone grandmaster'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh shoot, this is Muriel, former chief researcher to Exalt Chrom, my husband' Robin introduces, the woman merely grunting from behind her book<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now there are a lot of things that need doing so maybe we should send Henry off with Morgan and the kids to get a tour of the castle while we discuss how things will go from now on with you, Emma and Ruby. Though upon saying that, I don't know what the time difference between worlds is and you look a little tired Regina. Maybe we can find you guys a room to share and worry about the future tomorrow' the grandmaster/Queen offered, Regina turning to Emma who shrugged, leaving the decision up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Bring me some of the magic used and I'll send you wherever you want to go' she demanded, knowing the fairies were unable to assist in this regard so Snow and her ilk HAD to follow his orders if they wanted to get the portal open again 'Oh and for the record, Regina's gone' he adds, spurring the princess on as she yells at the dwarves to find the portal's location as well as the fairies to collect the magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will you be able to actually make the portal?' Belle asks when they leave 'After all you needed the curse to get us here'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True love, but unlike here she's probably sent herself to a world that actually had magic, which I can make portals to fairly easily. I just need the magic to know exactly where I'm sending them' he explains, sitting on a nearby chair, waiting for the idiots to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while but eventually they came back with a vial of strange, foreign magic, which Rumple pours out and performs several hand gestures to tear open a swirling portal in the air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There you go dearies, good luck and don't argue with me if there are problems on the other side' he smirks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

The one who had spoken was Chrom. \"Yes I suppose we are, might I ask who you are?\" David asked politely wanting to make sure his wife wouldn't piss anybody off. \"I am prince Chrom of Ylisse and these are my shepherds.\" Chrom answered waving his hand towards the shepherds Kellam waving his wand (not that anyone saw him) \"If you are a prince than what are you doing out here in the wilderness?\" Snow asked David mentally face palming, slightly wondering why he left Katherine for Snow. \"Well, we are here to visit our wives and daughters who due to a curse that happened they can't stay in the castle until the builders have finished renovating it.\" Chrom said, a light bulb going off in Snow's mind. \"Hey you wouldn't happen to know if a brown haired giantess was the one to cast the curse?\" Snow asked Chrom shaking his head no. \"No but what the curse did was turn them into giantesses here you and your group can come along on our visit.\" Chrom offered getting a nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they managed to reach the goddess castle's entrance where Morgan was. \"Hey Dad!\" Morgan said cheerfully hugging his father. \"Hey there kiddo anything exciting?\" \"Yep, I actually brought some people into this reality, one of them is a giant like mom and sis, her names Regina!\" At that Snow punched Morgan in the face with the force to give him a bloody nose. \"You son of b!tch, you let the Evil Queen into your realm, we start with this boy here who let Regina escaped!\" Snow shouted the others in her group shouting as well. \"You are going to regret touching my son.\" Snow looked up to see Robin, Lucina, Aversa and a good portion of the other female shepherds giving a death stare to Snow and her group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we all know that the Shepherds are going to win, what do they do with Snow and her group</span></div></div>",

Then there's the fact other than his bruised face there's no real damage done so they think capture and imprisonment will be enough' she says pointing to Morgan who poked his nose and lets out a small yelp of <b>OW</b> 'Plus, why would I ruin this figure when I can just spoil you guys and anoint you my heirs in the future?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan, don't do that!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But my nose itches' he whines, pouting cutely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well ignore it until the swelling goes down' Lucina grumbles, just before pulling Morgan close to her bosom as a dark, foreboding wave of KI sweep the castle and the door nearest them practically swings off it's hinges<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where's that little bitch that dared to hurt such an innocent child?' Regina growled, her magic swirling visibly around her, Olivia (carrying Henry) running nervously behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well it appears Regina's been informed that freshly driven was here' Aversa jokes, apparently unaffected by Regina's outburst, aura or rage, she was, it's just she's impressed rather than afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I had to, she seems to have practically adopted Morgan herself, plus he didn't deserve what gran...Snow did' Henry admitted as Olivia placed him on the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Flashback</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'MOM, MOM, MOM!'

He bounced off it as expected but this at least got a groan from nearby (whether it was Regina, Emma or even Ruby he didn't know) 'Mom Snow White arrived and she hit Morgan'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WHAT!' Henry's landscape rotated 90 degrees, causing him to plummet and collide with Emma and Ruby in Regina's cleavage as she sat up, waking the other 2 in the process 'What did you say just happened?' she asked, plucking him from her breasts and bringing him up to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Snow, Charming, Granny, Archie, the dwarves and some fairies came to this world and were outside the gates, something happened and she punched Morgan which set everybody off. Then she demanded they hand you over to her, preferably shrunken and they'd reward them by leaving. Grandma's gone nuts' Henry explains, not getting any further as he slips from Regina's fingers, bounced off her chest and landed between her thighs. The former mayor looked to be frozen in shock, until her hands and teeth clenched and she stood up, storming out of the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh dear, that won't end well' Henry turns to the woman they'd seen sleeping earlier, Olivia 'Hello, I'm O-Olivia' she stutters slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm Henry, sorry about Mom, she's very protective of things she likes' he tries to explain, eyes drawn to her long pink hair being teased by the dancer's long fingers. He doesn't realise he was staring until he looks at her face and sees she's blushing a deep red<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're staring quite hard little guy, I-I'm old enough to be your mother' she says with a blush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then you look good for your age, besides I know both my moms and Ruby are very good looking and I'm at the age I finally start noticing stuff like this' Henry apologizes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Both... oh you're Plegian they have such interesting uses for magic these days. Sorry about that, yes your mother is quite delicious looking, her partner is so lucky' Olivia smiles lightly and Henry blinks. He wanted to deny some of her assumptions, but she was right in a sense, at the very least that Regina was practically  Plegian if Morgan was anything to go on, Hell if they needed citizenship maybe that's where they'd get it. 'So should we follow her before she breaks something?' the dancer asks, lowering her cupped hands to Henry's level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, best to get damage control out of the way and as close to him as possible' he grins as she picks him up and follows the brunette out and towards the main rooms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>End Flashback</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalm down Regina, Snow and her minions got away, it's just 4 innocents they decided to leave with us' Aversa explains as Robin enters the room with their '<i>prisoners</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Charming?

Oh my girl at least tell me before you go off to another world. Also lay off the drink you smell like a brewery' she scolds, causing Ruby to giggle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Regina, all that Cider is messing with your magic it seems' she teases, causing Regina to sigh annoyingly and retrieve Emma from her cleavage and drop her on the table too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Archie, this as weird for you as it is for the rest of us?' she asks, trying to straighten out her clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not really, this is the scale I'm actually most comfortable at, I'm about cricket sized to most of the women here' he answers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry to cut this short but I needed to borrow Aversa because Tharja's paranoia mean she locked the door to the dungeon with a magic lock keyed to my sister's signature. So yeah, the door won't budge till she opens it for me' Robin explains her reasons for appearing, Aversa chuckles before picking up Astrid and Archie, while Robin takes David and Granny 'If you wish to speak with your family members we can allow you a few minutes, then you can accompany Regina to a meeting about where these people could be hiding and what they may do... especially as we've agreed not to actively hunt them down and murder them... which I'm told is the old Plegian way when someone messes with your family' Aversa's happy nod tells them all they need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now, and who do we stick to for the moment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Emma with David and then the meeting<br>\r\n2) Henry with the kids (giant and normal) while they try make Morgan feel better after getting punched and his worries about messing up by inviting Regina to their world</span></div></div>",

Lissa asks, a little worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well until such time as the scouts find something all we can do is wait.

Where's Henry?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm bringing Morgan up for some family bonding to cheer him up.

Maleficent asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine. Everyone this is Mal, she and I...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We were lovers, Gina was very good at it by the way.

Well in that case' she lowers her body enough to knock Emma onto her back with her nipple, then leans down so the 2 blonds were almost face to face 'I think I'll take my chances with this lovely lady. So Emma, ever made a lady....' her flirting was cut short by Regina pushing her head into the brunette's cleavage, her sigh turning into a groan when Mal wriggles free and start actually sucking on the bouncy boob, smirking around it when she sees how it affects Emma and Ruby so deeply, Henry's blush was expected, given she was playing with his mother's chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

Lucina gasped gently picking Morgan up and softly kissed him before sliding her brother into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Lucina turned around staring daggers at Henry \"you pushed my brother off a table, while I'm not allowed to punish you, I can however bring you to someone who is!\" Lucina shouted tightly gripping Henry in her hand before running to where the adults were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina slammed open the door and marched to where Regina was standing and dropped Henry. \"You're brat of a son pushed my little brother off a table!\" Lucina said everyone now looking at Henry. \"Henry is this true?\" Regina asked \"Yes it is and I\"</span></div></div>",

She then turns to Robin who was examining Morgan 'Will he be okay?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah he'll be fine, like he said he's practically indestructible, it's just the fall was sore. He'll be fine in a little while' she answers before sliding Morgan into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sighed in relief, though the feeling was shot lived as about 5 heavy books landed ontop of his shrunken form, shortly followed by Emma flopping into the nearby chair and restin gher head against the pile (being too big to lean on) 'Damn, why do magical books all have to be the weight of car tires, and why did nobody help?' she grumbled her question as Aversa chuckles behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Henry!'

Good work Emma' Regina says sarcastically, then pulls down her top to secure Henry within her own cleavage, Emma blushing and turning away while she does so. Once he was secure Regina pulled it back up and tapped Emma ont he shoulder 'Emma, while what you did hurt him it was obviously an accident. Just don't do it again' the hissed the last part causing Emma to nod her head violently 'Good' Regina almost chipper, kissing Emma's temple before grabbing the book at the top of the pile 'Off to work Swan, these books won't read themselves'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 hours later they'd emptied the entire library/archives of relevant books and...</span></div></div>",

The magic' Morgan asked in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, this place doesn't have magic, at least not normally' Henry answered, causing Morgan to pout<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really? That sucks. But still there are a few sources of really powerful magic within the area this town occupies, one which isn't moving...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Which must be the vault' Henry guessed, getting a nod from the young mage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Correct and the other one... well that's weird'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? What happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was going to say the other one is moving around so must be a person but it's disappeared, which is strange as something that big shouldn't be able to just vanish' Morgan ran his fingers through his blue lock before smiling 'There it is.. oh dear' he meeps as a thick purple cloud fills the clearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry looks about ready to run when he feels Morgan grab his arm and a chill runs through his spine, turning to argue he finds nothing, then when he looks down on himself... there was nothing there either<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shh' Morgan hissed as the magic dissipates and Regina steps out of it, looking as pristine as ever minus some blood on her heels, Morgan being reminded of Tharja just before he'd been sent across dimensions 'Wow' he whispers 'You didn't tell me there was a sorceress in the town. Why didn't we just go to her?' he asks curious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's my mom, Regina the Evil Queen' Henry answers, feeling a little guilty for using all her titles 'What do you mean a sorceress?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Back home using a lot of dark magic causes red or purple eyes, Aunt Tharja and 'Versa, Uncle Henry even Mom pre-amnesia did a lot of dabbling, mom and V a lot more than that seeing as their affinity cards rot from the touch. A sorcerer/sorceress is an even stronger dark mage' Morgan explains quietly so as not to attract attention... not that it did any good as Regina's still bright purple eyes seemed to lock onto them and with a wave of her hand they were visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Henry?' She asks confused as she crouches down to see the boys 'How did you get out, the protection spell on the vault should have been impenetrable'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That would be me' Morgan volunteers 'Hi, I'm Morgan from what my friend calls the FE dimension, I nabbed Henry mid flight because I need help' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina's eyebrow raised before her once more brown eyes met her son's 'Henry, what do you think?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's telling the truth mom' Henry answers, he may still be mad at all the lying but the scare from thinking she was going to be killed reminded him he still loved her, she was still and would always be his mom 'Please help him' he pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighs 'Okay let's here this story, then I'm going to get you somewhere safe kiddo, most of the idiots scattered after some white haired chick appeared and grabbed Emma. At least Ruby's useful in that the wolf is searching for either scent' she mutters the last part but noticed Morgan stiffen 'Something wrong little one?' she asks feeling bad for the little cutie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The woman, did she have a bow, short white hair held with a headband and um a large... chest?' he asked with a deep blush on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina looked surprised at the description 'Actually yes'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naga's testicle' he mutters angrily and Regina feels the need to reprimand, assuming it was some kind of swear while Henry is a mix of worried and confused 'Okay I'm from a kingdom called Ylisse, though through my mom I'm technically a prince of Plegia because of Grima's brand on my spine like mom has on her hand and aunt V has just below her ribs. Anyway a witch from another kingdom known as Valm arrived and cast a curse on my mom trying to bend her to her kingdom's will. What she didn't expect was for it to activate Grima's magic, and mom expanded to ... probably just shy of twice your height' Morgan explains, his mind stuck in the memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Robin falls to her knees as the toxic green coloured magic filled her body, her pain filled grimace comparable to being burned from the inside out, just when it seemed the sorceress was victorious something snapped and a thick pink/purple smoke covered the queen and spread out, a faint cackling sounded from within that only grew louder with each passing moment. When the smoke cleared Robin was unharmed and HUGE, but that was not all: her snow white hair which was originally shoulder length now reached her behind, her light smile was now feral with pointed teeth and her eyes... all 6 were blood red and practically slits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>I LIVE AGAIN!</b>' she hissed a long tongue slipping past her thin lips as she grinned then looked down to the little witch who tried to control her <b>'GOODBYE LITTLE BUG'</b> she hissed before her tongue shot out and wrapped itself around her, the Vallise screamed as she was pulled back into the gapping maw, but not for long as blade like teeth made short work of her unarmoured flesh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The witch had awoken Plegia's dark goddess and she started to turn and corrupt most of the other females in our former group. Some she kept at normal size to function more subtly in places she couldn't, such as that girl, my friend Noire' Morgan sighed 'Whatever reason Noire has taken Emma it's definitely for my mother's bidding, Grima wants something and if needed she will come here looking for it'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay so dragon demon giantess from another reality possibly trying to get into Storybrooke. Why come to me, there are other magic users here and I'm not a good person' Regina asks, her heart twisting at the boys story, though she was confused by his amused chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was right' he grinned 'You are just like Aunt V, only the hair colour is different. Same magic, same 'body type', same outlook on themselves, all identical. Aunt V. Aversa fought in a war before I was born, don't know much details as I haven't gotten to recent history with Muriel, but she never understood why mom forgave her, took her in and lets her near her children. Mom says everyone  deserves a chance, that sometimes the worst things are done for good reasons or sometimes just because eof pain, but it doesn't mean you just abandon them' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina looked to be ready to tear up, Morgan seemed to have an attitude she wished Henry had, the moment the book sais she was evil she knew there was no swaying him, she was bad and the morons were good little heroes who shat rainbows. Still he was her son and she needed to keep him safe in case of incoming threats as well as the occasional idiot using him to hurt her. With a flick of her wrist Henry was covered in a blue aura, which confused him for a moment before being picked up and brought to face height<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom, what are you doing?' he asked worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Keeping you safe. Mommie loves you and this way I know you won't be sneaking around and getting hurt' Regina answered first giving him a small kiss the covered his face... before opening her mouth and sliding the boy inside, her tongue pushing him toward the back of her throat before he could try to stop him. Regina swallowed, her magic supressing her gag reflex enough for him to slide into her stomach without issue. Looking back at Morgan she was surprised to she he had not really reacted to what she'd just done 'What?' she mutters to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Plegian women use similar charms and spells as well, thought they usually shrink their child or lover rather than grow themselves' Morgan tells her as his explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina shrugs, the boy made sense after all 'Now what to do with you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your world is ravaged by a demon that is your mother's dark side correct?' she asks to which Morgan nods 'Then I think it's best you stay with me. If she comes through I'm the biggest person in Storybrooke so you're safest with me and if she doesn't... well you'll need a parental figure so why not me?' she smirked as the tactician began to panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But, but, but I came here to fix things, not stay' he argued but Regna still smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes but you've said yourself that you're fighting a god alone, you have no chance. I'll keep you safe and sound with me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I need to do this' Morgan protested as Regina sighed and grabbed him, bringing him up to eye level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You are brave but you are only 11. I will no let a child throw away their life because they're being stupid, you saw what I did to protect my own son'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah but...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you want to join him in my stomach, because if that's what it takes I will' Morgan sighs before agreeing 'I'll stay' to which Regina grins widely and gently kisses his little body 'In that case I think we should head home, the mansion has so many empty rooms I'm sure you will have many places to chose from' with her hand flat Regina began to walk from the cemetery back in the direction of her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes she noticed Morgan was staring at her breasts, which confused her mostly because he was too young to have an interest in them yet 'Um Morgan, what are you doing?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aunt Aversa always put me between her breasts when she shrinks me. I guess I simply assumed because you feel like her minus the blond hair that the same would occur, really I noticed they looked just as soft and squishy as Aversa and Tharja's and I guess I zoned out and just started staring. Sorry Miss' Morgan explained with a rapidly spreading blush, which Regina mirrored<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I'm not putting you between them, but I suppose I could just let you sit up here' Regina offered straightening out her suit. Morgan nodded in agreement and Regina gently deposited him on top of her chest, the boy gently swaying with her steps as she continued her journey<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later they arrived and it was Morgan's turn to comment 'Um Miss Regina'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How are you going to fit in there?' he asked pointing to where he assumed Regina and Henry's home was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina chuckled, causing Morgan to bounce around 'It's quite simple, I'll just have to make it more my size' she smiled and raised both hands, thick purple smoke covering a city block with the house in the centre. After a few minutes the smoke faded and Regina was standing outside the door of a house perfectly her scale 'The bedrooms may be a little big for you now, but both you and Henry are welcome to stay in my room if you like' Regina offered as the door opened into response to her magical signature (best security system ever)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Meanwhile</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ow' Emma groaned when she felt pain throb through her brain from a smack to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello dearie' a dual toned hiss greeted as her eyes opened finding a white haired woman grinning in front of her, the area around them and behind her cloaked in shadows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where am I?' she asked, the girl flashing a toothy grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Somewhere safe, somewhere we won't be disturbed while I get what I want. Oh and don't try screaming for help, I learnt a lot about privacy charms form mother and Mistress's gift made them practically impenetrable. Now' Noire hisses as she pushes Emma back into the chair she'd been tied to 'tell me about the magic of this world' Emma smiles slightly confusing Noire 'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Out of everyone in this crazy ass town you could've kidnapped, you picked the one person who knows fuck all about magic' she laughs before getting a kick to the gut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never mind, I will just drain the magic from you' she growls before stumbling, gripping her head, Emma wonders what happened until she noticed the spider web like cracks spreading through the barrier surrounding them. 'What is this magic?' she hisses, swinging her arm to dispel the barrier before it would swing back on her magical core. Emma gulped, when she saw the outside of the barrier she thought she had been shrunk... until she saw Noire looked just as confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina walked in to see something surprising in her kitchen: the white haired archer that had kidnapped her son's other mother, as well as said blond other mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Noire!' Morgan yelled happily, almost boucning off Regina until the queen grabbed him to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Regina!' Emma called up, getting smacked by Noire's bow in the face as the white haired, black eyed girl stepped closer to the giantess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You obviously know about magic, you will be useful to mistress' she smirked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think not' Regina smirks as with a click of her fingers Noire poofs from beside Emma to standing between Regina's heels 'I think you'll be of good use to me instead'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

When she fired Regina flicked a finger and it poofed, exploding against the wall and given the size difference forming a small hole. Angry she fired again, and again, moving as she did expecting Regina to fight back in some way but she just continued to poof them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Noire stop this, this isn't you!' Morgan yelled from Regina's shoulder, Noire by this point getting rather annoyed so instead of aiming for Regina's torso like before she aimed her bow a little higher and aimed for Morgan. This got a reaction from Regina just not the one she expected: Regina still poofed the arrow away, but it's destination was just in front of Noire's feet causing the white haired girl to be flung onto her back where she soon found herself trapped in Regina's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now I was fine to let you tire yourself out when you were aiming for me, but then you targeted my son and I can't have you do that' Regina growled, Morgan in worry started hopping up and down, tugging on her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mama, stop don't kill her she's been corrupted' Morgan cried, Regina stopping partly in surprise, she hadn't expected him to call her mama this soon (though part of her knew he did it to get this reaction from her, he was a tactician after all) but the other was touch of confused amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not going to kill her, there's not point. Plus we need information' she said opening her hand and before Noire could do anything Regina's hand filled with smoke and a cage formed. Noire blinked in confusion before clutching at her head, holding in a scream as Grima's mark glowed and smouldered on her chest. As she fell back panting, the glow of the brand dulling but still pulsing Regina looked on in confusion and Morgan bounced along her arm to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Noire, are you there?' Noire blinked before reaching out to him through the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan you're okay! That's brilliant news I thought after Nah and Yarne you were sure to have been captured. How are you bud?' she smiled slightly before taking in her surroundings and frowning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Noire do you know where we are?'' Morgan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah. This place feels wrong, the magic is just off''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan, what happened?' Regina asks, placing Morgan and Noire's cage on the counter, Emma following at a safe distance to avoid being stepped on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not sure, what did you do?' he replies waving his hand in the direction of the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I conjured a way to capture her, and her own magic sustains it so even trying to escape wll just tire her out' Regina answered proudly. Morgan grins widely and claps his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course! The cage is feeding on Grima's magic because it's the most potent energy within it's grasp, meaning Noire is free. The only downside is it would only work inside the cage and I'm not sure my method of purification would do anything in this world<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on?' Emma asks, Regina finally remembering the cute little blond picks her up and drops her down between the 2 kids<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'These 2 are from another world, the girl was evil until a second ago and Morgan is trying to save her from a demon that was once his mother. Excuse me' Regina paraphrased as she steps over to the sink where retching noises can be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do I even want to know?' Emma asks referring to the giantess behind them, while Noire laughs 'What's so funny?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seems this Regina person is more Plegian than I expected' Noire answers with a smile 'Not surprising, she has the chest of one' at Emma's confused expression she elaborated 'Plegians such as Morgan's mom and aunt as well as my mom and to a lessor extent me are known for their large breasts and high magical skill. Sound like Regina?' Emma nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Glad to see my assets come up in conversations around you Ms Swan' Regina deadpans as she comes back to the group<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi Mom' Henry greets, getting pulled into a hug by his blond parent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Henry, where have to been?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Henry explains everything, meeting Morgan re-finding Regina, even getting eaten which he described as a strange but not bad experience, a statement that had Regina grinning at Emma's shocked expression. The fun was momentarily derailed when Regina stumbled, almost flattening Emma before catching herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom!'<br>\r\n'Regina!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch raised a hand to dismiss it 'It's fine, just a little drained after all the magic I used today. That and just look at the time' she waved a hand at the window, everyone surprised by how dark it was getting 'I think somebody needs to go to bed, though you'll all have to stay in my room. Just for tonight of course, I don't think it's a good idea for me to cast again tonight' With that she picked up Morgan Henry and Emma in one hand and Noire's cage in the other before walking up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what are you going to do with her?' Emma asks, eyes trained on Noire who was lying on her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well Morgan says she's herself as long as she remains inside the cage till Morgan finds a cure, with our help of course' Regina answers, whether she means herself and Emma or the 5 of them (Noire included) Emma wasn't sure but they made it to Regina's room to soon for her to care<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the question is how tired are everyone?

Nothing major just a little something to wind down with?' he asked with a pout<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh can we play chess? Mom taught me how to play but I haven't gotten to play against anyone other than mom, aunt Versa and Aunt Tharja' Morgan asked, his pout matching Henry's almost perfectly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll play, my mom taught me too, she's really good at it' Henry answered, both boys now grinning widely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My boys, bonding over strategy games' Regina cooed as she poofed up a chess set, though it was her size it was also light enough for the boys to move them around, if only just.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan's gonna crush him, I'd bet money on it... if I had any this world money' Noire cheered, but her boasts petered out at the end.<br>\r\nEmma disagrees 'No way, the kid learnt from Regina he's gonna be fine'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina chuckles as she sits back between the arguing girls 'I don't want to pick favourites between my boys but Henry has been rather distracted with all the Storybook stuff and it sounds like Morgan regularly plays against experts so I think he'll win in the end'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Geez Regina let the kid be in the world a day before you adopt him, though on saying that I wish I had someone like you when I was their age' Emma scolded then admitted as she leaned against the curve of Regina's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled at Regina's praise, while the level of affection she was shoving was strange so soon he assumed she was just someone who cared deeply and fell hard, it actually reminded him of stories he'd been told about Tharja and his mom, she made her feelings known practically the moment they met. Shaking his head he went with Robin's usual opening play, not that he thought he could achieve the victory he'd seen his mom do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''Again, again!'' Morgan cheered from his chair, watching his parents play the shortest chess game he'd ever seen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom sat there with his mouth on the table 'But, but how? That was like 5 moves'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin giggled 'Well I'm your chief strategist for a reason love'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Again, again!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom laughed and shook his head 'No can do kiddo, want to take my place?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>5 mins later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it, hey Regina can I pay you back tomorrow?' Emma complained Noire and Regina sprouting matching evil grins as Morgan is clearly winning, though Henry at least was holding his own to a certain degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Both of us Swan, I bet on Morgan too' the white haired archer chimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Regina can you move my Queen across the board?' All the way' Morgan asked, pointing to where Henry's white bishop currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure kiddo' Regina said moving the piece, her sleepwear causing bouncing that would cause embarrassment for Henry but Morgan was used to it given his history and extended family<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Morgan woke to gentle swaying and the all encompassing feel of soft flesh around him. Smiling slightly he knew exactly where he was, this having happened he knew all the likely candidates by their skin tone: Robin's skin was snow white like her hair, in fact even paler still. Tharja had the slight tan of all Plegians but it clearly showed she spent most of her time indoors working on her craft. And then their was his current location, the much darker tones of Aversa, caused by her much more outdoors-y lifestyle under the harsh Plegian sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi little buddy, we're going on an adventure' Aversa cheered, Morgan's surroundings bouncing as she giggled. Despite himself he smiled and lay back against her breast, safe and content knowing he'd be having a fun day with hid aunt... providing his over-protective sister didn't find out</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it!' Henry yelled realising he was in check, pacing back and forth 'Sigh I give'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sure Henry?' Morgan asks, not sure he wanted the game to end like this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah Mor, my brain is currently fried, maybe we can play again tomorrow' Henry yawned and Morgan nodded before he felt his own yawn building<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah my little boys are sleepy' Regina cooed, picking both of them up in separate hands before moving to the top of her bed, Emma trying to follow while Noire just slipped into the bed Regina had already conjured in her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Night mom' Henry mumbled as he curled up and was already almost dead to the world<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Goodnight sweet prince'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''AHHHH!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan what's wrong?' Robin asks as she rushes into her son's room, the 5 year old bluenette curled up holding his knees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I, I had a nightmare mom' he squeaked, trying to hide his face from her gaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my beautiful boy. What happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There were these grey things and they were hurting people, everything was on fire and people were... dead. I was trying to find you, Luci, Dad, Versa anyone but you weren't there, nobody was anywhere. I was alone and afraid, and then I woke up' Morgan weeped as he was pulled into Robin's tight, comforting embrace, his head resting on her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There, there Morgi, mamma's here. Mamma will always be here for you'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'P-p-promise?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I promise, you have so many people who love you, someone will always be there to hold you close' Robin whispered into his hair, also reminding her self to cut it as she could see it was getting in his eyes 'Want me to stay here with you tonight?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dad won't mind?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dad might sneak in, but more likely he'll see you need comfort and leave us be'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay mom Goodnight'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Goodnight sweet prince'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan?' Regina called, noticing the boy had gotten quiet, then seeing tears dripping down his cheeks 'Oh no, what's wrong?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sniffled 'I-I-I miss my mom!' he cried and a cascade of tears flowed from his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan, Morgan! Regina bring him over here quick' Noire yelled, stretching her arm out through the bars. Regina worrying about the kid put him down right next to her, Noire gently squeezing his shoulder 'Morgi, look at me! You aren't alone, we'll get our parents back and you'll see your mom again. But I'm here too, as long as the people who care can be together we can get through this' her tone was much gentler now, and she noticed the tears had slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan flinched slightly when she felt unfamiliar arms wrapped around his middle 'Don't worry kid, me and Regina will keep you safe and help you get your parents back. Plus I've only known you a few hours and you're already latching onto my heart and Regina's too if she's claiming you as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pair joined her own 'Yeah Morgan, I never had much family other than Mom and then Emma but you're definitely the brother I never had' Herny said laying his head on Morgan's shoulder, he still looked almost asleep but he could feel how important this was for them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sniffled 'Really?' he had a watery smile as her felt a fingertip ruffle his hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As much as I'd love to keep a wonderful little man like you to myself, I can't deprive a mother anymore than I could give up Henry. We're going to save your family Morgan, but you better come visit Aunt Gina and cousin Henry when this is all over'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh can I be Auntie Em? I always wanted to be auntie em?' Emma asked with a grin and raised hands, causing Morgan to laugh as he leaned against Henry's once more drooping form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Emma you can be Auntie Em' Regina answered with an eye roll but there was no anger in her tone or look, there was amusement and care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If there was any world I got stuck in, I'm glad it was this one' he mumbled as he too drooped, the cascade of emotion sapping the last of his energy after the long day he's had<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love you Morgan' Noire whispered, pushing his fringe out of his eyes 'He should be fine now' she said to Regina how nodded then moved her cell from the end of the bed to her bedside locker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This way we're all together when Morgan wakes up'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Speaking of which' Emma chimed in, having grabbed the end of Regina's sleepshirt when she carried the boys back to the pillows 'we never actually discussed sleeping arrangements'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do we do this?</span></div></div>",

So she placed the two boys on one pillow and deposited Emma right next to her on the other pillow and both women soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was in a room that was pure white knowing it was some sort of dream. \"Hello Morgan\" Morgan turned to see his mother, Robin, who had gentle smile on her face and open arms. \"Mom, I've missed you so much!\" Morgan cried running into his mother's embrace despite it being a dream he could still feel her warmth. \"How is this possible mom, I thought when you got corrupted you turned into Grima?\" Morgan asked looking up, Robin looked down at her beautiful boy. \"Grima and I share a body, while she controls it I can still see whatever she see, I'm here to to talk to you before she notices I'm gone.\" Robin explained, Morgan nodding in response. \"While I can't see where you are right now I do know that the you method of purification will work in the world you're in but it will require a gentle touch something that you have and excel in. As well if you purify my body all the other shepherds that have been corrupted will go back to normal, although it will not effect they're size but that is a lot less important. Now I need to show you something.\" Robin took Morgan's hand and suddenly they were in Grima's lair, the goddess herself standing in front of giant Lucina, Aversa and Tharja (Tharja being the same size as Regina while Lucina and Aversa were taller but were still smaller than Grima, I am a stegosaurus). \"Look Morgan\" Robin said point at Grima's (or her own, whatever this stuff is confusing) cleavage to see Chrom unconscious in it. \"Dad's still alive\" Morgan whispered very happy. \"Yes for whatever reason Grima is keeping all of the shepherds alive, but the same sadly can't be said for the villagers, I can't keep track of how many innocent villagers Grima has had killed.\" Robin replied gripping Morgan's hand tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I haven't received word from Noire yet about the mission, so I'm sending the three of you in once I regain enough energy to do so.\" Grima told the three giantesses who nodded. \"Yes master Grima\" Aversa and Tharja said in response \"Yes mother\" Lucina said her eyes red, and Grima's brand replacing her mark of the Exalt, as well Lucina wasn't wearing her bindings that she used to make her breasts look smaller (although Lucina made a personal rule she would only where them if she was preparing for a fight which rarely happened thankfully) Robin turned to Morgan and said to him\"I know you can stop Grima\" she then hugged him tightly whispering into his ear \"I love you my sweet prince I will see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan woke up next to Henry who was awake as well. \"Hey Morgan, what was- I mean what is your mom like?\" He asked to the tactician. \"She's great, she's so nice and kind, also very very smart, she was the one who first shrunk me when I was playing hide and seek with my sister when I was reaalllly little I asked her to hide me and I guess she was feeling really frisky at the time so she just shrunk me and we played together until Lucina found me. She's also really really really pretty and strong and has lots of magic I once heard she beat ten guys at once with a simple fire tome. She is very good at keeping me safe and she taught me basically everything I know!\" Morgan rambled Henry paying attention to every word. \"She sounds like a wonderful person, I would love to meet her one day.\" Henry said and before Morgan could say thank you the two boys heard a loud groan turning and saw....</span></div></div>",

Henry and Morgan screamed like little girls (you would too in their situation) before Lucina snatched them up. <b> \"Now, now little cuties don't waste your voices no one will take you away from me, I used a very strong spell on this pathetic so-called evil Queen so she won't be waking up soon enough to take you back from me. Now while I am here for Morgan, I don't want you to be blabbing to your mommies about this, I'm sure mother will find a use for you probably as a snack or pet for some of the more faithful followers. Unfortunately this hex works on one person at a time so you two will have to stay in my stomach.\"</b> Lucina grinned bringing the boys over to her open maw, Henry and Morgan gulped as Lucina plopped them onto her tongue and shut her mouth rubbing her tongue over the boys, noting that Henry was rather tasty, although Morgan was a tastier treat but she already knew his taste, moaning a bit before swallowing them. Thankfully Lucina was too distracted to notice Noire's cage so she teleported out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Lucina's stomach Morgan and Henry were sitting feeling Lucina's movement. \"I'm sorry Henry about this I should of been more aware to notice Lucina's magical signature.\" Morgan apologized to his friend who was in the opposite side of the stomach. \"It's fine Mom will save us\" Henry said but Morgan wasn't so sure himself and thought back to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked up to Lucina a lot thinking her to be the worlds most best big sister (he knew he was being bias but he was pretty sure he correct nevertheless and that Aversa was second place since she was his mom's older sister) Lucina actually had more magic than Morgan, so she was taught magic by their mother, Aversa and Tharja. That is until an incident where Lucina had accidentally hurt Morgan and she refused to learn anymore magic but after years of coaxing she got back on the wagon and now could use C rank tomes (she still preferred to use swords) and could use a shrink spell. Once Lucina had learnt the shrink spell she often shrunk Morgan giving the excuse that it's for practice but Morgan didn't mind at all and loved playing and cuddling with his sister. Sometimes if Morgan ever got too tired during their fun Lucina would happily allow Morgan to be nestled in her bosom while she would read a book of something else that didn't require much movement. Lucina had moments where she would get a little too over protective, one time when Tharja had shrunk Morgan to spend time with him and didn't tell anyone, Lucina freaked out when she learned he was missing and when she found Tharja she spanked her with wooden paddle saying Tharja should of gotten Robin permission first (she didn't mind but was a little peeved at not telling her first) and repeated \"kidnapping his wrong\" after that incident Lucina was ground for two weeks. Despite it all Morgan loved his sister deeply and gave her immense amounts of love and respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was drawn out of his thoughts when Lucina had stopped walking.<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" Henry asked Morgan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is happening though?</span></div></div>",

Emma was less physically and more mentally exhausted with all the crazy shit that had happened lately, she just wanted either to sleep or for it all to be a dream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now Henry, what were we saying about lying? If you don't want to be lied to you shouldn't lie, especially not to your mother' Regina mock scolds, Henry too tired to care so just nods and waits for whatever is needed 'You guys stay put, I'll get a blanket and you both will be up by my pillow tonight' she explains before disappearing into her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and Morgan flop onto their backs, Henry at least trying to stay upright until Regina returns, Noire watching with silent amusement as she lies on the bed Regina has added with barely a thought. It wasn't palace quality but it was still good for what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina appears a few minutes later, setting up a makeshift bed for her boys on the pillow next to her bedside, probably so she could keep an eye on all the kids easier then disappears to change into sleepwear after tucking them in. Not long after Regina reappears, slips under the covers and whispers 'Goodnight my little men, we'll get to work tomorrow' jokingly before falling asleep herself, the magic she'd been using all day taking more out of her than she admitted to the kids and Emma. The gentle sound of her breathing soothed and helped Morgan and Henry slide into dreamland<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sits back up a few minutes later 'Hey where's Emma?' he asks getting a cackle like laughter from Noire, which also causes Morgan to sit up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan seeing as Gina's an honorary Plegian, tell me what Tharja, Aversa or I would do with a little person sleeping companion?' she asks with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eh... cleavage or butt crack if it was Aversa or Tharja, with you they'd be where Henry and I am, sitting on the pillow, unless it was me then you'd make sure I was nice and comfortable between your breasts' Morgan answers, Henry assuming he answered correctly if Noire's blush (visible in the moonlight) was anything to go on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're saying Mom put Emma ... you know , between her...' Henry couldn't get the words out, whether due to his age or the fact it was about his mom the archer didn't know<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Her breasts yes, you act like this is unexpected. Regina is a lovely woman and Emma isn't so bad herself, plus their magic reaches out for one another. By Grima if we were back home other mages would be asking why they weren't engaged yet' Noire explains as though it was the simplest thing in the world, and for her it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way, Mom and Emma don't think like that, they hate each other' Henry argues<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire shrugs 'I don't know kid, maybe Regina wanted to share the warmth... of her massive rack. Anyway blondie is nestled away between them snoozing her little head off like Regina herself, don't worry about it and go to sleep' she sighs and flops onto the bed, closing her eyes and falling back to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Was she lying?' Henry asks Morgan who shakes his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know about the whole thing, but she was telling the truth about Emma being safe. There's no reason for Regina to harm Emma after what's happened, especially after saving her butt from Noire. Relax Henry it'll be fine' at this point Morgan curls up into a ball and tries to sleep, Henry sighing as he knows there was nothing he could do anyway and goes back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

Apparently in Ylissean tales of old the Pure Falchion was said to be able to reverse any form of corruption or mind control by simply doing a small cut on the target.

Plus I can't bring you into this insanity, even with your current size Grima is much bigger and more powerful, if she turned her attention to Storybrooke she could destroy it easily'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighed 'Morgan she already has my town in her sights given Noire was her first wave for lack of a better term. She would get here eventually so it only makes sense I would assist in keeping her out. Besides, I have 30 years more magical experience than you little guy, that should help with this plan you obviously have to stop the great evil'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nods slightly 'Yeah I do have a plan, use the ancient ritual to form the legendary Pure Falchion which is the only thing that could banish an eternal power like Grima, given what it did to Dumat and Mila in the legend'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good we've actually got a plan' Emma sighed in relief, she really didn't like the idea of facing giant mages and a god, <i>just winging it</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, but the problem is one of the ingredients, a <i><b>shattered heart of darkness</b></i>' Morgan admitted then looks up to Regina 'You had everything except that in your storage, which makes things a little easier'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina bit her lip before sliding to her knees 'Actually, I might have that last piece as well' her eyes flickered skittishly worrying not only Morgan but Henry and Emma as well 'Emma go back into my vault, there should be shelves behind the curtain. Check for the blackest crystal heart you can find and bring it and a beaker back up to us' the blond nods and runs down, Morgan looked confused and Henry shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma returned quickly with a nearly pure black heart, only little flickers of red streaking across it's core. 'Thank you Emma, now give the heart to me and hold the beaker beneath my hand' she orders, holding the heart between her forefinger and thumb, before with a motion similar to sprinkling a pinch of salt she crushed the heart to a black powder, which the blond Sherriff caught easily 'There you go Morgan, the darkest heart I had besides my own shattered for your ritual'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Henry gapped 'What just happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I crushed the heart of one of my former enemies, their sacrifice will not be in vain if it banishes this demon goddess...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Actually she's an dragon' Morgan corrects, then blushes when all eyes turn to him 'That's kind of the problem, all True Dragons go feral and homicidal eventually, Grima just took longer than the others did'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Still we now have all the parts for this ritual, anything else?' Emma asks, sensing a but in her future (other than Regina's)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um yeah, it needs a mage class magical, which I'm not old enough to have reached the level of, Lucina was one and Noire is on the threshold of one, not that it helps as she can't access her magic in the cage and she's Grima's puppet outside it. So yeah despite my attempt to do this myself.... I need your help Regina, you're the only mage in Storybrooke'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina nods in understanding 'Okay Morgan, we'll do this somewhere safe.... which at the moment means my home. So you will be fed and dressed properly like you were supposed to, then we shall craft your god slayer' Morgan sighs but agrees to Regina's stipulations, she did have a point as his stomach was starting to growl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, but just so you know if this doesn't work I'm going with Plan B and pulling some of those magic fruits from that universe I ended up in when I zagged instead of zigged getting here and using them on us. If it hadn't been for Scales I'd still be stuck there just so you know' the tactician comments, getting an amused chuckle form the adults, while Henry had a thinking face as the world sounded familiar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twist of her wrist the 4 of them (and all Morgan's items) returned to the house, the kitchen specifically where Noire's cage had already been moved, the archer working her way through a grape the size of her breasts (as the food had been grown to Regina's size when she reformed the house)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had been fed, dressed and ready for the day, what happens?</span></div></div>",

Henry asked looking a little disturbed (possibly left over from last nights conversation with the rabid archer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shrugs before sniffing the air 'Not usually but I do smell bacon.

Tharja's ham is unbeatable, but Gregor makes real good sausage' he explains, seeing in the boys eyes he got the scent too, and not a moment too soon as they were all poofed down to the kitchen, where Emma was munching away on giant food and Regina was cooking just beyond them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mine!' Noire hisses, trying to reach some of the slices, the ferocity even causing Emma to put down her rasher<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should we be worried?' she asks as Regina comes over with a couple waffles for them all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just throw her a couple rashers and she'll be fine' Morgan answers flatly, the adults shrug amongst themselves but follow his instructions, Noire pouncing on them like a Tasmanian Devil, till all that remained was the usually petit woman, with a bulging stomach and content groans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's not mama's, but it was goooooood' she coos happily before drifting to sleep again, Morgan laughing as the others just stare at the once more unconscious woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This happen often?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The food coma? Yeah sometimes, usually when Tharja and Gregor have their contests as they make a LOT of food and  there's usually some left over right until she gets to it' Morgan explains, then he sees the chunk of waffle, egg and single slice of bacon himself and Henry had each been given, Emma getting one waffle and egg, as well as 2 slices of bacon herself, while Regina got a mound of food Henry would usually associate with his blond mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well dig in boys, need to get your strength up if you want to get this ritual done quickly, well if magic over there is as taxing as it is here' Regina says, trying to encourage them to eat, something Emma needed no help in of course. Morgan nodded and pulled a chunk of egg and stuffed it in his mouth, smiling as he did: it wasn't Cherche's level but damn was it good<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina could see his expression and smiled back 'I'm glad you enjoy it, you'll need all the energy you can get' she nods as Emma is almost done and Henry has started on his waffle. In the end the boys didn't finish their meals (so Regina did for them) and Emma looked about ready to pass out into a similar food coma to Noire if not for Regina's death glares of <i>'Don't leave me here alone with the children'</i> which perked her up immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And now we save the world' Morgan announces confidently, waking up Noire who half heartedly raises her arm in solidarity, rolling her eyes at Morgan enthusiasm as well as energy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Morgan looked at the sword in front of him, his hail Naga, having literally bounced off what it was meant to destroy like a foam dart. He twitched, his eyebrows wriggling like spazuming caterpillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh dear' </i>Noire thinks as a vein thumps in his forehead similar to his aunt when she gets angry <i>'I wonder what's going to happen now'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!</b>' Okay that wasn't what she expected, but Aversa was also known for her colourful language, despite Robin's efforts to get her to stop doing so in front of the kids (aka just Morgan if we're being honest)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Language child, I will clean out that mouth of yours if required'</b></i> Grima scolds, but Morgan ignores her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All that work and it didn't even do anything, oh come on!' he complains, at which point Robin just sighs and reach's down for him, pulling her hand back reflexively from the combined fireball Regina &amp; Emma sent at her, alongside one of Noire's bomber arrows. Neither actually did anything other than get her attention though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Well, well Noire how can you disobey me?</b></i>' Grima wondered, her magic reaching out to enthral before retreating, Noire whimpering at the painful burning of the cut on her cheek <i><b>'Naga's underdeveloped balls!'</b></i> the dragon Queen hisses, her magic lashing out and wrecking part of the cemetery <i><b>'If you won't bend to my will, you will die with the rest'</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally they'd all be screwed, except Regina had the foresight to ensure they were all close enough to one another she could poof them all away together, after grabbing the Pure Falchion (an action that shocked both Morgan and Noire, Grima being too large to see), narrowly escaping the destruction caused by Grima's enchanted black fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina poofed them all back to her place, for once feeling odd about her living arrangements as she as currently just as small in the giantess sized mansion as the others<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do we do now?

Falchion can feel it, as well as the fact I don't know how to use it, I'm almost a pure mage not a warrior like Luci or even you.

I actually believe this belonged to him.\" Regina said proofing up Falchion, gently handing it over to Robin. \"Thank you, this is sword is actually a very important weapon in my world so it's good that we are getting it back.\" Robin said to Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Robin I think I know what I want.\" Regina said as Robin turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Regina want</span></div></div>",

Um hi, don't know how I got here but nice to see you' Morgan greets, running his hand against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerpentime smirked as she watches from the shadows, a little bit of her magic infected into Morgan's core will hide him from Robin, as well as more importantly feed on/cleanse him of the corruption using what even her dad called a Class 10 dark curse, having had the curse used first hand only his fist going through the girl's throat stopped something she wasn't sure even he could've walked away from. The kid had balls to even think of, never mind actually use something like that. After determining he would be fine with Severa she faded away, more mayhem to be caused somewhere else in the multiverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Morgan are you okay now?' Severa asks, worried about the boy being out and about so soon after nearly killing himself taking out Grima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah I'm good, all that sleep really helped. Today Lucina was going to have a fun day with me, but then Aversa knocked her out and we were going to have an adventure, but mom stole her from Aversa, and finally a demon stole me from mom and now I'm here. It's been a weird day and it's not even noon' the tactician flopped onto her palm as the red head chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Morgan, seeing as you appear to have no more plans for today... want to spend some time with me?' Severa asks, surprisingly timid about the whole thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah sure, I like spending time with you Severa, you're a good friend' Morgan smiled and got another cheek hug from Severa as she internally shrieked happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now? Does she go get Noire and they have a fun day as a trio (as Luci will be unconscious for another few hours)? Or does she decide to use this time with Morgan to get some help with seducing or even just asking out Lucina, the girl thinking she needed all the help she could get?</span></div></div>",

The how is actually quite simple though, using the Dark Arts as well as the action itself, regardless of his reasons he actually killed a fucking God, those factors as well as Grima's magic actually flooding your system means it's left a dark mark on your heart' Aversa explains sadly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a blip of magic in Lucina's hand 'Ah Versa, you forgot little ol me?' Henry teases before reaching into Morgan's chest and pulling out his heart. The heart instead of being red was mostly white, sure it did still have red but it was about 58% white, the problem was the inky black smear on it's surface 'There it is, Grima's taint as well as the darkness of using the Void curse. It's the problem we're all arguing about' he then shoves it back in and teleports away to avoid Lucina attacking him for what he did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'While crude, and something YOU NEED TO ASK PERMISSION BEFORE DOING he's correct' Aversa says, pinching the bridge of her nose 'Some of us think that refraining from Dark Magic and Morgan being his usual wonderful self should have him healed pretty quickly, couple of weeks to a month at the most, but Lissa as his doctor and a useless Ylsian who has no idea how dark magic works, has almost completely convinced Robin he needs to be banned from all magic for the foreseeable future. Regina has offered to summon an '<i>acquaintance</i>' of hers as she has a much deeper understanding of hearts than any of us do, also she's a non homicidal dragon so that's a plus'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why are you telling us this?'

Said archer was worried sick by Morgan's rapid deterioration, spending almost as much time as Lucina did and twice as much as Robin (though in her defence she was searching every source she could for something to save her son), cradling him to her body as it was an internal curse rather than a disease so there was no worries about her being infected/exposed to the problem as well.

He knew he'd been on the verge of dying, a few times in fact and they didn't want to risk it happening again but come on he wasn't going to break. Technically he did break, just not physically when he finally snapped, bounced onto Noire, buried his head between her breasts and wrapped his limbs around her torso so she wouldn't escape.

It also helped by giving a little of a dragon's <i><b>'fire'</b></i> which would help keep Morgan healthy and speed up recovery when he wasn't well (such as right now).

When instead of a fireball in his palms he was engulfed in dark blue smoke and a cobalt blue dragon was sitting where he was 'Well I didn't see that coming' she says before laughing at the cute and confused look on his snout (I'm imagining something like Toothless but blue, because that is definitely the cutest dragon I can think of right now, I suppose Raven Queen's dragon Nevermore is a close second) 'Well at least we know what my flame did to you, it made you like me and Lily, a dragon shifter. Now you just need to control it and you should be fine' she runs a finger along it's spine, a toothy grin on her face as the technically baby dragon purrs and leans into her touch, it warmed a cold and dark part of her heart, the part that holds all the pain of missing out on her Lilith's life, of helping her hatchling grow into something wonderful and wicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Note: Option one should contain people cooing or gushing over Dragon-Morgan's cuteness, and option 2 should probably coincide with Emma and Henry's visit simply because then everyone's present for him to show off to]</span></div></div>",

Now there's this big long list of prices but I have narrowed it down to ones that you wouldn't mind too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrima said as a piece of paper appeared in Grima's hands \"Let me see here.... be my servant for a week this is the only one where you don't go back write away but it doesn't affect your body. You lose your ability to use magic pretty straight forward. Being shrunk to the size of mouse, thankfully this one makes you invincible. You have to be eaten once a day for at least ten minutes at a time, oh we're getting into these ones for ones that say you have to do something if ypu don't follow it you die and can't come back. You have to always touch someone. Thankfully for this one you have five minutes each day to not touch someone also if you are airborne, which includes jumping it doesn't use up the time. Hey I don't remember writing this one here. Hmm, you have to make a girl orgasm each day but you have to wait three days if you want to do the same girl again. Scales must of wrote that when I wasn't lookung, you can pick it if you want but it's probably the most risky in my opinion.\" Grima explains looking at Morgan who was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat price does Morgan pay?</span></div></div>",

Weird he's trying to set you up with a harem when I'm pretty sure he's never had one himself (True, but there's always the future), eh he gets bored way too easily (Also true)' Grima sighs at the end of it, then noticed Morgan blushing 'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Actually, that's not the reason, there aren't enough girls I desire to perform the cycles. There's really only one girl I would want to make orgasm repeatedly, and that's Noire when I'm a little older, if she still wants me that is' Morgan blushes deeper just thinking about Noire in a compromising position like that, then smiled like the (half) Plegian that he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrima sighs tiredly 'I'm not surprised to be honest, mages do mature faster than mortals, you'd be about 14 if you were normal rather than nearly 11.

What to do, what to do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrima chewed on her lip and thought real hard, she'd heard Morgan had a laundry list of talents she could exploit but what did she want from hi, first there was his massaging skill, unparalleled by anyone, and his cooking/baking, sweets sound good right about now, Then there were other things, forming in her mind thanks to the demon she calls a friend, like teaching him how to please a woman for when he got back, or even as simple as having him be her seat cushion for a while. She had a week, she'd get to everything and more eventually, but where to start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Morgan massage or feeding Grima?</span></div></div>",

Now then, first things first when it comes to pleasing a girl via breasts your two best friends will be your mouth and the girls nipples.\" Robin gently booping one of her nipples. \"As you already know from your massages that the nipples are the most sensitive part of the boobs and your mouth helps get them aroused.

Although in return the woman has to be related to you by either blood or marriage so you if you get married than you can please your wife. However for each woman you give pleasure to her you have to give them pleasure at least once a month, say for example you make Lucina orgasm, that means you have to make her orgasm at least once a month for the rest of your life or you die.\" Aversa explained patting her right boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the left boob however you only have to one specific girl orgasm everyday so you won't have to worry about multiple women.\" Aversa explained \"Do I get choose someone or...\" Morgan asked as Aversa gave a half smile \"Well that woman has to be me, believe me if I had any say in the matter than I'd let you choose Noire. Another catch is that if you ever want to have children than I have to be the mother of your first child, if you get another girl pregnant before you get me pregnant than you die.\" Aversa explained to Morgan who was thinking of which to choose</span></div></div>",

When it cleared Morgan had shrunk, about the same size to Noire has he had previously been to the giantess that were their mothers and Aversa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go cutie, I bet you've been taught to please a big girl by now rather than one your own size so this should help, plus a girl has to have her kinks' Noire shakes her hips and winks, but Morgan can't see it past her bosom. Not wanting to wait any longer the sniper hops off the bed an relieves herself of her lower attire, flinging her underwear onto the bed and just barely missing Morgan, winking as she does. Morgan blushes but is also interested, being able to feel the tingle of her magic even just from her love juices. Noire then finally removes her top, freeing her large perky boobs which bounce around before settling 'Like what you see? Do you have the sexiest wife in all the land?' Noire asks with a pout, Morgan looking ready to jump over to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Noire, I really do' he answers with little prompting, getting brought up to her face rather swiftly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good, because that means we can get started' she coos before opening her mouth wide and sliding his upper half in, sucking on him like a lollipop. Noire moans at his taste as well as the mixing of their magics, the clash of light and oddly enough sending fireworks to the pleasure centres of her brain, she hoped she could last until he actually made it to her sex, as well as having the restraint to go through with her plan: she wanted their 1st time to be special, not her looking control and thrusting him like a dildo till she came all over him. Still she kept him in her mouth for a few minutes before releasing his soaked but enthusiastic body from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir next destination was one Morgan liked even before he knew about sex: Noire's breasts were considered disproportionate due to her thin frame but to him she was beautiful, having full breasts that would be impressive on a woman twice her size was just extra, and now he was being rubbed against and between them. Morgan wasn't surprised when his own sounds joined Noire's, his arousal also grew with exposure to her heavenly mounds, which she seemed to notice rather quickly if the slight increase in pressure from her thumb was anything to go by, but beyond that she was happy to rub her husband against her breasts, Morgan kissing and nipping anywhere he was able to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both now significantly <i>'warmed up' </i>Noire set herself down on the bed and placed Morgan between her legs, where her arousal was already leeking freely 'Well love, time to get a moving' she purred, holding herself open before picking him up again and sliding the bluenette as deep as her long fingers would allow 'Oh yes, just like that' she bites her lip and lies on her back, letting Morgan do the work this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan found himself thrust into Noire's body even faster than he expected, now in a squishy tunnel deeply scented with sex and Noire's unique aroma Morgan let it wash over him, if he was most likely going to end up here at least once a day he should get used to it, and at least Noire's goo had the heady feel of dark magic, so it wasn't as difficult as it could have been, it was actually almost pleasant, same with taste, the stuff was everywhere so it getting in his mouth was expected. With that out of the way Morgan began what his training hadn't yet taught him, some he improvised and simply did what he would on her outside, inside: massaging her inner walls, kissing licking and biting whatever he could find, even squeezing what he could tell was a bundle of nerves, that last act caused a tidal wave as her release washed him out and then threatened to drown him under her squirting, the ivory haired (carpet and drapes) girl practically screaming as she came, before flopping down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire groaned when she reopened her eyes, before using her flexible legs and long toes to grab Morgan from the puddle she had caused and moved him to a position she could actually reach with her hands, where the goo covered boy looked at her with a tired grin, which she returned just a much 'Perfect' she whispers, causing a blush from Morgan, but not as much as when she kissed him face, cum soaked or not she knew the kinds of reassurances and praise her little man needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The dragon's enhanced senses meant she noticed more than most beings, she saw the slight twist of the edge of her lips, a tiny smile she tried hide under genuine fear and it intrigued her.<br>\r\nMal flickered herself directly in front of the blond shocking her and causing her to fall to the ground 'Jeez lady you part demon or something?'' ''Maleficent laughed ''I am pure dragon dearie, don't you forget it'' she said taking another step to stand directly over the sheriff, enhancing her already tall, imposing, intimidating prescience<br>\r\n''You are an interesting being Ms Swan'' Mal says with a smile ''Um thanks?'' Emma asks hesitantly ''You are also an enigma. When I said you were going to become my shrunken plaything you smiled, you then got scared most likely due to embarrassment as much as by what you thought I would do to you'' her grin widened when she noticed Emma's blush.<br>\r\n''I can explain...'' Emma began but stopped when Maleficent's hand started to glow a royal blue ''I'm sure during your 'hit every branch on the way down' crash course with Regina she never mentioned the shrinking spell. It makes sense as it's quite a rarely used piece of magic, though I do find it a lot of fun, Regina was an excellent plaything; she always felt wonderful under my feet and she paid my breasts so much attention'' Mal appeared to go off somewhere in her head, which would've been a bad thing had Emma's mind not gone into a similar gutter (Because of that she missed Maleficent's absent minded muttering about how <i>''Other than Aurora she's the only one I didn't kill after using''</i>)<br>\r\nWhen she came back to the present Maleficent was amused to see Emma was still spaced out in fantasy land, she decided to move so she was literally standing over Emma with the blond between her legs. Bending slowly she flicked Emma's forehead with her non glowing hand before hovering the magic infused one above her face ''You are a perfect candidate Miss Swan, you actually want to be shrunk. You are the first willing person I've used this spell on, even Regina was reluctant the first time. So you want to be shrunk and toyed with, to be a plaything for me or maybe my daughter, I know you and Lily have a history. So what do you say Emma, time to get your wish''<br>\r\nMal looked into Emma's eyes as the younger blond kept focus on her glowing hand, there was no fear in her eyes this time but there was a hint of arousal. What did surprise her was Emma's response to the question...</span></div></div>",

She knew it was hardwired into a dragon's brain, instincts or whatever that they don't do casual screwing, they had a mate and remained loyal and faithful to them, something easier to do when paired with other dragons. Neither Lilith nor her '<i>father</i>' were aware of each other and it killed the elder dragon to keep her mate in the dark as well as her daughter with her near constant prodding of the subject, but maybe bringing her, her own mate would tide her over at least for a while, long enough to get Regina in the right frame of mind to have this discussion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sure Lilith will be happy to hear that' Mal says before silently booping Emma's nose, the blue flowing off her hand and enveloping Emma a cloud of royal blue smoke, which when faded revealed a 4 inch saviour 'Perfect' the dragon hissed, plucking her up and sliding her between her breasts for safe keeping. She did have a little walk around town, biding her time until Lily would be back home and she could receive her gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late afternoon before Lily returned home, Mal was waiting for her 'Hello kiddo' Mal says with a smile, Lily grunts but acknowledges her with a nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey mom'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You'll never guess what I found walking around Storybrooke today'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily tenses 'Mom, you know Regina says you shouldn't be doing that on your own'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal pouts 'Not even if I found your mate?

I've been in a world without magic my entire life, they don't teach shit like that here'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A mate is the person you're meant to be with, you're drawn to them and want to be with them, once you bond you can't be unfaithful to them, you're heart won't let you.

You're crazy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal laughs 'Probably, but the shrunken blond with me says otherwise, and I believe this one belongs to you' she plucks Emma from her cleavage and places her in Lilith's hands 'I know you 2 have a complicated history, it happens, but she is your mate. Please accept it, and don't give me grandkids for a few more years' she teases but her eyes flash with worry as Lily just stares down at Emma who was wringing her hands fearfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Lily's reaction/thoughts to this development?</span></div></div>",

Zelena smirked as she knew the curse couldn't be stopped, only redirected (which was why she was holding back) so even if Regina or Emma wanted to fight back someone else in the area would need to take their place and with Emma being a hero and Regina going soft she knew neither would go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the magical smoke dissipated Zelena knew it was safe to enter and began making her way up, her flare for the dramatic being the reason she used her magic to turn the door to ash rather than simply unlock it but it did the same job and enabled her to get the drop on her prey. Both Regina and Emma were rather close to the door though like the other adults they were 4 inches tall and practically neutered magically speaking which made scooping them up and slipping them into her dress child's play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the 'biggest' threats dealt with for now Zelena turned to the other occupants of the apartment, her eyes sparkling when she sees one of them (Charming she believes) making a break for it once their eyes met. He was going at what would be quite a pace if normal size but he couldn't hope to compete with the leggy redhead giantess then caught up to him in a couple of strides and mercilessly slammed her boot on top of him, moaning at the satisfying squish the former prince, former, former shepherd made as her was crushed to a bloody pulp. At that moment she knew why Maleficent and even Regina enjoyed this method of punishment, but also why the dragon had been so gentle with her princess and Regina had created the durability charms; non magical people were so <i>fragile</i> when they get shrunk which was fun when death was the end result but not so much when you want to play or even torment them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing her way through the home Zelena found Henry and baby Neal just as she'd planned: unshrunk and in stasis, though the fact they were together was a bonus as it meant only one poof. As she stroked her cheek Zelena though about how brave her nephew was, but how he was much to young for her to do anything to... thins wasn't his fight nor was it the baby's. She poofed them to Regina's crypt, they'd be fine there at least for now, maybe one day she'd release Regina and set the boys free, or maybe she'd try her hand at motherhood herself she really didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as she stepped back into the main area that she realised she'd missed one, where was Snow White? She found her huddled under the kitchen island crying her eyes out <i>'Must have seen what happened to her husband'</i> thought Zelena as she squatted down, getting Snow attention immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello precious' Zelena says with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Zelena, why are you doing this?' Snow yells through her tears, which just make the witch grin wider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's quite simple, you and the stain that was once your husband couldn't leave well alone, Regina was as much a pain in your side as she was to me all you had to do was sit back and pop no Regina everything is fine and dandy. But nooooo, you had to bounce in a ruin my plan like a heard of drunken elephants. So now I've found a new way to deal with the problem, Regina &amp; Emma will be quite fun to break and well Charming was fun to smush but I'm sure it'll be annoying to clean him off my shoe later so good news that's not how you're going to die'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow gulped 'Please just let me go, think about my baby, my grandson'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh I already did princess, they're safe and sound away from here, but like I was saying killing your boy toy and capturing the saviour and evil queen have made me quite peckish, if only I had a little snack to tide me on the way home' Zelena wrapped her fingers around Snow before the woman could figure out what she meant, which lead to her screaming as she was thrown into the elder Mill's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelena groaned as she swirled Snow around in her mouth, not seeing the point in being gentle so took great joy in bouncing the shrunken princess off her teeth for a few minutes before opening her jaw slightly and slamming it down like a trap on the first thing to enter it. The muffled screams Snow was making meant she hadn't slammed it down on her head (Zelena was unsure whether to be happy or disappointed by that) but seeing an opportunity to indulge her sadistic side more than she already did slipped the tip of her tongue between her teeth and Snow and pulled tearing her limbs as they remained but she was pushed to the other side, Zelena tasting blood that wasn't her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeking out and eventually finding a mirror Zelena held it up to her mouth and peered inside, noting once she found her she'd managed to remove Snow's entire arm from her shoulder as well as her leg below the knee. Knowing speaking was useless Zelena clicked her fingers to draw Snow White's attention even just for a moment as the pain was probably immense, and when the princess finally did meet her eyes through the mirror waved mockingly and closed her lips before beginning to chew until there were just a bloody mess of unidentifiable (and possibly fruity) gloop which she then swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was just the 3 of them Zelena could feel one of her prisoners was still squirming and fighting, trying to free herself from her occasionally emerald bosom while the other was not, she wondered if Regina had given up because knew she would be unable to fight her way out, or if she was fighting with herself to snuff out the arousal she'd normally feel in this situation. Hmm Maleficent is still angry with Regina, maybe when she was done with her she could offer her up as a gift to the dragon, she'll probably keep Emma as she was starting to enjoy the jiggling her movements were causing of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

After so many years, she finally got her revenge, a dream which became true. \"<i>Justice has been done</i>\" she thought while sitting on the Charming's bed, two former heroes who meet a dark fate some min ago...She smirked at how powerfull she was. Speaking about powers, Zelena decided it was time to show her dear sister what \"Power\" really looks like. She slides her hand into her cleavage, and to her amusement, she meets some little resistance from both Emma and Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It seems like someones want to stay stick in my breast...but i'm the one who makes the decisions here.\" Zelena said to her captives.

Would you play with me ?! \" Zelena was filled by joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't be stupid Zelena and put us down right now !!\" Regina ordered. \" Regina we should use our magic together !\" Emma suggested as she noticed both her and the mayor had their arms free from Zelena's grip. Regina nodded and they placed their hand toward the giantess, ready to create an attack or something...But nothing happenned, at least nothing else than Zelena's loud laught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not enought smart to realize that your power level shrunk with you ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"damn !! I don't know what's your plan but my parents will save us !! \" Emma yelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...about that...i think i'll make you clean the sole of my shoe...or maybe not. I don't know. How evil does that sound ? \" Zelena added most to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What does that mean ?! \" Both Regina and Emma began to panick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about Henry and the baby. But i can assure you you'll never see your parents again Emma. Oh yeah sis,i did in less than a min what you tried to do with Snow for so many years ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's struggles in Zelena's fist became stronger as she felt overwhelmed by anger and sadness, which unfortunately caused to annoy the giantess who decided to place the excited blonde's body under her left cheek, while her head is still out so she can breath.  \" Now try to express yourself with my ass..if you can move\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You'll pay for this ! \" Regina yelled while watching Emma's predicament.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's over Regina. I'm holding you in my hand and you have no magic. Come on, what could you possibly do to me ? On the other side, i can do whatever i want with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You'd better kill me now !! \" Regina said trying somehow to convince Zelena she's not scared of her. As an answer, Zelena openned her grip and use her magic to keep Regina flying into the hair. \" Kill you ? Don't count on it sis. I have better plans for you...and maybe some old friends who would love to see you again. But first, you should remember the place you belong. \"  With a simple movement of her finger, Zelena made her tiny sister to flight down riight on her shoe. Regina couldn't move a finger as Zelena's magic litterally stuck her to the top of her shoe, something really humiliating for the former mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Your body seems so fragile i can't take the risk to put you inside my shoe. But this way you might devellop an admiration to my gigantic size, who know ?  Oh speaking about fragile body, how's our little friend trapped under my butt ? \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The little blond was stubborn she'll give her that much<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, well Ms Swan, it seems you may have more magic that I expected, still alive and kicking under my arse. you might just be more durable than my little sister which means we're going to have lots of fun together and who knows maybe you'll even enjoy some of it'' Zelena giggles as she stand up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma really would have liked to have taken the opportunity she was given to escape  but a mix of exhaustion and shock prevented her from moving, plus she wasn't sure whether to be flattered or worried that Zelena thought she had more magic than Regina and that she was 'more durable' given she wasn't even putting Regina underfoot for fear of breaking her and ending her fun. Then there was the problem of Zelena shimmying out of her pants, revealing a pale full moon for the shrunken blond to ogle. 'Like it little one, I know it's phenomenally large at your size, plus...' with barely a flicker of her magic formerly pale white skin turned a strong emerald green '... once you go green, well you know the rest' Zelena giggled and sat back down, dropping her right cheek on top of Emma who now had a reason not to move as she couldn't. 'Hm, still solid and there was no crunch or pop. You'll do nicely Emma' she cooed as she stood up, Emma stuck to her slightly sweaty skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Zelena, you will pay for this' Emma yelled as she tried unsuccessfully to unstick herself from the witch's emerald ass cheek, just getting laugh from above as a response at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my pretty you're so very wrong, plus I'd like to remind you that the clothes in this world are very... tight and stretchy' Emma paled as she realised what Zelena meant as she pulled up what Emma thought might be yoga pants but conjured as there was no way she could fit in something this constricting any other way. The second the wicked witch let go Emma was reminded of the definition of skin tight as it pressed her deeper into Zelena's rear, pinning her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelena flattened down her coat, ensuring nobody could see the  saviour shaped lump in the back of her pants. As she sat down a little gentler this time she stared down at a frantically struggling Regina 'It's no use love, besides even if you could move given how vulnerable you are I have no intention of letting you out of my sight, which actually means telling me how to cast your armament charm would do us both some good' Zelena taunted, her toes curling in anticipation, Regina laughing in her face surprised her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The spell doesn't work on magical being, never needed to; Mal never shrinks herself smaller than half her size and when I was shrunk... well let's just say Maleficent put her whole weight on a half inch tall me and I'm still alive now, the 3 hours of formal dancing she did with Aurora and Mulan with me trapped under her arch was torturous but not life threatening. But you think you will break me at 4 inches, face it Zelena you fucked up' Regina sneered, despite everything she still managed to be better than the annoying red head bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelena growled as she pulled her foot out of her boot and took great pleasure in squeezing Regina's neck between her toes, not enough to damage her in any way, just to make it hurt ''You want that life again so badly I'll be sure you get there when I'm done with you. Seeing as you've been in her prescience you can clear up some rumors for me, or not I suppose: Is it true all dragon's have a foot long penis? Because if she does that'll definitely ensure you get shoved somewhere and are never seen again' Zelena grins when she feels Regina shudder, thought she's only half right as to why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Regina was afraid of what her sister will do to her, but she also feels anticipation at the chance to be this size around the others again. Sure they'll probably be angry with her and Mal is the queen of imaginative punishments, she's going to probably be inside one of them for a while or else look like she'd been trying to drown herself in syrup but after than she'd be welcomed back into the collective and besides, being the tiny plaything to 3 beautiful women (particularly ones who cared about you) what was the problem with that? She couldn't let Zelena know though as she'd ensure she was never reunited<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncurling her toes Zelena pouts ''I'm bored, guess we're going out sister dearest'' she coos and slides her feet back into her shoes, watching her first few steps and laughing at the nauseous look on Regina's face as her tiny body zoomed through the air. She especially liked bouncing down the stairs from the apartment to the street as she could actually feel Emma's body bounce in time with her butt cheek. Her stomach growling pulled her thoughts away from torment and mayhem, realising Snow really didn't help replenish the magical drain her major shrinking curse caused her she took off in the direction of the nearest eatery she knew, sure Ingrid's ices were nice but she needed something filling first, plus the thought as dunking either of her toys in the ice-cream and slurping it off appealed to her greatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

Grinning to herself and ensuring Regina was too dizzy to know what was going on she made her way into Granny's, sliding into the seat beside Mulan before anyone noticed her entrance, as well as suppressing a moan when she felt Emma continue to squirm under her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reactions to her prescience were to be expected: Aurora pushed back the kid's stroller away from the witch while Mal went all demon face with the black eyes and pointed maw, Mulan's hand wrapped tightly round the hilt of her sword. Rolling her eyes Zelena raises her hands in a peace gesture<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Relax darlings, I'm not here for the kids, dragolisks are inherently dark anyway so it wouldn't have worked even if I had stolen them' she says, getting shocked looks from the 3 women 'Oh was it meant to be a secret princess was the dragon Queen's baby mama? Surprised Regina hadn't noticed already, their magical aura can't be anything other than dragons'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you want witch?' Mulan asks, still tense though she looked less angry now Maleficent appeared to have relaxed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I just finished dealing with sevral do gooders and realised one of them isn't something I can really play with, family and all' at the curious expressions she continued 'The Charmings are no more, Miss Swan will be my personal play toy, and that just leaves Regina that I don't know what to do with' Zelena grins widely when she sees the dragon's eyes harden and the other women's jaws clench for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down she removes Regina from her shoe, gently manovering the struggling woman before dropping onto the table between the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora grabs her leg and pulls her towards her, until there was a crunch and Regina yells which causes her to immediately let go, Regina forcing back the tears as she wouldn't cry, not now. It also showed her just how much weaker she was under Zelena's charm when the least physical of them can break her ankle simply by holding her too tightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Much more fragile than I remember. Too bad, she used to make such a good insole and seat cushion' Mulan snarks, Mal's lips curling a smirk while Aurora is too shocked by the damage she caused to react<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelena pouts 'Cut me a little slack it was my first shrinking curse, besides it worked properly for Emma, she's currently keeping my butt company with no complaints from her. So I presume you're going to fix her if you do keep her?' she asks, Mal just rolls her eyes and waves her hand over the woman, a deep red glow filling her form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Done' she says neutrally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So like I was saying, there are so many things I'd love to have happen to little Gina, but as her sister it crosses several  lines even I won't cross, Emma will be feeling those by the way. So I hear you have some problems with Regina, want to distress with the source of your anger? You can keep her if you like, I'm never going to change her back so someone might as well get some use out of her' she red head shrugs as the others think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey knew all of them were going to punish Regina for what she did but she would eventually be returned to her former position in the group, a few days of Hell were in her future for sure but they couldn't stay mad at her forever, what's a few curses between lovers? The only hitch being Mal could sense the curse on her form, she was locked into her current size, but as they'd all learnt by now with her and each other, a little Regina was better than no Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what now?</span></div></div>",

It did feel to her that unwilling or not getting off to the smell and rough groping of her big sister's enormous feet would do Regina so much damage. It was also doing her a load of good as well, her core not being this fired up in years, a part of her considered a synchronised release as a cherry on top of this little moment but decided instead to deny it al together, just before Regina's crescendo all that pale flesh left her sight, tapping eagerly at the heel of her boot, while Zelena lay back on bliss, feeling she could almost hear her little sister's weeps of frustration and hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this moment Emma took to make her way over to her friend and previously co-parent now co-plaything tot crazy bitch. As she got close she could see how heavily Regina and Zelena's sweat had mingled on Regina's tired body, and was glad their magic mixed with every aspect of their body producing an appleish scent, though considering the source Emma's eyes still stung slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Regina, I'm here to help''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Emma run, don't look back just run and find somewhere or someone safe'' she yells as loud as she dares without drawing Zelena's attention from her own pleasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But I'm trying to save you'' Emma pouted despite the situation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes but Zelena won't kill me, she's waited too long for this. But she'll get bored eventually and there are certain lines I hope she won't cross I'll be released most likely this size one of these days. If she was to catch you Emma, let's just say you may never see the light of day EVER again'' Emma gulped, especially when she saw the fear in Regina's eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay Regina, but I will come back for you, mark my words and hang tight'' Emma promises and turns to leave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

This was all well and good until she pressed her breasts together as she readjusted herself, tender flesh pressing in on him in all directions his hormones went into overdrive and his dick began hardening<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had definitely developed an <i>appreciation/obsession</i> for breasts earlier than would be considered normal, but he put the blame down to 2 things: One being Ruby, the waitress seeming to be unaware of where her body ends, as over the years she's bounced her large breasts off his head many times, sometimes accidentally pressing his face into her constantly exposed valley of cleavage. The other cause was Regina, no that's a little unfair Regina's massive tits and her hunger for affection. One thing he did miss when he was fighting with his adopted mother was her hugs, especially having his head nestled between/against her pillowy bosom. Now he couldn't really enjoy this because despite everything Regina was still his mother, a problem he doesn't have with Belle, being only technically his grandmother due to her recent marriage therefore he was completely guilt free when he began to hump her boob while she made her way back to her place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle eventually made her way home and retrieved Henry from her bra, her frown deepening when she saw his erection 'You really are a pervert' she says, Henry winces and groans when she presses her thumb on his dick 'I bet you're going to get off on this,  but it's my turn to have you do something I want you to do' Henry hisses as she rubs the front of her pants roughly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time for a time-out Henry, for my turn you will be ... while I start my new book'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Belle have Henry do?</span></div></div>",

It was a good day, until she noticed something's strange while cleaning the dinner table : the rose that Rumple offered to her the day before, disappeared. She looked disapointed, wondering if Rumple was in a bad mood today and just made the flower disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she heard something inside the vase. She approached it carefully to check what was doing some noises. The diminutive form of what seemed like Gaston just looked up : \" Belle !!

I mean no injuries or something ? \" she asked worried as she remembered she cut a part of the rose to make it fit into the vase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaston checked his arms and muscles first, with an arrogant attitude as usual. \" No i'm not !

Not only that but she could see the sides had slightly buckled in during their brief stay in her cleavage, and while she was proud of her bust size she knew she was small compared to other people in town such as the aforementioned Regina and Mal both of whom would be like a compactor for the little car, smushing it the first time the orbs collided with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that thought that told her she should probably crush the thing now before it came up again in any kind of conversation or questioning, the only thing she needed to decide now was how to do it?</span></div></div>",

Regina (you assumed) asked with a tired sigh snapping Emma out of her drooling as she steps forward and extends her open hand so you were visible to the dark eyed mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, okay' she shrugs, causing the 3 of you to stare in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's it! We show you a little man literally in the palm of my hand and you just go 'oh okay'? Seriously Regina!'' Emma yells, fingers unconsciously clenching around you though luckily not enough to harm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well of course, am I supposed to be shocked when a spell works as it's supposed to. The protection spell I used shrinks any non magicals that cross it, which considering where we are is anyone from outside of town. It's what both mother and I used to protect out heart rooms from the usual idiots back home. I am pleasantly surprised that it seemed to still work just as well as before despite being spread out over the entire town line rather than a simple doorway that it usually protects'' Regina answers with a slight smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Great you've used this thing before, how do we undo it'' Emma asks quickly hoping to fix things as soon as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hold your horses Emma, 1 we don't know your little friend can keep our secret, and 2 I don't have the reverse lying around usually theft is dealt with swiftly and thought some people disagree in a much more fun way back home' Regina replies with a grin full of teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm going to die' You squeak in panic, though a heavy sigh from Regina draws your attention back to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You'll be fine, Miss Swan and idiot no. 1 are good judges of character... most of the time'' Snow pinks at the last comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Regina she was your sister'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exactly and look how I turned out, it's dumb luck you've didn't die a hundred times over''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Guys! The spell'' Emma interrupts, raising you back into their field of vision again 'Also how did you hear him?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There are rituals that enhance a mage's senses, Mal taught me quite a few and I used them to enhance <b>all</b> of them' Regina smiles as her fingers ghost over Emma's hand while she deftly transfers you over to her own palm then turns to walk into the centre of the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay get it together Swan you got no chance, she's with the dragon anyway' Emma mutters sadly to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No I'm not' Regina says causing both you and Emma to mentally facepalm as the mayor had just explained about enhanced senses 'Mal finally got Aurora to admit her feelings, only took missing 2 years of her kid's life before Snoozles finally got her arse in gear but Mal's just glad to be there for the rest of them, maybe even get another along the way' Snow and Emma just stand there in shock at the news causing Regina to sigh and flick her wrist, a purple smoke cloud forming on Emma's desk 'page 394 will be the reversal spell so get to it'' she says placing you gently on the floor between her heels before slowly and carefully stepping back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This will reverse the curse, also why am I doing it?' Emma asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Firstly this is the reversal to a generic shrinking spell as the other option would require a lot of research that may lead to nothing. Secondly, you are the one that wants to grow him back, personally I want to find a cage or maybe a doll house to keep him in so he doesn't get accidentally crushed because he's kind of cute at this size, therefore you can try fix him''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed but took her place by Regina's side 'This the one?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Ms Swan, now try not screw up' the mayor states before taking a few extra steps back, Emma groaning at the <i>'vote of confidence'</i> the 2 older womens retreats gave her. Focusing her magic into her right hand she held the book in her left and read the spell exactly as it was written then released the magic in your direction, the room filled with blinding light for a few seconds before fading again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened when everyone regained the power of sight?</span></div></div>",

She has so many plans for Emma that taking you with her might be a problem. She doesn't really like any stranger in Storybrook. She has two options in mind : first, she could convince Snow to keep you in a Dollhouse, as as she suggested it before, while she finds a way to fix Emma first. She remembers Belle has one at God's shop.<br>\r\nOr else, she might keep you with her and with some tricks she might \"accidentally\" shrink you more and turns you into Emma's little toy.</span></div></div>",

I was taught by the best' the older mage defended herself, puffing out her chest in pride as well as hopefully as distraction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really, who the fuck taught you to be kind? I met your mother and she's a right piece of work' Emma asked in disbelief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maleficent of course. She rather liked to play with little people but preferred remaining in human form to do it so the shrinking spell was one of the first after fire that she taught me. Aurora and I had a lot of fun with her, even if the 2 of us and probably Mulan these days are the only people to survive her games' Regina explains with a nostalgic smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um what happened to the others?' You ask, curiosity getting the better of you as Regina sets both of you on her desk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They got eaten or were crushed under her feet, ass or tits' Regina answered either unaware or uncaring of the fact both her tinies paled dramatically 'I remember the first time I crushed one, it was an accident really: Mal practically threw me onto her bed and well the little guy or girl went pop under by rear, it was strange but a dragon with huge knockers straddling you immediately after really does work as a great distraction' she smiles having gotten lost in another memory tangent and giving Emma the opportunity to suggest making a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan didn't get that far as with a twirl of her fingers both of you were paralysed and Regina was pulling a black book thicker than either of you were tall from her desk 'Neither of you are going anywhere until I've worked a little magic on you both' Regina says suddenly all business<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And what is that exactly?' Emma asks, glad she was still able to talk despite being unable to move much of anything else<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Protection spell, how do you think Thumbelina is still alive? I don't know whether or not my spymaster's lucky Snow is such an oblivious moron seeing as she stepped on her about 4 times and sat on her once. Poor girl, I actually can't remember if I brought her over with me with the 1st curse' Regina hums then clicks her fingers 'She's my PA'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Really? Wow Thumbelina's a lot um... bigger than I expected' Emma whistles and you have an idea exactly what Emma means by <i>'bigger'</i><br>\r\n[Because I'm a little bored Thumbelina is played by Caity Lotz, just because]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That she is and what a screamer. Plus you've reminded me of someone else who's survived Mal, not deliberately like Aurora, Mulan or myself, but more because she can't be crashed or digested, thanks to me' Regina grins victoriously before finally stopping somewhere in the middle of the book 'Because of this spell' she says and with a way of her hand a fine gold mist rises from the page and dives, engulfing the 2 of you and being absorbed into your bodies. You don't feel any different and judging by Emma's confused expression neither does she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did anything happen?' You ask when you feel the stasis charm release, a little worried that Regina's grin just kept growing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You tell me little man' she says before turning around and hopping onto the desk, flattening you under her left butt cheek and chuckling the entire time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'REGINA!' Emma yells and runs towards her, but stays back a certain distance to avoid the former Queen's shifting rear, staring in horror as the butt most likely smears you bloody remains across the desk, gulping as she remembers what Regina had accidentally said about her first time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh calm the hell down Swan, your little boy-toy is perfectly fine' Regina snaps at her before standing back up revealing you to at least look none the worse for wear, Emma now running over and helping you up 'Go on, tell her how it was'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It wasn't exactly comfortable but it wasn't painful either' you explain and Emma breathes a sigh of relief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good to know it doesn't hurt. I assumed it didn't as Lena never complained about it and she complained a bloody lot about other things, usually about the amount of times she got stepped on by idiots so it's not like she was afraid to speak her mind around me' Regina says in partial defence and amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So now we're essentially invulnerable, what are you planning to do Regina?' Emma asks, not even trying to mask her curiosity in her voice though her face was stony and serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The better question dearies is what aren't we going to do' Regina's eyes flash purple as she laughs and both of you feel a shiver go down your spines<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Meanwhile (aka just for fun)</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle smiled tiredly as she gazes down first at the tiny blond snoozing in her cleavage, then at the brunette shifter who's head is currently using her lap as a pillow and found herself very glad she'd followed Aurora's advice on love ''If you can't decide which desire your heart wants more, see if they're willing to share'' Seeing as it was the day after Aurora announced little Rosy's father was Maleficent and the duo and Mulan had been seen stealing kisses Belle knew Aurora had followed her own advice and was as happy as the bookworm hoped to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo back to Regina, Emma and you... what next?</span></div></div>",

She tried to remember all she learnt from Regina, mainly the fact that magic comes from her emotions, thought that she couldn't help but feels frustrated somehow.

With that thought Emma pushed back her leather jacket, slid the shrunken Queen into her shirt pocket and made her way back to the bug and with that, home. The shirt itself was most likely on it's last legs, hell this shirt was pre-Storybrooke for gods sake, plus it was definitely not equipped to deal with another side effect of Emma becoming a mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her was annoyed at no time did Regina, Maleficent or even Zelena (who Emma had somehow managed to become friends with) would tell her the effect magic would have on her bust, she had grown by 2 cup sizes since she arrived in Maine so the shirt was also straining to hold them in. This did have the benefit for Emma of Regina being plastered, spread eagle on her tit, only the thin material of her breast pocket and her bra stopping her pale skin touching Regina's more olive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned to herself as her house appeared in view, glad she listened to Henry and Killian about getting a place of her own, for no other reason than knowing if she'd still been living with her parents she'd have had to listen to Snow pitch a bitch-fit (sorry, <i>polite discussion</i>) until she fixed Regina, or worse, sent her to the fairies to try fix/experiment on. Given those option she knew Regina would pick any number of torments to being anywhere near Blue while this vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grinned widely as she locked her front door and bounced upstairs to her bedroom, where she finally removed Regina from her pocket, the tiny woman didn't stop squirming until she was dropped into Emma's palm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Emma, what the Hell are you doing? Quit this foolishness and bring me to my vault!' Regina yelled, even at this size Emma could see how angry she was getting but it just seemed to amuse her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way Queenie, though I suppose your just the queen of bugs now. You are mine, you said yourself this probably couldn't just be fixed, so I've decided to just keep you as you are. Maybe try make you a little bigger so you don't die from some of the activities I have planned' Regna shuddered at the twinkle in the blonde's eyes and how she licked her lips at <i>activities</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-w-what do you have in mind?' Regina asks, internally scolding herself for stuttering, something which causes Emma to just grin wider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh it's simple, from now on until the end of your life, you're going to be...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) '...My pet, and servant. It's my turn bitch' All her life Emma has had very little control over anything, her life was planned in order to break the curse and be the saviour, never mind all the shit she had to deal with between birth and then. So the chance to have practically absolute control over another person, particularly someone as powerful and unwilling to bend as Regina is an opportunity she couldn't pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) '...My lover/sextoy. You will <u><i><b>NEVER</b></i></u> leave me' Her parents, Neil and all the foster homes she stayed in and was kicked out of left Emma with quite severe abandonment issues. And what do you know, having the people show up again doesn't make those issues magically go away. The idea of someone who would love her and never leave her regardless of circumstances (already figuring out Snow's love was conditional, Hell she'd seen with Regina that even her own kid's love was conditional) gave Emma a million warm feelings inside. It definitely helped Regina was drop dead gorgeous in Emma's eyes, but that was just icing on a sexy cake.</span></div></div>",

Plus they had similar sarcastic senses of humour and she was very good with kids, now they were sure she wasn't going to try destroy the town again Henry was over ever once and a while, the wicked witch of the West being a good 'Fun Aunt' especially after so many years of Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the front door she knocked loudly, the red head poking head out irritably 'Yes?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have something you might be interested in, as well as something I need your help with' Zelena sighs and opens the door, letting Emma into her home<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then explained how she shrunk Regina (admitting to it being an accident but not one she regretted) as well as her plans for the former mayor which amused the emerald mage greatly.

So shall we?' she smirks and the duo are enveloped in green smoke, reappearing under Regina's crypt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well we're here, now to find a resizing spell, not a reversal just one to make her more of a handful so she can do more for me' Emma explains to Zelena who nodded in understanding before picking up some of Regina's books and passing one to Emma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Better get started them'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: They find a spell to enchant an object that will control Regina's size, then tether it to them both so only they can use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 There's nothing like what Emma wants in the texts, so Zelena goes 'fuck it' and decides to try change Regina's size a little with just pure magic.

She's not around at the moment, we're on break but I'll be sure to show it to her next time we have a lesson' Emma accepted the tome with a smile, a smile which grew slightly when she subtly squeezed her upper arms against her breasts, smothering Regina just enough to get her to squirm around just right for her new mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay then, best of luck Emma' Snow smiles and kisses her forehead before making a beeline for the door, Emma knew it was because she was worried what the blonde's unstable magic could do if she stayed too long. Sighing in annoyance Emma sat back in the sofa cushions and began to skim through the spells, okay she lied to Snow but it wasn't like the former princess really cared, she may not have Regina's vast knowledge of magical languages but her elfish was passable, actual quote from Regina, Mal was more like 'It'll do'. Still even her basic grasp of the language told her this was not just a basic spell book, oh boy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle was fine with lying to the former princess, her fault for never learning to read until Storybrooke, the tome she gave her was one on sex magic, and seeing as Rumple had at one point stated he would never use magic in the bedroom she decided there was no point in keeping it, it wasn't even a 1st edition (her inner bibliophile would never allow her to part with one). Originally she had tried giving it to Maleficent, but it turned out the dragon already had a copy and made liberal use of it, so her next stop was Emma... or more Emma through an oblivious and ignorant Snow White.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emma flicked through book a couple of spells caught her eye, grinning widely when she found the perfect one to use on her new lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Change the size of someone to anywhere between 1 and 7 inches tall (Emma didn't want Regina any smaller so obviously she'd be using it to make her bigger when playing and back to 'normal' when traveling)<br>\r\n2) Lowers inhibitions, allowing for expression of buried desires (Emma knew Regina felt something for her deep down, she could feel it in her magic, she just wanted to bring that to the surface.

Because I'm a weirdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curse was broken and everyone was pissed with Regina, well except for one person who had her own problems, boy problems. Ruby was often known as a flirt and her granny often got after for it very often. Ruby was annoyed with her Granny who didn't understand Ruby had her own needs. The only boy Ruby was able to interact with without her Granny getting after her was Henry. But the downside to that was that Ruby knew if she tried to do anything with Henry, Regina and possibly Emma would throw her butt in jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ruby thought of a plan. Ruby would kidnap Henry, she would do that by shrinking him so it would be easier to hide him, and since everyone was too distracted because they wanted Regina dead no one would notice the boys disappearance. But since Ruby had no magic she had to rely on someone else for the shrinking, thankfully she knew the perfect person for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never would of thought that you of all people would come here.\" Rumpelstiltskin mused as Ruby walked to the counter. \"Listen, I need a shrink spell.\" Ruby simply stated waiting for the Dark One to respond. \"Well what do you have to offer deary?\" Gold asked not really reacting. \"One free favor, when you need something from me you won't have to try and offer me something in return.\" Ruby offered, \"You know what, sure just wait here for a second.\" Gold went into the back room to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you told Grima we were leaving?\" Ruby looked down to see two tiny boys sitting in chairs at the corner of the counter playing cards. One had blond hair and was wearing a beret while the other one had blue hair and was wearing some sort of fancy coat royalty would of worn in the Enchanted Forest. \"Of course I did, do you really think I would of wanted a repeat of last time?\" The one with blue hair responded. \"True, also you touch us and you will be blasted with so many spells, find a sword through your spleen and be electrically castrated.\" The one in the beret said looking over to Ruby who just blinked. Gold walked back in with a small bag. \"Here you go deary, just throw a bit of this stuff on your target and they are good as shrunk, just a little note it also knocks the target unconscious.\" \"Hey there are two tiny kids on your desk.\" Ruby said, \"I have no idea what you are talking about my dear, unless if you are talking about mice.\" Gold responded looking at Ruby as if she was crazy, Ruby looked down to see the boys were gone before leaving the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby spotted Henry (attempting to) to snoop around, thankfully no one was around, probably because they wanted to brutally murder Regina. Ruby quickly sneaked up behind Henry pouring the bag of the shrink powder on him. True to what Gold said he became unconscious as he shrunk down to about two inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled at the small young boy, the only thing to wonder now was where to put him for the time being.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The frequency was at times because Ruby had little to do, liked messing with the kid by bumping off him with her breasts and because of how often Regina had her babysit the kid over the years, as well as how many times he'd gotten tired while she was minding him and curled up against her, resting his head directing between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this day the werewolf was unsure whether he was actually innocent enough to think he boobs were literally just pillows, or if he was a slight pervert who just didn't want her to stop and deprive him of the only person willing to put their large breasts in his face besides his '<i>mother</i>' which he couldn't really enjoy as much as Ruby's knockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the problem with that method was her usual dress being quite cleavage exposing, meaning either Henry could be seen or worse fall out so that was scrapped. Which left her with her current plan: sliding him into her tight shorts and panties, hiding him perfectly in her impressive ass. Moving her cheeks around with her hands Ruby was glad Henry would be unconscious for the next while, as otherwise he would definitely be squirming around at the moment, distracting her and giving the game away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to make it back to her room without anyone, even Granny noticing her Ruby locked the door and semi-reluctantly removed Henry from her now wedgied butt crack, placing him gently on the bed before cleaning herself up to make sure she was presentable. Hearing a soft mumble and groan she rushes over to present herself positioning her body over her new plaything so that while her best assets were in line of sight her face was the first thing he saw, licking and biting her lip as she imagines the things she could do with him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blinked into consciousness and his reaction was as to be expected 'Ruby, you're huge!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby giggled and pretended to blush 'Thanks, and they're al natural' she teased palming her breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No not your boobs... well okay they are nice' Henry grinned and that was the answer Ruby needed 'but I mean all of you in enormous, did you grow or something?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You might want to look around Hen'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry did and finally noticed his surroundings, that being Ruby's predictably scarlet bedsheets 'I shrunk!' he squeaked, then the smile returned even if a little smaller<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Henry, guess what? I've chosen you to be my little boy toy. At least for now' Henry looked up to her in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What, really? But you're so pretty, you could have anyone, why me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I know you Henry, you're sweet and lovely and so cute right now and will be very handsome later on, plus do you know anyone else I'd trust to rub their face in my cleavage without a hard kick to the groin?' Ruby answered, enjoying the blush and smile as she talks 'Or get a swanky ride in the back of my pants'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry gasped 'I was in your panties?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, carried you here between my butt cheeks' she says, turning around and nearly sitting on the boy, rear hanging tantalizingly close 'Thought about leaving you in there till you woke up, but decided you deserved a better first sight post shrinking than my butthole when you woke up'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wouldn't have complained but yeah your face is better' Henry mutters, unaware Ruby can hear him and grins widely. She stands up and turns again this time with her boobs swaying seductively over his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have a lot of plans for you, and with all the chaos at the moment we won't be disturbed for at least a couple of hours, so we're going to have lots of fun together' she says with a smile, enjoying the happy, almost dreamy look on Henry's face, as well as wondering if she could turn any of Henry's slight <i>interests</i> into full blown fetishes by the time this was over<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

Luckily due to a mix of the shrink spell and the general plump softness of the items he was being 'crushed'  between Henry was perfectly fine, in fact he was good enough he took the opportunity to nibble on Ruby's fine ass. The werewolf moaned as she felt him biting her rear, one hand fiddling with her bare pussy as the other squeezed her breast heavily, grinding her ass (and Henry) into her bed heatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down for a moment Ruby rose and looked behind her, finding Henry looking up at her with the same look of love and awe as before, plus a little extra that told her he was<i> 'enjoying' </i>this as much as she was 'I hope you liked that love, but I'd have done that to you anyway, the extra special surprise is next' she booms, grinning before with a slight adjustment drops back down, this time managing to get him directly between her cheeks.

Squeaking in surprise and stifling a much louder moan Ruby reaches behind and pulls Henry out, neither caring that hand (and now he) was covered in her love juices<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was amazing Hen' Ruby squeals, giving him a kiss that envelops his entire head 'For something so small to have such an enormous effect on a goddess like me.... you're just what I need' Henry blushes at the compliment, as well as Ruby giving him another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, to decide what to do next'</span></div></div>",

Well he knew that the city was strange, but this couldn't be more true when he openned his eyes to see his own appartment being so...big. He was on his bed, still having his clothes on as he was too tired the day before, all he remembered was that he only wanted to sleep when he came back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I must be dreaming, this is the only explain \" he said to himself too shocked to admit that he just...shrunk ! He was probably at the size of a coackroach now, but...everything seemed to be so true that henry had no choice but think this wa reality after all. He began to wonder...what if Lucy was right about the fairy tales ? Noo...there was probably another explaination. The truth was that he lost his family long times ago, he remembered it as if it was yesterday and it was still painfull. But how was it possible to being shrunk ? That was the only question which mattered for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy left the office, worried about many things...her mother mostly. She knew she will try to stop her somehow, now that she knew it was her own daughter who was responsible of the curse and not herself. This made her smile, after all it's been so long Ivy wanted to have full control over things, including her mother. And as long as she didn't have magic, she couldn't do anything. But today Ivy, aka Javotte, decided to make sure that the curse will never be broken, by going to meet Henry. She did everything she had to, so even if her sister Cinderella had to give him a true kiss, Henry will die. But Ivy would'rater avoid it, herself felt something for henry, so maybe if she could get him, Ivy would not only avoid a true love's kiss, but also will get her happiness. She smiled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl arrived at Henry's door and knocked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Henry it's me Ivy, i wanna talk with you ! \" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny confused man saw the chance to get help, thought he was not sure if he could trust her not, he knew she was nice with him these last times and even confessed her problems with him. He also suspected she was in love with him but decided to ignore it as he didn't feel the same for her...But for now he needed some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" IVY !! I'M HERE ! \" he yelled, thought that he knew she wouldn't hear him. He tried to think about something else to get her attention, when...he suddenly heard the door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she have a key of my home or something ? \" he wondered, still undertain to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy entered Henry's home, and checked everything including his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" DOWN HEEEEEERE ! \" he screamed as he saw her gigantic figure entering the room. That's when Ivy finally spotted some little movement on Henry's bed...And realized it was...Henry himself ! who was shrunk somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Henry is that you ?\"! She asked concernet as she approached the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah...i know it's crazy but it seems i've shrunk...How's that possible ?!

People don't wake up on a morning at this size ! \" Henry said in a sarcastic tone.

After all she remembered everything, and Henry is under the curse, thinking that magic couldn't exist, etc. \" How do you explain that you've shrunk ? \" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I...don't explain it ! \" He began almost angry. \" I feel like i'm in a nightmare, or in that movie 'honey i shrunk the kids', this doesn't have any sense ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smiled, for now Henry wasn't considering that the fairy tales were trues, thought she knew it was only a matter of time. But when that will happen, there will be nothing he could do as he'll be trapped with her. For now, Ivy just wanted to enjoy his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Maybe you should calm down, and see the advantages of your new size....\" Ivy suggested a strange smile on her face which made Henry felt something's wrong with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" advantages ? Are you serious ? What are you talking about ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the gigantic fingers of Ivy wrapped Henry in a soft grip, the man getting terrorized for a moment, before he was raised and placed inside the giant girl's bra inside her clothes. He screamed and try to resist, but at the end Henry knew that he should calm down and stay still or else he might fall off all along Ivy's body and die. He still tried to get her attention thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How do you feel in my gigantic bra ? \" She asked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ivy let me out ! \" he said. \" Find Jacinda and Lucy, please ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry did a mistake, and Ivy felt mad he would rather to have Jacinda take care of him instead of her, and the little man realized it, remembering that Ivy \"likes\" him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't worry i'm going to take a good care of you, no need hospital or either Jacinda.

To her pleasure and slight disappointment Henry was the perfect gentleman, barely moving other than the slight sway caused by her movements, sure it was nice he wasn't a raging pervert but come on not even a little wriggling she was letting him touch her quite frankly perfect tits. They may not be the biggest but the ones that were belonged to Regina and Zelena so they were the biggest Henry was going to get to play with without committing incest in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into her room Ivy tried to clear up the place a little, get random junk off her desk, hide the bra dangling from the end of her bed, place magic absorbing crystals on the corners of her desk... that last one was deemed most important in her mind as it they would draw in any magic that clung to Henry from whatever caused him to shrink. Sure it meant he'd be stuck at his current size, but Ivy was beginning to like the thought of keeping him like this, both in size and position. She also stuck a shard of Malachite to the underside of her desk, right in the centre with her gum, hoping the so called healing/purifying properties the mineral had in her world translated into this one, that way if worst came to worst Henry would be free of Gothel's poison and she could just stow him away on her person and make a break for it across realms. Gothel's schemes didn't matter to her, the old crone may think Ivy saw her as her mother, but she'd been burned enough times by her own mother not to let anyone have that level of trust and control over her ever again, plus she poisoned Henry and she really didn't like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the moment arrived, Ivy sticking his hand down her shirt and pulling Henry out of her bra, smiling sweetly as she placed him on her desk, slipping into the chair she kept right beside it 'Hello Henry, enjoy the trip? Given your new condition I've decided to graciously invite you into my home, just follow instruction and don't run off and everything will be fine. Don't do that and I'll have to get forceful' the witch says, interlocking her fingers as they rest under her chin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And by that you mean?' Henry asks, curious but also worried, a feeling not helped by Ivy's manic grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wrapping you up like a cocoon in my panties and shoving you in my drawers every night, for example? Gosh I hope I remember to check which one you're in in the morning rather than just put on the first one I find' she says with a <i>concerned</i> look on her face, causing Henry to pale and begin to back away, only to stop when Ivy slams her hand down beside him and grins 'I'm just fucking with yea squirt. But I do need you to stay put while I get research materials' she moves to stand and Henry looks confused once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait research? This is insane, where would you find instances of it happening, it's like... magic' he sighs the last word, his lowered head causing him to miss Ivy's raised eyebrows and wide eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well magic or not there have been cases of apparent miniaturisation, never has severe as you have right now but there are still cases. I heard about one many years back and it intrigued me, I kind of liked the idea of having a little friend or plaything, one that wouldn't abandon me like everyone else' she wipes her eyes before continuing 'Anyway I've had a passing interest in so called shrinking diseases and conditions for a while now, maybe we can sift through the data together to see if anything in the other cases match yours, maybe even find a way to either fix or manage it' she offers and surprisingly was mostly honest: despite being a world supposedly without magic there were strange things happening throughout the world, the shrinking was something that peaked her interests here as much as back home but here she could actually indulge without having mother clawing at her throat. Until Henry she'd never actually seen a little person since before the curse, and as a mage she could tell there was at least a magical root to his shrinking but a small part of her wished he'd contracted or been contaminated by something that lead to his new size (Hell maybe it did and the 2 mixing is why he's so small).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what am I supposed to do while you're gone?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy shrugs 'Amuse yourself I guess, I'd leave you a book to read or something but you're too small to turn the pages without potentially hurting yourself. Sorry my home isn't designed to cater to little people' she sighs dramatically before gently tapping his head with her index finger 'Don't run off now, I'll be back as soon as I can' she says with a purr, just before walking out the door, Henry hearing her front door open, close and lock not long after<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone Henry's mind was on overdrive, the sheer madness of his current circumstances were messing with his head, add to that his rather confusing feelings regarding Ivy and Jacinda, the possibility this was all something related to the curse nonsense Lucy was preaching to him, he just wanted to scream. His mind took the one moment of clarity to point out now was the perfect time to escape, a voice that sounded a lot like Jacinda telling him Ivy was bad news and didn't have his best interests in mind, but another voice, oddly enough sounding like a mix of Ivy and Roni said he should stay put, that Ivy was trying to help and that if nothing else it was a good idea not to annoy someone who's individual body parts were larger than his entire body (sound advice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Henry do, and what happens to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Henry stays put, Ivy shows up a little while later and the 2 spend some time combing through the data, mixed with a little flirting and Ivy toying with her potential future man<br>\r\n2 Henry says fuck it and tries to escape, failing and leading to a very annoyed Ivy when she finds him missing, also mad she has to <i>'punish'</i> him so soon after finding her new plaything.</span></div></div>",

So with that he decided to just sit on the desk, liking how well organised it was as well as the gentle glow of the crystals on the edges of the desk. It lulled him slightly to the point he was starting to fall asleep, his overworked mind conjuring images he wouldn't have allowed it to dwell on had he been fully on point: such as kissing Ivy, or more her lips enveloping him at his current size, followed by a positively wicked smile as she had be way with him with the ease his tiny form would suggest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Henry' the noise woke him with a start, shocked to see Ivy's massive face hovering directly above him, her eyes filled with concern, he presumed due to finding him passed out after however long she had been gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm good, sorry but I've just not been sleeping well these last few days' Henry apologises as he sits up, Ivy still frowning but sighs and sits in her chair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think I have an idea what has happened. You know the cult thing Weaver and Rogers are looking into?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The ones who took Eloise Gardner?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The one the crazy bitch runs' Ivy corrects but continues 'This sounds like part of their insanity. It's an end of the world type of cult where only the worthy will be spared. It's also one of those matriarchal and misandrist kind of cults, so any guys they chose to keep around would be well the size you are Hen'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry raises an eyebrow 'You do know how insane this sounds right Ivy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's response begins with a roll of her eyes 'Do I need to remind you that you're so small I could probably lose you in my underwear?' Henry blushes and misses the woman's grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay so say this cult managed to figure out how to shrink people, why me? Unless you're in the cult I can't think of anyone who thinks highly enough of me I should be spared the end times, even at a bug size'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy grimaces 'Lucy, or more the crazy things she's been involving you in. Her rantings are actually a rather strong parallel to the cult's ideas, so with Lucy trying to get you to break the curse...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eloise thinks I'm trying to stop her end time ritual' Henry gasps, dropping his head into his hands 'I knew coming to the Heights was a bad idea' he grumbles, Ivy leaning over to call down to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hen, relax, it's not all bad. I found you rather than Lucy or Eloise's cultists, and there's another thing' she grins down and when he looks up questioningly she flicks her eyes down. He followed them... and stares right into the void of her braless breasts resting on the desk 'Have fun' she whispers, shooting forward enough to envelop him in her perky bust, her hands squishing the malleable flesh around Henry's squirming form, moaning lewdly as his yelp gives him nothing but a mouthful of her pale breast. She finally releases him and both are red faced and breathing heavily, Ivy grinning widely as she flops onto the chair that hasn't ben moved since he arrived in the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'See, everything's under control and if the cultists can shrink you there should be a way to unshrink you... however' Henry tenses at that word alone, shortly followed by the click and clatter of Ivy's heels hitting the ground 'I've done all the work while you've napped. I think you should pay me back for rescuing you, giving you my room to share with yours truly, offering to fix you and letting you play with my amazing boobies twice...' she leans back and her bare feet land on the desk on either side of Henry '... I think giving me a foot rub should do for now. If anything else comes to mind for a little guy like you I'll be sure to add it to the list' she smiles at him from his view between her feet, her toes twitch ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Also, I wanted to rub my breasts in your face, especially to see you turn such a lovely shade of red' her feet drop to the ground before hopping off her seat and walking out of the room, leaving Henry confused on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later Ivy shows up with a plate of food, which contained actual food, such as meat and eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, so you do eat like a normal person' Henry jokes, to which Ivy rolls her eyes with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just don't tell mother, I only gain weight when she knows I'm cheating on my diet' she whispers conspiratorially<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's an oddly specific ability there'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True' Ivy nods with a smirk, pushing the plate to him while she chews on her own sandwich 'Hey, do you and Roni have any kind of signals? Like an <i>'I can't be there but I'm not dead or kidnapped'</i> kind of thing?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry chuckles 'Actually yes, it's Swan by the way. Why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy rolls her eyes, wondering if Henry's birth mother's last name was done by Regina on purpose or simply an echo bleeding through the curse on Henry's part 'Because I think we need more than just me looking for a cure for you, and Roni's the most trustworthy person we both know, as well as how she's protective of you in an oddly motherly way, don't ask me why. Plus better her than Jacinda and through her Lucy, as it will just make her more hell-bent on breaking the curse...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Which considering is what got me into this mess I'd prefer not having to deal with at the moment. Thanks. So when will you be seeing her?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I won't be seeing her, we'll be seeing her' Ivy grins, mostly as Henry's shocked face 'You're coming with me little guy, might need proof to convince her I'm not fucking with her or holding you prisoner' Henry nods at this, knowing Ivy and Roni didn't exactly get along, despite him being friends with both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Henry was full and Ivy was finished the hidden witch got herself ready to transport her charge, in this case meaning putting back on her bra. Henry blushes as she casually removes her blouse, not that it matters as she turns while doing so, so all he sees is her pale back until he sees the navy blue strap. After adjusting herself and putting back on the blouse Ivy picks him up and slides him into her cleavage, his head barely peeking out so she knew he could still breathe, before buttoning it up completely and walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Roni's Bar</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are quite a few things Regina wanted to see today, the pale witch bitch entering her building wasn't one of them 'What do you want Drizella?' she hisses as the brunette sits at the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nothing much Regina, just thought we could have a civil discussion about the little man Ms <b><i>Swan</i></b> birthed' she smirks for a second as Regina notices the code, before her collar is grabbed and yanked into Regina's personal space<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where is Henry?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jeez did he give me the wrong code word or are you just insane EQ? Seriously, Henry's fine, even more so if you let go' Regina does and Ivy brushes herself off, subtly checking Henry was still okay before continuing 'Gothel's stepping up her game, and might even be getting desperate. So I believe this is the time for a little truce'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina raises an eyebrow 'And why should I believe Gothel's little apprentice? You're the reason we're even here'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy rolls her eyes 'Firstly I did all this to get revenge on my mother, I don't give a flying monkey about Gothel's plans, hell if I can make mother suffer while giving the middle finger to the bitch who started all of this, count me in. Besides I wouldn't have been trying to draw the toxins out of Henry if In were on her side'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina's eyes widen 'But how? That much material should be enormous'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy chuckles 'True, but luckily the desperation I mentioned on Gothel's part meant I didn't need very much at all' at Regina's angry glare she elaborated 'When I went to see Henry earlier today, Gothel or one of her minions had shrunk him' Regina gasps<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My little prince' she mumbles which Ivy nods to 'But why help me? Or why ask me for help?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I need more than just my skills, especially given Henry has managed to steal a little piece of my heart, much like I presume he did yours all those years ago. Also as his only family I presumed you'd want to help fix him if nothing else'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina blinks, tilting her head in confusion 'I'm not his only family, there's Ella and Lu...' she stops when Ivy giggles almost like Rumpelstiltskin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And here I thought you were smart Gina, Blood magic, it's not just a fancy lock, it can also hide someone's bloodline under another's, which is exactly...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What happened to Lucy' Regina finishes, Ivy knowing she had most likely seen it but dismissed the possibility as it made no sense to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exactly. So want to get your boy back? You can invite Zelena to help if you think we need more backup of course'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina nods 'This doesn't make us friends you know?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy rolls her eyes once more 'Wouldn't dream of it mom' she teases, and Regina doesn't feel the shudder of disgust she had expected to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile for Henry he was experiencing a roller-coaster unique to him: Besides the bouncing that came simply from being encased in Ivy's breasts, there was the almost suffocation when Roni basically yanked Ivy over the bar as well as the more mental roller coaster:  the fact Lucy's claims had been real, that Roni was actually Regina, was his mom, that they were from another world at that Gardner's cult was a coven run by Mother Gothel, and the most surprising, that the thing he most wanted to be true, that Lucy was his daughter was false, not that her blamed the girl, no, from what it sounded like, any blame and annoyance lay at Ella/Jacinda's feet, not that it would matter at his current size and situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

The little guy approached one of the gigantic pair of soles standing in front of him, wondering what could happen if would have refused.

Henry wasn't sure he was enought strong to make her feel something, that's why he got surprised she moaned with an exagerated tone. The whole situation was embarrassing for him, also because he never gave a foot rub to someone, not even his wife...And know he was almost forced to do it to a giant girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, i guess this could be worst...\" the little guy tries to comfort himself.

It was then she sees him on the floor between her heels 'Well, he's down there already' she rationalises before she lightly nudges him over with her foot, then much less gently grabs him with her toes, before stuffing both feet back into her heels and walking to her front door, eager to get this confrontation over with before they try break in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Henry things were different a little different: Ivy waking up (or more her foot leaving the desk) hit him like a car, surprisingly the fall only winded him, to which he was just getting his bearings when Ivy decided he wasn't done with her feet and it was their turn to kidnap him, So now he was basically cocooned by her toes, his head pressed tightly into the crevice tween her first two, wishing he were almost anywhere else, sure Ivy could have done worse things to him (swallowed him or shoved him inside her ass for example) but she could have also done much better (between her boobs or left him on her desk)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm up, I'm up' Ivy grumbles as she opens the door, seeing her favourite mentor glaring at her (not sarcasm, Ivy's teachers are Regina and Gothel, I'm pretty sure despite everything she prefers Regina) 'Hi Regina, what brings you here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where is he? Where's Henry?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy pouts, resting her chin on her hand 'You lost him, and here I thought you were ,mother of the year' she gasps dramatically and Regina looks ready to punch her so she stops 'I haven't seen your little man, but all things considered I'd recommend checking Lucy and Ella's place as usual or wherever Gothel's hanging out, she seemed to have big plans and I doubt clueless Henry's going to be allowed get in her way'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina gets into her face and right there Ivy's glad she put him where she had rather than her shirt, as Henry had enough issues without adding 'nearly suffocated by his mom's massive breasts' to the list, as she could actually feel the former queen's nipples through both their shirts 'If I find out you've hurt him, I will destroy you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself Ivy laughs, tightening her grip and rubbing Henry more into her sole 'Oh believe me Regina I don't plan to harm Henry, if he were here with me he'd be perfectly safe.

It was only after she'd taken her feet out of her heels and they were both flat and splayed on the floor did she remember Henry, who was still in her shoe. Given her sleep and panic idled brain she couldn't remember which foot she'd used to grab him, so decided to speed up the process by simply picking both shoes up and turning them upside down on the desk, happy when Henry falls out, not visually worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess hiding and travel are a work in progress' she jokes and Henry remains silent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Henry yells but Ivy giggles, his wriggling having an odd effect on her insides<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go Henry, enjoy my 2nd best features, I'll take you out later bu bye' she winks at her ass, though she knows if she can't see him he probably can't see her, letting go of her pants and trapping Henry in her arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that dealt with Ivy decided that she needed to get out and have a little fun to chill out,  as well as give her best friend/turned butt plug some time to let them both cool off from their fight. Knowing Roni's bar was definitely a no go, as Regina would murder her there she decided to go to the nearby bar 'Missing Night' known solely for their strong drinks, something Ivy knew she'd need tonight. Grabbing her purse and checking herself in the mirror Ivy heads out, adding an extra swing in her hips for her own amusement and the torment of Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into Missing Night, she was surprised to find Tilly and Margo, aka Alice and Robyn sitting in what would usually be her table. Not wanting to be a bitch, as well as wanting a little company tonight she sat down, the others bringing her into their conversation before their first drinks arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And then he just slumped all over me' a tipsy Ivy recounts a cursed memory of one of her supposedly semi regular one night stands, grimacing at the very idea and glad her mind had always been unaffected by the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know, right guys are the worst' Tilly raising her hand in solidarity, nearly falling off her chair as she giggles and mumbles incoherently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True, which is why I've never slept with one' Margot grins widely, giving Tilly Ivy the eye, the brunette smiles and knows if she were a little more drunk or Margot were a little less, screw Henry she'd have her fun with Robyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Any reasons? Tilly asks, curious and also painfully infatuated with the nerdy looking girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They smell better, dress better, the sex is awesome and boobs, did I mention boobs? Seriously they're like pillows with a person attached, or attached to a person is probably the right answer' she sighs deeply 'Plus there's the lull of a heartbeat in all of them. Don't tell anyone but I couldn't sleep unless I could hear mom's heartbeat until I was 5, I nuzzled into her bust every night, just to sleep, maybe that's why...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're so out and proud?' Ivy supplies, Margot grinning and nodding like a puppy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, now I'm in the heights and on the hunt once again' she giggles, not seeing Tilly's ears perk up and a grin forming that reminded Ivy of Gothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Tilly and Margot get more into it, causing an drunk Ivy to decide to sleep off the hangover, Henry stuck in her till morning<br>\r\n2) Ivy blurts out she has a little friend in her ass, the girls want to see and eagerly follow her to her apartment. What's the worst that can happen to our little friend, when in the prescience of 3 tipsy/drunk and horny gals?</span></div></div>",

I think it's time you returned the favour and get me off'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? Ivy are you kidding?' Henry yells up at her as she puts him down and begins to undress, her breasts bounce happily now free from her shirt, while her ass is framed by her panties as she drops her skirt. Ivy sits on the bed and gives him a wicked grin, which flashes an image into his head of a similar grin from a red head with blue/grey eyes and ... green skin? Jeez what's in the water in this place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy finally reaches out with one hand as she pushes her panties off and toss into the basket on the other side of the room 'My pussy is ready for you Hen, make it gush' she purrs as she places Henry down between her legs, watching her man from afar. He tries to protest but she lays it out completely for him 'Listen, I will tie you to a dildo or butt plug and use it if I have to, you are going inside me' After than he nods meekly and Ivy's grin widens<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry couldn't believe he was doing this, he was about to enter who he thought was his best friend and she was so massive to him right now her pussy was probably bigger than her apartment was to her. With little choice he pushes himself forward till he touches her lips, already damp with her fluids and a smell that was making his dick throb painfully. Sure the cave in front of him made him worry he was going to drown, but a small part of him finds the fact Ivy desires... no needs him inside her, as really cool. Even at the size he is now, Ivy wants to sleep with him, it made him feel huge and powerful, not the little bug person he currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you going to do something already? Might as well be fingering myself right now' Ivy snaps impatiently, clearly still annoyed with him, so Henry pushes himself through her lips into the tight passage of her vagina, hearing the groan as she chews her lip, shucking her hips and causing Henry to stumble and slide against her slick flesh. Ivy groans as Henry shuffles further in, his small hands pinching nerve clusters deep within, sending bolts of pleasure into her brain. <i><b>'Oooooh yesssss'</b></i> she moans, grinning almost drunkenly as her muscles clench and pull him deeper inside her, reaching a peak as she feels him squeeze a particularly sensitive spot, her cum causing him to exit in a wave as Ivy flops onto the bed, a wide grin on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)With Ivy dazed and satisfied, now is the perfect time for Henry to try make another escape<br>\r\n2) Ivy grins contently, seems she'd found exactly how Henry can earn his keep while tiny: satisfying her needs whenever she desires it. Seems like a good idea to her, plus maybe Henry will like his duties and eventually enjoy 'Paying rent'</span></div></div>",

He was now ready to believe everything, after all no one get shrunk just like that ! And he didn't know what to think about Ivy, she was probably not a reliable personn considering what heard about her from Jacinda...But mostly, Ivy just threatenned him, taking her size advantage to get power over him. This was totally insane and cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was thinking as he was considering that the distance between his spot on the desk and the chair might be dangerous...Was it worth of taking the risk to jump ? He honestly didn\"t know, maybe Ivy left to help him in despite of what she told him. Well from what he could say, the girl was serious was she said she d'like a plaything to not abandonn her. For Henry it was scary, but at the same time, Ivy probably needed some love, so all he had to do was to serve her whims and do what she says to gain her trust. Henry had a choice to make, and it didn't take long for him to know what was the best option. He choosed to jump from the desk to land hardly on the chair, giving him some pain, but at last this was expected. What he didn't know was that he would have been dead right now if his body remained the same as before...it seemed that he was more resistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a long time then, between the chair and the ground but at the end he choosed to go down, slowly but carefully, the chair leg until he finally reached the ground. And then some other times to join the door, everything he did took so much times that he couldn't be more unlucky when the door just openned in front of him. A few steps more, and Henry would have been dead by the impact of it on his body. Now he was facing a giant Ivy coming back and she didn't spot him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm back. \" she said, taking a step forward, her foot past over him and henry screamed in fear for a moment, before Ivy got away leading to her desk when she realized that..her capitve just left !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Henry ? HENRY where are you ?! \" She panicked, checking the drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry\"s body began to shake as he was seeing the giant girl being mad, but took the opportunity to run toward the openned door. Unfortunately, Ivy's first instinct was to shake at the door, and spotted the tiny form of henry running to get away from her.<br>\r\nThat's when a giant high heeled shoe landed in front of him, blocking his path. And the giantess looked down at him disappointed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i've told you to not leave me...but still you tried\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivy, please, i want to see Jacinda or Lucy, i'm sure they can explain what happenned to me ! \" Henry begged, scared. Ivy was a giant to him in her full height, and she was mad. That's when she decided to hurt him, as much as he did to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i've found out what happenned, and maybe i could find a way to grow you back. But now it's too late \" She said, as she enjoyed deeply inside, Henry's reaction. \" You should have trusted me. Now i have to punish you \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry's horror expression on his face was priceless for Ivy, but still she was mad at him and was about to do what she was going to do with him anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is a joke, right?' he asks/begs but she woman grins wickedly and lets go, dropping between her cheeks and letting her underwear slap back into place soon after. Giving her rear a shake she loves the feel of him bouncing between her cheeks with no control what so ever, only holding in a moan by chewing on her lips. This was definitely going to make going back into work so much more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, she could handle her mother's passive aggressive, and today aggressive-aggressive barbs, as well as Lucy's kicked puppy eyes asking if she'd seen Henry, because she had him trapped in her ass for her own amusement squirming around whenever she moved. And she wasn't going about this gently, siting quite hard, slowly and purposefully grinding her ass into her chair, as well and bouncing in her chair whenever she got bored. The extra swing in her hips as she walked she blamed on new heels but were really because it allowed her to imagine a slap sound as he was thrown from one cheek to the other with each of her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of free and invisible stress relief he was giving her meant Ivy had mostly calmed down when she came back from lunch, plopping down just as carelessly as before but smiling normally rather than sadistically when she did so. After another while she checked the coast was clear and her work was done before speaking 'Henry?' she says just loud enough for him to hear her 'If you want to get out of my ass, all you have to do... is give it a kiss' she grinned as she allowed him to most likely silently WTF 'Yep, if you want out, pucker up and lay one on me.. well my butt but same thing' she chuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry grimaces but he hoped he wasn't misplacing his trust in Ivy to keep his word, after all not trusting/believing her was what got him in this mess in the first place. Steeling his nerves Henry plants a kiss on the sweaty hill beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy frowns, that was a pathetic attempt 'Did you do anything? Well if you don't kiss if soon I'll have to just assume you want to stay there forever. And who am I do judge, I may even sew some pockets into my panties so you can spend everyday nestled in my ass. oh what fun' she holds in a laugh at his panicked squirming before moaning as he practically makes out with her ass, desperate to get her to acknowledge him and free him from her rear end. He was probably lucky the stupid diets Rapunzel had her on meant she very rarely farted or else he'd more than likely hump her ass just to have  a shot at freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's better, I guess you've had enough of my ass lttle one, but don't worry, I have plans for you' she grins widely, not that he could see before she</span></div></div>",

Lauren started to get worried, she wanted to study pixie dust and it's effects but not on herself, and there wasn't currently a known reversal method so if she shrunk she'd be stuck like that. She barely got respect from the fae for her humanity, what could happen when she was palm sized?<br>\r\nLuckily for Lauren there is an necessary minimum amount required to be ingested in order for the dust to have any effect, as well as her knowledge that the method by which it entered the body effecting the speed it affected the victim, how was that by the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren inhaled a large amount of pixie dust, getting into her system quickly and shrinking her within the next few hours<br>\r\nor<br>\r\nShe swallowed a mouthful of the dust, slowly being absorbed into her blood stream and taking a few days to shrink her</span></div></div>",

''What the Hell'' Kenzi yells after spitting out the succubae's spit she'd accidently inhaled ''Come on Bo, it's...'' then she noticed Bo's eyes; they'd turned blue, meaning Bo's fae instincts were active and the driving force. Kenzi had learnt not to argue at those times, the last time the little Russian tried to stop Bo when she was like this she was nearly suffocated, pressed between the succubus and the wall, her massive tits cutting off the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo smiled and winked, a gesture Kenzi had seen first hand had women drop their panties when sent in their direction by the succubus as she spoke '' A Fornicar\u00e1s, and they say good things don't come my way. I've hoped to find one of you since I discovered your existence, don't worry I'll take good care f you I have the body type you prefer and I'll make sure you have many sexy lades for you to use and repeat with. They'll be eating.. or more you'll be eaten out of the palm of their hands'' Bo says with a chuckle. Kenzi was confused, she thought she was straight ... But everything Bo said and the thought of several women; lusting over her and cumming because of her filled her with desire and phantom pride, even more so when she remembered the size difference. Despite herself she grinned before trying to return o a straight face but Bo had seen it ''See I knew you'd like it, this will be great for both of us'' ''Bo..'' Kenzi began but Bo interrupted '' Let's get this official and then you can get settled in ok?'' not waiting for an answer Bo brought little Kenzi to her lips and enveloped the girls face with in a kiss, Bo's plump lips blinding Kenzi to the blue glow that covered her skin before fading, her tongue ninja like darting out and swiping across her face as Bo moaned ''I know it's probably bad form to cum just from your smell and skin but damn you taste orgasmically good, is this what succubus is for humans?'' she said trying to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now that's over with I'll need to show you your travel and possible sleeping arrangement, I hope they're big enough for you, they're the best I know of'' Bo said her tone prideful as she lower her into her cleavage . Kenzi having seen this coming immediately began squirming and kicking in hopes of freeing herself from her grasp, even landing a few kicks to her tits, alas her feet slid off the bouncy flesh. It appeared inhaling and ingesting so much Fornicar\u00e1s essence had gotten the succubus hot, leading to wet, slick skin and increase to the already warm temperature within the confines of Kenzi's destination. The sweat did allow her to slid between her tits with ease to her head though, with Bo's index finger doing the last push completely enclosing her in tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo couldn't keep the grin off her face; she had every succubae's wet dream between her tits and it was all her's, there was a lot of preparation to do ...<br>\r\nLater when Kenzi was released ......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Fornicar\u00e1s: Small fairy/pixie sized fae with sex based abilities similar to succubae. They increase arousal only in female fae &amp; humans, gaining sustenance from the released essence. Because of this they usually seek out lesbian couples, which would double the sustenance produced in a single effect. They are sought out by succubae as they affect them stronger then even their own kind do, similar to how their own powers would affect humans or adolescent fae.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Yes Kenzi is now actually one of these, Bo's hasn't just lost the plot from lack of sex or something.]</span></div></div>",

''Agents Vasquez and Lane were talking about it near my office, and both myself and Agent In-Ze overheard this'' he answered, Alex rolled her eyes as well as noticing they'd just passed Kara's skirt ''So now Astra thinking being a Danvers makes you gay'' she sighed while J'onn laughed ''Nah, she thinks and is glad that living with a Kryptonian makes you open to alien boobs over a human penis'' he smirks as Alex blushes deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex praises the universe when they finally reach Kara's shoulder ''You're not going to let me go are you?''

The supergiant moaned loudly as she pulled the businesswoman back out, Kara noting she'd never seen a human's eyes as dilated as she did now. 'More' was a sound Kara only heard due to her enhanced senses <b>''Sorry?'' </b>Kara asked, mostly to tease the woman she'd started to fall for (Knowing Cat was a no go as the woman's walls were practically kryptonite laced titanium) ''I said, More!'' Lena yelled, and Kara noticed just how much she was affecting the woman in her hand, and a quick glance towards the roof showed she was having a similar effect on Alex, though much more unwanted in the other brunette's case as she was blushing heavily and trying to look anywhere else but at her sister sucking on the paler, non-evil Luthor like she was a lollipop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''Now for the main event I suppose''</b> Kara said once more pulling the front of her suit away from her skin, exposing her pale hills to both women ''Wait, can I.. um...'' Lena turned surprisingly meek and awkward for a moment which Kara found rather amusing <b>''Yes?</b>'' she framed trying to get the woman to continue ''Can I make my own way between your lovelies?'' Lena asked and Alex choked while Kara's eyes only widened slightly <b>''Sure''</b> she said with a grin placing her woman on her shoulder where she sat down and slid onto the exposed top of her left breast before turning to face the other ''Here goes'' she mutters to herself before bouncing off one tit and slapping face first into the other, grinning widely as she slowly slid down the slightly sweaty, alien boob, Kara quickly letting her suit snap back to catch her, now matter what she eventually landed on a fall from the height Kara's boobs were at would hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time Alex swore internally, as well as wishing they'd let Astra be used for the tests (apparently assisting in stopping Myriad didn't make her 'trustworthy' enough, dicks) even if just so she could not feel awkward or guilty for getting aroused due to the busty giantess with the Kryptonian blue 'fuck me' eyes, Kara was her sister (and potential future niece in law) she really didn't need those images in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's eyes bulged momentarily as she was surprised for her over enhanced senses to feel the pleasure of Lena Luthor herself licking, sucking and nibbling on her breast, sure in terms of damage the human might as well be chewing on a tire but you couldn't tell as her breast  would feel as soft and squishy as any human's, there would just be no marks, no visual claims of ownership. Oddly enough that sent her mind into a tailspin while her eyes blindly passed over Alex: claiming, she'd probably have to use scent as the usual methods would cause severe damage just due to her being Kryptonian never mind a giantess, she thought about swirling the brunette around in her mouth or dropping her in her panties, something to get the scent of Supergirl all over her, in her entire being, so strong it'd take more than a shower to remove the scent. An stray thought flashed in her mind; she occasionally lactated, maybe she should save it for Lena, either for drinking or claiming, whatever the woman desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she remembered she wasn't alone at the roof of L-Corp, Alex was staring up at her swaying breasts and spaced out grin and Kara could tell she was trying so hard not to be turned on right now, but was failing. <i>''If the office gossip is accurate for a change Aunt Astra is in for one hell of a night''</i> Kara joked in her head as she gave Alex a cheeky wink and squeezed her breasts together, pulling them up high enough for her long Kryptonian tongue to flick over her hard nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo?</span></div></div>",

This was a torture she couldn't escape, So Alex sat down, wondering how long her suffering will last as she also could hear Lena's screams of pleasures..<br>\r\n\" Oh...myyyy....Gooooosh ! \"  Kara yelled full of joy. \"how is it possible for a human to be sooo resistant against a giant Kryptonian like me <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> ?\".  \" Let's say that i made a good use of what my brother built in a purpose to make his body really resistant. He gave up on the project since it was not enought for him to face your cousin. Guess it's more than expected for me, though that i'm a bit tired \" Lena replied exhausted by these giants interactions from the girl of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Guess what ? I'll put you in a special place for you to rest.\"Supergirl said while she placed her hand which was holding Lena, under her skirt, trying to find the entrance of her panthy hose, and then when she removed her hand from her skirt, Lena was not in her hand anymore. Alex couldn't help but looked with curiosity to know what was the place, and she started to feel aroused by the probability that Kara just placed the tiny woman in her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sorry there's no room for you \" Kara said to her sister as she spotted Alex's gaze around her skirt. \" i swear i'll find a way to shrink you back ! \" the brune yelled angrily.<br>\r\n\" Go find a girlfriend first. You look like you need one right now\" she laughed one last time to Alex before she decides to fly away for a more \"private place\" with Lena trapped in her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex spent the next few minutes alone on the roof, sad and humiliated by the girl she once called her sister. She wanted to cry, but as she stood up and looked at the ground, Alex spotted a little bug walking near her shoe and decided  to make it pay for all her frustrations by squishing it under her shoe. She didn't feel better after she twisted her foot on the innocent bug, but at least she shared her pain with that little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" How pathetic...\"</i> a voice said from behind Alex who turned back to see.. \" Asta ?! What are yo doing here ?!\" The mature Kryptonian walked toward Alex and slides her fingers throught Alex's short hairs. \"I was surprised to see the DEO found a way to turn my niece into a giantess, but mainly i was shocked to see how she treated you..my poor little girl \".  Alex blushed by feeling Astra's fingers now touching her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wh..what do you want ?\" she finally asked.</span></div></div>",

Astra began ''...it seems he didn't have as much faith in this project as he appeared'' she smirked as she pulled out a sci-fi looking laser gun ''What does it do?'' Alex asks ''It's supposed to be a shrink ray, at least I think it is'' Astra answers turning the gun as she passes it from one hand to the other ''It kind of looks like something Winn would design'' Alex says now she has a chance to look at the device ''Or the new guy, but apparently it's based on Jor-El's original device, plus it apparently has a reverse switch'' Astra says, still grinning.<br>\r\n''So do you know if it even works?'' Alex asks, slightly worried by the almost theoretical way Astra talked about the gun ''I have absolutely no idea'' Astra answers cheerfully before Alex is blinded by a flash of purple light (Consistency)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex eventually came to when she hears a booming voice <b>''Are you still alive Littl... opps I mean Brave one?</b>'' for a second Alex thought Kara has come back, and prepared for more mind melting teasing, opening her eyes her jaw dropped, her core clenched and almost all thought left her mind: There crouched above her (giving Alex a view of her entire perfect figure) was Astra, even larger than Kara had been... or at least it appeared so as Astra had been taller than the blond Kryptonian before all this mess. Alex quickly checked her surroundings and had her suspicions confirmed, she'd been shrunk by the device to a scale similar to what normal humans were to Kara now, and now she was practically a bug at the feet of a goddess, looking  but she felt a mix of fear and excitement at the look of hunger in Astra's large eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a move faster than something her size should move Alex found her self being grabbed by Astra and slid up her body as the Kryptonian stood, being run along her thigh, stomach, being pressed harder against her breasts before finally reaching the white streaked alien's face <b>''Hello brave one, enjoy the trip?</b>'' Astra asked innocently her smile widening at Alex's luminous blush ''Y-y-y-you shrunk me?'' Alex asked, cursing the way her voice crackled <b>''Yes, and I must say you look so much like a yvalberry when you blush, oh they always were my favourite back home''</b>  Alex's eyes bulged as she realised way too late what she was gong to do, watching helplessly as Astra opened her mouth and tossed her in, moaning loudly while she swirled the DEO agent around in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eternity of torment (a few minutes at most) Alex felt herself being slammed hard against the roof of Astra's mouth by the alien's tongue as Astra swallowed, before feeling a rush of pressure as she was spat into the brunette's cupped hands. Astra watched a completely soaked Alex cough up Kryptonian saliva with a smile that almost looked cute before she spoke <b>''Not much of a first kiss was it?''</b> he smirked especially as it caused Alex's blush to reappear ''I? You? Really?'' Alex asked, half confused and half... hopeful? <b>''Speechless, I know I am when I reach a peak like you did'' </b>Astra teased while watching Alex splutter in embarrassment ''It's not what you think'' she defended weakly<b> ''Really?'' </b>Astra asked, curious as to how <u>her</u> Brave One would get out of this ''I'm not saying that I couldn't have enjoyed being in your mouth, a little, but the reason what happened, happened was due to something else entirely'' <b>''Hm?</b>'' Astra tilted her head in confusion ''Kara's a sexual sadist and one hell of a tease'' Alex explained as bluntly as quickly as she could, really not wanting to have this conversation with Astra  <b>''Ah, so you liked what she did with Ms Luthor?</b>'' Astra inferred Alex nodding as she saw no reason to lie ''Yeah, it was just really awkward when the sexy goddess is also your sister you've seen be a total nerd and make an absolute tool of her self just the previous day'' Alex admitted <b>''Well, I guess I'll just have to try harder then'' </b>Alex looked confused until she felt Astra's hands move closer to her face and see the older Kryptonian pucker her soft lips, Alex closes her eyes and prepares to be smooshed... but wasn't. There was pressure as when she cracked open her eyes she did see she was pressed against the woman's lips but nothing more. Frowning internally and presuming she'd never get the opportunity again Alex leaned into the 'kiss' obviously the correct response as her head was then enveloped in a smooch from the much larger woman. Astra's lips parted to allow her tongue to slide across Alex's face before dropping her hands.... slightly. <b>''Better?'' </b>Astra asked ''Other than once more having your saliva in places I'd never expected it to be, yes  lot better'' Alex answered as she wiped alien spit off her face and mostly out of her eyes <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''Well as much as I'd love to continue this all day''</b> Astra said with a sigh, Alex pouted in response as the Kryptonian fixed her suit (blank, royal blue super suit, with a silver cape) <b>''I have something very important to do. So let's go fix Kara''</b> ''Okay'' Alex answered then noticed the look Astra was giving her 'What?'' Astra giggles <b>''I don't have pockets. So you'll have some fun while I find my niece'' </b>she smirks as Alex finds herself being moved to Astra's...</span></div></div>",

Lena Luthor while exhausted was also smug and satisfied, she lay tiredly on the enormous pussy of Supergirl, having just finished pleasuring the goddess around her to a shuddering orgasm (which if the Thanix cannon sounding noise is any indication caused the giantess hero to lose control of her heat vision) and as her love juice flooded out of her sent the human crashing through her fifth. Smiling smugly she stretched her naked body (having lost her clothes sometime between entering Kara's panties and the real fun between the 2) and continued to gently nuzzle, glad this day had happened exactly the way it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was enjoying her afterglow when she felt something land on her forehead, opening her eyes sluggishly, her cross eyed expression found her aunt Astra staring down at her <b>''Hey Aunt Astra, did you see Alex, she so wants to jump you''</b> Kara cooed, giggling ''Yes Little One I did, though you were a real bitch to your sister back there'' Kara pouted <b>''But she was a stick in the mud, I just wanted to loosen her up''</b> Astra rolled her eyes ''Well Little One, I hope you enjoyed your time as a giantess because you're changing back right now'' <b>''But Asssstrraaa''</b> Kara whined ''No Kara, you need to change back, this isn't up for debate'' Astra retorted, Kara pouted and sighed before finelly growling <b>''Fine''</b> Astra nodded and floated up before pulling out the shrink gun ''This won't hurt at all, Brave One can attest to that'' Kara raised a giant eyebrow at the statement before her sight was filled with bright purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is the shrink ray a targeted device or an area of effect beam? (By that does Lena get shrunk with Supergirl so Kara has a hidden passenger in her panties, or does it just shrink Supergirl and her clothes.. ending with a blissed out Supergirl with a completely soaked Lena on top of her and shreds of former SG underwear in the vicinity (because the 2 of them definitely couldn't fit in underwear that just about fit 1)</span></div></div>",

Astra smiled as she knew from the tiny movements of the tiny brune that she didn't know how to react to this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Just relax. I know i'm not Kara, but still i'm a kryptonian and i'm sure you like my body \". The giantess used a finger to gently push Alex closer to her mature pussy, and with that, she flight away to middle town of National city. The good thing with a Giant Supergirl was that she easily to find from the sky. Standing in th air, Astra used her super-ear and could say that Kara was actually having fun to talk about herself to the medias. And though that one of the journalist was asking her about some rumors that Supergirl was seen last night doing some sexual things with Lena Luthor, she denied it. Kara only added that many men have now more fantaisies about Supergirl since she became a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra then got her attention to Alex who was moving enought to bother the giantess a little. \" Oh come on don't get out from your special place.\" Once again, Astra pushed Alex deeper into her vagina, until she was totally stuck inside with no possibility to move anymore. Astra then saw her niece leaving the journalists to have a personnal talk with Cat Gran who was standing in her balcony facing the giant face of Supergirl. Astra decided it was the good moment for a conversation and landed on the balcony, to both Cat and Kara's surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Aunt Astra ? What are you doing here ? \" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" that's a good question, i don't remember you were invited in MY balcony. But i guess i can allow that for this time \" Cat said, with a change of mind thinking it was not a good idea to mess with the aunt kryptonian of a giant supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I came to help you with your size, but first, did you have your fun with Lena Luthor ? \" Astra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my...So the rumors were true ? Supergirl don't tell me you did that ?! \" Cat was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah i did it \" Kara admitted as she blushed. \" But she wanted me to do it, so there's no regret. She's fine and she's probably at her office right now.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well...anyway i think it might be a good idea anyway to have a normal sized Supergirl before she does something she will regret later ! \" Cat approved at the idea of Astra who suddenly aimed the gun at Kara and fired before she could say anything. A few moment later, Supergirl was flying into the air and landed on the balcony, at her normal size but somehow frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Why did you do that ? It was fun to be a giantess...\" she said with disappointement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not for your sister. Should we talk about your behavior with her recently ? Oh in fact just forget it Kara, Alex is now happy in my panties \" Astra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cat and Kara were shocked at what Astra just said, but not for the same reason. Kara was mad at Astra for taking care about Alex, but Cat just discovered that...<br>\r\n\" Kara ?! Oh gosh i must be dreaming. The giantess Supergirl was my assistant, and she raped Lena Luthor, while her aunt has Kara's sister in her panties...no no no Enought !

''And last but not least'' she grinned before speeding into the room and returning right in front of Kara smiling with her hands cupped ''My apology gift to you'' Astra offered, opening her hands to show a groggy Cat looking slightly out of it ''Astra?'' Kara said with a confused tone ''Oh Kara, everyone in the entire bloody DEO know about your damn crush, if nothing else just take her and talk, if anything else occurs then yay otherwise meh. Now if you excuse me I have another crush that I want to see if it will blossom into something beautiful or if I've just found the only love toy a Kryptonian can use repeatedly on this planet'' Astra grins and spreads her arms like she's revealing a prize, dropping the half conscious blond, only safe because of Kara's swift reflexes ''Damn it Astra'' Kara growled, holding Cat close to her chest, but unlike Lena she kept her outside her suit ''See already closer than ever before, see you later little one call me if Lena wants another go and I can shrink her down too'' Astra winked as she flew off, most likely the apartment the DEO had set up for her (not that she was actually there often with the globetrotting she had to do catching former associates)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara sighed as she flopped onto Cat's couch, setting the older blond on her lap over her skirt. She sat there for a few minutes before realising there were some things that just worked better when she was 'normal' so she gently lay Cat on the sofa before speeding off and returning in her 'Danvers' clothes. Now for the hard part, waiting for Cat, she wasn't too worried about Alex, sure even the thought of her becoming essentially a sex toy sent chills down her spine, Kara knew exactly what Hank, Lucy and Susan (Vasquez) knew: Alex had a Krypton sized crush on the white streaked alien, and Kara really hoped the relationship 'blossomed' not just because it was the only way she'd ever see her sister again, or because the girl NEEDED to get laid, but because she deserved to be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's thoughts were interrupted by a pained groan to the side of her, Cat was finally back with her <b>''Good afternoon Miss Grant'' </b>Kara greeted as she normally did, hoping to start things off on the right foot ''That's not going to work Kara, the things a shrink ray not a memory eraser'' Cat replied as she sat up then slipped into a seated yoga position <b>''Right. First of all I didn't rape Lena, she consented to everything and was the instigator to half of it''</b> Kara quickly responded, wanting to clear the air before moving on to anything else ''I know Kara, it was a slip of the tongue and I know you, so know you'd never do such a thing'' Cat apologised which surprised Kara ''Now what was your aunt talking about Supergirl?'' she asked, watching the girl of steel freeze like a lost lamb amusing her and giving her some of her usual stability back ''<b>Well you see, the thing is...</b>'' Kara was now mumbling and muttering gibberish ''This is about the little crush you have on me isn't it?'' Cat asked, the expression of shock and fear her (former) assistant had telling her everything she needed to know, as well as tell Cat this was going to be a long night, making the blond wonder if she could get a <b><i>Lena</i></b> if she played her cards right for her formerly lovesick friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Meanwhile</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara had been wrong about one thing, Astra didn't head to her apartment, she headed to Alex's. Upon entering the residence she quickly stripped off her suit/uniform leaving herself in silky black underwear as she sat on Alex's sofa, though it would be a nice end result, she thought actually doing this in Alex's bedroom would put to much pressure on the girl. <b>''Are you okay down there Brave One'' </b>she called, frowning when there was no response of any kind, no attempt at speech, nor the expected struggling and squirming she'd hoped for. A shiver of fear passed through her, quickly she pushed down her panties and slid her long fingers inside herself until they found her shrunken human, glad as she slowly tugged her out her human wriggled in a way that showed she was still alive an conscious, most likely she'd been giving Astra the silent treatment. It was only when she had pulled Alex partly outside her that she realised the girl was struggling to be released from her light grip which confused her <b>''Hello Brave One, not feeling like talking to me?</b>'' Astra asked ''No, I'd just gotten comfortable down there'' Alex complained and Astra had to stop herself laughing, though she was amused by how even when 5-6 inches tall, with her topless upper half sticking out of her vagina, and lying on the used panties of said Kryptonian she still had the same attitude as if she'd been told to shove over in the bed, but she supposed that was what made her enjoy Alex, she never backed down and was much cuter now she'd stopped blushing like child. <b>''Comfortable eh?</b>'' ''Yeah, nice, soft and warm, I had to lose my top but I'm sure it's in there somewhere'' Alex grinned up and Astra raised an eyebrow <b>''Well I guess you'll get it back the next time we come'' </b>Astra replied, ideas already running through her head ''Nah, I think I'll sleep'' Alex said trying to slide back in to the Kryptonian's surprise, though she was able to stop her easily with 2 fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smirked at the effect she was having on the giantess, eyes glazing over with a primal lust, despite what the others thought she wasn't oblivious to her attraction to the former eco-terrorist Kryptonian, and she was enjoying the side benefit to getting shrunk by her, free trip to paradise. She had no reason to move from her lovely new abode, particualty as it was warm, soft, and the Kryptonian had great taste in underwear, so if Astra wanted anything she'd need to use that magical Kryptonian strength to get it herself, which the agent was looking forward to rather giddily. She was actually surprised by how much she was enjoying teasing her giantess potential future lover, damn alien pheromones sure helped with inhibitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where to now?</span></div></div>",

Kara then decided to remove her shoes, and lays on the couch, placing her captive on her belly. \" Hope you don't mind i make myself comfortable on your couch.\" she joked while she took her cell phone from her pocket and starte to type something on it. Cat remained silent, waiting for the next part of whatever Kara had in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh i'm sending a message to someone, so meanwhile, you can walk to my body or something...i don't know, just find something to do, ok ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens ?</span></div></div>",

There we go, she should be here in a little while'' Kara said, mostly to herself but also to Cat, noticing as she looked away from the phone the blond hadn't really moved from her stomach, instead deciding to lay on it, her half lidded expression telling Kara the woman needed the break with or without the crazy that had occurred, leading her to just gentling run her long fingers along what was once the most intimidating person in her life. As Cat reached a state of near unconsciousness she was intruded much  less than expected when she felt her assistant's fingers on her, Kara actually being much gentler than she's expected thought it might have something to do with Astra setting the device to larger so she was about the size of a small kitten rather than a toy (like Alex had been) so Kara actually had something to pet and rub, sending waves of pleasure and contentment through her tired body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither knew how long they remained in this position, Kara on her back gently rubbing most of Cat Grant's small previously tense body, until their solitude was interrupted ''Oh this is so cute'' Kara's head turned at a speed that may have snapped a human's neck, eyes focused on Lena Luthor smiling at the scene she'd just walked into ''Hey Lena, have a seat'' Kara offers, moving her feet so as to give the CEO a space for herself, as well as placing her hand directly below Cat before moving herself to a seated position. Lena sits and turns to Kara &amp; Cat, smirking the entire time ''So I presume the fact Cat's kitten sized and you're not 100ft tall are intrinsically connected?'' Lena asked, well more presumed, her smirk only growing when she sees the 2 blonde's shocked expressions ''How? You knew? When?'' Kara asked, well sort of in a messed up way, Lena laughed and placed her hand on Kara's knee ''Oh sweetie, I've known since your 2nd... well I suppose 4th if you count when I met you as Supergirl the 2 times you saved me, time we met. It's that energy you have and those big blue eyes, I don't know how nobody else noticed'' ''I did'' Cat piped in, causing Kara to smile and roll her eyes ''So you always knew...'' ''That the girl that was becoming my friend, was also saving people in a blue suit and a cape? Yeah practically always darling'' Lena answered with a smile ''Also, human is blue, Kryptonian is green'' she said smiling wider when Kara's eyes widened in shock and understanding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You might want to be careful little Luthor, Kara's crazy aunt shrunk me when she outed Kara to me, imagine what she'd do if she finds out you've always known'' Cat warns, even at the size she is Lena nodded in understanding rather than wave it off ''Well if I do get shrunk, do we get a repeat Supergirl?'' she winks and Kara feels her heart melt ''Oh definitely'' Kara answers almost instantly ''Kara are you cheating on me already?'' Cat asks in a mock hurt voice if it wasn't aimed at her Kara would probably be glad she was still relaxed enough to joke with the her and Lena ''No, no, plus we aren't actually anything so it wouldn't be cheating'' Kara answered, blushing heavily. ''Nothing is happening as you haven't said anything, besides the way things are going I see no other way things are goin..'' <b>''No!'' </b>Kara yelled, tossing her glasses across the room as she lifts the older blond up to her face <b>''That is not the way it's supposed to go, I don't want you to just give in because you think you don't have a choice, I want to be loved like everyone else</b>, if you don't feel it then just tell me. Besides if you meekly nuzzled by breasts, you wouldn't be the person I want'' Kara first yelled then argued, finally surprising both the humans in the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you mean?'' Lena asked, tilting her head in confusion while Cat nodded in agreement ''I don't know if either of you have noticed but I definitely have a type'' Kara answered with a slight blush ''Really? Because if we're going on myself and little Luthor it's nothing to do with: age, hair colour, accent, eye colour, nationality, occupation or personality. All I got is humanity and boobs'' Cat argues her confusion ''True, but I do have a type: strong willed, assertive, beautiful women. Also while exact age isn't a factor I do seem to prefer older women, you're around Kal's age, and Lena is at the most 8 years older than me'' Kara explains while both humans blink owlishly as they process the information. Lena was the first to snap out of it and smiled widely ''Then I suppose you'll be happy about this'' she grins before surging forward and kissing the blond Kryptonian, glad to get the younger reporter to react and kiss back, though pulled back when they noticed the <i>meep</i> that when they pulled apart realised (the brunette now blushing as strongly as the 2 blondes) they were crushing Cat between their breasts as they were kissing ''Sorry miss Grant'' Kara and Lena apologised, the older blond rolled her eyes and sighed ''Really Keira, have absolute control over me and little Luthor still gets that first kiss, damn it Kei... <i>woah</i>'' Cat complains, up until Kara tosses her into her mouth and swirl the media mogul around like a lozenge, moaning loudly. After about a minute Kara spits her out, Cat standing up in her hand as she wipes her face of the alien saliva, as well as trying to squeeze some out of her clothes ''Happy now Cat?'' Kara asks with a quirky grin ''Actually yes'' Cat answers, curling her finger to draw Kara's head down level with her, and kissing her upper lip, grinning as much as Lena was as Kara's face turned almost the same shade as Red Kryptonite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think we broke her Cat'' Lena joked as she gently removed the shrunken blond from Kara's hand which now flopped limply onto her lap ''Well I guess not even Supergirl can handle her ultimate fantasy'' Cat chuckled as Kara blinks back into reality ''So ... you both... really?'' Kara asked, her eyes sparkling with some kind of hopeful joy ''Yep, you're just too cute for people like me and kitten here to resist'' Lena answered with a smile, Cat nodding in happy agreement. Kara smiles brightly (Lena and Cat being reminded of her other nickname being Sunny Danvers) before bouncing over to them and pulling them into a hug, once more crushing Cat between hers and Lena's boobs, before kissing both of them (Lena on the lips, Cat on her entire head) while her grin just doesn't fade. ''So? Should I call Astra for the shrink gun, or should we just have some fun by ourselves?'' Kara asked, her joy giving her an extra surge of confidence and the thoughts of seeing the level she could reach with the 2 of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I think this is how my shipper heart works on it's arguments between supporting SuperCat and SuperCorp. With Cat gone from the show I can't use that, so this is it trying to make both sides happy]<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) A very happy Astra shows up with the shrink ray for Lena, Kara finding out her good mood is because she soul bonded! (A Kryptonian thing) [Guess Kara will get to see Alex in the future]<br>\r\n2) J'onn comes looking for Kara now she's normal size, prompting Kara and Lena to hide 'tiny cat' so he doesn't know about their 'extra uses' of the shrink ray</span></div></div>",

When she was put on the ground the brunette turned to Kara and pulled her into a similar hug ''Kara!'' she hissed in her ear ''Aunt Astra, you're really giddy, you've not been whammied by something have you?'' Kara asked, a little worried about the shift in personality her aunt had gone through ''Oh I'm fine darling, just happy for myself and Alexandra's bonding. She's tired out but I'm just to giddy to join my Brave One'' Astra answered with a slight giggle ''Um that's nice auntie'' Kara replied running her hand through her hair in embarrassment, before Astra drew back her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Kara, I glowed'' Astra cheered, Kara gasped before pulling the older Kryptonian into another hug ''Astra that's great I'm so...'' Kara begins to congratulate her, but quickly turns pale and begins to gag (something neither human knew she was able to do). ''Um why did Kara go from happy to nearly throwing up so quickly? Should we be worried?'' Cat asked from Lena's shoulder, visibly worried ''She'll be fine, she just remembered what is required for Kryptonians to recognise their soulmates, as well as her mind imagining her aunt and adopted sister doing what was required, especially given the size difference between the two'' Astra explained before walking over to a still pale Kara, rubbing her back gently and soothingly ''And how exactly do they find out?'' Cat asks, her curiosity getting the better of her ''Oh if they have sex and glow they're soulmates, if there's no glow then hopefully it was a good lay as it means little'' Astra explained smiling now Kara had finally regaining her colour ''Oh'' Lena said sadly, thinking she didn't have a chance, before getting her head tilted in Kara's direction ''Hey, while a wonderful time, but you were on the outside or at the edge of me, nowhere deep enough to even check if we were soul mates, not that it would matter if we weren't, I still love you guys'' Kara comforted, causing Lena and Cat to smile at the sincerity in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So Little One, you wanted me here now what?'' Astra asked at the point she believed the moment had passed ''Oh right, I was wondering if I could borrow the shrink gun, partly for use now, but also because Lena wants to examine it at the later stage'' ''I presume to make more of them?'' Astra asked/assumed ''Only if it's possible, I assume it has a kryptonite core to be able to effect Kara'' Lena answered to which Astra surprisingly nodded ''Most likely, there's a lead lined section connected to the power source, most likely containing Purple Kryptonite as it's the only one I'm aware of that has size altering capabilities'' Astra guessed with a shrug ''That's great, can so can we use it?''

The CEO had removed the device from under her desk the moment the giant Kryptonian appear with her playthings so after getting the giantess' attention with a whistle and a yell of ''Supergirl, back here'' she tosses the flashing red ball which detonates about a foot from the Supergirl, but rather than doing damage releases a small cloud of fine red mist, which enters Kara's body with her next inhale. Alex worries (and clings for her life) as Kara coughs and splutters for a few seconds before clearing her throat ''What the Hell did you do Luthor?'' she growled, Lena raising an eyebrow at her outburst ''Firstly I have a first name, second it was just a little something to make her more <u><i><b>fun</b></i></u>'' Alex didn't like the way the woman ended that sentence and that feeling worsened when she was lifted by 2 of Kara's fingers and raised above the blonde's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt fear looking into the now crimson orbs that stared up at her with hunger ''Ka.. Supergirl don't do this, I'm your sister'' Kara tilts her head cutely before answering <b>''I was an only child for 13 years, I've found another use for you''</b> she whispers before opening her mouth wide and allowing the brunette to fall screaming into her mouth, Kara swirled the DEO agent around in her mouth, the human's taste getting her even hotter than the red kryptonite already had, she wished she'd known about this sooner maybe her and Astra could've had a truce over tinys. A shiver shot down Lena's spine as she watched Supergirl casually play with the younger woman in her mouth like a boiled sweet, only the occasional yelling of ''Supergirl'' and 'Kara' telling her Alex hadn't died from those strong teeth of hers or swallowed up by the hungry giantess, though she did manage to be distracted when the now very horny Supergirl started to fondle herself right in front of her, the bounce of orbs much larger than her entire body capturing the woman's attention right until the dropped onto her roof, leaving cracks and everything and she was forced to look up at Supergirl's face: which was currently pursed lipped almost directly above her. Lena watched open mouthed as Alex tumbled from her lips with a wet plop, the brunette's heavy breathing good enough proof she was mostly fine. The distraction of Alex meant Lena was looking down up until the shrill whistle coming from the enormous superhero <b>''Time for your turn Lena, have fun''</b> Kara smiled almost drunkenly before tilting her head down and wrapping her lips around the woman in question, Lena oddly enough loosing her shoes as they were slipped off before they passed Kara's plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with Alex Kara bounced Lena around her mouth enjoying the human's unique but equally arousing but also pressed her against her teeth so that she could properly explore the woman's breasts and already dripping vagina with the tip of her tongue. Kara grinned closed mouthed as she heard Lena's loud moans before finally letting her slip out similarly to Alex, in fact almost on top of her. Lena giggles and nuzzles against Alex, the agents weak struggles ignored as she kissed her neck, the giant Kryptonian's pheromones really screwing with her head (and libido) where as Alex grew up with Kara so was at least able to ignore most of the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''Ah are you ignoring me?''</b> Kara cooed causing Lena to break away from practically straddling Alex to staring up at the alien's grinning face, Alex sure the lack of a cleavage window the only reason her hormone nuked mind was able to look away from Kara's humungous rack. ''No darling, she was just not joining in, I went to the trouble of making you be fun and she isn't helping at all'' Lena pouted and both Kara and Alex wondered if Lena had also been affected by the Red K like Kara had. <b>''Well we can't have that now can we, what to do with my lovely playthings?'' </b>Kara put her finger to her lips in a thinking position, causing Alex to worry and Lena to giggle and start to tear at her blouse, exposing her large (to scale, they were obviously tiny compared to Kara's) breasts and near snow white flesh, Alex biting her lip at the cleavage of a woman she didn't think of as a sister (though she was beginning to question those feelings) and wishing Lena had rubbed those into her face instead of just nipping at her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

Since Lillian was taken in and her crimes were revealed it lead to a lot of outrage from the human and alien community almost to the level when Lex was first arrested, which in turn lead to an increase to the number of death threats that came into Lena's inbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the motive for the newest upgrade to her security systems, using her repaired and upgraded alien detector as the basis for the trigger as they were the ones most likely to be able to reach her going <i><u>through</u></i> her normal security (the gun under her desk was a precaution for human intruders). Currently she just needs to work on a quicker way to activate and deactivate the system, as Supergirl did make it a habit of showing up unannounced to chat... yep definitely need an ON/OFF button for her null beam rather than 5 minutes of typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ms Luthor, Kara Danvers has just come in to see you'' Jess's voice came from her intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thank you Jess, send her up'' Lena replied, the woman smiling at the thought of the lovely puppy that was her girlfriend showing up for lunch as she often did. Despite being called up the junior reporter still gently knocked on the door rather than walking right in, something which amused the CEO to no end ''Come in Kara, it's open''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open and the usual cheerful Kara Danvers shows up with a bag that is most likely lunch, Lena's stomach taking this moment to remind her she forgot to eat gain today. Smiling she thought this might actually be a good day for a change... oh how wrong she can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problems being from the time it takes the sensors to register a non human, currently a minute and a half which was enough for Kara to walk in and put down the food bag before alarms blared and the orb on Lena's desk glowed brightly,then shooting a dark purple coloured beam straight at the blond woman causing her to collapse, Lena rushing over to her just as the secondary effect of the beam took effect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ow'' Kara groaned, staring up at the ceiling wondering what the hell had happened, as well as how to broach the subject with Lena. Deciding she had no point in waiting and possibly worrying the raven haired woman more than she already had she sat up and yelped in surprise. She was still on the floor and Lena was sitting beside her as she recovered as was expected... it's just her being 3 inches tall with a now enormous Lena sitting cross-legged that was surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hello Supergirl'' Lena greeted, Kara noting she sounded...</span></div></div>",

It is supposed to work only on aliens, so when the beam came out i thought the system didn't work, but it did when i realized by opening your shrit with my nails that you were Supergirl. \" Lena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Lena i wanted to tell you...so many times...but...\" the tiny blonde started while getting on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" But i'm more a Luthor than a friend to your eyes. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That's not true, listen i....\" Kara started while trying to fly but she stopped when she noticed something wrong with her powers. \"Lena what did you do to me ?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let's say the beam might have contained some kryptonite in it. I made sure there's not enought to hurt you, but i suppose it worked in better way than i could expect.\" Lena replied, thought that she not truly happy about how things turned. Kara/Supergirl never meant to be her target. Kara decided to approach her giant friend sitting on the crouch they usually both were for the Lunch time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok Lena you wanna talk, i'm ok with that, but i wanna be by your side like i always do, not by your feet ! \" Kara yelled to Lena's surprise. She expected Kara to be more worried about their size difference, and about what Lena could do to her. But she was enought brave to not care about a such a detail. In Lena's mind, that was the thing..let's forget about these size detail for now and let's fight like two normal sized friends !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Guess what? I'm really hungry right now. Let's see what did you bring to me for Lunch ! \" Lena then uncrossed her leg to get back on her feet and walked toward the lunch bag a few steps behinds Kara, which didn't shrink. But of course in her way Lena made sure to land one foot on the ground with violence near Kara, who, for the first time of her life really felt some fear. It was quick, but she really thought she was going to become a red stain on lena's ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant brunette totally ignored Kara as she bent down to pick up the bag and check inside. \" Oooh my favorite noodles ! thanks Kara. \" She said before leading to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" LENAAAAA ! STOP IGNORING ME !! \" Kara yelled, while Lena took a seat and started to eat.  \" Sorry i can't hear you. You should come here. Oh this is so declicious \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny blonde knew exactly what Lena was doing. She was kindda playing with her to make her pay or something for having not telling her the truth...And with no power, Kara had no choice but to make all the distance from the crouch to the desk, and from her perspective this was a challenge !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Damn you Lena ! \" she thought.</span></div></div>",

She was just glad that while Lena was eating she wasn't making any exaggerated moans and slurps to tease her on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smirked as she watched the little blond scurry across her office, slurping her noodles and letting her mind wander, the device will have removed her active abilities such as her flight, strength, heat vision and freeze breath, but should have no effect on her passives such as her super senses and hopefully her patented invulnerability, as it wouldn't be any fun to have a tiny Kara and not get to play with her, though she had hoped her first victim not be Supergirl as she'd have liked to feel whoever the idiot was smash under her heels... ah well maybe some day in the future now what else is there to eat, oh Pot stickers! Kara definitely brought this here. Lena knew she shouldn't, even at her tiny size Kara would probably fight her for eating her precious pot stickers, but at her current size she wouldn't miss one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara panted as she nearly collapsed on the ground, damn this office was too freaking big. She was almost there but she wasn't sure she could move any further, looking up she saw disappointedly she could still see Lena over the desk meaning she was further than she thought she was, as she tilted her head and pouted.

Her little screams were muffled by the soft skin of Lena's gigantic sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You know, i also had my little secret. I wanted to get you beneath my foot sooo badly. \" The woman took another bite,  closed her eyes while chewing it, and rolling Kara underfoot on the same time. Lena was definetely in heaven.

Kara called up angrily, Lena in response wrinkled her nose and sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kara must you be so dramatic, your food is just there' she said pointing to a small pile of noodles and pot stickers, Kara' eyes widened and her mouth started to water, even with her super apatite at her size it was a veritable feast 'All you have to do is one little thing' her mouth slammed shut and she sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just a foot rub, I'm sure <i><b>Supergirl</b></i> could accomplish that much' Lena teased, her toes wriggling in anticipation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And what if I refuse?'

Did you know pacing greatly assists with memory retrieval?' Lena asks seriously watching Kara's face pale almost ghostly white before she laughs ''I'm kidding Kara relax. Regardless of what happens you'll still be fed and watered, it's just how you do with my feet that determines where you'll be staying until I head home. Do a good job and you'll be comfortably nestled in my cleavage, they may not be as large as yours but at your current size they could swallow you whole.'' Lena grinned as Kara blushed ''However, if you don't try hard enough and do a bad job you'll spend the next few hours either under or in my ass. Actually I've thought this through if you do outright refuse then after food you'll be put back on the floor as a little foot toy for me to play with... well unless you want to help Jess with some distressing God head her she needs it''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So do I get to eat first or what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Massage first, eat second'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara sighed but got to work, pressing hard at certain parts of the human's foot as she began her massage, she used her entire body against the pale flesh and even licked, kissed and pressed her body against it to enhance the experience between them all. The bad side (if you want to call it that) is that despite the fact Lena began to get back to her work, her toes still had their full attention on Kara. She squeaked the first time they squeezed a breast or fondled her ass, and Kara could tell by the curl of her lips she was enjoying the chance to feel her up. After about half an hour an exhausted Kara, covered in both her own and Lena's sweat dropped against Lena's heels, her task finally complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ahh there you are' Lena said picking the tired and hungry girl up 'Well did in' she dropped Kara just shy of the pile on her desk, the blond running and practically jumped into the food<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So how did I do?'

Lena yells, twirling her chair in an attempt to dismiss the Kryptonian even though she knows it was pointless, Supergirl having already flitted to stand in front of her before her chair stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is your life we're talking about. With Lex and Lilian out there you're in even more danger than ever' Kara argued, having just saved the woman from what felt like attempted assassination #340. All her friend had to do was agree to temporary protective custody, she could even bring her work with her and run L Corp from her laptop she just needed to be somewhere safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes and the problem with them is the same reason I'm still her. Luthors don't back down, we don't give up and we don't show weakness' Kara could see the determination in Lena's eyes and was this close to tearing her hair out. She hadn't wanted to do this but if it kept Lena safe then fuck it, she just hoped the woman could find it in her heart to forgive her one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry Lena' she whispered, her heart breaking when she see's the raven haired woman visibly relax thinking she had given up and taking that moment to strike. A blitz of super speed meant the needle had entered her neck and emptied before Lena could even blink, biting her lip as she hears the human whimper before she passed out cold due to one of the more immediate side effects of the serum she'd been injected with. Kara moved Lena's body to a more comfortable position for the serum to run it's course before only then deeming her safe for transport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena awoke to pitch blackness and loud yelling, something that wasn't helped by the throbbing headache she was currently forced to endure. It took a few minutes for her mind to flow correctly again and with it came rage ''That bitch drugged me'' she thought, eyes scanning the room wondering where she was and what the alien hero had in store for her, as well as planning exactly what she was going to say to the girl about taking no for an answer and how kidnapping is wrong. With that out of the way she was able to focus on the voices outside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''...<b>it's just a temporary measure, the DEO will find Lillian and Lex and then everything will go back to normal''</b>  that was definitely Supergirl, Lena wishing she could punch the woman without her own hand being the only thing that breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''It was still a really bad plan and extremely dangerous for both of you...''</b> that was the agent, Kara's sister... Alex Lena wanted to say was the name but the migraines were making her a little unsure <b>''Not just in what you just did to her but in the fact you're going to end up spilling all your secrets Kara, your plan most likely involves her being around you practically all the time, she's going to figure things out the woman isn't stupid''</b><i>........................ well shit</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kara is Supergirl' Lena mutters to herself, something which didn't help at all with her nerves or the falling sensation in her gut at the revelation, as well as the barrage of moments which should have tipped her off, moments she ignored because Kara was a ray of sunshine in her shitty life and she didn't WANT to think about it. FUCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sigh, let's get this over with'' was Alex's annoyed response before the wall of Lena's side open and she practically jumped as she pressed herself against the wall at the huge faces of both Alex and Sup....Kara Danvers, the blond previously looking relieved quickly turned to concerned, while the brunette still looking pretty impassive about the entire thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Y-y-y-you shrunk me'' Lena squeaked out, and while she would deny it if it ever came up in the future she whimpered and flinched as Supergirl's <i>'could crush her like a  bug even before all this'</i> hands wrapped themselves around her form and pulled her out of the box, holding her just shy of cradling her to her chest and gently stroking her head with her forefinger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There, there Lena, everything's going to be fine, I'll keep you safe' Kara whispered and despite herself Lena couldn't help but believe her and slightly relax, this was Kara, the little puppy of the woman that was her only friend in the world other than Supergirl... which after this new information made her, her only friend period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hm I know Kara'' she mumbled as she wrapped her arms around the hero's thumb missing the look of shock on the blond's face before she tried to convey 'I didn't say anything' to her sister without using those words, seeing as the DEO agent knew she'd been dying to tell Lena everything, not wanting secrets between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just sighed<b> 'No, but I did, I just called you Kara a minute ago, and these...'</b> she pats the side of the box Lena had been kept in <b>'...they're not soundproof. So yeah Lena knows now, I hope you're happy</b>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'A little, yeah' </b>Kara admits before turning her attention back to Lena who was looking up at her past her chest <b>'So, I know I sprung this on you but this was the best way to keep you safe. Plan A was simply to put you into protective custody, but in all honesty that wouldn't work especially when we aren't sure we got all the moles. So instead with the power of some rather impressive alien tech I was able to shrink you down and this way almost nobody knows where you are and I can keep you safe'</b> Kara grins her megawatt smile at her explanation, Lena finding herself literally unable to not mirror the expression, even if just for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what now then Kara?' Lena asks, Kara yaying in her mind at how easily Lena seemed to be going along with this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since Alex left her appartement, she felt alone, the atmostphere was not the same. This was going to change now, thought that Kara's first priority was Lena's protection, but there's no way she could be in danger at home with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Right...then put her back inside \" Alex openned the box Lena has been kept, a suggestion from the Danver's sister which didn't seem to be appreciated by the miniaturized female Luthor considering her expression. Alex noticed that and couldn't help but smirked when suddenly Kara offered another option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"actuaaaally...\" she started. \"...since Lena knows about my identity, i'll change my clothes back and go back home as Kara not as Supergirl holding a box. It might be too suspicious if i get spotted by anyone even when i'm flying. And i'm not sure this is good thing for someone so small to fly right now. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm used to fly you know..by plane at least \" Lena added, not because she wanted to be once again in that box, but mostly because she doesn't like to be seen as \"weak\" or \"fragile\", thought that it can't be more true by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo you think it will be less suspicious for you to walk throught national city streets with a woman in your hand ?\" Alex sounded sarcastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I have pockets in my jean you know ? \" Kara answered with the same tone, the Danvers used to have gentle fight like this everyday, which didn't surprise Lena, after all Kara told her about her sister...it made sense to her they had a strong bond. But the situation was totally weird for her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....but this is not what i was thinking about. Can you hold her for a min ? I need to tell Jon that i'll be off for a while to take care of Lena then we'll leave. \"  Lena started to feel worry to be left alone with Alex even for a moment, and was about to say something when she was quickly placed in her palm as Kara disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were an embarrassing silent moment between Lena and Alex, as the Danvers was pretending to look somewhere else, as if she was interested by the color of the walls or something. Lena realized they were not in her office anymore. Of course, she didn't know how much time has past since she was \"kidnapped\". She decided to use this to break the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where are we ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh...guess it's secret times today for you. I'm not supposed to tell you, but since i made you unintentionnaly discover my sister's secret, i think she would have tell you anyway. This is the DEO headquarters.\" Alex said still not looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I think i've heard some rumors about it...a secret governemental organization.\" Lena added most to herself. \" You don't like me don't you ? \" she suddenly asked, this time having Alex turning her head to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It doesn't matter what i think about you. I trust Kara. Just don't disappoint her and everything will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Is that...a threat ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex raised her hand close to her face, making the little woman having a step back in her palm. She almost regretted her words as the giantess had a serious look on her face. Alex openned her mouth, about to say something when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" All right it's time to go ! Jon doesn't approve my choice, just like you but i can insure you guys, that it was the...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It' ok Kara i get it. Take her\" Alex interrupted Kara, almost happy to giver her back the tiny Luthor, as well as Lena herself to be in the hand of Kara Danvers this time and not Supergirl. She still had to get used to the revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok so Lena, i think i know where to keep you safe....\"</span></div></div>",

What she couldn't see was the massive smirk Alex was currently sporting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Safety smafety, you just wanted to have your...'' Alex was silenced by Kara's hand covering her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You already told Lena one of my secrets, which I don't mind because I've wanted to tell her for months, but if you tell her that one, I will go through with my threat to throw you into space' Kara whispered, Alex gulped as she could see the kryptonian's eyes glow behind her glasses and nodded. Instantly Kara was back to her happy-go-lucky persona 'So ready to go Lena?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena shrugged from Kara's plan, it wasn't like she had any ability to stop her if she tried, plus she wasn't going to miss the chance to touch Kara's succulent chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great then let's get started' Kara chirped, smiling as she pulled open her shirt revealing her pale breasts as well as the blue bra that was currently holding them back like it's life depended on it 'Opps, right it may be a little tight in there, I had a slight growth spurt the other week and haven't had the time with CatCo and my 'other job' to get new ones' she said with a blush, while Alex sniggered in amusement from a safe distance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They're magnificent' Lena whispers then yelps as Kara drops her onto her right breast, the shrunken human surprised that despite the bulletproof comment it felt just as soft and bouncy as normal titflesh, not that she had anywhere near this amount on hand before, Sinclair only had B cups when they'd dated. She was pulled from those thoughts when Kara separated her mounds with 2 fingers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well what are you waiting for, get in' Kara motioned with her head to her cleavage and Lena not seeing any reason not to slid her way into the crevice which sealed itself up to her neck when Kara's fingers withdrew. Kara had been right, it was a tight squeeze, luckily due to the bouncyiness of her alien breasts it was less like being crushed between two wrecking balls or possibly moons, and more like being submerged in jelly. Trying to find a small bit of comfort Lena leaned her head sideways so it rested on her left breast and through it her heartbeat, the genius noting it was quite a bit faster than she'd expected but chalked it down to an alien trait.(It wasn't)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So what now Supercrush? Ow' Alex asked when winced when Kara pinched her side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shut up, Lena can hear you' she hissed, causing her sister to laugh and confuse her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kara there's enough insulation I wouldn't be able to hear me, plus i'm sure she's conked out again any minute now so we'll be fine''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay but if Lena finds out about it from you...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah kick into space I know'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Actually I had a much better idea: I shrink you down, tape up that big mouth of yours, cover you in latex and give you to Lucy saying I got her a fancy alien sextoy for April Fool's day' Kara grinned as Alex paled significantly ''That's right unless you want to experience your first girl crush on an intimate level I suggest you keep it zipped' she said lightly tapping her sister on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara left with a metaphorical spring in her step, she had her crush nestled gently between her breasts and she was going to have plenty of opportunities to try get them together as well as experience the size difference in a lot of fun ways. The only thing bugging her was the distance: sure the DEO was 5 minutes walk from Alex's apartment but it was over 35 minutes from Kara's and she can't fly there as it would negate the point of changing out of her suit. Sigh, she would just have to put up with it, but her suit called to her from her bag... maybe she could quickly change and fly home, Lena would be safer quicker... but sh was safer with Kara Danvers than she was Supergirl.

Kara turns to the sound and found a white haired, rather busty woman with snow white, flawless skin, with the exception of some kind of bony thing that formed a wadjet on her left eye twirling the gun around on her finger like she was Ocelot. The other hand smoothing non existent wrinkles in her tasteful (aka not sloooty) shoulder less dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sakura!' Kara cheered and bounced at her in a hug (accidentally crushing Lena between both of their chests for a few seconds) before hoping off in slight confusion 'why are you here, not that I'm not happy to see you or Serpentime but last time you appeared long enough to steal this little cutie Serpentime entrusted me with and vanish'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed and pointed her long fingers at the boys 'These idiots are world hopping without any care as to the destruction they could cause'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like the scaly bastard does' the multi-coloured haired boy mutters, but both females heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Also mick, this' she held up the gun and crushed it in her hand 'the dwarf star is the ammo block, the rest is almost an ordinary gun, sure there were enchantments to reduce recoil and a couple of other things, but other than that an ordinary revolver and now a chunk of scrap metal'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'By the way where did he get this crazy stuff?' Kara asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Bloodrayne' Sakura answered and Kara's eyes lit up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh can you check on my order for kryptonite inhibitors, the DEO are being idiots again and the old ones haven't even been repaired yet. Plus do you think Snaky can alter the design I'd like it to protect more than just my tits'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura raised the eyebrow of her uncovered eye ''It covers your crest'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Which is on top of my tits''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow sighs ''I'll see what I can do. Now boys time to go home, Primus specifically said no DC, go annoy the guardians or SHIELD if you need to fuck with people''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutli haired boy steps forward 'And if we don't want to?' he says bravely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even blinking Sakura pulled out a scythe and sliced his head off, the boy/gem's body poofing revealing a yellow coloured mineral (Grievous orb) which she placed in a small jewellery box and slipped into a pocket on her dress 'Anyone else have a problem?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For once I don't have a plan for this, do you?' Mickey asked his friend who shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm an arsonist who became a firebender thanks to a crazy bitch, I'm crazy not suicidal (except for calling her a crazy bitch out loud). We give up, provided we still get to shove Ren in a dress'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shrugs 'I have no problem with that, but you do know if you don't put him in something tasteful and Tali finds out you better hope you are lightning proof because she follows Snaky's shooting policy of <i>'Face, balls, heart anywhere else' </i>and that's even worse with lightning' she grins at the identical winces both boys have 'Well let's go then' she chirps waving her hand before clenching it in a manner similar to Cisco vibing until the wall seems to part into a black abyss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So is this safe?' Pyro asks being strangely cautious, unfortunately for him he was also sticking his head through the hole so didn't see the kick till it flung him through seven realities which was the end destination of the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You can walk in or be kicked, your decision' she stated, Mickey grumbles but walks through Sakura head slapping him for whatever was said under his breath (Kara wasn't trying to hear them just waiting for them to leave) 'See yah kiddo, I'm sure Kaos will have the inhibitors ready for you and Astra soon enough' she smiled widely before following the idiots through, the gateway closing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara breathed a sigh of relief 'Finally alone at last' she flopped onto her sofa. It was only when she noticed a pinching feeling on her nipple she remembered her passenger and charge, quickly pulling her suit off she found Lena hanging on for dear life with her arms in a vice like grip on the blonde's nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Opps' Kara blushed as she placed her hand under the shrunken human so she could let go without falling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's okay, Kara it sounds like outside your suit was very distracting' Lena said trying very hard not to stare at Kara's <i>'at least twice as large as my entire body' </i>breasts fully exposed and slightly bouncing directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well anyway we're back at my place and you're safe and sound providing we don't get any interdimensional visitors anytime soon (In another universe Mxy sneezes, then gets attacked by the dragon God of Death and Destruction), so what do you want to do now?' Kara grins and once again Lena can't help but mirror it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

She shucked her mini skirt just as quickly and practically floated out of her boots leaving her now just in her tights and panties. Wanting to savour as much time as she could of Lena bouncing around against her vagina Kara slowly wiggled her way out of her tights, getting them stuck on her rear for a moment before complying and falling to the ground before stepping to the shower and setting the temperature for what a human would consider warm so as to not lose herself and track of time in the pleasant heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena on the other hand was confused and a tiny bit annoyed by all the bouncing around Kara was doing as she rather obviously ignored her, the only thing stopping true anger was the fact she knew Kara was playful and was practically incapable (Red kryptonite excluded) of being malicious in any way. Still it didn't mean she didn't want to get out of her crush's pants even if it was to take a breath not clouded by the hormones flowing from her enormous sex, which was practically drooling all over her... not that Lena had any problems with knowing what she did to her blond, it was just as she spat another mouthful out from a large drop that splatted into her face, she preferred a little more control and less helplessness. Which was why she was still trying to find a way out, or at least get Kara to acknowledge and let her out, though her squirming and fumbling had little effect when coupled with Kara's own movements unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was perfect, now for the hard part in Kara's mind: Deciding what to do with Lena. <br>\r\nOn the one hand she could slide the tiny CEO inside her hungry pussy, then retrieve her just before they ate (and if they both came during her shower, yay them), <br>\r\nBut on the other hand that may be a little forward and overly forceful, maybe she could take her out and they could shower together, get her out of those sweat and cum soaked clothes (especially after the thoughts she just had of shoving Lena inside her) and give them both the rinse and relaxation they deserved.

She wouldn't have any problem with the morality if Lena was a criminal woman who would have done many bad things, but she was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes it sucks to be a good girl \" Kara thought, mostly talking about herself, but also about Lena, as she started to remove her tights and panties and put them on the ground. Lena was finally free and reached to craw from the panties to the closest exit, and found herself in front of the giant naked blonded who picked her up in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sorry for that \" Kara apologized in a cute tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Guess you had your fun..it's ok. I just...not used to have things out of control\" Lena admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Relax you'll have your fun too. For now, would you like to take a shower with me ? \"  Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" that would be appreciated ! \" She said thinking about the strong pussy scent surrounding her. She then started to remove her own clothes, in kara's palm while the blonde was looking at her, which made her blush. Once she finally revealed her tiny perfect naked body, Kara tried to resist her own excitement. Lena was so cute...she wanted to do so many things with her right now, but that would not be fair. She put the tiny clothes on the washbowl, and put a step forward to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Lena was shocked by the big water drops falling on her, but she got used to it. Lena then was arroused by seeing the giant blonde with hairs weet falling back, she was so sexy so divine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What ?\" Kara asked by seeing Lena's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you're just...amazing like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait to see me in a better angle !\" Kara added before placing the tiny Lena on the ground between her feet. Lena looked up to see a giant naked Kara full height in an unique view. She was like a true goddess, her hands full of soap spreading it on different parts of her body in a sexy way. Her boobs, her arms, her belly...then she joined her two hands together to spread the soap on one leg descending to her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smirked at Lena then gave her a drop of soap so she could wash herself. Seeing the tiny naked Lena by her feet, Kara only wanted to grab her between her toes and rub this body between them...And that's exactly what she did as she wrapper her between her second and third toes without warning. To Kara's surprise, Lena didn't show any resistance or didn't even try to protest. She actually wanted that, so the giant blonde started to wriggle her toes slowly, really slowly, to hold back her kryptoninan strenght.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena was moved up and down by the two titanic toes of her goddess, the pressure was not too strong, and the feeling was amazing. Lena was definitely aroused and couldn't think clearly right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel ? \" the blonde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" this is..close to heaven \" Lena replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara kept rubbing Lena for some minutes before she released her laid on the back. She was ready for the final part as she brought her little toes to Lena's crotch when....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIIIIIIIIP \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh no not now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that...?\" Lena wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Pizza is ready.

This little fact meant that while she had escaped Kara's underwear she was still trapped on the woman's person, specifically in the tube of fabric that was her left leg tight, sliding down her sweat slicked skin till she stopped inside Supergirl's boot. She was only able to stop at Kara's ankle because the blond was currently standing around putting the pizza in, she knew things would get much worse soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, the moment Kara raised her foot Lena started to slide underneath it, first her arms then her upper body, then her entire shrunken form found itself under Kara's arch.. There was a part of her that was glad she only had to endure what she later called 'unaware stomping' which was really Kara walking around normally just with the added effect of a shrunken Luthor under her heel. The next 'stage' was something she wasn't entirely sure she was happy about, Kara's foot rubbing against her rather than stomping on her, slightly rolling her from one side to the other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually Lena didn't like being on the receiving end of domination but here she was with her dom not even appearing to know she was there, under her foot.

Guess we have something else to bet over seeing as I still don't see any flashbangs'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed 'Fine we play for who gets to choose the shrinkie, happy?' Maggie nods and moves her hands to Alex's hip bones to remove a distraction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lena she really wished she was anywhere else: Maggie's ass was like a mountain of jello, constantly bouncing around as she moved and twisted, even more so when it was clear she was exaggerating her movements for Alex's benefit. Lena did try to get Alex's attention but Maggie's rear muffled the sound and when she tried to yell before she sat down all Lena got was a mouthful of sweaty ass flesh. So now she was trapped under the giant detective, and while there was less severe shaking and movements there was a lot more pressure as she was actually sitting on Lena, plus everything shifted with the high speed turns Alex made, some even spooking Mags enough she clenched around Lena for a few seconds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Some time after</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Boom, I win again' Maggie cheered and bounced around, Alex sipping her beer and smiling behind her hand 'You promised a week'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That I did, first week off I get I'll have Kara jab me with the minimeum enzymes and after the delivery I'll spend the time being your tiny plaything' she grinned as the confirmation just made her girlfriend happier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Brilliant, I need to find a realyl nice pair of underwear, that and an outfit that makes me look divine. You'll be spending a lot of time bowing in worship to my amazing ass Danvers, I expect lots of hugs and kisses' Alex starts it off with a kiss of her own<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't need to shrink me for that, you know you're getting an absolute ravaging tonight' Alex nips down her neck before leaving an actual bite mark on Maggie's shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Alex you spoil me so'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Always'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena was feeling seasick from all the bouncing and shaking, it seemed Maggie spent most of the game with her ass in motion, most likely as a distraction technique which considering the 5 straight victories worked perfectly as well as all the bouncy victory cheering she did. A part of Lena worried she put her life in the hands of a woman that easily distracted by a little tail... thought she also admitted it was a very big 'tail'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Several more drinks later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie swayed as she danced along with Alex, when she felt something wriggling in her ass, giggling she wondered if Alex had tried to get her in the mood by slipping a toy down the back of her pants. Deciding to make the most of it she pulled her panties till it gave her a slight wedge, but it was worth it to feel the tiny vibrator against her asshole. Maggie moaned into Alex's neck before pulling her into another kiss ''I think it's time we head back to your place, eh Danveeers?' she slurred and Alex grinned in response<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''As you wisssh detective' the buzzed one of them agreed as they headed out of the alien bar and into the cold evening<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what next?</span></div></div>",

Knowing that her glass doors meant whoever they were knew she was there she quickly grabbed Kara, the shrunken hero yelping as she practically flew in Cat's hand from the table to her lap, luckily still over her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Come in'' Cat yelled and the person, who now Cat looked up noticed was a brown haired woman with the exception of a white streak in her hair, stepped into her office, then shut the door and stood directly at it, causing the media mogul to raise her eyebrows in confusion ''Hello Ms Grant'' the woman greeted cordially ''I name is Astra In-Ze'' Cat's eyes widened slightly, so this was Kara's 'aunt Astra' the woman looks good for being in a coma till about a month ago, guess she could chalk that up to being Kryptonian ''So you're the mysterious Aunt Astra Kara was blubbering about a few month's back, I presume you're here to see her?'' the blond asked, hoping to think of some way to get the super powered woman out of her office, and preferably the building ''In a manner of speaking, also you didn't need to hide her darling, it means my gift reached it's intended owner'' Cat and Kara's eyes bulged, she was the one who sent the purple kryptonite ''Why?'' Cat asked, though not before placing Kara back on the desk like she asked ''Kara can explain, if you remove the kryptonite from the box you'll find a message, I'd show you myself but the neutralizer only deflects so much'' she said pointing to a device on her shoulder that glowed an eerie green light ''That's why you're standing so far away, I presume?'' Cat asked semi rhetorically as she removed the crystal and dropped Kara into it, the woman known as Supergirl finding a single sentence engraved in kryptonian <i>''This is for your own good''</i> and really wished she could punch the woman for interfering in her life again, why can't the woman stick to scaring her mentally and constantly distracting Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So what does it say?'' Cat asked as she swapped Kara and the purple kryptonite back to their proper places, her hand and the lead lined box respectively, but Kara was annoyed with both of her usually favourite women in her life (minus Alex, damn Kara hoped her and Hank weren't in on it too) so remained silent, meaning Astra had to explain to the confused (and annoyed human) ''What I wrote, in a tongue only Kara could read is that I did this for her own good, this was the most effective way I could fine to get Kara ...''</span></div></div>",

Probably not important though so oh well]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Cat looked at what was actually in the box, the purple kryptonite was carved into a figurine or at least half of it was with one side being completely flat while the other seemed to be some kind of dragon like image. The entire item was aprox 7 inches long and that combined with a small ring of kryptonite behind the head of the 'dragon' gave Cat an idea. Taking the kryptonite in one hand and Kara in the other placing the shrunken former superhero on the flat section before pinning her with her thumb until she could grab a needle and thread from one of her drawers.<br>\r\n''Ms Grant...'' Kara began when the media mogul began to wrap it around her body but was shut up why the older blonde's hiss ''I'd recommend keeping yourself quiet, or else I'll have to use it as a gag too'' Kara wisely shut the hell up as she continued to be secured to the source of her situation, yes the source, as the cause of her situation was keeping her secrets from Cat (luckily she had yet to blab the secret that actually involved the older blond) but she sighed and kept quiet as Cat inspected her work standing the purple item upright and making Kara feel like she'd been tied to a cross.<br>\r\n''Almost perfect'' Cat muttered as she set the piece down and moved from her desk, meaning Kara only had the ceiling as company for several minutes until she returned into view. It was during this lull she actually was glad it had been purple for a moment, as she'd apparently left the painful stage of it's effect on her (a time which if it were green would be followed with death) instead the mineral just felt cold and the threads uncomfortable, Kara now wondering if she could snap it and free herself, after all it was only the thread Cat used to reattach her buttons, and they snapped fairly often not that they didn't go without a fight they were just no match for Cat in her blouse.<br>\r\nShe was snapped out of her thoughts by Cat re-entering her field of vision, wearing a simple silver necklace that hung low enough to just graze her cleavage ''<i>Don't stare at her tits,Don't stare at her tits,Don't stare at her tits,</i>'' Kara thought to herself repeatedly as well as thanking Rao Cat wasn't actually a mind reader or else that other secret would be out as well. ''Well Kara, seeing as you want to stay with me so badly I'll let you do just that, by being the hidden extra to my newest accessory'' she smirked as she unclasped the necklace and threaded it through the hoop in the back of the statue like segment, essentially right behind Kara's head. The woman formerly known as Supergirl knew where she was going, but had no way of preventing it even if she'd wanted to, as Cat once more picked up her necklace and put it back on, Kara finding herself in a new home,  that being Cat Grant's blouse with roommates for the first time, namely Cat's breasts. She still wanted freedom, and hopefully the chance to be normal sized once again, but this wasn't as bad as it could've been ''There,  perfect fit, though the method of securement could be stronger, at least you're not going anywhere Keira'' Cat said with a smirk and despite herself Kara smiled, even shrunken to 6 inches tall and reduced to the centrepiece of a necklace, she was still making Cat Grant happy, she really needed some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo?

Barry sighed before her ran all around the area, about to give up when he saw what appeared to be black smoke, revealing a female figure in a skin tight hooded suit, and when they turned revealed a faceless mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot going to let the meta get away Barry rushed over, yelling ''Hey'' getting their attention before grabbing their arm. The meta tilted their head in confusion before (as far as he can tell) smiling and grabbing his other hand and they were both engulfed in the black smoke. When it cleared the meta kicked Barry away and took a few steps back herself, smoke once more gathering at her feet. Barry tries to run at her, but the smoke had gone beyond her and when he ran into it, he ran right through it and the smoke just continued to increase in size. It was at this point Barry noticed things were off and realised just what this meta's power was, which was confirmed when the smoke revealed a several hundred foot giantess who stepped on him. Now normally Barry would be able to get out of the way with no trouble, but he was still in shock at the face he'd been shrunk to 3 inches tall so couldn't get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>About an hour later</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''Barry!''</b> Barry bolted upright at Caitlin yelling in his ear, glad to see he was still alive but most of his body was still sore, he also noticed he was still tiny that the meta had managed to get away, making him wonder how long he'd been out for ''Yeah?'' he called over the coms ''Barry, oh great you're okay, almost all your suit's monitoring equipment went offline and we were so worried. Did you get them?'' Cisco asked ''No, she got away'' ''Anything important about her powers we need to worry about?'' Wells asked curiously ''Yeah, but I'll be much easier to believe if you see it yourselves'' Barry answered, knowing a size changing meta was something that had to be seen ''Okay, just pop back to STAR labs and Dr. Snow will examine you'' Wells said with an unseen nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry stood and checked his powers still worked, zooming around the room.

On his way, it appeared this was the weirdest run he ever made, since everything around was so huge for him, Barry had to avoid some differents obstacles, like car's wheel. Things he never had to focus at a normal size. But at the end he didn't have to make more effort than usual, even his body already started to recover from the pressure of the giant foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry finally entered the main room of STAR labs, but of course no one noticed him. \" Hey guys, i'm here ! \" he just said, trying  to get some attention,but of course it failed.<br>\r\nThe closest personn was Caitling, she was standing near him looking at some documents in her hands about the possible identity of the meta human that Barry tried to stop. Meanwhile at the opposite of the room, Cisco was talking with Wells about what Barry meant by <i>\"much easier to believe if you see it yourselves\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry then decided to use the coms system to get their attention. \" hey it's me..i just...came back \". Everyone were looking around to find him, but....<br>\r\n\" I can't see him. Do you ? \" Caitlin asked to Wells and Cisco. \" no. Barry we don't have time for jokes. Tell me what's wrong. \" Wells replied to the com. Cisco suddenly got excited : \" i knew it !! Barry just became invisible ! Man this is amazing, this power combined with your speed, can you imagine wh...\".  \" CISCO ! \" Caitline yelled. \"S..sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok guys, let's say that i only got a <b>small</b> problem...Cat, can you look down by your feet ? \"  Barry asked. And suddenly a second later, the now giant sized Caitlin let out a little scream which hurt Barry's ear throught the com. \" B..Barry is that you ?! \" She couldn't believe her eyes by seeing the tiny red human form of the Flash standing on the ground. Cisco was in shock \" oh no...this is the incredible shrinking flash...\". \" This is a bigger problem than you think Barry. Dr Snow i need you to examine Barry right now, Cisco you go to the police station and try to explain the situation to Ms West. I'm going to find who is that Meta human.\". Wells said before he left the place followed by Cisco who seemed annoyed to get the most crazy job ever : telling to Barry's family that he just shrunk !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry soon find himself alone with a giant Caitlin who seemed embarassed by this strange situation. \" All right then...huh... first as we don't know if your powers is dangerous for you or not in your state, i suggest you to no use your power anymore until we get the results of the exams. \" She said. Barry nodded, not sure about this.<br>\r\nWhile ha was thinking, he suddenly find himself surrounded by some giants fingers which closed arround him and he was raised to Caitlin's giant face. \" What are you doing ?\" Barry asked. \" Sorry i wasn't sure you would like to be held in my hand.\" She blushed. \" it's just that...i don't want to be treated like a puppet. Oh well let's finish with these exams you need to do on me please. \".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin smiled as she...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Barry starts to call, but stops when there is a loud bang like a hammer slamming the table ''What are you doing?'' he asks more worried ''Oh I was just preparing your medicine'' Caitlin answers with a small smile, holding up a rod with what barely qualified as a spoon like tip filled with white powder. <br>\r\n''And what is that?'' ''It is, well it was part of a pill I had been working on about a month ago, it will neutralize a speedster's powers, temporarily of course. Seeing as we've had some really bad speedsters, like Reverse-Flash, Zoom, Trajectory all running around we needed a way to keep them contained so why not seal their powers. I tested it out on Thawne's remnant and it worked just fine'' ''That's why I had to literally throw him into the time ripple'' Barry said in understanding ''Yep. Now I need you to eat this.'' Barry's eyes bulged ''What! You want me to lose my powers?'' Caitlin sighed ''Yes, but it's for the best. At your size your body is highly unstable and if you were to vibrate too high from speed you'd literally fall apart into a puddle of goo'' she explained, Barry staring up in horror ''Okay fine but this better be temporary'' he said taking the handful of powder and eating it ''Oh you'll be fine'' Caitlin said with a smile, glad she was better at lying when it was mostly true: He would disintegrate if he went too fast, but he would need to be going the equivalent of Mach 5 for it to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Barry was essentially a shrunken human Caitlin began her proper examination, mostly of the medical variety but also for her own amusement getting to toy with a tiny guy. ''Okay Barry we're done. Now as far as I can tell the meta had very few bad side effects linked with the shrinking, in fact it seemed you're more durable than if you were normal sized thought considering you said she'd stepped on you and you weren't dead as probably obvious'' Caitlin explained, still running her fingers absentmindedly along Barry's body ''Okay, anything else?'' ''Actually yes, I have one more thing to test...'' she began then picked Barry up and brought him up to her face ''Cait!'' Barry yelled in surprise ''I'm going to see if you can survive day-to-day in the real world'' she grinned ''After turning off my speed? I don't think I'd even be able to use stairs at this size'' Caitlin giggled ''Then it's a good thing my apartment is all on one floor'' ''What?'' ''You're coming home with me, so I can observe changes in interactions based on your change in size. Well let's go then'' before Barry could complain or try argue Caitlin let go of him, falling until he was caught by Caitlin's pale breasts, currently on display because her other hand pulled open her shirt. Caitlin smirked at how easy it was to do this, mostly because Wells and Cisco were still busy and nobody had informed Jessie about Barry. She made her way to her car, and drove her way to her apartment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatlin made her way quietly into her place, then entered her room, sitting on her bed before opening her shirt ''Well once again you're in my room, and this time I'm not even drunk and you still managed to get a look and a feel of my boobs'' Caitlin laughs while Barry blushes, closing his eyes and trying not to touch anymore of her breasts than he already was ''Oh don't be like that Bear, I put you there, it's fine to look and feel'' Caitlin said as she deftly removed him  and let him sit in her palm ''Now, let's see where this test goes...''</span></div></div>",

Barry blushed as he tried to avoid to look at any part of her body and turned back to face the wall of her room. \" This is not funny Cait, i'm not sure Wells is aware about these 'tests' you have in mind...\" he said nervously.<br>\r\n\"Just relax Barry, you already saw me like this when i was drunk, and you were not so shocked, right ? I suppose you are more nervous at this size. More scared also probably, even thought that i'm someone you can trust.\" Cait added while she sat on her bed,and crossed her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry turned back to her, about to reply, but he was amazed by how sexy Caitlin was, sitting like this with her crossed legs and her underwears. Caitlin smiled at his embarrassement, Barry was so cute at this size and she was glad she found way to be alone with him, althought that she didn't know how far she could go with him. The good point was that he seemed to liked the view, so maybe after all it could be further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it..'s a strange test you know \" he finally said. \" Well, that's because i was wondering if you already had imagined the good points about your size ? \" She asked, leading the next part of her plans in a good way.  \" What..do you mean ? \". Before Barry could get an answer, he was grabbed by the back of her shirt between Cait's thumb and index finger, then raised into the air until he was placed right in between her now uncrossed legs. He was now stuck between two walls of warm flesh, which were Cait's thighs. Barry instinctively tried to get away but it was useless. Somehow he felt good in there, but this was still a weird situation he wanted to avoid ! He then looked up above him to see the giant face of Caitlin who was laughing at him. \" Silly, I meant that you have a better perspective about girls now,  You can take advantage of it don't you think ? Look where you are, isn't that great ? Or maybe you prefered to be in my boob, like earlier ?\" Caitlin chuckled as Barry didn't even try to deny these good points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...anyway i don't plan to be in that state forever. \" Barry yelled, to change the subject. \"But Cait wasn't listenning to him as she was thinking about what else she could do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Huh..Cait ?

Barry asked, already beginning to worry<br>\r\n''It's actually a simple one in theory: we're going to test your resistances to physical pressure, as well as where your limit to said pressure is'' Caitlin explained ''And that means?'' ''I'm going to place you on a flat surface and then slowly increase the weight and pressure on your body. As this is a test of the limits, I want you to tell me when it becomes too much for you.''

Barry asked in a defeated tone ''Yep but come on, you don't want to get a closer look and feel of this lovely body?'' ''Wait what?'' ''I'm going to use myself as the 'weight' to test you, better to have something softer rather than some chunky metal blocks on top of you, plus I can remove myself much easier than any other weights'' Caitlin explained with a wide grin, while Barry groaned but couldn't actually find a hole in her logic ''Okay fine, lets get this over with'' ''YAY!''

It was so intense that he thought his ribs would break at anytime, but it didn't. He just couldn't move anymore, and could barely breathe..but yet, the only thing he could breath  was the smell of  the giant foot which hold him with strenght against the ground.

She continued to apply more pressure, when she realized that Barry was now probably not able to tell her to stop, so she went easier with him. \"Oh Barry you feel so good under my foot.

He asks/yells ''Yep, I've decided to be the perfect friend and let you obtain necessary warmth from sleeping on or in the insulated, fatty regions of my body... and by fatty I mean here or here'' she says, poking her boob so it would react and jiggle, before standing up and shaking her behind in Barry's direction in amusement, the shrunken man unable to tear his eyes away from the mound of what he believed was actually more muscle than it was fat.<br>\r\nWhat broke his staring was a giggle from Caitlin ''See I knew you liked it, I know you better than you know yourself, which is why I picked where you'd be sleeping at<u><i> l'hotel de Snow</i></u>'' she finished with a passable French accent before picking him up and bringing him up to her face ''I hope you like this Bear, I'm being really open with you and that doesn't happen, I really hope you apriciate this... oh who am I kidding of course you do. Now time for night kiss'' she coos before pressing Barry's head to her lips and kissing it, Barry wondered for a moment if this was a test to see how long it took him to pass out when he was finally released. Caitlin had a goofy grin on her face and she said one last thing ''Night, night Bear, I'll see you in the morning'' before she moved her hand and Barry and her was...</span></div></div>",

The giant woman realized that he just started to got the lesson as he didn't try to discuss her decision, which will probably make things easier for Caitlin to do whatever she wants with him in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's first thought was that the night will be long for him, trapped in the most unexpected place for a man. The smell of feet didn't help either to feel comfortable, althought that it could have been worst. <i>\" thanks god she takes a shower everyday \"</i> he thought. Looking at the entrance of the shoe above his head, he could see Caitlin's little smile on her face saying : \" have a good night Barry \".  \" yeah good night ! \".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she put the light off and went to bed, happy to know that things are going well for her. But she was wondering how long this game will work before Barry get mad ?

Now I need to take you out of my shoe so I can wear them, sure this could be a good form of transport if we need it, but we're still trying to determine your limits so let's leave it for now'' Caitlin greeted and said with a cheery grin, noting how Barry practically flinched at the thought of being under her feet for that long, guess he deserves somewhere else as a change of scenery. Without any warning she plucks Barry from her shoe and slides him into her bra, which was still visible under her half open shirt ''Cait!'' Barry yelled in embarrassment  but she continued to smile ''Oh Barry, my girls got you here, which means they can definitely get you back to Star Labs, you'll be fine'' Caitlin placated as she did up her buttons, slowly entombing him between her breasts.<br>\r\nOnce her face was out of Barry's field of vision she smirked, some things were just too easy. Slipping on her shoes and slightly regretting the lack of a little red addition, she exited and locked her apartment before heading to her car and driving back to STAR labs. When she arrived she wondered how Cisco and Wells were doing in the hunt for the shrinking meta, Cisco already probably giving her some kind of name like <b>Dr mini</b>, or <b>Nanocloud</b> but most likely not having any luck with actually finding the size changer if the lack of any contact after getting home was any indication. She also wondered how the Wests were taking the news about Barry's condition, not well she presumed but it showed what they thought of her skills that they also didn't text or ring her asking about Barry.<br>\r\nHer mind then began to wander to random things she could do with Barry, or even with the new meta's powers when she walked past the lab Jesse usually worked out of: usually working on ways to upgrade the STAR labs tech or the do-dads her father brought over from Earth-2, Jesse Wells was every bit a tinkerer as the non-evil Harrison they were getting know, and it was clear he was where she got all her sarcasm and wit. It was actually this that made her stop and think about a few things: Had anyone told her about what happened to Barry? Would she even care? Would she show a similar <i>interest</i> as Caitlin did and want to do her own tests? Would she be open to a <i>group project</i>? There was a lot to consider including what manner of things they could do with the little guy together and if maybe something else came out of their collaboration (having given up on Dr. Wells noticing her a LONG time ago) what was the harm?<br>\r\nSo... (By the way if you choose option A, Wells has to name her, as in the original chapter <u><b>Minimizer</b>)</u></span></div></div>",

Now she was sure he couldn't see her she grinned like a loon before heading out to her car quite briskly, wondering how long it would take her morals to kick in and remind her she needed to find the meta and unshrink Barry, rather than keep him this size under the influence of the speed neutralizer as her insole forever. Sighing in annoyance she plopped into her car and drove off, occasional clenching her toes around what she believed to be his head, mostly for her own amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's heart sank as he saw Caitlin's now enormous foot block out the light from the shoe, but also surprised by his own surprise, leaving him in her shoe was just asking fro trouble the only good thing was it was accidental, but that did little to lesson the pain of her body crushing him under her toes, what did help was that Caitlin was wearing flats today, putting the weight on the heel of her foot, rather than her toes (and through them him) if she'd worn high heels like she often did. He also discovered 2 things about this position: it was a lot more comfortable to be in this positon than it had ben last night, most likely because the pressure had been essentially constant, while this was go=stop=go=stop in time with her steps as she walked, the other being that he was glad Snow showered daily, as there was a strong scent of strawberries, instead of just foot sweat. It was bearable but not that much so he hoped Caitlin would remember him and let him out soon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... what does Caitlin do?/What is Barry's fate for today?</span></div></div>",

'Well <i><b>I believe that's all I came here for, except...'</b></i> he doesn't finish his words just grabs Barry's arm and runs, pulling him through a breach and back to his previous lair on Earth 2, flinging the former speedster against the wall as he stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why did you take me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'It's quite simple Barry, once I collected items from the people I killed, now I'm going to collect all the speedsters I destroy.

Rolling onto his back he blinked his eyes into focus and flung himself back against the wall in fear and shock: on the other side of the glass wall was an absolutely enormous version of the mirror faced woman, Zoloman grinning manically a little further away though equally massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A perfect victim as always dear, the name Minimizer suits you perfectly' he says casually as the woman waves him off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What was the point in this?' she asks curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I decided to track my progress of concurring the multiverse by collecting Flash's as I defeat and drain them of their powers. Using your powers they can't escape nor would there be much point if they did. That and I think you girls deserve a reward for your continued service, so as long as he stays alive you can do what you like with him'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you Hunter' Minimiser says running a finger along the outside of Barry's cage, the powerless speedster shaking so hard he was practically vibrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay, I'm off, you girls have fun then'' Hunter grins as he leaves in a streak of blue, leaving Barry to stare in fear but also confusion as the mirror faced Minimiser was the only person here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh don't worry we will' came a loud female voice and Barry cursed his luck as he turned and was shocked to see a smirking Caitlin... Killer frost half spread across the table he'd been placed on, along with Dr. Light (Linda Park) and Black Siren (Laurel Lance) both who had similar looks as they stared down at the tiny, helpless Barry. Luckily distraction came in the form of a monitor in the room lighting up and a distorted female voice calling out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay guys he's left the city limits'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Finally free of the bastard for a few hours' Dr. Light mutters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thanks Livewire (Not the Supergirl one, similar abilities but she's a Flash/Arrow character. Actually she's kind of like a human Rotom to use a Pok\u00e9mon reference)' Siren said as she quickly knocked over Barry's<i> 'cell' </i>causing him to tumble onto the desk, the meta looking down at him with hungry eyes, licking her lips ... until she's repeatedly jabbed in the ribs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Zoom said no killing' Minimizer stated flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like you listen to that bastard' Siren scoffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I do when it prevents massacres' was the annoyed reply 'One of us has to use our brains around here' she mutters but Siren could still hear her. Siren grits her teeth and inhales to prepare a sonic shriek, but then she notices the slight movements of her hands that Minimizer uses to direct her abilities and looking down she sees blue smoke covering her up to her ankles. Sighing loudly she relents 'Fine but I still get a turn'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wouldn't dream of stopping you. Now if you'll excuse me I have this claustrophobic thing to remove' Minimizer replies while waving her hand in the direction of her face. She pushes back her hood and raises a hand to either side of her head, a click was heard and the mask slid off nicely ''Really need to thank Le Fay for the mask idea'' she mutters now with her real voice audible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Didn't Luther already owe you for what you did to the Kryptonian?' Livewire asks causing the formerly masked meta to chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True, Mor was happy to have me turn her former lover into her new plaything, don't think the other girl really complained that much either.' she smiles and turns allowing Barry to get a proper look at her and was shocked at the level of alteration her meta abilities had caused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin was lavender and her hair was shimmering black at shoulder length. Her eyes were larger than they should be and her ears had pointed tips. Her smirk meant Barry could see the pointed teeth and thin black tongue. It took him a minute or 2 for him to see past all the physical changes and see the woman she'd once been... and he knew her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions for Minimiser are as follows<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara Lance<br>\r\nFelicity Smoak (Otherwise she's Earth 2's Livewire)<br>\r\nPatty Spivot<br>\r\nAlex Danvers (for fun :D)</span></div></div>",

He started to climb up the front of the empty black shoe and made his way along the side, trying to reach the heel, as it was the highest point he figured it was his best shot at jumping to her dangling foot. Just as he was reaching the heel of the shoe the enourmous foot collided with the shoe, knocking him down and sending him stumbling inside. Getting up he looked around and realised there was no way on earth he was going to be able to climb out, not that it mattered however as everything around him went dark, looking up he realised she was putting the shoe on! He began sprinting toward the toe section in hopes that he'd be able to avoid getting crushed but he was way too small to reach it in time and her bare sole pressed him down into the leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she feel him?</span></div></div>",

With that Pam brought her massive bare foot over to Jim, dangling it over his tiny little body, he wanted to run but his body was in too much pain, he fell to his knees in the darkness as Pam's massive sole cam down onto him, turning him into a tiny bloodstain on the foot of his goddess of a co-worker. \"That'll teach you to hide in my shoes\" Pam mumbled.</span></div></div>",

What's causing this itching? It can't be lice! My hair is perfectly healthy!\" She had had a checkup the year before and the doctor had said her hair was definitely free of vermin or their eggs so she knew it wasn't hair lice but yet there was something moving around in her hair she could feel it and began scratching it trying to find the source.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She checked under the sofa, and all throughout the carpet. He wasn't there. She checked the chairs, the counter and drawers in the kitchen, but he was nowhere to be found. Bella then went up to her room, checked the bed, the floor, and her wardrobe, but still had not a clue as to where he was. At this moment she began to feel something ticklish in her belly button. She bit her lower lip to dissuade an escaping giggle and continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the bathroom, carefully inspecting each drain, and lifting the toilet seat ever so slightly to check and make sure there wasn't a tiny, bug-sized little human potentially drowning in there. Her bowels groaned, and she let loose a little fart. Having thouroughly ensured that she would not indirectly kill her potential third boyfriend, she lifted the lid, unbuckled and unzipped her tight jeans, and shimmied to get out of them. Once her lower clothing was in an untidy heap at her feet, she turned around and plopped her sizeable behind on the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her muscles relaxed and released their load into the waiting porcelain bowl, Bella stretched her legs and leaned back with an overblown, melodramatic sigh. She wondered, vaguely, where her tiny new friend could be. Why had he run? Maybe...maybe she had gone too quickly for the little cutie. Maybe he just hadn't been able to keep up with her pace of things and just bolted away. Yes that was probably it. Well, she wouldn't hold it against him, at lea--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, out of the blue, her belly button tickled again. She couldn't conceal it -- she was caught by surprise -- she laughed. \"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something -- something <i>alive</i> in her belly button -- and Miss Bella Swan knew what -- or rather, <i>who</i>, it was. She immediately slammed a palm over her belly button, in order to keep that wonderful tickling sensation. Bella laughed again, \"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAnopleasestopAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the tickled giggles began to wind down and Bella began to regain her composure. Immediately she grabbed the tiny man in her belly button and brought him to her face. Her face wreathed in wide smiles, she immediately bent forward and gave him a long, sucking kiss before gently depositing him in between her enormous breasts so she could reach around and flush the bowl full of waste that she could catch glimpses of between her thighs. Still giddy, she giggled gleefully as she imagined how much her tiny cargo would like to be placed in that toilet, for him to catch a glance of her tremendous posterior. Oh, what a show it would be! She thought, flattering herself with an imaginary strip tease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified. First you were trapped inside Bella's belly button, your attempted escapes causing her to laugh like a demon. Then she trapped you in there for personal pleasure, and now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella leaned in closely and whispered conspiratorily to her tiny cargo. \"I know what you want, little guy...\"</span></div></div>",

There, Bella took you out of your hiding spot and placed you on a desk. Then she overturned a cup on top of you.

Bella, not expecting this sudden pain in her hand, cried out and dropped you on the ground. While she looked at her hand to see if you had drawn blood, you ran as fast as you could away from her. Suddenly, Bella shrieked and started stomping after you. You had made her bleed, and she was going into the incandescent rage of being hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you slid beneath a door. You crouched under the door, your head millimeters from the rough, splintery wood. Swan stomped by, not noticing how there was a tiny shadow in the middle of the crack between the door and the floor. As you backed away, you wondered just what room you had gotten yourself into. You turned around and found yourself in a titanic bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked for cover. There was no way you were going to stay on the floor -- even if Bella didn't see you, she could still squish you into a bloody pulp just by putting her foot in the wrong place at the wrong time. There wasn't much to hide you on the ground, so you scaled a nearby tub to look for cover. There! On the outside corner, there rested a curved bar of light blue soap. You crawled beneath the soap and tested the \"walls\" of your new temporary shelter. They were very soft. As you looked closer, you could see the indents where Bella placed her fingers. But then, the excitement of the past few hours caught up to you and you fell asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't wake up until it was too late. Bella had already walked in, stripped off her clothes, and started the water. You leaned out carefully of one side of the curved soap. The window, though its slats were blocking most of it, showed a sunset. It was late evening. Below you was the pile of Bella's clothing, with her empty bra cup lying on top. You leaned out the other side, and saw Bella sit down next to your corner. Her head turned, and she glanced at the soap. You hadn't been seen yet, but Bella started to reach for the soap bar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: You're mesmerized. Bella grabs the soap, still unaware of your being there, and starts to clean herself with it. While you are at first mashed deeply into the bar by her fingers, you may come unstuck when she submerges the soap to clean her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Two: You run away, and fall into her open bra cup, which she will put back on after the bath.</span></div></div>",

She'd need to make some arrows of her own once she'd found a safe place to stay for the night, or at least for long enough to get a little rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Meanwhile in the Game maker's platform</u> (That thing has no official name so F*** it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sir she's almost at the boundary, do we turn her around?'' One of the observers asked<br>\r\n''No it's fine, she won't get much further. Time to see what R&amp;D have come up with to deal with little miss 12'' Seneca answered as they watched her running towards the boundary<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Back with Katniss</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatniss was still running, hoping to find some kind of end or edge of the arena, something when she heard a slight buzzing in the air, stopping she turns in several circles looking for a source of the noise but nothing. Frowning Katniss decides to keep going, not getting more than 10 steps before something directly in front of her explodes in a brilliant flash of blue light, blinding her and throwing her several feet, knocking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Later</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatniss awoke with a splitting headache and several bruises across her body but luckily nothing more severe than that. Which was probably a good thing as when her eyes adjusted she found a much bigger problem: That she was sitting/lying in the middle of an enormous bow, the bow that had previously been on her person not so long ago. Standing up (and using the bow to measure herself) Katniss discovered the game makers had somehow shrunk her to 6 inches tall, something which appeared to only effect certain materials as both the bow as well at the backpack were still their original size, though Katniss was more glad that their outfits were affected as she really didn't want to add naked to the list of problems she had: following shrunken, defenceless, rapidly losing heat and both thirsty and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to formulate a plan Katniss heard the heard of elephants that was a normal sized person moving through the forest regardless of any attempts at stealth, thinking quickly Katniss ducked into the underside of her fallen backpack, just in time as she watched the bow being pulled away out of sight. Katniss gulped and prayed whoever they were would miss the backpack and move on but the silence worried her, they obviously hadn't moved since picking up the bow as even slight movement in this undergrowth would make a lot of noise to someone Katniss's size and proximity to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fears were realised when the backpack was lifted off the ground, Katniss tried fleeing into the undergrowth but the severe change in light conditions disorientated her and caused her to stumble. Turning onto her back Katniss looked up at the girl now wearing her backpack, and her eyes met their much larger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

But as you get up, it didn't matter anymore to know where your <br>\r\nwas, because the first thing you realized is that you were...small. You were not only teleported somewhere, you also shrunk to the <br>\r\nsize of a bug ! That was crazy, you must be dreaming ! You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you head a female voice in your head : <i>\" You have to find the your Crystal..\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sorry ? Who's there ?! Where i am ? \" You replied. Then, a beautiful woman normal sized just appeared in front of you. You noticed <br>\r\nhow beautiful she looked. She had long blond hairs, wearing some golden ornements in differents parts of her white dress. She was a kind<br>\r\nof \"Divine\" in your mind. The other thing you noticed was that she was sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My name is Cosmos, i'm the Goddess of the Harmony. I'm the one who summoned you in there. But i didn't expect you to be...that small.<br>\r\nmy powers are decreasing because of Chaos, God of Discord. \" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What's the hell is going on ?! If i'm not dreaming, why did you bring me here ? \" You asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You're the last warrior i've summoned. There are many other warriors from differents worlds already fighting against Chaos's soldiers. Each one <br>\r\nof them is supposed to find their own crystal, so i could recover my power and protect every worlds. But your mission will be more difficult since you<br>\r\nare so small. Your crystal could be enought powerfull to restore your normal size. I suggest you to find some allies to help you in your task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Your warriors right ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes. But be carefull. They don't know about you, i told them to not trust anyone else. They might think you're an agent of Chaos.You'll have to convince<br>\r\nthem. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait, what ? And what if they decide to step on me ?!\"  You panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You can't die in this world. If you get killed, you will come back an hour later. But try to avoid this, because we don't have so much time to waste. \" Cosmos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmmm...guess i have no choice. All right, if i can't die anyway...That sound like a weird war if no one can die, and i don't understand everything, but i want to come back home as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Goddess smiled and picked you up with two fingers to put you in the palm of her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" With your size, i can at last send you in the battlefield. Find your Crystal. Good luck little one.\" With that, she bring you close to her face and gave you a big<br>\r\nkiss. You felt the cold and soft lips of the goddess all over your body. This was a strange feeling, but good also. Then, everything went dark in your sight as you<br>\r\nwere send to the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appeared in a kind of Castle, but here again some parts of the environnement was strange. You didn't know how you were supposed to find your Crystal, and how<br>\r\nyou would recognize it...When suddenly you heard a voice behind you :  \" what's the hell is that thing on the ground ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to see...</span></div></div>",

But, if your into that, then imagine it how you want). You slowly and sheepishly nod your head, a little embarrassed of this strange desire. Surprised, yet pleased by your answer, Carmelita says \"Well then there's no time to waste! Wouldn't want you getting washed away by all the rain ;)\" She then picks you up by the collar of your shirt between her thumb and index finger, and proceeds to drop you into her tall, brown boot. As you landed, the insole of the boot was softer than you expected. You then look up to see her paw descending into the boot, slowly. Carmelita wanted to savor this moment. After so many failed attempts to capture Sly Cooper, she greatly enjoyed your predicament. Then her paw made contact, and slowly squashed your tiny, squishy body into the boot. \"I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I'm invincible.

You couldn't wrap your mind around why, but the way she powerfully pressed your spongy body into the insole of her boot was just plain sexy. Step after step, she mercilessly stomped on your tiny frame for about an hour (she took the long way home). She then finally arrived at her destination, and continued her nonchalant trot through the front door. As she kicked of her boots, you realized you were stuck to the sole of her foot. Carmelita then walks over to her couch, sits down, and tunes in to her favorite TV channel. Not sure if she remembers you or not, she doesn't withdraw her ruthless attitude toward you as she lifts her heel and grinds you into her carpeted living room floor. This behavior goes on for another hour until she decides to prop her feet up on a footrest. After being plastered to her sole for another hour, she then gets up and decides to hit the hay. When she got to her bedroom, she put on a pair of white ankle socks and fell asleep on her bed. Although flattened to your hot captor's tired foot, this may have turned out to be the best day of your life. Intoxicated by her natural scent and the warmth of her sole, you eventually grew tired, too, and soon fell asleep. You awake...</span></div></div>",

A detective like me needs to stay in shape.\" Before you could get a word out, she stood off her bed, dropped you in front of her bare feet, and proceeded to stomp on you in hopes of you sticking to her sole. After a couple of good stomps, she then lifted her heel like yesterday, and started twisting her foot back and forth, grinding you into her carpet yet again. She was relentless, but you loved her even more for it. After a few good minutes of stomping and grinding, Carmelita was satisfied with your current position. She then slipped her white ankle socks back on, and got dressed for the gym. Dressed in blue sneakers and matching gym attire, she began jogging to her local gym. Today was a hot day, which made Carmelita's 'Natural scent' 10 times stronger, and she was starting to get sweaty. And she wasn't even halfway to the gym. When she arrived, you were already in heaven. You started to kiss her sole all over, thankful for whatever miracle had placed you at her feet in the first place. On Carmelita's side, she was also having the time of her life. She thoroughly enjoyed squashing you under her feet. So much so, she forgot all about Sly Cooper and her detective job. All she wanted to do was keep her little insole forever. As she entered the gym, she started at the treadmill. On a side note, the gym's air conditioning wasn't working today, lucky for you. Carmelita was at the gym for hours, having no remorse in stomping on you with her ever sweaty and smelly feet. You wished you could stay in her sneaker forever, but soon she returned home, relentlessly stepping on your squashed body along the way. When she returned to her home, she kicks of her sneakers and peeled off her clothes in preparation for a shower. She then scraped your flat body off of her sole of the wedge of her stairs, and started towards the bathroom. You didn't get to catch a glimpse of her naked, though, as you were trying to re-inflate at the base of the stairs. After half an hour, she gets out of the shower and...</span></div></div>",

Then she began to walk over to the kitchen to make herself some breakfast before watching some TV. After fixing herself a bowl of cereal, she walked over to her couch and sat down.

After a solid 5 minutes of squeezing, she dropped you back on the foot rest and asked \"Ready to answer my question now?\" You nodded your head and told her all about your world back home, and how you were suddenly transported to this strange place. Carmelita was very intrigued, as it sounded like something out of a storybook. She then told you all about her world, despite you already knowing everything about the Sly Cooper games (but you didn't want her to know that). After you two knew each other fairly well from chatting over a foot massage, she decides that she enjoys your company and wants to treat you better. \"Now that we've gotten to know each other, I feel like I understand you better, so I won't be treating you so harshly anymore.\" said Carmelita. You almost had a visibly disappointed face when she said that. She took notice in you trying to hide your disappointment, and said \"Unless you'd like me to?\" You don't want to lie to her, so you told her all about how much you enjoyed being crushed and smothered underfoot. You saw she was blushing through your explanation, and felt a little reassurance yourself. Maybe you weren't so weird after all. After the heart to heart, the two of you decided to go on a date.</span></div></div>",

This was because one time Ren's boss was being an utter moron and tossing a shrink ray he bought on the internet to himself and then deciding to throw it with a boomerang, surprisingly it worked but Ren's boss had horrible hand eye coordination when it came to stuff like catching sports balls so the shrink ray hit the corner of a table and hit him and also teleport him to a friend of his. Although when he got back to normal size there were two side affects. One he would shrink whenever he went into a portal and two he was resistant to electricity, key word resistant as Ren was once struck by lighting and he got third degree burns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on multi-verse what will it be this time, a sandwich, women's clothing store, a gopher hole, or heck maybe even fifty feet above the air!\" Ren shouted as he fell landing on a next to a table, breaking his arm. \"Oh, that hurts\" Renaissance winced biting his lip in pain. Despite the fact Renaissance has been in several horrible situations before but this one was probably in the top ten. Renaissance ducked behind one of the table legs hearing the sound of humming. He took a peek and saw it was Tali, a close friend of his. Although Renaissance wasn't sure it was his Tali, he listened to some things on alternate worlds knowing that there were multiple of versions of most people in the multiverse, so he would have to wait more until he was sure it would be safe to reveal himself.</span></div></div>",

Even if she preferred to play the damsel, hoping to find herself a husband in the process she knew better than to actually trust a man to show up and save her from the monsters so continued to improve her skill, her axe twirling between her fingers idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the adrenaline coursing through her veins it was no surprise she knew immediately when something (or someone) flopped onto her foot, looking down she saw what looked to be a large bug. Now Charlotte was quite a brash and hardy woman but she still had actual moments of meek female such as the immediate <i>'kill it kill it now' </i> chant going through her mind whenever she saw insects, the difference being she'd be the one to smush the thing rather than yelling those thoughts out load and hoping a man was nearby to kill it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising the foot the bug was on (so she wasn't standing on her own foot when she killed it) she prepared to crush it, except when she moved she caused it to roll over and spread out, revealing something that looked human<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The fuck?' she whispered, lowering her foot before crouching down to get a better look. It was a little person, a boy with blue hair and a cute face, such a lovely creature.... and he was all hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning like a psychopath Charlotte picked up the little guy and examined him, noting first of all he was unconscious, the deepness of his sleep seemed to suggest he'd keeled over from exhaustion, another being his little clothes, very well made and if she wasn't mistaken custom made rather than simple dolls clothes. Was he someone's pet? Servant? Those thoughts made her grin imagining him serving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan opened his eyes slowly to find himself looking into the big blue eyes of a blond busty bombshell (is that even a description we can use in FE? Oh well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why hello cutie, my name's Charlotte what's yours?' the woman purred, in a way Morgan had heard Aversa do many times, either in a teasing or flirty way and he wasn't sure which this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um I'm Morgan Miss' he answers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh how lovely Morgan sounds like such a perfect name for such a cutie little man.

Morgan yells but Selena rolls her eyes then pokes him in the face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Idiot, I'm still Severa, just not the one you grew up with.

Any chance I can get home from here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah you can, but given my job of retainer to princess Camilla I can't just leave and bring you, so I'd need to send word back home, and with the Outrealm gates that would take a few days, then someone would need to come over to get you then get from the gates to Castle Krakenberg which is a day or so ride' Selena explains, not wanting to get Morgan's hopes up at a speedy 'rescue' as she's sure Odin will call it... being saved from her clutches that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, well I guess I can stay with you if that's alright?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, I'll just need to keep you hidden from Camilla, if she saw your cuteness you might never leave her room and you already have one of those back home' she winks but whatever joke she's trying to make flies right over Morgan's head. (She's making a joke about Noire's affection/love/obsession with Morgan and how he doesn't need to add Camilla when he already has Noire) 'Now seeing as you were so reluctant to leave my lovely breasts, how about you give them a massage?'

Beruka added that last part when she was about to go into Selena's room and heard the red head moaning loudly and there were some things  that made even Beruka uncomfortable. Although she had some other theory's little boy was Selena's lover but that one seemed unlikely because one time Beruka stole Selena's diary where some rather <b>graphic</b> things written about some woman named Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeruka was thinking about when should she take the adorable little boy that Selena had that Beruka deserves more since she was Camilla's retainer longer and didn't complain as much, in her room, sewing outfits for the little boy including pajamas. Beruka had learned to sew when she was being trained as an assassin as you never know what talents you need for killing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate at night Beruka struck, she she had snuck into Selena's room. which had been locked further stoking Beruka's curiosity as normally Selena left her door unlocked due to laziness. Beruka couldn't see the little boy anywhere but she had heard adorable snoring coming from Selena's chest. Beruka pulled out the sleeping boy and took his clothes off and replacing them with a pair of pajamas she had made earlier.

The lilac haired woman answered the door in her usual seductive sleepwear, something which gave the redhead Lucina flashbacks followed by regret pangs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good morning Darling, what brings you here at this hour?' she asks and Selena knew she was right; outside of missions the princess never saw her retainers before noon and it was only just gone 9<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'An old friend of mind... dropped in due to an accident.

Well let me see him. He's a guest of castle Krakenberg and it would be very rude for a princess such as myself not to greet him personally, don't you think' she bites her lip and Selena panics internally, Camilla always was the sneaky one, when she wasn't being a one woman demolition team.

He can't simply marry you instead' she bullshits, hoping there was enough truth in her statement Camilla won't simply call her out on it<br>\r\nMorgan was a prince, 2nd in line to the Ylsian throne, as well as being Aversa's heir and 1st in line for Plegia, unfortunately for them being inline to another via blood means Aversa needed a backup... thankfully we have our favourite busty archer around. Aversa didn't have and didn't plan on having any kids, content to rule her arid land, enjoy her harem and spoil her 2 favourite kids, Morgan and Noire (Yeah her and Luci don't get along. Lucina thinks she's too laid back and insane, Aversa says.... she has a naginata shoved up her ass she's so stiff). The best thing about it was that Noire was never going to marry anyone other than Morgan, and the little guy was already head over heels in love with her, plus there were only issues if for some reason Lucina doesn't become Exalt, otherwise Morgan is free to become king of Plegia with his Split Queen bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla pouts 'Really, is she cuter than me? Can she stand against this sexy might?' she thrusts her tits out as far as her immense bust can go, Selena trying to hold in a nose bleed while Morgan smiles slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ummmm...' Selena stutters slightly 'h-h-her boobs are about the same, been a while so she might be bigger than I remember...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pout intensifies and Selena knows it was her that taught Elise to beg for sweets 'And her ass?' Camilla shakes her hips with a wide grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh you've got her beat there' the redhead can't help but leer at her boss, who just smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well it appears I'll need to meet this bride to be of yours my future husband, and either explain how I am simply the superior mate for a lovely creature such as yourself, or just marry her too' the sweet smile on her face told Morgan Camilla was surprisingly okay with either option (Camilla may not like to share but she may be more than okay if they were both hers, and of course she was both of their's)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Morgan or Selena knew how to react to the statement 'Uh.... well nothing can happen until they get my letter and send someone, if they send her I'll send her up to you, otherwise maybe we can make an adventure out of it, bring Corrin along and see Plegia for yourself' Selena says, adding the bit about Corrin because Camilla dotted on the white haired klutz, and giving them a chance to see the world ranked high on Camilla's things she needed to do, it would definitely motivate/encourage her to go through with the option if they needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla thinks about it before nodding 'All righty then, but this little cutie stays with me, hope you like the twins lover, they'll be getting to know you quite well' she grins and slides Morgan between her boobs, squeezing them around him playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um Lady Camilla, Morgan and I haven't had breakfast yet' Selena mentions, causing Camila to gasp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well the send Flora up with some food, now would be nice' she orders before removing Morgan and placing him on her pillow, despite herself Selena smiles at her boss's affection for Morgan even despite her crazy, knowing they both see all Morgan's favourite people in Camilla (Tharja, Aversa and of course Noire, little bit of Robin during her more mature and worrying moments like with Morgan eating). It was this that told her Morgan should be fine in the few minutes it should take her to find the blue haired maid and return with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who gets sent to retrieve Morgan? Is it Noire, who has a discussion/flirtation with Camilla about Morgan's future or does Robin come herself and Garron involves himself in Camilla's little bit of husband hunting?</span></div></div>",

I freaking hate my future self obsessing over Morgan like mom does with Robin! Just because future me and Morgan got married everyone thinks Morgan and I are an item! I'm getting married to Owain for crying out loud! The only people who get that since my future self and I grew up differently its reasonable to love different people are my dad, Chrom and Owain's parents. I mean future Nah and Yarne got married but my Yarne was engaged to Lucina before he got lynched by a group of purists. So Lucina is now currently dating Inigo who you should know isn't a total perv like his future self!\" Noire ranted panting tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp since you aren't bethrothed to Morgan I'll-\" Camilla got interrupted when she found a knife pressed up against her throat. \"You misunderstood my rant, I don't love Morgan romantically but I still love him as a friend and I lost a week of planning   for my wedding since Robin and Mom are trying to change my mind and I'm not gonna leave the cousin of my groom in the hands of some slutty,deranged cougar.

She was glad the forest was a short hike from the main city, as she really didn't want to risk Morgan while horse riding (Speed=Bounce, Bounce=Pain. Yeah probably wouldn't be fun for Morgan if he was awake). The thanked all the deities she was aware off that Camilla was daydreaming about Corrin and Beruka was her usual anti-social/silent assassin self, as it meant she didn't need to try interact with them and risk giving something away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a semi conscious Morgan wriggled his way into a more comfortable position, he knew he was in a rather large and bouncy butt, his brain wasn't running quick enough to be sure who it was but he didn't mind right now, he just knew whoever she was, was a nice place to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was entering the palace Selena nearly jumped out of her skin when even unconscious Morgan's little hands managed to find one of the massage/pressure points of her ass and squeeze, a situation which was made worse because Leo (who she'd been passively flirting with for the last few weeks) was walking past at the time, a witness to her almost spazz out, luckily neither Odin or Laslow were present or she'd never hear the end of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally returning to her room Selena was quick to dig the blue haired prince out of her pants, before he woke up or caused more damage.

'Come on, or I won't have the energy to continue' Selena thinks, feeling another peak build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was enjoying himself greatly, bouncing around in the greatest behind he'd ever gotten to play with, his own arousal growing inside him as he moved, just as it reached it's apex he bit down on the cheek he'd been massaging, giving this girl a lovebite of her own as well as a small claim on this one. Finally spent Morgan droops and slides into her crack, just for a moment before being pulled out and finally meeting his goddess... to say he was shocked it was Selena would be the understatement of the century, wow he knew he ass was nice but this was beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena grins at her little buddy, his massage undoing most of the stress caused by having someone like Camilla as the royal she was protecting, and she was glad to see he was still ready to go 'Very good job back there Morgan, but I hope you're ready for more'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Morgan wanted to go spelunking with Kagero, make her feel good on the inside as well as the out, but her knew he couldn't just ask her, as <i>'can you put me in your panties and use me like a sex toy?'</i> wouldn't have gone over well, but Morgan was a skilled tactician, so he had a plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on Kagero's shoulder (getting unobscured views of her succulent cleavage) watching her eat her desert, Morgan decided to put his plan into action 'Hey Kagero'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm?' the ninja grunts lightly, unsure what Morgan would want<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want to thank you for being so nice to me and apologise for messing up your cake' he looks down sheepishly and Kagero coos internally 'My size means there are a lot of things I can't do, so I try find ways to be useful.

So what I'm offering you is an ultra special massage' the blue haired prince smiled widely, Kagero unable to do anything other than mirror it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now slightly blushing ninja agrees quite quickly to a breast massage from her little friend, speeding off to her room the moment she finishes her cake.

Outside of her tight uniform Kagero's breasts were less firm and more doughy, but Morgan didn't care, in fact her like that he practically sank into this mountain of squishy, heavenly scented flesh. Once he knew he had her attention Morgan began to worship her bust as much as massage it, with feather light kisses and long licks all along her cleavage. Grinning as he had her practically purring, Morgan bounced up her boob to her nipple, where he wrapped his arms around it in a hug and bit down on the very tip. This rewarded him with Kagero's loudest, most primal groan, along with the side effect of him being mashed between her palm and her tit as she fondled herself, making cute little pants and purrs as she did. Finally her hand falls to her side and she lies there breathing heavily, Morgan just as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is his 'seduction' working?</span></div></div>",

While he knew Chrom was joking Morgan took it to heart and mastered baking. Now some of you heathens may be thinking 'But DS Morgan is an inch tall how could he possibly bake?.' Shut your little unbelieving faces for a second and let me explain. Morgan uses his magic to move things so he can bake, unfortunately this magic for some reason only works when he's baking but he doesn't worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Kagero, to thank you for taking me in and getting me a new pair of clothes (While I was explaining crap Kagero found Morgan a pair of doll clothes that fit perfectly and comfortably on Morgan while his other clothes were being washed) I'd like to bake you some cookies.\" Morgan said as he was carried in Kagero's hands (He understood why Kagero didn't immediately place him in her breasts) \"While that is a nice offer I don't see how you can bake at your size.\" Kagero said \"Welllllll I have special magic that helps me cook, if you bring me to the kitchen I can make yiu the best cookies you'll ever eat.\" Morgan said cheerfully, \"Okay I'll take you up on that offer.\" Kagero smiled as she went towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was sat on the countertop and he started using his magic to take out ingredients and utensils. Morgan was going to make Gourmet Cookies, his special cookies that made women immediately gain weight in the right places when consumed. Morgan knew if he was going to marry Kagero she had to be really big, as in Plegia the curvier the woman the more respect and power she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had made twenty-four cookies all for Kagero. \"These are all for me?\" Kagero asked drooling a bit, Morgan nodded with a large grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BURP* Oh Dragons those were amazing, thank you Morgan.\" Kagero said \"No, thank you for trusting me enough to bake for you.\" Morgan replied happy with his work. Kagero now had T&amp;A bigger than ever Aversa which were strained by the too small clothes Kagero was wearing and her large thick thighs weren't helping. Kagero's stomach had gone from flat to now a nice large muffin top, incredibly soft and doughy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero had taken Morgan back to her room. \"Here you go you can sleep here, its bed time. man these clothes are too tight.\" Kagero muttered the last part as she set Morgan on the nightstand where there was a small doll pillow and blanket. Due to being so full Kagero's mind was dulled causing her to strip naked losing her sense of modesty. This of course mde Morgan blush ridiculously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty minutes Kagero felt something on her belly, she looked up seeing Morgan shivering. \"Miss Kagero, I'm so cold can I sleep with you, pretty please?\" Morgan whimpered, this wasn't him trying to marry Kagero, he was actually cold and he's literally never slept by himself. Kagero gave a small smile \"Sure liitle guy you can cuddle up....\"</span></div></div>",

Still the choice was simple, while he was sure his perfect woman was curvy in all the right places he knew he had a preferential leaning towards breasts, knowing from experience a girl with a bubble butt didn't appeal to him the way a girl with huge tits did, though he liked an all round buxom babe most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your breasts please' Morgan asks and Kagero blushes before complying, because of the upgrade her bust had Morgan was quite literally buried in sexy ninja tit flesh. But he didn't care, he was warm, he could hear Kagero's heart lull him to sleep and the woman's scent was positively divine. He had no trouble falling asleep in his position, as he hoped to do always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Next morning</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan awakens, having found that he'd sunk through Kagero's cleavage until he was resting against her breastbone, unfortunately with a rather aggressive case of morning wood, something that didn't normally happen to him as he usually woke up next to family, though maybe because Kagero was even bustier than anyone he knew may not have helped. Still he'd prefer her not know about this just yet, for fear of being labelled a pervert, so decided to just deal with it. This meant taking himself in one hand then fondle her tit with the other, rubbing his face along the big bouncy flesh wall that just as he thought helped him get off quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him his movements got the attention of his future wife, who with a little effort pulled him from her cleavage and sat up to look at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good morning Morgan'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morning Kagero, looking lovely as ever' Morgan grins widely as Kagero giggles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Such a charmer, aren't you' she says and it was Morgan's turn to blush 'What to do today, what to do?' Kagero wonders, to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had the day off so technically she could stay in her room all day and play with Morgan, on the other hand she could go see her friends, maybe introduce them to Morgan too?</span></div></div>",

While a little jostled the bluenette was fine until they reached their final destination<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello everyone' Kagero greets condially as usual, getting eye rolls from her oldest and newest friends, while the other princesses have simple gotten used to her mannerisms. It was after a slight double take she was dragged over to their table by a very enthusiastic diviner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kagero my friend, where was all this love hidden? You always wore skin tight clothes so there must be something you're doing' Orochi purrs, the (even previously) busty ninja blushes but reaches into her pack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's a recent development because of a friend of mine, everyone I want you to meet my newest friend Morgan, Morgan these are my friends Orochi, Princesses Hinoka, Corrin and Sakura of Hoshido' she introduces each girl in turn who nod and wave at the little boy. Morgan was polite but none appealed to him the same way Kagero did when they met, some of them appealed but he wasn't giving up on his prize. It was then he remembered his aunt Aversa joking about him being such a chick magnet he'd have a harem when he was older and smirked, these girls had potential, they just needed a little extra all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This guy made you bigger, but he's so small. is it a special kind of magic?' Corrin asks curiously, she wanted to know how the little guy made Kagero even sexier than Camilla, and if he could show her so she could do the same to herself and her girlfriend, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know a recipe for special cookies, ones that only add fat to the correct areas' Morgan admits, hoping Kagero wouldn't hate him for intentionally busting her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh he is definitely making some of everyone within the week' Orochi states and Kagero knows she'll find a way, she also knows by EVERYONE she does mean all the girls princess Corrin had interacted with in her travels (This is an everybody lives version of Revelations, so everyone's happy :D. Basically if they were a teammate in any game they're alive and still friendly with Corrin and the others). She hoped they had enough mix and Morgan had enough baking magic to make that many Gourmet cookies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't mind, in my mom's culture busty women are more powerful and respected, probably because of said power'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is it political power or just general power, because if it's the former I think we should crown Kagero Vinsmoke (It's the one visible eye paired with being a badass) Queen of all 3 kindoms right now' Hinoka jokes with a smirk Kagero rarely sees, Morgan seems to just exude calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's more magical power due to a high mage population, but the better magic probably helped their political power and the respect' Morgan explained as best he could but he'd never really asked for an explanation, just understood busty women are well liked in Plegia, hense why Aversa was their Queen, until Kagero post cookies she'd been the biggest woman Morgan had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then sign me up' Hinoka grins widely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Same' Corrin cheered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I won't say no' Sakura smiles lightly, a deep blush on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... what next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group laughed and chatted for quite a while before Morgan finally asked if they wanted him to make them the cookies, Hinoka actually grabbing him from Kagero's hands in her haste to finally have noticeable breasts, her sisters chuckle before following much more sedately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's bitch, stealing my Morgan' Kagero mutters through clenched teeth, almost ignoring the faint chuckles behind her. Turning she sees Orochi having the time of her life if the shit eating grin is anything to go on 'What's so funny?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've really fallen for the boy haven't you?' she asks curiously, not wanting to step on any toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero sighs and looks into her cleavage, mostly because she can't see her feet with her new assets 'I think so, he's just so cute and loveable how can you not fall for him?' she wonders aloud, unaware there were others thinking the exact same thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the 2 had gotten to the royal kitchen Morgan was already hard at work and the princesses were trying to keep out of his way, for the moment he was only making treats for the girls he knew, plus another for Kagero because he loved them BIG, and Kagero deserved to be the biggest in all the lands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey you're here, great I'm almost done we just need to wait for them to cook' Morgan explains, having done this enough times he barely had to even think about where he was directing his magic, he had made 5 for each so they should have a nice addition without going overboard in the first go, considering how eager some of these girls were he'd rather not see their intimate zones on his first day meeting them, hell he hadn't seen Kagero's intimate zone yet and he met her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiting was actually the hardest part both for Morgan and the girls, he wanted to see their new looks and they wanted to be ultra sexy like Kagero was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the oven dinged and Morgan divided out all the cookies, only Kagero knowing they were receiving a lot less than the ninja had been given previously, but she wasn't going to complain anytime soon, especially when she was getting more from her little one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot counting Kagero out of the group only Corrin and Orochi had a figure that could be considered '<i>busty</i>', the diviner more than the dragon princess, while the others were much less gifted: Hinoka due to her exercise regime didn't actually accumulate enough fat to expand her assets, while Sakura can actually just be attributed to age, being the youngest she had quite the petite frame, actually quite similar to Elise in that regard, though much more emotionally mature than the blond Nohrian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the cookies Hinoka was proudly sporting a firm handful on her chest, with Sakura blushing at the cleavage her own growth had caused her torn dress to reveal. Corrin's chest had filled quite nicely in Morgan's opinion, rivally his mom's and with her white hair she actually reminded him of her... making him glad she already had a girlfriend or things would be awkward. Orochi held onto her title as bustiest of the new gals by bouncing a pair of knockers equal in size and plumpness to Aversa's with an ass to match, shaking it in Corrin's direction in an attempt to entice the dragon, her deep crimson blush showing it was at least a partial success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this paled in comparison to Kagero though as Morgan had hoped. But then again when you manage to fill her bosom to the point the only thing he'd ever seen with assets this big was a statue of the Goddess Grima, there is nowhere else for you to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Morgan got to experience just how thankful the girls were first hand a few moments later, if he were anyone else, or a least not himself he'd probably be overwhelmed by the amount of breast flesh he found himself pressed against, including accidentally sliding into Sakura's cleavage and not so accidentally dropped into Orochi's, as well as being rubbed against her butt so he could 'fully experience what he helped create' before he was snatched away by a jealous and blushing Kagero, the diviner winks and sticks out her tongue teasingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Morgan turned around in awe as he saw the sky was black, a thunder storm and swirling dark clouds. They both saw something slowly descend from the sky and landed in front of them. Morgan was surprised to see it was a woman who looked just like his mother, but bigger, much bigger. She had white hair and red eyes, but she was a whopping ten feet tall with massive breasts and huge butt. As well, like Kagero sported a potbelly. <b>\u201cI am the wings of despair. I am the breath of ruin. I am the fell dragon, Grima.\u201d</b> The massive women stated in a terrifying but beautiful voice. Morgan was baking in fear. \u201cW-w-w-what you do want G-g-g-Grima?\u201d Morgan stuttered, Kagero didn\u2019t really know what was going on but decided it would be best if she stayed silent. Before Grima replied she started coughing and hacking into left her arm rather loudly. \u201cSorry, about that I recently had a cold, and when I have cold it\u2019s not really pretty. Anyway back to business; \u201cYOU!l\u201d Grima shouted pointing at Kagero who turned her head right and left rapidly before looking at Grima and pointing at herself. \u201cMe?\u201d \u201cYes, you, you\u2019re way to big for a mortal woman.\u201d Grima stated and Morgan noticed something important, while in outright size Grima was obviously bigger but proportion wise they were the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was really worried that Grima was going to do something to hurt Kagero, however what is it that Grima does?</span></div></div>",

All of the royals were in the dungeon helpless to stop Kagero. Kagero had forgotten about Morgan who was still in his magic induced coma. Eventually Kagero became unsatisfied with what she had. She wanted to conquer more places. She then realized that since Valla was separated from the other countries there could be more worlds out there. Kagero thought of way to gain access to other worlds. She took the divine weapons which were now floating in front of her. She snapped her fingers and Siegfried and Rajinto disappeared. The omega yato glowed for a bit before it reverted back to Alpha yato. Kagero snapped her fingers again, Fujin Yumi and Brynhyldir disappeared. Alpha yato went back to the original form. And with a flick of her wrist yato was gone.

Roses shield and your light, was the only reason we lived, the diamonds thought we were dead, not wanting to attract anymore attention Rose gave the order to hide until the signal was given, this happened after you faded from using too much power. However Light Blue thought we could still stop the diamonds, so while I left to the distortion realm Light Blue and the others fought against homeworld, they couldn\u2019t kill the legends but have them imprisoned on several different colonies. I was unaware of this but several years later I got tired of waiting for the signal and fought against the diamonds a I had grown stronger, unfortunately they were too strong but not enough to kill me which is how I ended up here.

A massive multi colored building with several guards posted around it. \u201cDang, with how big it is, everybody else has to be in there.\u201d Prism whistled, \u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s not the case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism and Platinum yelped at the sudden voice. They turned to see a sapphire with whitish hair and semi-dark blue skin, dressed in ninja clothes, which covered up his left eye, that is if he had left eye in the first place as sapphires are Cyclopes. \u201cK\u014drimizu! How did you get out!\u201d Platinum exclaimed happily to the sapphire attempting hug, but not getting it. \u201cI used a water clone making them think they had captured me, I hijacked a ship and that\u2019s how I got here, but I\u2019ve been stuck here for centuries.\u201d The Sapphire explained with a sigh. \u201cWait, did you say for centuries?\u201d Prism asked \u201cYes, I\u2019m not dumb enough to attempt a rescue mission by myself so by using my future vision I thought about what I want and I did all the things necessary to get what I want. Oh yes almost forgot, Platinum I\u2019m going to need you to place some adhesive shadow serum right about here.\u201d K\u014drimizu said pointing on the ground a couple of feet away from where Prism was standing. \u201cWhy th-\u201c Platinum was cut off because the Sapphire was giving a death stare \u201cOkay Okay no need to get in a hissy fit.\u201d Platinum said walking over to the spot the cyclops referred him to. Platinum dispensed a black liquid from the red tip of one of his membranes. \u201cThere, now why is it that you needed me to do-<b>WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IS HAPPENING!?\u201d</b> Platinum yelled and for good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight where Platinum applied the adhesive a light blue gem with darker blue hair wearing princely clothes blurred into existence appearing in pain, having empty eyes. \u201cNononono, no more.\u201d The blue gem panted before screaming once more blurring out of existence, except he stayed where he was. \u201cIs that, Light Blue?\u201d Prism asked. K\u014drimizu walked over to gem. \u201cI see\u201d was all that the stealthy gem said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Platinum asked to the fellow legend. \u201cWell it\u2019s quite obvious, his gem is cracked.\u201d The sapphire said lifting up the injured gems right arm showing the cracked adamant orb in the middle of his forearm. \u201cA simple thing to fix really, as long as you have the right stuff, which I do have.\u201d K\u014drimizu places his other hand on the cracked gem, muttered something quietly a small ring of blue energy appeared around the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue gem changed his eyes no longer empty but now blue with diamond shape pupils. The smallest but fastest of the diamond authority: Light Blue Diamond. \u201cThank you K\u014drimizu, when the other finds diamonds tried to have me shattered all it ended up doing cracking my gem and my time powers were on the fritz, sending me to different times and worlds but only for a little amount of time before I would disappear again. I\u2019m sorry you guys, I went against Roses orders and it ended terribly for us, if we manage to get back to base, I\u2019ll resign as second of command.\u201d Light Blue said his head drooping. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019ll be necessary.\u201d Prism said, Light Blue looked up seeing that the three other gems were smiling. \u201cEvery leader makes mistakes, because you admitted them that makes you better than the other Diamonds. Besides while Rose Quartz is the leader of the Crystal Gems, you shall always be our diamond.\u201d Platinum said, he and the other two gems salute to the now crying diamond who hugged the three. \u201cYou have no idea how much I needed to hear that\u201d Diamond let go spreading out. \u201cSo tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it was explained K\u014drimizu talked about the other imprisoned legends. \u201cImprisoned here is Obsidian and Hinokoku. Gold and Sunstone are kept together on another colony. Moonstone and Shinju are imprisoned togehter, that\u2019s where I originally was but I as unaware of it until I was off planet. Emerald will be the most difficult as he is located somewhere near Pink Diamonds human zoo, which is now owned by Blue Diamond.\u201d The Sapphire explained to the other gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent some Gianni good and right fore these off to the prison K\u014drimizu took Light Blue aside \u201cIt will take time for you to completely heal, so don\u2019t use any time powers until that ring disappears.\u201d \u201cSure thing doctor.\u201d Light Blue joked before walking towards the others. \u201cI am Ninja not a doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for this I recommend listening the song that plays at the one minute this great video <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xbzDXYeQyw0\" target=\"_blank\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xbzDXYeQyw...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey snuck into the building, Light Blue and Prism taking one side while Platinum and K\u014drimizu took the other. \u201cWhy do we have to stick with stealth, these are regular gems not freaking diamonds.\u201dPlatinum quietly complained as they snuck by multiple gems, Platinum using portals while the sapphire stuck to regular ninja stealth.\u201dHey intruders!\u201d A large quartz said running towards the two. \u201cYou and your big mouth.\u201d The cyclops said summoning his weapon, a katana from the blue orb on the side of his hip. He disappeared in a flash then reappeared on the other side of the quartz who poofed. \u201cAli opp.\u201d Platinum said running after the sapphire, grabbing the gem and bubbling it, the gem disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued, K\u014drimizu throwing shurikens of water and ice while Platinum used his membranes bashing and impaling enemies. \u201cStand down, we\u2019ve got you outnumbered!\u201d An agot said with several gems in front of her. \u201cOutnumbered means nothing to me.\u201d K\u014drimizu said and did several hand gestures rapidly. <i><b>\u201dOrigin Pulse\u201d</b></i> several blue orbs appeared behind K\u014drimizu and were fired at the enemies, proofing all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b>At The Temple in Beach City</b></i></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou see guys this is really weird a whole bunch of bubbles keep on appearing and they look different from all the others.\u201d Steven said pointing at the new bubbles in the bubble room. \u201cGarnet, is this what I think it is?\u201d Pearl asked to the fusion. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s very much possible, if that is the case we need to come up with an explanation.\u201d Garnet said \u201cWait what are you guys talking about?\u201d Steven asked \u201cSteven let us tell you a story about some of the other crystal gems.\u201d Pearl said before she began an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike with K\u014drimizu and Platinum, Prism and Light Blue decided to just poof any one who came their way.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you say that sword just appeared in front of you?\u201d The diamond asked as he sliced several gems with his weapon: a rapier. \u201cYep, the cool thing is that well see for yourself.\u201d Prism pointed Siegfried and it fired a straight dark laser which went through multiple gems. Prism through the sword in the air <b>\u201dPhoton Geyser!\u201d</b> and launched a ball of light which exploded hitting several gems. Diamond extended his left arm and fired flash cannon out of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have you surrounded\u201d A higher ranking gem said. \u201cShould I use Prismatic Laser?\u201d Prism asked quietly. Light blue looked down and saw that ring around his gem was gone and grinned.\u201dI don\u2019t think that will be necessary. <i><b>\u201dAuslaf\u201d</b></i> Time slowed down for everyone but Light Blue Diamond. Sure Light Blue could of frozen time but he wanted to start out with something simple since his powers just returned. He proceeded to stab all of the enemy gems in the chest and ran out. He explored the entire prison uninterrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis must be where Obsidian and Hinokoku are kept.\u201d Blue said, there were two boxes, one was covered in insulators while the other one was in a tank of water. Light Blue got the two boxes out, grabbed his allies and left the prison. <i><b>\u201dReturn\u201d</b></i> Time went back to its normal speed. \u201cI believe it\u2019s about <u>time</u> to leave, Platinum, a portal please?\u201d \u201cYes my diamond\u201d Platinum said with a grin and opened a portal, the gems entering it to rescue their allies</span></div></div>",

It growled at Light blue before firing an energy beam which the diamond quickly dodged, just before he summoned his weapon a loud shriek brought him to his knees, luckily it seemed to also incapacitate the other crystalline being<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Toph no, the gem is not to be harmed' came a female voice, causing Light Blue to turn to it's source. There in the hallway were 2 newcomers, first being a creature that looked to be a mix of a bat and dragon, and the other light blue thought to be human... or at least as human as a gem given her strange metallic silver/grey eyes 'The boss is not here, he is out causing mayhem as usual. The castle as been empty for a while, so she has taken up residence. She is waiting for you, in the throne room as we have come to call it' she smiles but her expression looks off in ways light blue couldn't really explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, who are you, how did you know I'd be here?' the youngest diamond asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sapphires aren't the only seers, Alice and Mai are quite accomplished, even if the waves of Kaos often throw off their readings slightly. And for the record, my name is Tardis' the women now known as Tardis flashes a more genuine smile before walking away, Toph scuttling back into her hole like a crab and the dragon/bat thing flying off, with Light Blue running after the lady<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Blue couldn't see it but Tardis was getting an almost obscene level of pleasure listening to him curse out Kaos for putting so many stairs in between where he'd been attacked and the top of the tower, which was why she hadn't even offered to teleport them. Finally they reached and the entity pushes open the door to let him through, though doesn't go in herself. When he enters he is forced to stop when he sees a large diamond cut jewel suspended in a think black goo, the gem releasing an energy pulse before releasing itself from it's holding material. The gem who formed from the diamond was tall and thin, her namesake embedded in her throat and dressed in rather high quality looking materials, though clearly emulating some of the other diamonds as she had the shoulder pads favoured by Yellow and Pink. Her eyes were black, well the iris was with the pupil invisible due to no clear boundary between the two, as well as silvery grey sclera. Her skin unlike other gems was a different colour to the rest of her body, a pale white colour almost making him think of a pearl, but he guessed with gems being shapeshifters she just felt like changing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello little one, didn't think they made diamonds your size' she purrs with a smoky tone that sent a shiver through his gem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're not much bigger than me' was unfortunately all he could say as a come back, but her chuckle showed he amused her rather than annoyed her with his comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True, but that's because Prime made me able to compress my gem, enabling me to hide when inactive, such as on a ring perhaps' she grins as an ornate looking ring formed on her right hand, clearly missing it's gem 'Due to what I am I can reach the size of the others, I just prefer not to, make fusion easier too' she chuckles before willing the ring to fade away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Blue swallows 'So it's true then, that you were made by killing the other diamonds. Will you be killing me too?' he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBD actually looks confused 'I bear no hatred for any of the diamonds, in fact I expressed indifference to Yellow and Blue the last time I met any version of them. They were amused if nothing else. Honestly I'm just glad White was a separate entity when the diamonds pissed off Kaos' she mutters to which light blue asks for clarity 'The boss was passing through Homeworld space, managed to piss off the diamonds and they tried to kill him. They failed and he shattered them, getting the idea to make a diamond of his own. He made me but the 3 diamonds clearly weren't meant to join like that and Triad was unstable. Luckily the part that was yellow was still able to access the database and we found Pink on some backwater planet with early humans running around throwing spears at each other. Shattering her was my field test, and my reward was a shard of her broken gem, the 4 parts mixed with his blood and a fragment of his soul to make me; the Black Diamond. As for the other comment, the last world I was in White diamond is a fusion of the other 3, the highest proof of the diamonds unity and authority. Kind of a 3 eyed bunt, but I can't judge as I can be one too' she smirks and pulls a khopesh from her gem, her eyes flash and Light Blue seems a ring of pink form in each eye, revealing her to have diamond pupils just before a portal opens and her shield block's Platinum's tentacles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The hell?' LB yelps as BD smirks and bashes the shield into Platinum's face, sending him flying into the wall, before lightning strikes him head on causing an instant poof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seems your friend was worried about you, but fighting me was stupid' Black diamond muses, dispelling her shield but not before Blue saw it's design. Like her clothes it was more ornate than the one used by Pink Diamond, with the gem in its centre surrounded by an eye, serpents spiralling out from where he expected compass points to be. He'd seen that symbol before, it was all the proof he needed to believe her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Help us...'

He closed his eyes and cleared his thoughts unaware the Black Diamond was now taller than the other diamonds. \u2018Dialga please lend me your power if just for a little while, I know that the price of my ability means they won\u2019t be useful against other diamonds but just this once give me enough time to escape.\u2019 Light Blue said and when he opened his eyes everything was frozen in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Blue Diamond knew he had about 20 or so minutes before time started flowing again. Blue couldn\u2019t create portals so he had to wait for Platinum to reform so he could leave. So what Diamond did was look at Black Diamond. He had to admit she was beautiful. He even noticed that her mouth was open. \u2018If I wanted to I could go in and crawl into her stoma-\u2019 \u201cNO STOP IT!\u201d Blue interrupted his own smacking his face, blushing. He kept on looking at Black Diamond walking around her in circles admiring the bigger diamond. He knew how gems could change their form so his mind started to wander again imagining a thicc Black Diamond, and then an extra thicc black diamond, then extra extra t- \u201cGet your mind out of the gutter blue!\u201d Light Blue started smacking his face multiple times, blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes Platinum\u2019s gem started glowing and he went back to normal. \u201cGet away from him you Bi-\u201d Platinum started to yell but Light Blue slapped him in the face, gently. \u201cDude, you attacked her first.\u201d Light Blue said to the taller gem. \u201cYou were gone for quite a while I was getting worried.\u201d Platinum said rubbing the back of his head embarrassed. \u201cThe reason for that was because someone decided to give this place way too many stairs.\u201d Diamond complained and noticed Platinum\u2019s eyes were widened. \u201cBlue, what\u2019s wrong with tall, dark and angry?\u201d Platinum asked pointing to the frozen diamond. \u201cI had to ask Dialga for help, probably won\u2019t be able to my stronger time magic for a while in return.\u201d He explained to the blond gem. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get out of here before time goes back to normal.\u201d Platinum created a portal and left. Rather than following him; Light Blue turned around and jumped up to Black Diamonds face. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll meet again under better circumstances.\u201d Light Blue whispered and gently kissed Black Diamond\u2019s cheek and jumped into the portal before Platinum noticed anything. Unknown to Light Blue his kiss left a blue mark on the massive diamonds face (Like those lipstick marks you see on cartoons, not that Light Blue was wearing any lipstick in the first place).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Blue was surprised to see that the gems they haven\u2019t rescued yet were now present with the exception of Emerald. \u201cHey Blue, when we noticed that you froze time we thought, \u2018hey lets go rescue some of the others while Blue\u2019s doing whatever the heck he\u2019s doing\u2019.\u201d Prism said with a wide grin. \u201cI didn\u2019t get poof anybody.\u201d Obsidian complained, he had dark gray skin and black hair, his gem covered his right eye but you could still it (sort of like Flygon\u2019s eyes), his weapon were dual falchions (not the fire emblem kind, I\u2019m talking about the curved pirate ones) and was dressed in black (imagine what hook wears in Once). \u201cWell, I\u2019ve discovered that we may have to deal with something worse than the diamonds but first we\u2019re going to have to save Emerald before we plan for that.\u201d Diamond said and his fellow gems cheered eager to save their remaining ally.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The plan was that when Blue Diamond was off to visit yellow light Blue would freeze time in the area. Thanks to K\u014drimizu and his future vision they discovered that Emeralds exact location was underneath the lake in the human zoo. Moonstone, who had a weapon that had four forms based on the phases of the moon, would be in charge of removing the water so that Hinokoku would be able to get out Emerald (Hinokoku\u2019s weapon was a kid Icarus arm that looked like the tail of a groudon). In case the time freeze didn\u2019t last long enough K\u014drimizu\u2019s ice clones would freeze them while Shinju and Platinum would take out any stragglers. Shinju had light pink hair and was dressed like a butler with his weapon being a kid Icarus now. Gold, Sunstone and Prism would be on the lookout in case any ships attempted to land. Sunstone had white hair and his weapon was a suit armor (look up solgaleomon and you\u2019ll see what it looks like) Gold was dressed like a cowboy but didn\u2019t have a southern accent and oddly enough had two weapons: a pickax and a boomerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went according to plan, Moonstone created a mini moon and removed the water while Hinokoku smashed the ground open and pulled out Emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the interesting thing about Emerald is that he was the first gem hybrid. The story was that white diamond proposed an experiment of what would happen if you grew multiple gems in the same hole would it form one giant gem? Unfortunately it didn\u2019t create a giant gem but one mute gem with blank eyes. He was shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it turned out that this gem was immune to shattering or more specifically he still lives after it. Emeralds body was his gem, and had access to a variety of weapons including but not limited too: a battle axe, dual pistols and a kid Icarus cannon that looked like a freaking raquaza. Now the last weapon appeared once Emerald became a protective skin to a human baby named Reginald, they swapped names, the gem being Reginald while Emerald was the boy who dressed like an rpg their, had spiky hair green tint to his skin when merged with Reginald whom he could communicate with mentally. This resulted in emerald being immortal when merged with Reginald however he did require sleep. When not merged with Reginald emerald wielded two blades that looked like the disks of mega rayquaza and could use wind magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now</span></div></div>",

Finally she collapses forward, panting slightly as her cheek cools on the grass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well she's done cooking, let's see what she is' Grima grins before removing a plate of marble, which begins to erupt into colour when she pushes a little magic into it 'My, my'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?' Morgan asks worried about his lover<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'May I introduce you little human to Vinsmoke Kagero, goddess of fertility and the harvest' Grima announces and reveals the image to the 2: It was clearly Kagero, wearing a thin dress which exposed an acre of breast and cleavage, a hole cut into the midsection to show off her rounded stomach and near see-through leggings to showcase her massive ass cheeks. Beside her head was a small Morgan flashing the peace sign with a large grin on his face, while all around her are people, either in worship, pregnant, impregnating or farming, all under the sultry gaze of their goddess. The eye now on the middle of her back was contained within the sun in this image, the blood red sygil stark against the pale yellow sun. (For the record the eye is the symbol of the Sheikah tribe, even being the same colour)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my' Kagero gasps, before information floods into her skull, her eyes opening widely as her powers were explained to her: she now as her title stated had control over fertility, of both plants, animals and even people, she produces pheromones that affect the cycles of beings around her, can give herself or another believer the needed equipment for breeding, increase or decrease the size of their assets by holding them, cause the chance of impregnation to skyrocket or wither away with simply a touch, same with the ground she walked on. All she needed was food and sex, preferably/mostly the feminine kind as Morgan was the only man she had any feelings for and she couldn't put satisfying a goddess on his petite shoulders alone. 'This is incredible' she says with a grin, then picks Morgan up to nuzzle him, which he greedily recipricated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrima smiles widely, glad to see the Demon's fruit did it's job, as well as something else she can rub Naga's nose in, she made a God 'Well you look to be having a good time, don't mind me' she chuckles before with a click of her long fingers her body dissolves into mist, not that the 2 noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I want to spread my influence, make this world worship me like it used to the dragons. I want you to be my high priests and I'll grant you anything you desire as my reward for this undertaking and agreement to assist me, consider it a blessing from the Goddess so to speak' she explains, not even having to ask before Orochi replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You! I want you. The little one would be a nice addition but you are the most important thing I want more than anything else in the world' she admits, the words tumbling out of her mouth with much less grace than usual, causing Kagero to chuckle, a barely hidden Morgan to grin as his arousal grows and the former ninja to pull Orochi into a much more chaste kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So you wish to share my bed darling?' she asks, getting a quick nod from her oldest friend 'Then so be it' she cups both cheeks and the purplete winces as Kagero's mark forms in the centre of her forehead, proudly showing her positon as a follower of Kagero, as well as an increase of a cup size when her hands pass by those melons of hers 'Now, who's next?' she asks, pretending not to notice the mage fall to her knees and nuzzle her inner thighs, until she runs her fingers through her hair and get a surprisingly loud purr from the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the one to take the plunge next, and why/what do they want as their blessing from Kagero?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Corrin, who asks to be made a futanari so she can have a child with her girlfriend that is both theirs by blood<br>\r\n2 Sakura, who asks to be altered to have a body more suited for an ecchi/hentai than FE, wanting to not fade into the background any more.</span></div></div>",

You already do have a big butt and big breasts but I want to see you to become an ultra soft mountain.\u201d Morgan said with a blush in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good I think the both of you can be willing to do what the other wishes but I think it would be best to start with (names) request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho goes first?</span></div></div>",

Orochi grins, licking her lips as she peeks over at the little bluenette 'Then let's begin' she yells, picking up Morgan and rushing off into the kitchen for him to prepare some sweet treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was happy Kagero picked him to get his wish granted first, not only because he got to fatten up his goddess's high priestess, but also because like she said it would make it easier for her to get her request granted, that being him worshiping her as well. Now he already knew Orochi was beautiful, a being worthy of worship on her own, but he felt she needed a little extra, it was just how he was raised, powerful Plegian women were large in all ways, as well as gifted in most kinds of magic. Orochi was a powerful mage, he was just trying to get her body to catch up with her core. Plus he knew he'd find her much more attractive if she were a soft squishy mountain of sexiness, again it was just something in his Plegian blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhistling as he works his way through his latest treats Morgan tries to focus on his work rather than fantasizing about the 2 sexy ladies he's found himself bound to, knowing if he's distracted things may not work out how he'd planned. Luckily Kagero seemed to be aware of this, could you call it a problem? Flaw? Eh oh well, and kept both herself and Orochi away from the bluenette's work. Once he had cooked a huge pile of cookies, he yelled out for them to come in, Orochi bouncing in while Kagero follows her in at a much more sedate pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tada! Here we go Orochi' Morgan cheers, pushing the plate over to the purple haired woman, grinning widely as she begins to munch away with reckless abandon, Kagero chuckling at seeing her friend stuffing her face, apparently impatient to get big so Morgan will love her the same as she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what effect do the cookies have on Orochi, or more by how much?</span></div></div>",

While Morgan was a very social person every morning he would take a walk in the morning so he could get in his alone time. Luckily for Morgan the garden was arranged in a way so Morgan could a have clear path to walk through without being accidentally stepped on (although he would be fine because his durability was strong enough to make it so the harsh environment of the stomach is just a cozy place to relax.) At the end of the pathway Morgan would walk there would be someone to pick him up (literally, heh jokes) and take him to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later Robin was in the courtyard walking to where Morgan's walk would start when she passed by Lucina. \"Good morning mother, I just dropped Morgan off for his morning walk and I was going to go hang out with Severa for a bit.\" Lucina explained not noticing her tiny father tucked away. \"Thanks for the information Luci, I'll see you later.\" Robin said her and her daughter going past each other. When Lucina had discovered she would be a big sister she was ecstatic. When she found she saw little baby Morgan for the first time she was more excited then when she was first told she was next in line for the throne and wished to be the best big sister she could be. Although Lucina was very protective of Morgan sometimes crossing into overprotective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had reached the garden and easily spotted Morgan despite being tiny (the fact that she's a tactician and being his mother does help with that) \"Oh Morgan there is someone who wants to see you.\" Robin said kneeling down in front of Morgan who turned around. \"Who is it mom?\" Morgan asked confused as normally his mother knew to respect his wish to be alone for his morning walk. Robin grinned before grabbing Chrom from her robes and setting him down before Morgan. \"D-d-dad you shrunk!?\" Morgan exclaimed running over to Chrom. Robin chuckled before answering \"Well I noticed that you and your father spend very little time (which was a major understatement as Chrom has only touched Morgan a total of five times in his life) together so I shrunk him so you two could spend some time together, now I'll let my boy have some privacy, I'll see you two later.\" Robin said getting up and leaving her husband and son alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan hugged his father tightly for about five minutes before letting go. \"Sorry about that Dad I just want to give you a hug.\" Morgan apologized Chrom laughing a bit and ruffling his hair. \"Its fine kiddo, now should be the best time to get started before girls start fighting over you.\" Chrom joked before he and Morgan walked onto the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes everything go fine or go down to crap? </span></div></div>",

As the the duo continued walking Chrom decided to ask Morgan a question. \"Do you ever wish you were born normal sized?\" Morgan stopped and was quiet for a second, Chrom hoping he didn't trigger something until Morgan laughed. \"Of course I do but I know not focus on it too much, it is what it is. Mom once tried to use a spell to make me normal sized but it just simply bounced right back onto to her making her into a giant. Sure I have to give up on achieving some of my dreams such as playing piano and cooking but on the bright side I've been told I'm amazing at giving massages and singing. Despite not being able to survive without having someone to help me out I still appreciate all that has been given to me.\" Morgan explained to Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A bit later down the path Morgan decided to speak up. \"Hey, Dad, can I tell you a secret?\" Morgan asked turning his head to his father. \"Sure\" \"I'm gay\" \"Wait what!?!?\" Chrom shouted but Morgan started laughing like a maniac. \"Finally the first time I use that joke and it works!\" Morgan said laughing crazily.  So your not gay?\" \"Nope I'm as straight as you, I just wanted to see if using that joke on you would work. When I tried on Mom she saw right through it and just told me I wasn't. Same hung happened with Aunt Tharja and Aunt Aversa, then when I tried on Lucina, I kid you not she said 'You're gay too?' Boy was that awkward to explain I wasn't actually gay.\" Morgan explained to Chrom \"This is my actual secret.\" Morgan said opening his palm and an electric ball the size of his palm formed floating above his hand. \"You can use combat magic?\" Chrom asked he knew his son was capable of using healing magic without a staff but it was limited and could only heal small injuries. \"Yup, normal sized people can't feel it but it has helped those few times insects would try to eat me.\" Morgan said closing his palm the electric ball dissipating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Extending her magic out into the building she let it reach out for the others, giving them a subtle pull towards her, helped by the differences between their magic and those around them, none of her lovers were Plegian by birth but they all found the faith so to speak and worshiped the dragon goddess as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of apple tinged the smoke as her first arrival made herself known and Aversa wasn't surprised: Zelena was always the impatient one, a fiery red head with stormy grey eyes and a wicked temper, outside the Grimleal it's believed she could produce cyclones with a flick of her wrist, something which amused them as while her speciality was indeed wind magic even she wasn't that powerful (not that she let that information known to anyone). Aversa grins and kisses the smaller woman, palming her full bust and pinching her tight rear, glad her assets continue to grow with her magical strength like the others (well almost all the others)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle knock signalled the 2nd of Aversa's wives and the closest to her in age: Helena was almost Aversa's reverse (HA!) visually, with midnight coloured hair and pale skin. She also had a hefty bust compensating for her practically non-existent ass, or at least that was the joke amongst the group. She was calm and polite in public, but as much a demon as any Plegian when given the chance, her glasses flashed as she reached up to remove them, their prescience merely a reminder of her position as chief archivist within the Grimleal. She kissed both women on their cheeks before sitting in Zelena's lap with a smirk, knowing Aversa obviously wanted to tell them something important<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door being practically kicked in made the flier almost sigh but instead she laughed: Mara was blunt and didn't hold back because of feelings, 2 traits that caught Aversa's eye from the moment she met the young woman. The fact she had an arse that went on for days (balancing out her B cups most likely) probably helped, and Aversa was sure to show how much she appreciated her most recent bride with a hearty squeeze. 2 years already, she grins and the platinum blond sits beside her, one arm reaching behind her to place with the darker skinned mage's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well that's most of you, but ...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All present and accounted for' a voice called from nowhere, Mara falling off her perch while a startled Zelena tossed a wind blade in the voice's direction, it's owner dodging it almost playfully. Helena smiles and Aversa rolls her eyes. Kasumi was peculiar but what would you expect from an assassin trained by Nico Robin herself? Even within Aversa's group she as strange, C cups and a small rear, most of which was hidden in the dragonhide uniform she wore and the hood that obscured her face, not that the woman needed the hood, like the master she was an expert in shadow magic, as shown by her practically walking out of one and scaring the shite out of her lovers. Her purple painted lips curled into a rictus grin as she drops into Aversa's lap and steals her a kiss, as well as casually dropping about 5 knives and spikes from her sleeves. 'So what yah got for us?' she asks, knowing it had to be important for a summon rather than simply going looking for them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I had a mission for Validar, to kidnap an enemy combatant, which I did by shrinking him. With the mission success I was granted the little guy as my own, and yesterday I discovered his talents for massaging, I came so hard from him rubbing my ass and tits it was beyond words. So, seeing as I'm never getting rid of my little pet, I thought I'd share the love around to all my lovely ladies' she explains, shifting Kasumi to another of their group so she could stand and remove Morgan from her ass 'Girls meet Morgan, Morgan these are my girls, the harem of the High priestess: Zelena, Helena, Mara and Kasumi'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi' Morgan greets meekly, the others nod or wave in response<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So I presume a demonstration is in order?' the Dark Flier asks, getting a smirk from Helena and Kasumi while Zelena nods and Mara scoffs but her eyes say yes 'Excellent, now to figure out what you'll do first my little pet' she wonders as she gently strokes him, the others using their magic to change into something more comfortable, showing off their impressive assets for the lad to see<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which part of the girls will Morgan be massaging first today?</span></div></div>",

What he lacks in size and strength he makes up for in optimism and healing magic, I took it upon myself to look after him when you passed, I've never let him leave my sight.\" Lucina said, as the young boy quivered a bit before diving into Robin's expansive cleavage, Robin normally would've been pissed at having someone touch her boobs without permission but oddly she didn't feel any anger in fact it was rather pleasant to have her child cuddled up in her chest.

He's also quite the silver tongue when he wants to be, especially around those of the female variety, he can massage like any expert of the craft, his size making him able to deal with deep tension without pain, he's a brilliant musician, learnt to play the piano under the Soul King himself, melts the hearts of all who hear' she lists with a smile, Robin happy to hear the list but still confused about how he could seem himself so poorly with all this <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And lastly he is a brilliant magical chef, his cakes and cookies are positively divine' she half states, unsure if Robin would want to know the side effects of his treats: she didn't always have the goddess like rear she had now, Morgan's cakes did that, and similar effects were done to all the girls who ate his treats, given her size Robin probably wouldn't notice any kind of increase increase but the other girls would, luckily it didn't effect men, other than Yarne who's hair was now silky smooth and his finger and toe nails were sharpened claws... but the same happened to Nah so it was simply his magic affecting the beast rather than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anything else, anyone else?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well there is really only one other person who could help, who hated Morgan's horrid self image even more than I did: Noire. She got very angry when he was self deprecating about himself, to the point whenever she heard it she made him say something nice about himself or something good he could do, or else she'd have to get creative in his applications'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin didn't like the sound of that 'Such as?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Chew toy, lollipop, bra padding, bindings clip, cleavage pet, pendent, seat cushion, insole, foot toy, stress reliever... once she was having a bad day and after 20 seconds of silence she dropped him in her boot for 5 minutes'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's horrid. Those things can't be good for his already poor self esteem, how can you let that girl do such things?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina laughs 'Actually it works, before his memory loss Noire was very important to him, probably just below you and me and he never wants to disappoint her, even if he feels glad to please her in some way or another when she assigns him his '<i>task</i>' he knows he disappoints her when he doesn't give her an answer and tries his hardest not to be silent. Morgan doesn't like letting anyone down but this is something more' the bluenette shrugs 'Plus he's practically invulnerable so it's not like she would kill him even accidentally, she once joked about swallowing him and letting him massage her belly but never actually did. I'm just giving you your options Miss Robin, what you do with them is up to you' with that the 2 women left the tent, the older one now having even more on her mind rather than less<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does she do to help Morgan first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robin smiled before snapping her fingers causing Morgan to shrink to under an inch in height. \"Mother, do you need Morgan for something?\" Lucina asked picking up her miniscule brother and going over to Robin. \"Yes I do, thanks for helping him read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're we going mommy?\" Morgan asked buried in his mom's bosom. \"I'm going to have Tharja babysit you.\" \"Oh no, not the scary lady, Owain and Brady says she does super mean things to people.\" 'That explains that' Robin thought as she got to Tharja's door and walked straight in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tharja I have a special little gift for you.\" Robin said to the Dark mage who was alone in her room. Robin pulled out a shivering Morgan. \"Morgan I want you to be a good or Tharja, mommy will come and get you at bedtime unless Henry doesn't come back tonight from his special trip. Tharja try to be careful, Morgan's a little skittish.\" Robin said before leaving the room putting Morgan on Tharja's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little bud how about to start off your day with Auntie Tharja how about we....</span></div></div>",

Partly to escape and partly because it was routine he dodged her probing digits and slipped between her breasts, spreading out his arms and resting his head on her left breast to try hear her heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh there we go cutie, and that feels so nice, no wonder Robin says you're such a good cuddler' Tharja sighs contently while Morgan blushes and tries to hide a little deeper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not that great' he whispers but Tharja was a mage who enhanced herself so she still heard it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh silly boy, you're very special, your mother, sister and even my daughter won't stop talking about you. It made we want to spend a little time with you even more than I already did' the sorceress smiles sweetly down at him, at least his blush was fading<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're not like the other kids say you are' he says after some peaceful quiet, mostly of Morgan bouncing around with Tharja's breaths, but his statement did peak the mage's interest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really? What do the other kids say?' she asks, hoping whatever rumors the kids had heard or overheard from their parents it didn't affect they way they treated Noire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just stuff' Morgan gives his non-answer, causing the woman to sigh, not really expecting any information from him right off the bat but it was worth a shot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what next?</span></div></div>",

You can translate and I can transcribe it onto the 2nd scroll' Helena offers, Morgan pouts and rubs his chin, before nodding. Helena grins widely and Aversa gently plucks him from her cleavage and gently slips him into Helena's own bone white breasts (about a cup size larger than Aversa's, but her non-existent ass meant Aversa was still higher in the harem ranking) and sneaking out to work on her duties while the 2 chatted amicably while they worked together on Helena's current pile of ancient texts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Couple of days later]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAversa smiles as she hears the sounds of a violin being played and grins, she knew there was something for Morgan to bond with her wife, plus she hadn't heard him play since he came to Plegia a couple weeks earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aversa, who's that?' Morgan asks, peeking out to try find the source of the music<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's Zelena darling, her music was also what drew me to her.

Weaver had been quick to inform Aversa who made her prescience known almost imidiately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So ladies, what can I do for you today?' she asks as she steps out of the shadows, barely dodging an arrow that would have lodged itself in her brain from a skittish Noire 'Impressive' she drawls before turning back to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We wish to see Morgan, he's our friend and we miss him' Lucina states, Aversa having been around royals enough to know a poorly concealed demand when she hears one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Only if he's not busy and that he wants to see us' Noire adds, tilting her head slightly in respect, Nah remained silent but followed the snow haired girl in action... something the blunette failed to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAversa smiled internally, she was right about Morgan attracting a crowd, she just hadn't expected it to be this quickly, She could also tell the 3 all cared deeply for Morgan, though only Noire seemed fully on board with the thought of sharing the little tactician, she assumed Lucina simply wanted to steal him away from the EVIL Plegian witch and keep him as herself forever... while Nah was simply a dragon, they sometimes have difficulty sharing most things, but Aversa had high hopes for the mature girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sure he'd love to see you all, he should be in the shared quarters right about now' she turned and swayed to the tower, the 3 girls followed close behind. It was when a filthy moan was heard Aversa grins widely and she gets lightly shoved by the blunette princess, who flings open the door and her brain quite clearly short circuts. The edge of the sniper's lip curls when she reaches the doorway and Nah just raises and eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had revealed his skills at massage within the 1st 3 days she had been in their care, and he was once more using it to it's full advantage and Helena moans and croons on her back as Morgan gently rubs and squeezes her soft snow coloured bosom in his small hands, meanwhile Mara was passed out and drooling with her ass still in the air, and Zelena was curled up between her sister-wife's legs as if they were a cot. Kasumi was sitting in the corner, biting her lip and using a Den Den Mushi to record for future pranks and blackmail<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAversa doesn't want to ruin the moment but she had to 'Morgan darling, you have some friends looking for you' she says after getign his attention with a clearing of his throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looks up 'Who ... guys you're here!' Morgan cheers and bounces off of Helena and is swiftly picked up by Lucina who rubs him against her chubby cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes we are buddy, we miss seeing you around the palace, even dad smiles less and you know about him and his smiles' Noire replies, snatching Morgan back and resting him on her cleavage, the tactician grinning widely up at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey don't forget me' Nah pouts, one of the few traits she shares with her mother but Morgan makes her pout stop and her smile magically appear when he turns to her and smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I could never forget about you, you're my little dragon' he teases, getting a laugh from the girls, though Lucina's is strange and stilted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes they split for air, both hyperventilating, before Robin raises her hand to her cheek ''Marry me love'' Tharja squealed (she will deny it if anyone asks) and jumps into Robin's arms, attempting what an outsider would believe to be a appendectomy with her tongue</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was pulled out of her flashback by Tharja nudging her shoulder, they were heading to their current location because Laurent and Yarne (having Ricken for a dad comes in handy) said they could detect their kid's magic nearby, something that interestingly pleased both Lucina and Kjelle as much as it did Tharja and Robin, not that the future girls would tell them anything. When they reached the location they were immediately attacked by the criminals that made this place their base of operations, having been on high alert due to one of their captive's escaping not to long before the group's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior's Hammer shattered Robin's Levin sword, causing the women to be knocked onto her ass, Tharja running to get to her... when the man's head was pierced with a jet black arrow, causing him to burst into flames which consumed his entire body. Helping the Grandmaster to her feet, they both turned to find their rescuer, already dismissing the idea of Virion being the cause only because his arrows don't blow up/incinerate. They found a hooded woman, with white bangs and a chest at least 2 sizes larger than either than theirs (Tharja being the larger of the 2, which Robin enjoys as it means more for her to play with). They could see the lower half of her face so knew she had smiled at them, before turning and firing another arrow, Tharja noticing several runes along her bow glowing as she pulled back. The arrow hit it's target in the arm, but did it's secondary job of getting it's opponent's attention as she next yelled ''Nah catch!'' throwing what looked to be a silver dagger from beneath her cloak, the dragon catching it and giving it a twist, transforming it into a spear which the dragon girl was quick to shove through the man's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archer smirked at the kill, though this lull made her miss a moment, an arrow fired by a Bow knight barely missing her head but cutting her cheek and ripping her hood from her, revealing the shock of snow white hair. Her large purple eyes grew then turned black as she snarled and began to fire rapidly and wildly, incinerating the knights horse and then damaging their limbs before shooting them through the forehead. A snapping twig made her turn and shoot another arrow, glancing off Falchion as Lucina and Kjelle ran up to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Noire, wake up come on it's over. We need you to come back'' the girls pleaded as Noire stands staring them curiously before she staggers and the blackness leaves her eyes. The knight catches her before she falls as the bluenette leads them back to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well I didn't see Draco and the Black archer showing up in the battle coming'' Kjelle joked as the magical exhausted Sniper pulled herself closer to the teal haired girl, Lucina's only response was to sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let's hope we can weather the next storm'' she mutters confusing her friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh?'' her thoughts were interrupted by a worried Sorceress and Grandmaster who scooped Noire from her arms into their own<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh what have you done to yourself?'' Tharja asked, running her hand through hair so much like her wife's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Lilith came out again didn't she?'' Noire asked tiredly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes she did'' Lucina answered as Nah and Yarne came over and hugged the 19 year old<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Noire you're back'' They yelled in sync amusing the sniper who was now standing on her own<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I leave for a few days and you've already forgotten everything'' Noire jokes while Nah turns as red as her hair ''Hey, don't worry, it's why I keep spares'' she grinned and the dragon knew she wasn't angry and hugged her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well you certainly have them looking up to you'' Robin comments with pride <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yep, there are times I feel like Team mom, even though Luci's the eldest of us and the actual leader'' Noire joked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Can I come out now?'' came a small voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sure squirt, mother and mom are here...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mom's back!'' the voice was louder as a small black haired boy popped out from between Noire sizable rack shocking the non-time travellers <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh he's so cute''<br>\r\n''We'll have a baby boy'' Tharja tearing up as Robin tried to resist squeeing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, I'm not a baby, I'm 13'' Morgan pouted, but yelped when he was plucked from Noire's cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That you are love, you're a big boy indeed'' Lucina joked as she dropped Morgan into her own cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well that's Morgan's secret out of the way, how about yours?'' Kjelle asked with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Kjelle''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Shut up'' Noire hissed as she used the knight\u2019s shoulder guards to pull her towards her before her before wrapping her arms around her throat and shoving her tongue down her throat. When they release, Kjelle standing there with a goofy grin as Noire turns and pulls her parents into a hug, well as close as 3 women of their chest size can ''it's so good to see you again'' she whispers, Robin meeting Tharja's eyes over their daughter's head and both smile, before hugging her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what now?</span></div></div>",

I like to make music with my sister and cousin, bake, sweets and cakes in particular, give massages to the lovely ladies in my life and when I have spare time, I write. Yes my size in natural, you did all the research and it appears to be a side effect of making a Y with 2 X's' the black haired teen said with a wide grin on his face, all from his safe positon of Noire's cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My, what a skill set you have little buddy' Tharja whistles and Robin chuckles but lightly slaps her wife<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Play nice love. Though I do have a few questions, how do you bake and what do you mean cousin? Neither of us have siblings' Robin asks in confusion and her interest is peeked when Noire bites her lip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Actually' the sniper begins 'You do have a sister mom. The problem is that she's... Aversa. Also our cousin is Comic Century, her son as well as the child of the necromancer Comic Sans' Tharja gasps while Robin looks confused as all hell, besides the Aversa part she had no idea what anything else her eldest just said meant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, this family is just getting weirder' Tharja tries to joke but it feels flat 'What about you kid? Anything worth telling?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire smiles 'Well I'm Noire, 19 and have Kjelle wrapped around my bony fingers. My passions include archery, singing, painting and spellcrafting. I've also been keeping Morgan safe with my bosom for the last 8 years, as well as Drago and Lapis so I'm practically a mother of 3' Morgan chuckles at her nicknames for Nah and Yarne, knowing the shifters thought the same of his big sister being essentially their surrogate parent 'Also there's Lilith, the name Morgan gave my other half, caused by a bad reaction to my magic's shift in my teens. She's psychotic as well as sadomasochistic, not a good combo, only Morgan and Kejelle seem to be in the clear with her'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin frowns 'You've had a lot of pressure on those shoulders dearie' she hisses gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good thing Morgan's around to get the tension out from back there then' Noire jokes and Morgan grins widely, which was infectious as both Robin and Tharja follow suit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So it's getting late and we have a bed ready for you, we can talk more in the morning' Robin says before trying to swallow a yawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay then. Um, can Morgan stay with you tonight? Usually it's myself or Luci but given everything it would probably be best for him to stay with you 2' the archer offers him to their parents, who nod and Tharja picks him up and gently secures him in Robin's cleavage, smiling down at the big bright eyes peeking out from the Grandmaster's twin peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

My husband took a similar stand against his tyranny not long ago. The brute took a girl hostage and then cut my husband down as he lowered his weapon! *Sniff* I can't let her suffer the same fate...\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it took for Chrom to rush to the aid of this woman, though that pace was sped up even further when Lucina mentioned it sounded something one of her friends would do, Kjelle. Given the duo had already started picking baby names it was fairly obvious who they were on the lookout for so Robin hopped on the back of her wife's horse and the actually lead the charge, despite her <i>'squishy mage'</i> status, once an insult from the tomboyish great knight when she was still an unknown, now it was a term of affection, Robin was <b>'her squishy mage'</b> plus she did have the large and squishy Plegian T&amp;A so it fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the area it was fairly obvious who their target was, the woman in heavy armour with short white hair and a slightly crazed grin (All Plegians are a little crazy. Fact!) tearing through Cassius's forces with relative ease, though Robin still hopped off the horse's back to magi bolt a trickster before he could stab the younger ash haired woman in the back. The knight turns and her eyes widen for a moment before she gains a wide grin 'Mama!' she yelps, pulling the grandmaster (more a mage than a warrior though) into a hug, slightly crushing her against her heavy armour<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We found mom? Hey Kjelle you're squishing me again!'  a squeaky voice was heard from between them confusing Robin as Sully walks over, dismounting Rochinate before continuing the walk to her family<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What was that?' both Shepards ask, to which Kjelle smiles with a slight blush and reaches for the necklace mostly hidden by her armour and bust. Pulling it out she reveals a young boy with Sully's red hair smiling widely at the 2 of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mother, mama, this is Morgan my little brother' the knight teases as the boy rolls his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We, we made a minizora' Sully gasps, but turns when she sees Robin tense out the corner of her eye 'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You, you're okay with this?' she asks meekly Sully being able to tell it was worry rather than her own feelings for a little being their kid. The rider cups her slightly shorter wife's cheeks in her calloused hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Love, he's our precious child. I wouldn't care if he was a friking dragon, I'd be kind of confused but I'd still love him because he was ours' Sully confesses, blushing as these kind of things were not something she was good at, especially not with other people around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sniffles then smiles, wrapping her thin arms around Sully's waist 'I'm glad you see it, and I'm glad we make 2 lovely children in the future' she leans up slightly and kisses her lightly, getting the expected groan from all who saw<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seriously mom there are people who can see you' Kjelle whines and Morgan fake gags, but both their misty eyes show they're just happy to see their parent alive and well even if the cutesiness was a little much<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighs lightly before turning to the kids 'You're right, there are bigger things to deal with right now. You ready to deal with this bastard?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKjelle's grin is practically manic 'I'm good, Morgan even enchanted this spear so it'll cut straight through any magical shielding Cassius might have. Little bro's a savant for this crap' Morgan grins almost smugly at the compliment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Language' Sully scolds the younger knight grins before they march toward the sorcerer as a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out the enchantment worked perfectly, whatever magical barriers the man had set up that had him grinning like a smug twat the entire time was rendered useless for the few seconds her lasted after Kjelle's spear pierced his chest. Chrom was quick to recruit them both, mostly on Lucina's word but he had seen the girl fight and he'd been told of Morgan's skill with enchantment and rune crafting (turns out being small means you can be a lot more detailed with your symbol work).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what next? Do Sully and Robin pair off with a kid and get to know each individually, or do they spend time and learn about one another together as a family</span></div></div>",

Sully took Morgan while Robin had Kjelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Robin had went into Kjelle\u2019s tent she saw something that somewhat surprised her. \u201cStupid things, how is it even possible?\u201d Kjelle murmured to herself, Kjelle was incredibly muscular but her breasts and her butt weren\u2019t tainted and were pure doughy goodness. \u201cHi Kjelle\u201d Robin said shocking her oldest who fell onto her bed because she tripped on some armor. \u201cHi Mom\u201d Kjelle groaned Robin helping her up. \u201cI don\u2019t get it mom, I work out every single day and with maximum effort yet for some reason my butt and my chest are just big blobs of fat.\u201d Kjelle complained groping herself to demonstrate \u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t so big\u201d Kjelle mumbled Robin having a slight grin \u201cif we were in Plegia they\u2019d of put you in an insane asylum for saying that.\u201d Robin said with an amused tone \u201cHow would you know don\u2019t you have amnesia?\u201d Robin bit her lip, so it seems that Lucina had informed Kjelle of how Robin had amnesia (remember in the future kids timeline Robin didn\u2019t have amnesia)  \u201cTrue But Tharja had decided to teach about Plegia and its culture. Apparently the reason that muscle hasn\u2019t tainted your assets is because special bloodlines chosen by Grima are granted with large soft assets, so think of this as blessing rather than a curse.\u201d Robin said trying to comfort, Kjelle scoffing in response \u201cA blessing from the fell dragon who was killed everyone in the future, Yeah right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSully and Morgan<br>\r\nSully had Morgan in her cleavage, it was slightly weird in her opinion but it was somewhat pleasant. \u201cSo kid, you can do enchantments tell me more about that. \u201cWell you see I can enchant armor to make it so they can be stronger and with Kjelle\u2019s armor in particular can absorb magic that makes contact with it and make the armor even more stronger and have stronger resistance against the magic that was used against it, unfortunately there is only so much magic it can absorb so when it reaches overflow, an immense magical shockwave happens and basically kills everything! Also I can enchant weapons to either make them stronger or have special effects like Kjelle\u2019s spear piercing magical barriers. Unfortunately I can enchant magic weapons or specially crafted weapons like falchion, Lucina once asked me to try and enchant it but when I tried to do it, I ended up bursting into flames. That was not a good day.\u201d Morgan explained excitedly and shuddered at the last sentence, \u201cOkay that\u2019s pretty cool what about the runes?\u201d \u201cOh yes, well, they have a special effects, their are two kinds of runes, activation and dormant. Dormant require very little magic and you just have to have them on your person for them to work, unfortunately there is a limit for how many you can have on your person before all their magic cross over and cancel each other out. Activation requires more magic and have much more powerful effects some working like  spells, the stronger the rune, the more magic it requires the stronger the rune however runes don\u2019t require that much magic so anyone can use them but the really strong ones require an actual mage to use, however after you use an activation rune it requires time to recharge the stronger the rune the longer the recharge time. I also bake and managed to combine that with runes, I draw out the symbol in the dough and gave it bake, it works sort of like a dormant rune as all you have to do for it to work is eat it, it\u2019s effects are stronger than a dormant runes but the cookie runes stop working once their completely digested.\u201d Morgan explained Sully Turing to take in all that information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now</span></div></div>",

Chroms asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgie here figured out how to actually create what Cipher called <i>'sneak damage'</i>, a passive system that increases your power as long as you're stealthy' she explains 'And given despite being a walking tank Kellam is basically a ninja this plan is perfect for him. Where do you want it done?' she asks Morgan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'On the inside of his armoured shoulder pads, biggest solid piece that the array will fit on' Morgan answers as Noire begins spinning a jet black arrow head between her fingers before beginning work on the armour piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Morgan was working on a magical compensator for his moms to wear as pendants, using his own carving tools and some amber shards Lucina had been happy to get him. When one was finished he called the older woman over and asked her to put it on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now all we need is someone to use magic on you' Morgan says to no one in particular, meaning Tharja as happy to shoot a curse at her and watched the spell be absorbed into the shard as the runes glowed 'Ta Da, absorbs all hostile magic. he smiles brightly at the chance to work his craft openly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end (about 4 and a half hours later with Noire's assistance) he created intent based barrier arrays to attach to the mage's cloaks by carving them into their clasps, The warriors had a mix of power augmentation, magical absorption and even density modification and both Chrom &amp; Lucina were given a strong mix of all 3 sets, working with Noire to find the correct positioning of the wards so as they don't feed off one another at worse backfire and injure them in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect as always Morgie' Lucina teases as Noire's Respira shot shatters on her protection shield, as well as Robin's fireball, the boy blushes at the praise, not being good at taking compliments from people other than his family and Noire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

After a couple minutes she managed to release the nub, her belly a little bloated but nowhere near the level it was previously, Morgan and Robin noticed too, if their sly grins were anything to go on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all that was left in Lucina's mind was to let the magic do it's thing, but how much of a change is there to Lucina's body?</span></div></div>",

Well she was Plegian by blood but Robin moved Ylisse due to several things: one in a desert it\u2019s the skinnier person who lives longer, Robin did the research to confirm it and Robin would admit she was somewhat chubby. Next the grimleal were annoying and were a problem for the kingdom, as well as the rule of Plegia was a terrible person (In Robin\u2019s opinion, and most people\u2019s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Robin first moved to Ylisse there were some slight problems but after some time Robin managed to settle down and get married to a man by the name of Chrom, she was a couple of months older than him and a couple of inches taller. They had two children, Lucina and Morgan. Morgan was a minizora a being that originated in Plegia but moved to Ylisse so they could be treated better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlegia started a war with Ylisse. Ylisse didn\u2019t want the war and did offer them food to trade. Plegia declined as they also wanted everyone to worship Grima.. To make things worse Chrom was drafted which broke the hearts of his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive months into the war Morgan was tasked with going to the market to get food and a variety of other things. The reason Morgan is capable of doing this is that Robin taught Morgan a spell that allows him to shrink non-living things allowing Morgan carry money and food. As well Robin gave Morgan enchanted shoes that allow him to move at the same speed he would move if he was a normal size person. The reason why Robin trusted her eleven year old boy to do this was because Ylisse minizora rights were were so well minizoras\u2019 were treated as well as anybody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Morgan was going back home he saw tent in the row of markets he had never seen before. Morgan entered the tent and saw a red haired woman with brown eyes. \u201cOoh a customer.\u201d She said with a gleam in her eyes as she picked up Morgan shocking him. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a minizora to walk in here all day.\u201d She said with a smile. \u201cIs it because you have special products just for minizora\u2019s?\u201d Morgan asked with a smile. \u201cNope, I\u2019m going to sell you to Plegia and make a boat load of money!\u201d Morgan\u2019s eyes widened as the merchant shoved him into a box with holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a limited time only you can buy a minizora, he\u2019s basically indestructible, young, healthy and absolutely adorable. The starting price is 500 bullion!\u201d Anna shouted gleefully watching as the auctioneers went berserk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c100,000,000 Bullion for auctioneer number 87!\u201d Anna said as she gave the box holding Morgan to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blue haired boy deciding to stay in the corner of the box in a desperate attempt to stay hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time the box opened up revealing the face of a dark skinned woman with white hair. Morgan squeaked and tried to get himself tighter into the corner. The woman only cooed before using her free to pluck Morgan out of the box. \u201cMy, my, you have to be the cutest minizora I have ever seen. My name is Aversa, I am the high priestess of the grimleal. What is your name little one?\u201d Aversa asked softly, as she didn\u2019t want to scare the boy. \u201cM-m-m-my n-n-name is M-m-m-m-morgan.

Now I would like you to tell me what you know is expected of the plegian high priestess.\u201d Aversa asked, Morgan calming down slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is supposed to be in charge of the meeting of the grimleal. She is supposed to receive revelations sent from Grima. They only appoint a new priestess when the previous one has died or retired. The new high priestess is the previous ones second in command. They can only retire after five years. The High Priestess has to match the shape of Grima as much as they can. This means she has to have the largest chest, stomach and rear, she also had to be the tallest woman of Plegia.\u201d Morgan explained, looking down and seeing that Aversa\u2019s chest was at least twice as large as his mother\u2019s, which was saying a lot. He also saw she had a potbelly (not as large as the FG Aversa,). While he couldn\u2019t see it Aversa had a rear that matched her chest. On top of that Aversa was seven feet tall. \u201cAs you can see I fulfilled that requirement before I was even appointed.\u201d Aversa giggled using her free hand to shake her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh right, I forgot, the high priestess is allowed to have harem that can consist of whoever they wanted.\u201d Morgan said, at that Aversa frowned. \u201cThat used to be the case, in case if you didn\u2019t know that when a new high priestess is appointed they receive a revelation from Grima. My revelation is that instead of having a harem I\u2019m supposed to have a minizora on me at all times. So that is why I was at the auction today. The ironic thing was that the thing I was most excited about when I became high priestess was having a harem, I knew who it was going to consist of too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough chatting, I do believe it\u2019s time go home.\u201d Aversa says shoving Morgan into her mountains and walking off. While she was walking she saw the full moon, making her remember how in the old days the full moon was supposedly Grima\u2019s protruding stomach after a feast. Aversa walked into the temple and made her way to her room and decided on a way to make her first night with Morgan better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to my brain being overactive, instead of the regular two options there will be four options that are split into two due to not having a paid membership; curse you paid memberships!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.Let Morgan choose where he sleeps.<br>\r\n2.Aversa sleeps Au Naturel<br>\r\n3.Aversa uses a spell to make Morgan normal sized, temporarily (reminder Morgan was originally a minizora, the spell prevents Morgan from leaving her room)<br>\r\n4.Aversa uses a forbidden spell that supposedly makes her bigger than (or equal to) Grima <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robin was doing her early morning rounds, she only wore her coat as while she wasn\u2019t necessarily fat, she weighed the most out of the female shepherds (Aversa not having been recruited\u2026.yet) so she handled the cold like a champ. She would walk to each of the tents to check on the shepherds. Right now she was making her way to her son, Morgan. Robin normally did whatever she could to prevent Morgan from participating in combat, yes he was perfectly capable of fighting as proven when they recruited him in the ruins of time. However he was only ten and Robin felt like it wasn\u2019t fair to him to have to fight for his life at such a young age. Morgan did want to participate so what Robin did was have Morgan do a bunch of chores and helping out around camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin went into Morgan\u2019s tent. \u201cMorgan, sweetie, are you awake?\u201d Robin asked poking her head in. \u201cM-m-mom thank goodness you\u2019re here!\u201d Robin heard and she walked completely into the room.

Robin lifted up the clothes, to Robin\u2019s surprise Morgan fell out, an inch tall...and naked. \u201cMorgan, what happened!?\u201d Robin asked picking up Morgan, who was shivering. \u201cW-w-well, you see, I noticed that you didn\u2019t let me help out on the battlefield that much and I realized it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to get hurt. So when we were at the previous town I passed by a guy in a bird mask selling some stuff, one of the things was a potion book. In it there was instructions of how to make an invincibility potion, I made it, drank it and I shrunk.\u201d Morgan explained still shivering and blushing. Robin sighed, walked over the table and saw the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at the book which was opened to the potion that Morgan was talking about. Robin read the page. \u201cMorgan you\u2019re a smart kid, but why in the world did you stop reading after the instructions?\u201d \u201cW-w-w-well, n-n-normally the instructions are at the end.\u201d Morgan said twiddling his thumbs. \u201cMorgan it says here that consuming this potion has seventy five percent chance of shrinking the person who consumes it.\u201d Robin says and she continued reading the page and was frustrated by the fact that other everything else was written in a language that the grandmaster was unfamiliar with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Robin do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues her early morning rounds, Morgan was one of the first few people she checked on.<br>\r\nRobin starts working on a way to return Morgan to normal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At your size you need to be kept nice, safe and most of all warm, which is exactly what I plan to do\" she purrs before pulling back the light shirt she wore under her Grandmasters cloak, dangling Morgan over the chasm that was her cleavage. She was right about one thing, it was warm, in fact it felt like he was nestled in a blanket until she moved and he bounced along with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, nice and safe\" Robin says mostly to herself she exits the tent, though not before slipping the book into her cloak for future/further study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interesting thing about the sleeping arrangements is that Fredrick had them arranged not by family but by Generation, so all the main Shepards were in one group, couples sharing tents as there was no point trying to hide it when you have an at least teenage child to show for it, while the time travellers were on the other side. So Robin was able to quickly check up on all her friends, coo at how cute Chrom's wife looked being the Exalt's little spoon, as well as remind Panne that Ricken isn't actually a carrot, though his blushing was worth it every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moved onto the kids, Gerome was alreay awake and alert, getting some early morning brooding done, Inigo stared almost drunkenly at her tits when she peeked into his tent, Kijelle threw a pillow at her and rolled over for more sleep and both Noire and Lucina greeted her politely with wide grins and asked how Morgan was doing today. Robin didn't quite lie when she said he was fine other than not liking how cold it was, to which Noire chuckled and said he was never a winter child, most likely due to his Plegian blood (which Robin would probably also have a problem with if she was thinner), while Lucina pouts and asks her to give him her best wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure everything was good Robin retreated to her own rather fancy tent, today was more a training day than anything else so the Grandmaster didn't have to worry about people noticing Morgan missing yet unlike if they were actually going somewhere as Marribelle would be anal about attendance and timing, so she would have had to tell everyone about her son's blunder if they were to go anywhere. As I stood nobody should be looking for Morgan until lunch at the earliest, maybe later if Robin claimed him to be sick so he couldn't come to the table himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Robin was then thinking about how maybe she could find a way to manipulate Morgan\u2019s size so if she ever wanted to she could shrink Morgan and play with him.

Robin\u2019s thoughts were brought to Morgan\u2019s biggest secret, well he didn\u2019t remember it because amnesia but still. Morgan didn\u2019t have a father. According to Noire and Lucina what had happened was somehow Future Robin didn\u2019t end up married and yet she still wanted to have a child. Chrom offered to be a surrogate father (is that even a thing.) Future Robin politely declined as she didn\u2019t want to make things awkward for the exalt or his wife once the baby was born.

Robin deciding to go for it, the girls were the only other people besides herself that Morgan remembered. \u201cWell, there is but before I tell you, you have to stay calm. Can you stay clam?\u201d Robin asked the girls. \u201cOf course what is there to eat out an- <b>oh my gosh tiny Morgan!\u201d</b> Noire screamed as she saw Robin pull Morgan out from her shirt. \u201cHow did this happen? And why is he naked?\u201d Lucina asked as she looking carefully at her tiny friend. \u201cMorgan bought some sort of alchemy book, and he attempted to make an invincibility potion but it backfired. So I was wondering if you could look after Morgan while I work on looking for a cure.\u201d Robin asked, We would be honored, right Noire?\u201d Lucina asked to Noire who\u2019s breathing had finally slowed down. \u201cRight!\u201d Robin smiled flashed son had such good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Morgan, Lucina and Noire are going to take care of you for a couple for a couple of hours. Can you be a good boy for mommy?\u201d Robin asked sweetly. \u201cYes mommy\u201d Morgan said, his whole body being enveloped by Robin\u2019s lips when she kissed him. Robin handed Morgan to Lucina. \u201cHere you go, try to keep him warm, got it?

Tharja stepped onto it, the platform lowered it took several minute before reaching ground. \u201cMorgan, you believe in Grima, correct?\u201d Tharja asked, Morgan nodded rapidly in fear. Tharja chuckled with a dark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Morgan let me show you something....interesting.\u201d Tharja continued walking and there giant doors. Tharja opened them and Morgan gasped. On the floor wearing nothing but metal cuffs around her wrists and ankles was a giant woman, she was big enough that Tharja was basically doll in comparison. She had long white hair and red eyes. Her breasts were absolutely swollen. Due to her being on the floor and laying on her back Morgan couldn\u2019t tell she had a massive rump as well. She was struggling and grunting obviously trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan this here is Grima, she is my prisoner.\u201d Tharja whispered moving Morgan so he was in front of her mouth. \u201cBut how?\u201d Morgan asked mouth agape. \u201cWell, before I became queen I was just a regular plegian citizen. One day Ylisse\u2019s goddess Naga spoke to me in a dream. Apparently Grima was asleep in an underground tomb. Naga couldn\u2019t open the tomb herself due to being a creature of light magic so she agreed that if I opened it for her she\u2019d grant me power. I told her to give me the powers first, which she agreed to. It was a small amount but it was enough to claim the Plegian throne. After words I opened the tomb, Naga placed those cuffs on her which are made of the same material as Falchion. Those cuffs allow me to control Grima\u2019s body. Naga made me swear that I cannot conquer any countries on the Ylissean continent.\u201d Tharja explained to Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay but why is Grima here specifically?\u201d Morgan asked to the queen. \u201cWell you see by drinking Grima\u2019s milk it allows women and by women I mean me, to grow more and more. Oh another thing it\u2019s feeding time.\u201d Tharja smiled and snapped her fingers a large tube appeared and forced itself into Grima\u2019s mouth. Grima moaned as her stomach started swelling like a balloon until it stopped when it was about the size of a bowling ball. \u201cIf Grima\u2019s a goddess why are you feeding her and what are you feeding her?\u201d Morgan asked whimpering. \u201cI\u2019m feeding her ambrosia the food of the gods, Naga has an invite supply she has, the tube connects to the fountain in Naga\u2019s palace. As for why I\u2019m feeding her, well I discovered that the more I feed her the tastier her milk is, the effects are stronger. Also it makes her fill up with milk faster. Your job is to tend to Grima, feed her, rub her body, do whatever she asks besides letting her escape or betraying me. Also you will be my assistant in my Grima related things.

Sure it held me when Tharja captured me, weak from my slumber as well as healing from the instability from the little bunt trying to tear out my magical core to feast on it like the greedy piglet she is, but now, I could tear through them like linen' Morgan doesn't need to be able to see her face to know her grin was practically feral<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But why haven't you?' Morgan asks 'If it's that easy'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because despite holding me prisoner Tharja isn't as bad as she could have been, feeding from me and pleasuring herself on my massive body are things I approve of, it's why I created the gigantus lactatus curse and imbued it into my bloodline, If she frees me, I'll make Naga's boost look like a healing staff in terms of power, as well as fully awaken her bloodline, the girl will produce milk like me, weaker but still capable of enhancing Plegian females, such as the white haired amnesiac she's taken as a lover, and I'll even give her the ability to sire offspring, create a dynasty of Nocturne. All i'll ask for is freedom and the chance to tear that bitch's magical core out like she did me, then who gets to eat her can be decided after' another moment passes when Morgan assumes she's grinning like a loon, but he's already getting used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still don't know what I have to do with this' Morgan admits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like I said, you will be my envoy, offering the deal to her majesty on my behalf as is meant to be.

Some of those things include dragons, maleficarum and other gods. Once I'm done digesting Grima if I decide to make myself... say the size of Morgan, it would work but I would be a massive blob.

He moved around not for magical reasons but as point of pride, he was considered a good masseur, even without magic setting off the pleasure centres of the brain and he wanted to show off to the princess so tried to do a thorough job, more difficult than it sounds when his work station continued to expand and expand as he worked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKjelle and Severa watched with jaws dropped, it was one thing to be told minizora had transformational magic that could alter women's body's, it was another to actually watch their previously boy arsed friend's butt slowly swell like they were blowing up a balloon, finally Morgan stopped, his magic telling him he couldn't go any bigger, unlike with magically enhanced breasts which depended on core size the ass was limited by the proportions of the woman, or more specifically what her body could handle; you can't put ass cheeks the size of yoga balls on someone like Nowi now can you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done he made the fact known, letting Lucina pick him up and place on her bedside table before sitting up, getting off the bed and rushing to the nearest mirror, when she does she squeals in pleasure and bounces her new ass around like it was full of jello laughing at seeing it flop around in the mirror. Kjelle then elbows Severa to kick start her brain who mumbles 'You look nice' to which the princess grins widely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuci wants to share the gift of size and her pet Morgan with the other girls, Severa so she can have big boobs while Kjelle gets a smaller but more all round addition to her figure (so Severa has a nice ass, but small chest, while Kjelle is overall petit, as seen in her confession art where without her armour she is quite a small and adorable thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets Morgan join in the games with her and the other 2 girls, but worries the massage took too much out of him to do another so soon, normal ones are fine but no magic expansion massage for at least a couple days</span></div></div>",

With another huff she pulls her fiery red hair into twin pigtails, finding it the only thing she gained from her mother, having a major problem around pegisi or even horses, she was luckily good with a sword so she had something she could at least do with her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Severa, I have a surprise for you' the red head turns from her mirror, surprised her mother would be looking for her, usually her and father were working for Chrom, or protecting the princess, so to have her focus on her was a strange feeling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Coming Mom' she yells throwing something on hastely before meeting her mother in the main room, the older red head smiles, her fingers running along the top of a wrapped box in her lap 'Yes?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia smiles 'Hon, I know your birthday isn't until next week, but I couldn't hide something like this from a curious little dragon like yourself, so happy birthday my darling. Be careful though, it's fragile'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera takes the box from her mother, only slightly rolling her eyes at the fragile comment, who did she think she was Cynthia? Pulling off the wrappings she discovered a cage, frowning for a moment before sitting down and opening the little door on the cage and tilting it toward her. Her eyes nearly fell out of their sockets when a small white haired boy fell out of the box into her palm 'You.... you got me a minizora?' she asks, happy tears forming in the edge of her vision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course darling, you're a growing girl and a little companion seems appropriate now' Cordelia explains 'Also you have so few friends, mostly just Kjelle and that whatever they are...' if Severa had been listening she would have chuckled, her mother was right her main friends were Kjelle, daughter of one of her father's friends and a nobleman, and a penpal named forest, who as far as she could tell was a boy, even if he didn't want to be, dressing rather similar to the current Queen Maribelle if she were being honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't because she was examining the minizora in her hand, he was young and quite cute, any girl would love to have him 'Bet <i>princess would love to get her hands on this cutie</i>' she thinks before amending that thought, even before the war the royals had a noticeable distain for all things Plegian, including minizora due to them making up 15% of the magical nation's population, while they didn't even have rights here. That was something was both kind of okay about (given it got her this little one all her own) but also sad and annoyed as especially now she could see one for herself she couldn't tell the difference between this one and a human, so why are they treated like pests. It made her think about something her crazy aunt Nowi said about it being something in the blood, which her husband Gregor confirmed, having apparently had a sister who was minizora, luckily she passed many years back due to illness, but he knew it could pop up and was glad when her daughter was more dragon than human which protected her from any problems in his blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven she'd been poking an dprodding him she felt it was rude to not at least ask who he was 'Hello little one' she speaks politely 'Who are you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blinks in confusion before slowly answering 'Morgan miss. Can you help me find mama and Aunt V?' he asks cutely and Severa nearly gushes, but then pouts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are they little like you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! They're big, really big with big parts that bounce. Mom is really important, cause she can do a lot of magic, Aunt V is older and she has more skill but Mom just blows her out of the water in terms of raw power' Morgan explains getting really happy as he talked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia sighs 'He's Plegian darling, most likely the child of a sorceress based on his description. Might want to keep that to yourself little one' she says and Severa grimaces, given Plegia's 64% magical potential population Ylisse did get twitchy about a lot of magic, having banned a good portion of it (it was things like runes and blood magic so she didn't have a reason to care but it was still quite a bit), the idea of a mini with powerful magical heritage may get him hurt, and even if Cordelia was in that camp she wasn't going to take her daughter's present away after ony just giving him to her 'Well up you go, there are things to do later so you might as well relax and show him his new home' the younger nods and runs off leaving the cage on the floor to the elder's amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So this is my room, and I suppose yours too' Severa explains not really giving a tour per say, just telling him he'll be staying here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, okay. When will I see mom?' Morgan asks, causing Severa to grimace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morgan, you're not going to see them, you were sold to my family and you've just been given to me as my pet, or companion if you'd prefer' she says sadly, even at his size she could see how his eyes watered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never?' he whimpers, Severa thinking fast to try distract him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey I heard some rumours about minizora magic, is it true?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is?' Morgan asks confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well for starters that... '</span></div></div>",

Oh please tell me that's true I'm stuck with these little bumps that make me look like I have a boy's body and I want to actually been seen as a woman. Is it too much to ask for a little T&amp;A? Ugh!' Severa grunts at the end and plops down on her bed looking sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan scratches his head and chews his lip 'Um I think I'd heard similar rumors but I've never actually tried, Mom and Aunt V were already the biggest in Plegia naturally, they didn't need a boost. But I can try' Morgan offers, not liking it when girls are sad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sniffle, really?' Severa asks, grinning widely when Morgan nods enthusiastically 'Thank you pet, you're the best!' she cheers and quickly pulls her shirt off causing Morgan to blush. Severa did have a small chest, to the point neither her nor Cordelia believed she needed either a bra or bindings, still they looked like a good size to Morgan, but given how sensitive she was being he wasn't going to voice that thought 'Ready to try little one?' she asks, lying down and placing him on her collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nods 'I can try, like I said I've never done this before' he then steps up and climbs the slight incline to him that was her right breast, kneeling down and beginning to massage. This was something he had been taught as it was a pretty successful future career for a minizora as they could apply the right amount of pressure to sensitive areas as well as avoid painful areas, plus they could also use their magic to stimulate nerves and give pleasure, though that was a different career path entirely. Still his efforts seemed to be enjoyed by Severa and he could see her chest was slowly beginning to increase in mass, even if he was the only one who noticed so far. Luckily it affected her entire bust, not just the area he was rubbing or else she'd be quite lopsided, though he still made the way from right breast to left, having to cross Severa's newly acquired cleavage to do so (made a little more difficult when a giddy and pleasure high Severa trapped him for a few seconds between them and squished him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Morgan didn't know when he began was that while increasing her bust size he was also helping to stimulate her own rather small magical core, as there was a limit to the size someone could reach without having reached a magical threshold, it was more well known in Plegia where some witches looking to enhance their figure turned to their magical studies before the minizora method, as apposed to Ylisse where they used transformation spells and implants to up their assets, but this was an expensive process both in general and in comparison  to the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Morgan collapses in magical exhaustion, sliding into Severa's cleavage again alerting the newly a woman red head that he was done and giving her a chance to inspect her assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big is she? (I suppose this is a question of how much magic Severa had as well as Morgan)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a D (she has gone from a non magical to a low level witch)<br>\r\nor close to the size of her head each? (she had magic, she was just never trained, now she has the strength of a mid tier mage and will definitely need some training to use it properly... and a bra)</span></div></div>",

Morgan looked confused again and then licked his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t taste like anything.\u201d Morgan said looking at his hand before remeering something. \u201cOh, I know what you\u2019re talking about now!

Whatever the case it didn\u2019t matter now, Severa was going to have a tasty snack. \u201cWell Morgan, did your mom say anything bad will happen if you get eaten by someone else?\u201d Severa asked to the young Plegian who shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera grinned before grabbing Morgan with her other hand and depositing him into her open maw. When Morgan touched her tongue she started to moan and shut her mouth swirling the boy around in her mouth. Morgan tasted incredibly sweet, heck if she was being honest Morgan had to be one of the tastiest things she\u2019s eaten, or about to be eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera started to grope her small chest and continued to moan as her tongue dominated Morgan\u2019s small body. As much as Severa wanted to keep tasting Morgan she knew all good things had to come to an end. Severa swallowed Morgan and felt him travel down her throat and land in her stomach. Severa giving a small burp and patted her stomach as she laid on the bed. Severa started moan once more, Morgan was a tiny thing so he didn\u2019t take up tat much space inside of her stomach but despite that he was causing Severa to feel immense pleasure. Severa mentally telling herself to thank her mom even more the next time she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was inside Severas stomach and admitted it was very nice and cozy inside but he was starting to feel strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince my brain runs wild I thought of four possible things that could happen so they\u2019ll have to be divided up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption One: Morgan\u2019s clothes start to digest, acid proof fabric is incredibly expensive so Aversa just used a spell that makes it so his clothes don\u2019t digest but only if he\u2019s in her or Robin\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Two: Morgan is now magically bound to Severa<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Three: Severa is unknowingly absorbing Morgan\u2019s magic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Four: Just like option three but the magic is turning into belly fat for Severa</span></div></div>",

The weirdness was due to him not draining so much magic from his body, it was actually the closest he'd ever come to magical exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the magic did to Severa was easy to notice, witches/female mages from this reality, their magical level was visible by the size of their bust, Aversa having a H cup showing she was one of the strongest of her generation, and with Morgan's magic being dumped into her rather small magical core her breasts began to swell, going from little A cups C's in a few minutes, Severa almost not noticing the change in a blur of pleasure, until she arched her back and felt her chest bounces for the first time... then her attention was drawn to her swelling bosom. 'Holy shit' she swears before moaning once more as the magic flooding her body sets her nerves aflame<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlopping onto her bed, panting slowly Severa rubs her belly, Morgan wriggles as a response to the pressure, his empty core meant her chest stopped at a high C.

Lucina on the other hand was petite only reaching up to her towering mothers chest and had small assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo mother, why is it that you\u2019re taking me to Plegia with you?\u201d Lucina asked, her mother biting her lip. \u201cWell, the thing is Lucina, you have a brother.\u201d <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201dWhat!\u201d</font></b> Lucina screamed her mother covering her ears. \u201cLet me explain, Lucina calm down.\u201d Robin said to the frantic teen, who started to calm down. \u201cAs you know Lucina, I am a plegian, what you don\u2019t know is that my older sister is the queen of Plegia, Aversa.\u201d Robin explained, Lucina not yelling as she wasted her yellingness at Robin\u2019s first bombshell. \u201cNow I was an ambassador or Plegia for Ylisse which is how I met your father, we fell in love and wished to marry but Aversa wasn\u2019t necessarily fond of Ylisse because of events that took place with both of your grandfathers. After much convincing Aversa allowed your father and I to marry. On one condition: that our second child would live in Plegia and be Aversa\u2019s heir.\u201d At this point Robin was crying and a Lucina went to sit next to her mother rather than across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAt first Chrom and I thought nothing of it, but when your brother was born we tried to convince Aversa not to take him but as expected she wouldn\u2019t budge, if anything she became more excited once she found out he was a minizora.\u201d Robin sniffled and stopped crying. \u201cMom, what\u2019s a minizora?\u201d Lucina asked, Robin giving a small smile \u201cOh you\u2019ll find out once you meet him.\u201d Robin said with a small smile which brought up another question \u201cWhy is it that I\u2019ve never met my brother?\u201d Lucina asked to the queen \u201cBecause once your brother was born Aversa had some mercy allowing me to see him twice month, which is the real reason why I leave to Plegja so often, however she didn\u2019t allow Chrom to see him at all.\u201d Robin stated putting her arm around her daughter. \u201cSo why is it that I\u2019m going to see him now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got tired of not seeing him enough and it killed me that you couldn\u2019t get to know him, so I made a new deal with Aversa. If I brought you to Aversa and have you become a suitable queen of Plegia by the time you\u2019d be old enough to rule Ylisse and Plegia would become one you would rule as queen.\u201d Robin said astounding Lucina \u201cbut I\u2019m not big like you, and from what you told me plegian women are big.\u201dLucina said Robin giggling \u201cSilly girl, the reason you aren\u2019t big like a plegian is because you don\u2019t eat enough, yes plegian women are bigger than other women but they still require food to get bigger, heck if you didn\u2019t have my plegian blood in particular you\u2019d be two sizes smaller with how little food you ate.\u201d Robin teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they reached Plegia, Lucina following nervously behind her mother and stopped and stared in awe at who she assumed was Aversa. She had dark skin in contrast to Robin\u2019s pale, she had white hair and was half a head taller than Robin and was at least one size bigger and had a potbelly. \u201cHello my dear little sister, ah you must be my niece, Lucina, my you\u2019re such a cutie.\u201d Aversa said hugging Robin and taking Lucina\u2019s head in her hand and pinching her cheeks with the other. \u201cAversa, is it okay to show Lucina Morgan?\u201d Robin asked \u2018<i>Morgan; so that\u2019s his name</i>\u2019 Lucina thought. \u201cOf course\u201d Aversa shoved her hand into her massive cleavage and pulled out her balled up hand. Aversa moved it in front of the younger girls. \u201cMay I present to you prince Morgan of Plegia.\u201d Aversa said opening up her hand revealing a half inch tall five year old with blue hair. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute!\u201d Lucina squeed snatching the small boy and rubbing him against her cheek. Morgan honestly didn\u2019t know what was going on but enjoyed the attention and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now</span></div></div>",

Still what little he had felt had worried him, it was worse than anything he'd even felt in his life, darker than even what his parents had told him about and they'd fought Grima back during the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey what's going on here?' one of the castle guard's ask as he appears out the corner of Morgan's eye, unfortunately that causes Noire's focus to be drawn to him as well and as her upper eye flashes Morgan watches in slight fear as the man's entire psyche is shredded and broken down simply by Noire's prescience and magical aura. A dark chuckle escape pouty lips as her bony hand claps his cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Leave us' </b></i>she hisses and the broken man shambles away as quickly as he could still move, at which point Morgan finally looks up past her bust to Noire's grinning face <i><b>'Hello little one' </b></i>she purrs, giving Morgan a strange feeling in his trousers,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Noire, what happened to you?' he asks, biting his lip (which Noire cooed at as she found it cute)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'You did, you helped to give birth to a Kishin, and Elder God of madness and destruction from the days of old. Even better you did it without me having to devour the souls of the wicked until my own reached critical mass and evolved. Yay!'</b></i> she cheers, her bust bouncing and Morgan had to grip what remained of her shirt tightly in order to quell his fear of falling, not that her right hand on his back would allow it of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'S-s-so what about me?' Morgan asks, not really sure what answer he wanted to get from the demonic being that was his best friend and secret crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is this new being still Noire but upgraded, or has an elder god been born to cause havoc regardless of whoever stands in her way? And how does that effect Morgan?</span></div></div>",

He was wrapped in his typical indigo coat, slumping lazily on his wooden stool with a dusty tome open between his legs. A lone candle on his desk lit the cracked pages, its calm glow extending to the stacks of thick, musty books forming a half-circle around him. At his back, the entry flap swayed in the warm breeze, a sliver of rosy morning sunshine seeping through. Yet Morgan paid the outside world little mind. He was studying hard, intent on learning a spell or two to match the talents of his mother, Robin, and serve her well as a Shepherd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he whispered, flipping a page, \"so, if I concentrate on the vibrations in the air\u2026 I should be able to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan fell silent. The entry flap was thrown aside with dramatic flair. A red-pink ray struck his book, reflecting harshly on the beige pages and stinging his eyes.

The enchantress drew the eyes of many impetuous men, the luckiest among them running for the hills before she could hex them. Lacking the maturity to appreciate her curves, Morgan only felt his skin crawl as her gaze landed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last\u2026 I've found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Tharja,\" he stammered, slapping his tome shut, \"um\u2026 were you looking for me?

Wow, Tharja, I never knew you were just shy! Maybe you could talk to In-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shy!?\" Her gaze snapped back onto the boy, shutting him up instantly. \"Ha. How appropriately childish of you, Morgan. No, I simply loathe the slightest chance that my approach could be perceived as an act of aggression, shutting me off from Robin forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 that still sounds like shyness to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not! You see, this is why I need you, Morgan\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja took a step closer, bending over, her breasts hanging before Morgan's face. Blushing, he shrank into his seat, the turtleneck of his coat creeping up to his ears. He looked upward to see her hungry gaze looking back. She patted his head, pushing it deeper into his coat until only his eyes and hair were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us propose that, hypothetically, you were to\u2026 'disappear\u2026'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026for a little while\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026down my throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan turned pale as a rock. Tharja smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, while you sit in my stomach, your mother would enlist my assistance to find you. And with my assistance rendered, she'll have no choice but to\u2026\" Tharja grinned, standing up straight and laying her hands on her cheeks, blushing brightly. \"\u2026Pledge her gratitude to me! Oh, can you imagine how wonderful that would feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait\u2026\" Morgan's head popped up from his collar, mouth agape. \"You aren't seriously talking about\u2026 eating me, are you, Tharja? Y-you can't eat a human being, and even if you could, I'd be digested! And even if I wasn't, I'd tell my mother what you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja laid a finger over Morgan's lips. She chuckled as she gave her own a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple. I've learned a shrinking hex just for this occasion- it will render you invulnerable to harm, and when I'm ready to 'divine' for you, I need only cast a memory-altering spell\u2026 And you'll be just as thankful as your mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew her finger back, a green spark sputtering at its tip aimed straight at Morgan. He shook his head, eyes wide in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! You're nuts! You can't seriously be about to- hrk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green bolt struck Morgan's chest, encapsulating him within an electric coat. Sparks blinded him, and when they faded, he found himself standing on a massive wooden platform stretching hundreds of feet in all directions. Looking up, he spotted the towering trunks of Tharja's pantyhose-clad thighs rising on the horizon. A grim shadow fell over him and invited his gaze higher, revealing Tharja's open hand descending, her face looming like a grinning moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she manage to grab Morgan?</span></div></div>",

Her fingers had closed over nothing. Morgan swiftly sidestepped her grasp, prompting a gasp from them both. Neither of them expected the agility granted by his tiny size, but Morgan smiled because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! I guess being a master of the dark arts doesn't improve your reflexes much, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr\u2026! Hold still, you little insect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja made repeated grabs, but her prey slipped through her fingers every time, much to her increasing annoyance. Morgan gradually back-stepped to the stool's edge, glancing over his shoulder to confirm his escape route in the form of a stack of books under the desk. He spun around with a flick of his coat, dashing for the edge, only to feel a sharp tug that stopped him in his tracks. A throaty chuckle confirmed that Tharja had grabbed his coattail. She pulled upward and lifted him off the stool, but he raised his arms and slipped out of the sleeves. Morgan landed on solid ground in his milk-white undershirt and pants without losing a step. He hopped off the stool and landed on The Principles of Alchemy below the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insolent brat,\" Tharja spat, shoving the stool aside, \"you won't elude me that easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark mage hunched over and reached under the desk. Morgan scurried down a short staircase of books leading to the tent's posterior flap, where a glimmer of sunlight peaked through. Tharja's open hand chased him for a good portion of his run, fingernails clawing at his heels until he jumped off one last book, landed on the tent's floor, and slipped underneath the flap. She snarled a curse, standing to her full height and stomping out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shot out into the warm, pinkish sunlight, stopping to catch his breath. The ground was soggy from the nightly rainshower, dew resting on the scattered patches of grass that, from Morgan's height, seemed tall as trees. He raised his head to see a massive wall of dark fabric, belonging to a tent opposite the one he had just escaped from. Its lower rim was open a gap. With Tharja undoubtedly in pursuit, Morgan ran across the ground and ducked underneath. From his hiding spot, he glanced back and saw Tharja's massive heel stomping by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where could that boy have gotten to\u2026? Hm. I suppose I'll know soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, nuts,\" Morgan whispered to himself, \"she's right. I bet she just went to grab a dragon scale and divine for me.\" If that was the case, he realized, he had no time to lose. He turned and crawled through the narrow passageway. It really didn't matter who he found- he just needed someone who could keep him safe from Tharja. Then again, she might just be crazy enough to shrink someone else\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might as well try- ouf! \u2026Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan stood up from under the flap, he bumped his head against a soft ceiling. It was impressively wide, ending at a thin rectangle of light toward the end. He pressed on, crouching a bit to prevent his hair from dragging against the ceiling. The nearer he drew to the light, the clearer the tent's interior became. A fuzzy area rug covered the whole floor, a table standing at its center topped by several candles. Cots and shelves ran along the fringes of the room. It was the main sleeping tent of the camp which, Morgan immediately recalled, was where Robin slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this is perfect! Mom could fix me right up! \u2026But I wonder if she's even here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she there?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan stepped out from under the low ceiling. He turned around to see a large mattress towering over him, its topside totally obscured. As he assumed, he had been crawling underneath one of the cots. He turned and continued looking around, but from what he could tell, the tent was empty.<br>\r\n\"Well, that answers my question. Hmm. Wait a minute\u2026 If Tharja catches me alone in here, she could just eat me without any witnesses! Crud, I should've thought about this more\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan paused. Looking between the legs of the central table, he saw the entry flap rising and falling with the wind. \"Well, I could still head back outside. Maybe someone out there would help? \u2026Or maybe I'd run into Nowi. Gah. At least Tharja was planning on letting me out of her stomach eventually... What should I- wha!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Morgan's choice was made for him. A harsh quake vibrated through the rug, throwing him face-first into the fuzz. He rolled over and sat up, beholding a pair massive feet, each big toe large enough to flatten him. They rose into towering ankles, widening into thighs that entered a pair of navy blue shorts. Above the shorts sagged a sky-blue shirt, finally ending at the soft, weary face of Morgan's older sister, Lucina. Her disheveled blue hair fell in frizzy locks over her shoulders, cobalt eyes fluttering as she stretched and yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh\u2026 Good morning\u2026\"<br>\r\n\"S-sister\u2026?\" Morgan's jaw hit the floor. He sat there, at the foot of his giant sister's bed, along with her actual foot. She shook her head, wiping the crust from her twitching eyelids and slowly surveying the floor.<br>\r\n\"Mm\u2026 Alright, time to\u2026 wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina paused. Her blurry vision revealed a tiny, pale-colored object by her toes. She spread her legs and bent down for a better look. She wondered if it was a bug, until it stood up and showed it had only four limbs. In fact, closer inspection revealed it to look quite human. A dark line divided its body into a white shirt and pants. On its head sat a dark blue tuft of hair bracketing its cubbish, smiling face. Lucina's eyelids flung wide open. She was looking at a living, breathing boy, one who was small as her thumb, with features that could belong to only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B\u2026but\u2026 It can't be\u2026! Oh gods! Morgan!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chuckled nervously, scratching the back of his head as he looked up at Lucina's bewildered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah... Good morning, Sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what\u2026? H-how are you- I must be dreaming\u2026 But I can't be! But then\u2026 Are you real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only one way to find out,\" Morgan shrugged and smiled, \"Give me a hand, sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina lowered a flattened palm to the floor by Morgan's side. He stepped on and took a seat, the warm, squishy skin heating his legs. She slowly raised him to her face as she straightened her back, trying to be as gentle as possible. Morgan gasped nonetheless, having never ridden a human hand as an elevator before, watching the floor shrink away beneath him. When the ride ended, he stared up at her panoramic visage and the uncombed blue frizz framing it. Her mouth remained agape and her eyes remained wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 can't believe it's really you. You're so small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he nodded, \"I guess I'm really your 'little' brother now, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina closed her eyes and shook her head with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\u2026 it's definitely you.\" She opened her eyes and matched her younger brother's warm smile. \"Well, I'm always glad to see you, Morgan. Although, this is still very strange\u2026 holding you in my hand like a doll. What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it all started when I was in the magic supplies tent\u2026\" Morgan's explanation rambled on for a while. Over the course of his story, Lucina's fingers slowly curled into a defensive cup behind his back, her eyes growing wider by the minute. By the time he concluded, she looked totally dumbfounded. \"\u2026So basically, Tharja wants to eat me! Um\u2026 You do believe me, right, Sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina offered a slow, solitary nod. \"Yes, I believe you\u2026 but I wish I didn't. I'd like to trust each of my fellow Shepherds equally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Morgan folded his arms behind his head, reclining against Lucina's curved fingers, \"I don't like judging people on first appearances, but\u2026 Yeah. Tharja's always kinda creeped me out. And she's probably still out there looking for me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina flinched. Her hand closed tighter around Morgan, fingers curling over his head forcing him to bend his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy there, Lucina!\" He raised his hands and pushed against her fingers, as if to trying to slow their descent, even though he knew it was impossible. \"I'm sure I'll be fine in your hands without you crushing me with 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina shook her head, as if snapping out of a trance. She unfurled her fingers, allowing Morgan to recline like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry. It's just\u2026 the thought someone capturing you scares me.\" She shrugged, managing a smile. \"I guess it's a 'big sister' thing. You may be older now, but it'll always be my job to protect you, you know? Especially if you're shrunken like this. With everyone running around camp, who knows what could happen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Morgan chuckled, fearfully daydreaming of being squished under a clumsy Sumia or swallowed by a playful Nowi. \"Still, I think I'll be okay. Tharja said she made me tough enough to survive in her stomach, after all. Then again\u2026 she's definitely still looking to trap me in there. She'll do anything if it means getting closer to mom. Speaking of mom, I was thinking we should find her to get me unshrunk. I'm not good enough with magic to undo this hex, but I bet she'd know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I had the same thought. Although\u2026 Mother should be coming here any moment. I was going with her to that town as a fellow ambassador.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So, does that mean we'd be better off staying here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Lucina answer</span></div></div>",

Her eyelids shut halfway, while her smile grew just a little wider. \"So, we'll just be waiting a while, huh\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's the plan,\" Morgan shrugged, \"but are you okay, Lucina?

Morgan found that Lucina's hand was lowering, cradling him over her thigh. Her hand tilted, allowing him to slide off and land in the corner between leg and waist, resting his back against her lower abdomen. The same hand flipped over and gently rested over his legs, pushing him into the soft, warm fabric. Her stomach rose and fell behind his back with her slow, relaxed breaths, squeezing him between the fluff of her shirt and the warmth of her fingers, her pulse throbbing under her skin. Her eyes drifted down at the tiny brother lying in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe\u2026 Comfy down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, um\u2026 Lucina\u2026\" He looked up toward his sister's face as she peered down with a loving smile. \"Not that I mind this or anything, but what's gotten into you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. It's just\u2026 with all the time we spend out there fighting, we never have much time to just relax, huh? Just to be a family once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you have a point. I've thought about that too, it's just\u2026 I guess I'm more used to the 'new' you, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Lucina raised a brow. \"There's a 'new' me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, yeah! Er\u2026 Y'know\u2026 the gruff attitude, the flashy sword stuff, the whole 'mask' thing\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina chuckled, smiling warmly. Morgan returned her smile, though there was something about it that he couldn't quite place. Nothing devious like Tharja's, but something distant, uncanny, nostalgic perhaps. Especially as she tilted her head to the side, resting her cheek against her fist\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're adorable, Morgan. Just like you've always been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait a minute\u2026 Ha!\" Morgan laughed, pointing at Lucina's face. \"That's what I'm remembering!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Lucina realigned her head, raising her cheek from her fist. That fist sprouted a finger that joined Morgan's in aiming back at her face. \"What about this look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the one you used to give me when I was a little kid. When we used to play around and you'd always giggle about how 'cute' I was\u2026 haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina playfully blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not funny! And don't you dare tell anyone around here that I 'giggled!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you totally did! Like, when you used to stomp around, pretending to be a 'giantess' who was trying to eat me! Then you'd give me a chance to fight back and 'slay' the giantess, but\u2026 Man, I was such a softie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\" Lucina's words were caught in her throat, blocked off by a snicker. \"Oh, ha! That's right! You never 'slayed' anything\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Because I couldn't bring myself to hurt you, even if we were just pretending! Ha\u2026 I sure was weird, huh? I always hear about siblings getting into fights, but I never wanted to fight with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Morgan\u2026\" Lucina sighed, shaking her head. \"The only thing that's unusual about you is that you're too kind. And if that's your biggest problem, you should consider yourself blessed. I should, too, since I have you as a brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks!\" Morgan threw his arms up, as if reaching out to catch a ball bigger than his whole body. Lucina giggled, laying a hand over her lips as if to seal all silliness inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee\u2026 Oh my gosh! What's with that pose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" Morgan dropped his arms and chuckled, \"I just remembered how our game always ended, with me giving the 'giantess' a big hug! Heheh\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A big hug for the giantess, huh?\" Lucina's smile broadened. \"You mean\u2026 like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you- uwah!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina's free hand swooped in and scooped Morgan up, eliciting a brief yelp as he was elevated. But, rather than bringing him before her face, her hand stopped at her collarbone. She rested her other arm diagonally over her chest, forming a small gap between skin and cloth. She tilted her hand, letting him slide comfortably into the crevice, lightly pressing her arm inward to secure him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan slipped up to his waist before Lucina tightened her \"hug,\" squeezing him against the soft, warm cloth. His head rose just above the collar of her shirt, his face nestling against the crest of her smooth skin. Lucina lowered her head and hummed affectionately, nuzzling her brother's delicate frame between the two soft planes. Morgan wiggled his hands free of the constrictive cloth, awkwardly spreading his arms to embrace as much of his sister as he could. He barely managed a fraction of her warm, plush breadth, but she giggled lovingly his attempt nonetheless, keeping him a while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lucina brought Morgan back up to her face. She sat cross-legged on her bed while he sat cross-legged in her hand, the two of them smiling as brightly as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Sorry about the lousy hug, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright! To be fair, you had a hard time wrapping your arms around me when you were little, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh\u2026 But that didn't stop me from trying, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Hahaha\u2026\" Lucina shook her head, her laughs trailing off into a sigh. \"Wow. I can't believe we used to play around like this every day. It feels so long ago\u2026 But it feels nice right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And we haven't even done any of the crazy stuff yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh?\" Lucina's eyes narrowed naughtily. \"Are you saying you want to do the 'crazy stuff?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know that feeling all too well,\" she concluded with a roll of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, If you insist! But, what was your idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" Lucina let out a mischievous giggle, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026 I hope you don't mean we're going straight to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan yelped. His platform swooped down toward the mattress as Lucina let out a demented sounding giggle. With a tilt of her hand, he rolled onto the blanket, sprawled about before her folded legs, which didn't stay folded for much longer. She sprung up onto her knees, chest puffed out comically with a hand laid on her hip, putting on her best \"evil\" performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwahaha\u2026 The giantess comes, and she hungers for human flesh! You'd best be running away, my little morsel! Not that you'll get very far before I snatch you up and gobble you whole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan couldn't help but laugh. So many memories came flooding back as he stood to his feet, wobbling a bit in search of balance on the swaying mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that, sis! I slipped away from Tharja, I'm sure I can get away from- wha!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina wasn't messing around. She immediately swiped for Morgan with an open hand. He hopped backward just barely in time. He then turned and tried to run, repeatedly stumbling and falling, crawling on all fours when he couldn't manage to stand. Thankfully, Lucina was similarly afflicted, barely able to keep up her \"gigantic\" stature as she waddled forth on her knees, nearly toppling over. The slow, awkward chase continued to the end of the bed, where Morgan had managed to outpace the 'giantess.' But she had one last trick up her sleeve, lurching forward and throwing her hand forth. As she thudded against the blanket, she produced a massive shockwave that undulated the whole mattress. Morgan was launched into the air, legs fluttering helplessly as he fell into Lucina's open palm, her fingers enclosing him. She crawled over to the bedside with Morgan in hand and sat up, dangling her legs off edge. Finally, she brought her 'prey' up to her mouth, her earnest smile replaced by a victorious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! I've got you now! Now you're all mine, hahaha\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn. I'm guessing hugs won't save me this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\u2026 if you wanna hug the inside if my belly! Haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina gripped Morgan by his shirt with her free hand, hoisting him above her mouth while tilting her head back. Her jaws parted wide beneath him, a wave of warm morning breath washing over his legs. In the low light of the tent, her teeth were a pair of monstrous jaws emerging from an inky black fog, her shimmering serpent of a tongue unrolling just beneath his feet. Her breath grew hotter and hotter as she dangled him lower and lower. He looked down, the pink throat arch just barely visible, twitching as if in genuine anticipation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lucina's hand opened, and instantly she felt a small, cloth-covered object plop onto her tongue. She kept her head pointed forward, her ears greeted by the last voice she wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina. Robin's daughter. Do you fare well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Tharja. Lucina felt a chill run down her spine, and Morgan apparently did too. He wiggled on her tongue and flipped onto his back. She heard the slightest squeak from him before she shut her mouth, sealing him inside. Just for a moment, she assured herself, to buy some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Lucina's maw, Morgan watched the teeth clack shut, sealing him in steamy darkness. The squishy tongue twitched beneath him, expanding and contracting like a sponge, secreting saliva between its bumpy pores. His back was soaked, and his front wasn't faring much better with moist breath blowing over his face. The smell wasn't terribly pleasant, and all he could hear was the clenching and unclenching of the throat muscles, producing a wet sucking sound. That sound soon joined by a deep, reverberating moan. Morgan found himself sliding slightly forward and slightly back as Lucina's head tilted up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm\u2026 hm.\" Lucina answered with a subtle nod, taking care not to send Morgan down her throat. She watched Tharja pace around the table, arms folded and head facing forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was searching for someone. Your brother, Morgan.\" She shot a glare at Lucina. \"You wouldn't have happened to see him around here, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-mm,\" she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's understandable.\" She realigned her head and nodded. \"I was assisting him with learning a new spell, but- oh, the poor boy. You know how excitable they can get at his age. He shrunk himself to a few inches, so you must understand I am very concerned for his safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm\u2026 hm,\" she nodded noncommittally. She couldn't believe this witch was really as cold as they said, but there was another reason for her dissonant reply. There was also the tiny body resting upon her tongue, a strangely alluring flavor washing over the wet muscle. She was so lost in the salty, tangy sensation of that she almost forgot she was tasting her own brother, and that Tharja was still speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Because I just got done divining his location\u2026 you truly not seen him\u2026 scurrying around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm\u2026 mmh\u2026\" Lucina heard Tharja's words trail off into babble. She started tilting her tongue left and right, absorbing every bit of Morgan's taste she could. He slipped and slid all over the slick muscle, wiggling in protest, lathery bubbles filled with his essence bursting all over. There was no mistaking it. He was delectable. But was he delicious enough to eat, Lucina wondered? He did say that Tharja's spell rendered him capable of surviving digestive acids. And he was delicious. And she wondered, somewhat naughtily, what it would be like to give her little brother a \"hug\" with her throat, feeling him inside her body, squirming around\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordswoman jerked. Her blue pupils expanded as they met with Tharja's dark gaze, her scowling face was mere inches from her own. How long had she been there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026You're being awfully quiet. Mind telling me where you last saw Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bead of sweat rolled down Lucina's forehead, crossing between her eyes and dripping off her nose. She knew Morgan wouldn't like it, but she also loved him. It wasn't like he would be harmed. Besides, what choice did she have? It was either her stomach or Tharja's, but she'd let him out sooner. Clenching her fist, she tilted her tongue back, pushing her little brother back toward her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh\u2026 now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Lucina's mouth, Morgan sat up, bumping his head against the mouth's roof. He had been listening to the muffled sound of Tharja's voice outside, but mysteriously, she had fallen silent. He figured it was only a matter of time before Lucina's mouth would open, dooming him to confinement Tharja's stomach instead... but he was surprised to feel Lucina's tongue shift and bow. The fleshy wedge curled inward, its firm tip pressing against chest, forcing him onto his back while folding over his legs. Morgan felt his whole world tilt as the fleshy blanket slipped free of his lower body and he slid straight into the waiting throat below. He felt a ring of muscle stretch over his head, sliding over his forearms as it slowly tightened, abruptly clenching to squeeze him downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lucina! Wai-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulk~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina twitched. Half her mind worried Tharja would realize the true nature behind her gulp and know it not to be a simple sign of fear. But the other half was too busy enjoying Morgan's wiggly little form sliding down her throat. She relished every little twitch as he passed from her neck to the inside of her chest, squeezing his way through lower esophageal sphincter and plopping into the pit of her stomach. He felt just as nice inside her throat as she had hoped, but the sound of Tharja loudly clearing her own throat brought her back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Tharja. I'm afraid the last time I saw him was yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Tharja believe Lucina </span></div></div>",

Lucina stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina nonetheless counted every second before the dark mage was gone, but when the entry flap fell shut, her shoulders dropped with a heavy sigh. Then she shuddered. Morgan skittered around her stomach floor in quick, jerky movements. He eventually stopped and slumped against the internal wall, tickling the sensitive muscle. Lucina hunched over, speaking to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M\u2026 Morgan? Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Morgan replied, muffled behind the visceral layers, \"loud and clear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good\u2026 I can hear you too.\" Lucina blinked. She was amazed that she could hear the voice of a living thing inside her, let alone her own brother. \"So you're\u2026 okay in there? You're not melting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! I can feel the acid, but it's just kinda warm and mucky\u2026 And it doesn't smell great, but I can manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can\u2026 breathe alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That had me stumped at first, but I think it's just another part of the hex. Like, it was designed for maximum stomach-comfort! Heheh\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're\u2026 sure you're okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! C'mon, Lucina, you're the hungry giantess! I thought you'd enjoy it a little more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe\u2026\" Lucina bit the tip of her pinkie. \"I can't believe you still have a sense of humor even in this situation\u2026 Because\u2026 Well\u2026 I'm sorry for swallowing you so suddenly. It felt like you were really freaking out in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't sweat it, sis! It was kinda scary at first, sliding down into a dark, slimy hole like that... But once I got into your throat, it felt nice, like a full-body massage. I don't know, maybe it's just the hex. Maybe it was created to condition the 'captive' into staying relaxed inside of the captor's stomach\u2026 Either way, this is kind of cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\u2026 really? You think it's cool\u2026 in my stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, it's very warm. But just seeing the inside of a living stomach up-close like this is totally cool! Like, I was reading a book about human anatomy, and now I wanna go back and rewrite it! It's waaaay different\u2026 And\u2026 I know I said this already, but\u2026 maybe it's the hex, or\u2026 mmm\u2026 I dunno, it's just\u2026 it's so\u2026 comfy\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you- Ohhh\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina shivered, her upper body standing erect. She felt Morgan's tiny form plop into the pit of her stomach, his little arms spread as he sank into the muscle. Such a simple gesture, but that little squeeze, that little shift of his weight, flooded her senses with bliss. She sat totally still, time seeming to fade from her conscience, nearly reclining against the wall and falling back asleep. But a faint moan from within her drew her attention downward. She arched her back and directed her ear toward her stomach, listening for Morgan's voice amidst her stomach's watery sloshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026 sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Yes, little brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Thanks for protecting me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Of course, Morgan.

She tapped a finger against her chin, giving her daughter a slightly disappointed look. \"And you still aren't dressed\u2026? I was hoping you'd be ready before I got here. And where is Morgan? Weren't you speaking to him just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina smiled, laying a hand on her stomach. \"Well, where to start\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed outside the command tent, more than the driver of the horse-drawn coach awaiting Robin's return had expected. Eventually, the flap opened and he saw her. She stepped alongside her daughter Lucina, who had donned trademark blue leather armor, her hair combed into a set of straight cobalt bangs. Morgan stepped out soon after, still slipping his arms into a newly-prepared indigo coat as he hurried alongside his mother and sister. The coach had no canopy, but it did have opposing seats for four, so the three easily boarded together. Lucina and Morgan sat in the back, while Robin, seated in the front, turned and signaled the driver to start. As the horses trotted along, pulling the coach forward, she turned back around to see both her children smiling. As was often the case, Morgan spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for letting me come along, Mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Morgan! But you know, if you're ever trying to expand your knowledge of magic, you could just come to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I know. I just wanted to impress you, that's all! Y'know, show how independent I've become, and all that\u2026 Sorry, is that arrogant of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, kiddo,\" Robin assured, patting Morgan's head, \"that's a good trait to have. But you can always count on your family for support, no matter what happens. Magic is especially hard to learn on one's own. I'm surprised you got as far as you did. Although,\" she added with a wink, \"I could always show you how to cast the shrinking hex on yourself with an easy way to undo it\u2026 If you two were interested in more 'stomach bonding.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Lucina blushed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Morgan mumbled, \"well, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mother,\" Lucina cut in, looking around at the camp as they rolled by, \"Do we have to discuss this in public?\" She glanced at Morgan before continuing. \"And I don't think it's a practical use of Morgan's time to teach him magic that will only be useful for two people\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin waited a moment. She laughed as her children's cheeks glowed red as the morning sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Lucina shrieked, waving her hands. \"No, no! Wait! I didn't mean it like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are such a handful,\" Robin sighed with a shake of her head. \"And who said it was just for you? I thought Morgan was pretty cute when he was small, too. So\u2026\" She paused, patting her son's knee. \"What do you say, Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\u2026 heh\u2026 Well\u2026\" Morgan's gaze danced between his mother and sister, finally settling on the latter. \"I mean, it's like you said, sis\u2026 no harm in having some fun with it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Ah, sure,\" Lucina shrugged, her smile returning, \"why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As if right on time as soon as the baby came out Chrom, Lissa, Lucina and some doctors were there. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely little boy\u201d Aversa said bringing the baby up to Robin. \u201cAversa, the baby is tiny\u201d Robin said, of course she was happy the baby was born safely and was healthy and of course she would love him, however he was tiny and up until today he was normal sized. \u201cAversa, please tell me you didn\u2019t plan for this to happen; did you?\u201d Chrom asked worried about his sister-in-law\u2019s intentions, he did get along with Aversa often but she was still unpredictable at times. \u201cOf course, not I specifically made sure not to use any spells that would permanently affect the baby.\u201d Aversa reassured to the Exalt, however; is Aversa lying?</span></div></div>",

While Grima and Naga had originally had a deal \u201cYou don\u2019t interfere with my country and I don\u2019t interfere with yours.\u201d However, Naga was prone to nagging and telling Grima what she can and can\u2019t do, especially saying Grima can\u2019t visit her own country. After centuries of this Grima decided to get rid of Naga, by eating her, whole. Grima was able to devour the other goddess and had her body to her own. At first Grima thought it was the perfect solution since there was no more Naga and it made Grima much more powerful. Unfortunately, Naga made Grima fat, very, very fat. Grima\u2019s assets did go up several sizes but she now had a massive doughy gut. Grima was fine with being big however it made certain things more difficult. As well Grima now had Naga\u2019s mark on her rump. The worst thing was that Grima was no longer capable of going into Plegia, so she could only watch. As well it prevented her from communicating with her friends, who she knew would be able to fix Grima\u2019s problem of being blocked out from Plegia (Snaky in particular). While Grima could leave to see them, there was the problem of the world being unsupervised, so she wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent any world ending stuff. On the plus side Grima can turn someone into a god thanks to Snaky and this weird fruit he gave her. However she didn\u2019t want to give it to an ylissean and plegians, or at least worthy plegians, didn\u2019t like to leave their home country.<br>\r\nGrima felt a ring, and she grinned, she set up an alarm of sorts to notify when a worthy Plegian would be outside of Plegia. Grima looked through to see and grinned.<br>\r\nRobin was a tall, young woman with large assets, and white hair. As well she had a tiny amount of pudge on her stomach. She had a five-year-old boy, Morgan who also had white hair, singing along as he and his mother made their way to Ylisse to find a new home. \u201cI love my mommy yes I do, she is super-duper cud-a-lee.\u201d Grima smiled, the woman looked very similar to her and she also had a cute kid this woman was the one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we continue what is Morgan\u2019s size?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes there was the problem that when going through the time portal they could all get separated but Lucina had a plan for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina went outside to see her allies and friends: Noire, the daughter of Henry and Tharja. Severa, daughter of Cordelia and Gaius. Yarne, son of Panne and  Kellam.  Nah, daughter of Nowi and Ricken. Cynthia, daughter of Sumia and Frederick. Laurent, son of Miriel and Vaike. Kjelle, daughter of Sully and Virion. Inigo, son of Olivia and Donnel. Brady, son of Maribelle and Gregor. Gerome, son of Cherche and Libra. Lucina's cousin, Owain, the son of Lissa and Lon'Qu. And last but not least Lucina's ten year old brother, Morgan, the son of Robin and Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now everyone this is the moment we've been waiting for and I know you are all nervous, I am too. But if we all stick together we can get through this!\" Lucina said with confidence. \"I hate to be a debby downer, Luci but Naga said so herself that we might all get separated.\" Brady said, Lucina looked towards him with a small smile. \"Thank you for bringing that up Brady, I actually have solution that will fix that, now none of you will like it, except maybe Morgan, but it will work and it's for the greater good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Lucina opened her palm and there was a bright flash of light. When Lucina could see properly all of her friends were one to six inches tall (To be more specific and stuff, Morgan was one, Noire, Severa and Kjelle were six and everyone else was between.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked pretty freaking terrified, except Morgan who was really giddy standing in awe of his massive sister. \"Now don't be scared, I need you to remove your armor and weapons.\" Lucina said calmly, the little people obeying her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-so why did you want us to remove our gear?\" Noire stuttered as Lucina put the stuff in a small pouch. \"Well so I would have an easiee time eating you.\" Lucina said casually and with the excption of Laurent, Gerome and Morgan, everyone started panicking. \"Guys calm down, the spell I used to shrink you also makes you invincible.\" Lucina sighed as the others still panicked, Yarne tried to run away but Lucina quickly grabbed him and ate him, gagging a bit as he was nasty due to his fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yarne was swallowed everyone shut up. \"What's going to be done about Minerva?\" Gerome asked \"Yeah and my Pegasus!?\" Cynthia piped in and Lucina sighed once more. Unfortunately we'll have to leave them behind the shrink spell only works on things with human blood and the things they have on them.\" Lucina explained right before she ate Gerome and Cynthia in case if they thought they would run off or complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina ate them one by one till there was one person left, Morgan. \"Are you ready little brother?\" Lucina asked holding him at eye level. \"Yup, I bet its super cozy in your belly!\" Morgan cheered, Lucina giggledin response gently kissing the young boy before gently tossing him into her mouth. Lucina moaned, Morgan was the tastiest out of all of them and she kept in her mouth as she out on her mask and bindings to hide her \"Incredibly sexy body\" as Severa calls it, or as Lucina calls it her breasts and her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so sticky in here, isn't Morgan supposed to be here?\" Severa asked/complained. \"Maybe Lucina is keeping Morgan in hee breasts because of nepotism?\" Inigo suggested \"If it was nepotism then Owain wouldn't be here, I'm surprised that you know what nepotism is.\" Laurent said and before Inigo could say something abput Laurent being a jerk, \"Hey do you here that?\" Nah asked looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\" \"Oof!\" Severa said as she fell to the ground. \"Severa are you okay what happened?\" Noire asked as since it was dark no one could see. \"Hey Severa sorry about landing on you.\" Morgan said as he cimbed off the redhead and went over and snuggled into a stomach wall. \"Morgan what heck are you doing?\" Yarne asked wondering if his friend had gone insane. \"I'm just getting settled, its so cozy in here!\" Morgan cheered as he used some of the flesh as a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina patted her stomach, while she would never say it anyone, except maybe Morgan, it felt great having all her friends in her belly. Patting her gut satisfied she dove into the time portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that scene where \"Marth\" introduces himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was in an inn sitting on her bed rubbing her stomach, a part of her didn't want to let out her friends but she knew it had to be done. Lucina went into the restroom, she gagged spitting up everyone. \"Here is all your stuff I'm going to grow you guys back\" Lucina said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever something goes wrong but what </span></div></div>",

You can keep him' she sighs and walks out, the tactician pinches the bridge of her nose and places him down before getting dressed and then bringing Morgan with her to the tent she was sharing with her future sister in law.

Morgan whispers in her ear, large purple eyes swing open and he's grabbed by the girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'MORGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' she squeals nuzzling him and sliding him between her breasts 'I missed you precious' she coos then lies down again with a big smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well... now that's over what are we going to do Luci? Kjelle asks, the bluenette begins laying out their plans for saving the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Robin was the shepherds tactician, she was incredibly powerful both psychically and magically and was the reason Lissa became a sage and helped Lissa with combat magic. As well she was taller than even Frederick and was incredibly buxom. Robin's breasts were much larger than her own head and a rump  that could cover Chrom's lap up entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, Robin and Chrom were engaged. No one else knew except Lissa as she had passed by Chrom's tent and witnessed Chrom proposing to Robin.... and Robin giving Chrom a lap dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Lissa was jealous of both of them, Chrom for bagging such a sexy woman and Robin ascension to power due to the upcoming marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this Lissa managed to fit six large toads into Robin's bra while the tactician was bathing. Lissa laughed like a crazy person when she heard Robin's screams when she had put on the bra (Lissa could of fit in two more toads but then Robin would've been able to realize they were there before putting on her bra.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lead to a prank war both girls viciously pranking each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa awoke in a cramped but soft area with something poking her back. Then there was light and Lissa fell to tne ground. \"Glad you're awake.\" Lissa turned to see a giant, topless Robin. \"R-r-r-Robin, what's going on?\" Lissa stuttered, hoping this was just a dream. \"I shrunk you\" Robin said matter of factly. \"W-w-why?\" Lisaa asked \"Well you see, I had a nightmare last night that our prank war had continued on into my marriage, yes I know you were there last night master tactician and all. In the nightmare you decided to end the prank war by eating me whole, digesting, me, mocking me as I was churned up into fat and waste. Even after I died in the dream it continued with you mocking me. While I know that you're incapable of eating me whole like you did in the dream I knew  I had to end this prank war on my terms.\" Robin explained intensely as Lissa shook in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence until there was loud snoring coming from Robin's bra on the floor. Lissa walked over to it seeing in one of the cups was a sleeping four inch Tharja (Lissa was three inches). \"Uh, why is the Tharja shrunken?\" Robin sighed \"She also overheard Chrom's proposal and I caught her trying to chop off Chrom's genitals when I got back from kidnapping and shrinking you, anyway the two of you are for now on going to be my.....\"</span></div></div>",

There were three red orbs, a blue orb and a green orb. Kiran choosing the green orbed and placed it into the relic. She aimed the relic forward blasting a burst of energy forward revealing Robin, a female Robin which was impossible considering she was for some reason could be summoned if a special challenge was completed. Kiran was able to tell this Robin was a five star which made her extremely giddy as this would be her first time summoning a five star. But what was interesting that this Robin was vastly different than then the female Robin that could be earned for the special challenge (which Kiran never was able to complete with her numerous attempts) and the one for when they helped the world of Awakening when it was under Veronica's control. This Robin was a lot taller and more buxom than the other female Robins they have seen. But she still had the same silver pony tails as the other Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Alfonse I was right this was a great summon she'll be extremely useful and all of the enemies will be too distracted by her sexiness allowing us to easily to defeat them!\" Kiran shouted ignoring the fact Robin was standing right in front of them. \"What about the female enemies?' Alfonse asked Kiran immediately responding \"They'll still be distracted because they are either jealous or attracted to her.\" Kiran then turned to Robin who finally spoke up. \"My name is Robin, Chrom's tactician and wife. I'm sure you'll find me useful on the battlefield. I hope my son will be of good use as well.\" Robin said with a smile not offended by the comments about her attractiveness as she often overheard people talk about it. \"Wait did you son?\" Alfonse asked only a couple of seconds later something happened. \"Hey mom what happened?\" A one inch ten year old blue haired boy popped up out of Robin's cleavage. Reasonably Alfonse screamed like a little girl \"WHAT IS THAT THING!\" and then ran away still screaming like a little girl. 'Yes very good summon indeed' Kiran thought to herself drooling slightly as Kiran was secretly a microphile and to her that little boy looked positively scrumptious (while she wasn't meaning it literally she was pretty sure he actually tasted good). Kiran didn't realize that her face was dangerously close to the boy. \"Sorry but I only allow people I have absolute trust in handle my Morgan.\" Robin said putting her hand in front of Kiran's face. 'So his name is Morgan a perfect name for someone as adorable as him.' Kiran thought to herself before backing away. \"Thank you for that information, I'll lead you to the castle where we can get you a room.\" Kiran said now knowing what her goal was, getting Robin's trust so she could get to Morgan (the boy in question retreating into Robin's bosom)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A NEW DAY BECKONS!' Anna yells from the door way, grinning widely when Robin falls out of the bed and flops to the floor with a  thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What was that for?' Robin asks, though it comes out as more of a growl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're at war, can't exactly have a lie in now can we? Wait Kiran didn't tell you? Damn it woman, if I didn't know it was natural I'd worry her brain had been melted with excessive hair dye' the red head sighed loudly 'There's this world, the Emblian Empire who use the heroes from other realities to conquer worlds, and we are here to stop them. Maybe now is the best time to get you to meet Corrin, she should be able to explain it better than I'm doing' Anna sighs and steps to the side, Robin pulling herself up with a grunt and moves to follow her, after checking that Morgan is alright (he gives her a smile and a thumbs up)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio had just reached what Robin assumed to the main Hall when a voice called from some kind of speaker 'Commander Anna, a situation has come up we need you here immediately'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it, this isn't going to be a good day. I gotta go, Corrin's around her somewhere she won't be that hard to find. See you later' Anna yelled before running off, leaving Robin confused and alone, she hadn't even been told what Corrin looked like how was she supposed to find her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm purple locks may be a little crazy, but it seems we both have the same tastes in women' a silky tone was heard behind Robin, turning she found herself looking at an old friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tharja?' Robin says, the dark mage stepping forward to bury her face in the tactician's large bosom, something the Plegian hadn't done since before she married Henry, well other than a couple of times while pregnant with Noire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh such a goddess amongst mortals, so much lovingly prepared dough to be kneaded' Tharja chuckles to herself before blinking owlishly at the set of eyes staring at her from Robin's cleavage. When Morgan pushes himself a little further forward to be properly seen Tharja was surprised 'Well, well, such a little cutie, I bet you're quite the tasty morsel' she opens her mouth wide to catch the younger tactician when she was gagged by Robin's long fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stay away from my son' Robin hissed then shuddered as she removed her fingers from the sorceress's throat 'Sweet Grima's tits I forgot you got off on that stuff'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know me so well lovely, how are we not married?' Tharja asked with heart eyes and a love-struck grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not into you like that, we're just best friends' Robin answered and Tharja pouts 'Say do you know where Corrin is?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes she's 1 floor down and to the left, most likely still messing around with mini me. Bring brain bleach' she giggled before skulking off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself Robin re-adjusted Morgan before following the even more insane version of her friend, sidestepping a pink&amp;blue haired woman that made Aversa and Tharja look sane before finding a door marked 'Corrin'. Thinking nothing of it she pushes the door open and walks in... regretting the decision instantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bed was a straighter haired doppelganger of Tharja with her tongue down the snow white haired woman beneath her's throat, as her large breasts were squeezed and bounced by the other girls' long bony fingered hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh love you're perfect as ever' Rhajat moaned as she separated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course I am, I don't think you'd have married me otherwise my dark Queen' the red eyed girl teased before kissing her cheek 'Now get off love,  we have company' she whispered, smirking when the dark mage yelps and bounces off her lap as though burned 'Hello, you must be new, not only does Anna send newbies to me but also you don't know my door being closed means I'm having alone time with my wife' Robin blushes and Corrin's grin just widens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anna said you could explain things better than she did' Robin explains to which Corrin nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably. She mentioned the Emblians right?' nod 'How they take heroes to be their fighters to conquer other worlds?' nod 'That we're here to stop them?' nod 'Then what do you need to know?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did I get here?' Robin asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, that is because of the Summoner, the hooded chick that greeted you when you first arrived. She has the ability to pull heroes to this realm, yes I know similar to the Emblians but she isn't trying to conquer or rule anything, she's just trying to fix things' Robin nods once more in understanding 'Anything else?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, not right now'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, Welcome to the Heroes Guild' Corrin greets <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what next?</span></div></div>",

She is basically a living tower with how tall she is, now lets check out the back door.\" Rhajat walked around to behind Robin and gasped \"Wow her butt is just as big as her chest this woman is truly a goddess among mortals.\" \"Rhajat are you trying to cheat on me in front of me?\" Corrin asked half-teasing, Rhajat going in front of Robin to answer. \"Why of course not she's just eye candy\" Rhajat quickly turned to Robin \"No offense I'm sure your a wonderful person\" Then turning back to Corrin \"But you are the real deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally turning back to Robin and looking up at her. \"So do you wanna have a three some?\" Rhajat asked, Robin snickering a bit before holding up her hand. \"While I am flattered by the offer but I have to say I'm already happily married.\" Rhajat pouted while Tharja poked her head out from the side of the door. \"Wait a minute you are you married to?\" Tharja asked in disbelief \"Why Chrom of course\" Robin said somewhat confuse wondering who the Robin of Tharja's world married. \"Why am I not surprised that a female version of Robin would be married to Chrom.\" Tharja said walking into the room. \"Wait what do you mean by female version?\" Robin asked in confusion. \"Well you see for some reason you and I have male counterparts in other worlds, so Tharja here comes from a world where you're a dude.\" Corrin answered than sniffing the air and tilting your head. \"What do you have in between your chest?\" Corrin asked Robin decided to amuse the woman by pulling out Morgan and placing him on her breast. \"This is my son Morgan, Morgan this is Rhajat and Corrin.\" Robin introduced Morgan giving a wave saying hello. Rhajat walked over to Robin looking at the little boy. \"Corrin when we get kids we're going to shrink em.\" \"Wait a minute if your married than is this child your actually kid?\" Tharja asked walking over to Robin as well this time not touching Morgan. \"Of course, why else would I refer to him as my son?\" Robin asked confused, Tharja shrugging \"I don't know maybe because he was your servant and you had some sort of mommy kink.\" Causing Robin to cringe a bit before Corrin speaking up this time. \"So what spell did you use to shrink him?\" Robin chuckling in response \"No spells just a little bit of luck is all.\" \"So weird genes?\" Tharja asked Robin shaking her head no. \"Well in my world male plegians have a ten percent chance of being born like Morgan.\" Robin answered before a speaker went off. \"Can Robin please go to Kiran's room?\" Robin sighed before placing Morgan back into her cleavage hiding him from the world. \"I swear if she does anything creepy she'll end up being punctured with arrows.\" Robin said leaving the room pulling out a red tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had a mythical tome she had found in the cellar when she was trying to find Sumia wedding ring she had dropped. The tome was called Yonduon and apparently created red arrows made of energy that Robin could easily control and were devastating against infantry units (basically its a magical version of Yondu's whistle arrow from Guardians of the Galaxy but there is more than one arrow)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had walked into Kiran's room hoping that what the summoner wanted wasn't too unreasonable. \"Oh hello Robin, before I can send you out to fight I have to talk to you about Morgan.\" Robin mentally sighed before replying. \"Okay what do you want to talk about?\" \"Well you see I'm concerned that if you go to battle Morgan may end up getting hurt or lost if he falls out of your bosom, so possibly before you go into battle you could leave him with me as I never go into battle myself.\" Robin laughed before answering, \"Listen Kiran, Morgan is safest with me, as for getting hurt, Morgan is capable of taking boat loads of punishment, heck he willingly allows himself to be eaten at times. As for getting lost, the odds of Morgan falling out of my boobs are the same as Chrom deciding to cheat on me with Cordelia; its in the negatives.\" In fourteen different worlds Cordelia starts crying. Kiran nods \"You seem pretty confident in yourself but I will still need to examine Morgan.\" \"Your drooling\" Robin simply stated which was true as there was some drool on Kiran's face (less than on the first day) Robin sighed before pulling out Morgan. \"Fine you can 'examine' him but I'm staying in the room to make sure you don't do anything creepy.\" At examine Robin made air quotes before handing Morgan over to Kiran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summoner was internally drooling up a storm as she was moving Morgan around in her hand to examine him. \"Amazing how could one so small survive in a world so much bigger.\" Kiran asked Morgan surprisingly taking the attention well. \"Well I have so many people around me who love me, so that helps.\" Morgan answered with a small smile. 'I wonder if later I could try summoning a tiny Morgan without Robin?' Kiran thought to herself but to make sure she decided to check Robin's stats. This Robin used a red tome, had ignis as the trigger skill. Kiran checked Robin's skills list and was surprised at what she saw. Apparently Morgan was considered a skill which had healed five hp every turn which made Kiran believe that Morgan could use healing magic. As well Robin had skill that was actually called sexiness which had three levels to it, the skill line basically was supposed to prevent opponents from fighting Robin but the max level of sexiness prevents enemies from not only from engaging combat with her but also prevents them from moving if they are at a certain distance. The icing on the cake being they can't counterattack if Robin is at half or less hp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done examining Morgan he checks out.\" Kiran says handing the boy back to his mother. \"You know Robin I need to put you on a team so you could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Tharja screeched in pain, \"So you wanna play dirty, then let's play dirty.\" Tharja hissed when the two dark mages started hitting each other which continued to the point where they were on the ground, biting, and scratching, kicking and punching. Robin finally had enough and separated the two Tharja's. \" Enough stop fighting, I want both of you to stop fighting go to the infirmary and make up or else Morgan will be the only who get to 'please me'!\" Robin shouted, the two Tharja's eyes widening for a second before they stared at the ground muttering as they made their way to the infirmary (Tharja just following her smaller self.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked down at her son and sighed \"Sorry you had to see that kid, now lets go have some proper alone time.\" Robin says walking to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Well she had until she heard some very familiar giggle, freezing in front of a room with a spiral eye she pushed it open slowly (learning from the last 2 times) and stared in shock at what she saw<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was sitting on the table with his hands full of cake frosting, a mini cupcake between his legs, while Kiran had a large cupcake stuffed in her face (a fact which would at some point lead Roibn to theorise the woman having a disarticulating jaw), grinning around the treat as Morgan laughed his frosting covered face off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah hem' Robin coughs drawing all attention to her, Kiran pales (somehow) while Morgan waves his sticky hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi mom, look at what Kiran got me, cake for breakfast. Plus she was showing me her explodey stick. it's awesome' he cheered happily and Robin could only look at him, a part of her wondering how he could be so comfortable around a stranger, were all boys that won over by explosions?

Aversa is super big and cuddly so I have lots of space to move around, her tummy is also really nice. Lucina is like mom but she has blue hair like me. Lucina is maybe one size smaller than mom. Lucina and Aversa have a three way tie of the coziness of their belly, breasts and butt.

Morgan yells/asks getting surprised looks from the Fates Queens 'Elise mentioned him when she was talking with me and Kiran'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's Kiran and I Morgan' Robin corrected 'So what's the issue?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhajat's fidgeting increased slightly 'Well  given his heritage Kana is quite the magical prodigy, always fiddling and tinkering with magic as he pleases. The problem is that it backfired this morning and now we have this' Corrin opens her hands to reveal a small spiky grey haired boy in similar armour to her, with large purple eyes staring up at Robin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh he's so cute!' Robin squees before she could help herself, Kana yelping and curls into himself, a soft glow of magic later there was the cutest snow white dragon on Corrin's palm... until it lept off the dragon Queen's hand onto Rhajat's bosom and tried burrow into her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Robin! You scared him' Corrin hisses, Robin looking noticeably scolded, having her own tiny child she should know better but until now Morgan at been the only one she'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry Corrin, um should we get him out of there?' she asks pointing to Rhajat's chest, which still wriggled with the dragon's squirming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nah he'll be fine, besides he loves cuddling up to his mama's big titties' Rhajat answers, leaning down to kiss the small reptilian head that peaked out for a second before slipping back in 'Now I'm sure you're wondering why we're here'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A little, it obviously has something to do with Corrin'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Correct, we were hoping that, as you are the only other person with a shrunken child you cold give us some advice on caring for him, even if it's just until we come up with a reversal spell or cure' Corrin explains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I don't know how much advice I have that is relevant, having somewhere safe to keep him and move him around is already sorted by Rhajat's bust, though your breasts and both your behinds would be adequate size to keep him in as well'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin smiled as she snaked a hand around Rhajat's hip, pinching her rear so the witch would hop up, enough to be pulled into the Dragon Queen's lap 'That's a good start, we have used magic to determine any other traits or effects the shrinking may have caused: he is indigestible and more sturdy than he would be normally, and his dragon form is now larger than he is normally, usually he could become a dragon the size of a small cat, it's one of the reasons he's so comfortable rubbing against Rhajat's breasts, he does it a lot as a dragon' as she lists these things Robin notices Sapphire blue eyes peering out of Rhajat's canyon, seems even if he's hiding he's still watching her in case she does anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, then you can add your stomachs to the list of safe havens for Kana, you need some kind of support system, other lovely ladies willing and able to keep little Kana safe and sound, I have my sister, MY Tharja, my daughter Lucina, their friends Noire and Severa and finally Lissa my sister in law'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhajat nods in understanding 'Well I suppose other than us there's mother, then Camilla who's bust is the closest our world has to you, Elise, Sakura may be a little too timid, Hinoka worries me at times but she's VERY protective, Felicia or more likely given her accident prone nature her sister Flora and finally there's the most surprising, Corrin's practically a <i>'sister from another mister'</i> Charlotte. I mean I worry about her seducing the little hatchling similarly to when I used to worry about my then girlfriend now wife, but she has a very strong protective streak and has the T&amp;A to protect Kana from any attacks that may occur when near him'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay that's good, now I don't really know how it works for dragons but tinies lose heat very quickly, you need to either make a specially insulated sleeping area, or more easily at least for the moment her needs to sleep in a highly insulated place on your body, like your breasts, behind or in your stomach. I do it all the time with Morgan and he's fine' Morgan nods in agreement with him mother, those nights he actually prefers to when he sleeps in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That won't be a problem, beddy bye will be between my boobies for the foreseeable future, that good baby?' white light filtered from her cleavage before a very human head peaked out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're really warm mama' he smiled, Rhajat and Corrin knowing he flashed pointed teeth, then turned to Corrin 'Mommy, can I stay here? Please!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin chuckled and ruffled his hair with her index finger 'Of course baby, whatever you want' Kana grinned before Corrin gently pushed him back down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So anymore questions?'

While Kiran didn't squee like Robin she did drool somewhat with a creepy look. \"So we're wondering if Kana will affect us in battle.\" Rhajat said napping her fingers, Kiran stopped drooling and checked Rhajat and Corrin. Both were four stars and had on the stronger side of the Heroes she had. Kiran was not necessarily surprised to see that Kana didn't count as a skill, as while he technically was summoned with Corrin (as in the they counted like one unit and it was lucky that Ehajat was summoned in that same session, fun fact crazy Tharja and Elise were in the same summoning session, I'm done talking in the brackets, enjoy) but Kana didn't count as a skill than and he didn't count as a skill now. Kiran got out of checking mode (sorry can't think of a cooler name it can be changed later) to talk. \"Well Kana doesn't really affect you guys so for combat what you can do with him is either have one of you go into combat and the other looks after Kana. Both of you going into combat but the one holding Kana has to be extra careful to not lose him or leave him with someone else when you two go into combat.\" Kiran explained to the couple. Rhajat and Corrin looked at each other. \"You guys don't have to stick with one decision for what you'll do.\" Kiran reassured to the women who sighed glad they didn't have to go with a permanent decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck happens now?</span></div></div>",

I want to see the girl Aversa and Kaos tell me about, the snarky, energetic, openly gay dark mage, not this ylssian automaton. The question is how to give it to her, I can't use it directly or else she'll think I've cursed her, I guess Tharja will have to do, or else my Lissa, if she won't do it for me I'll just take her heart and cast the memory restoration healing charm <b>THROUGH</b> her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah Feck!'

'Ugh <i>Kaos was right, Ylssians are boring</i>' she complains internally, she still knew Robin was hot, no doubt about that but it seemed her amnesia extinguished the spark she'd been looking for.

They said it wasn't there place or their story to tell but they implied Kiran didn't have the best life and wasn't exactly able to learn proper social skills and etiquette because of that, so the girl sometimes went about things the wrong way simply because she never learnt there was a right/wrong way in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um hello Miss Robin, I brought back Morgan who I found wandering the halls tonight.

She kissed it gently, making a wish to keep this feeling before pushing it back into the right side of her chest and sliding into her bed, she had a lot of work to do and that included yelling at idiots, lack of sleep would just make her irritable and more violent.

Getting no arguments Robin closed her mouth and swallowed, flopping back onto the bed when she feels Morgan reach his final destination, rubbing her stomach gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Goodnight Morgan' she coos<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Night Mama' she feels before she drifts off to sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Robin finally wakes up the next day she was greeted to an unfamiliar weight on her body, ordinarily she would assume it was Lucina, Aversa, Noire or Tharja.... okay it could still be Tharja here but it was still a shock. Cracking open one eye she quickly opened the other when she sees her intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on top of her, dead to the world and a lot lighter than the grandmaster expected was Kiran, currently using her left tit as a pillow and mumbling incoherently into the bouncy flesh, then there was not only that but the fact the Maleficarum had somehow managed to get her arms under Robin so her hands were each palming one of her ass cheeks. There was a part of Robin that wanted to kick the shit out of her, another that wanted to embrace her Plegian heritage and start a Yuri harem starting with the purple haired summoner and Tharja, but the largest part was her maternal side which noticed just how young the summoner looked when she slept, the stress of her duties made her look to be late 20's early 30's, but here and now, passed out and half buried in Robin's cleavage she looked just barely Lucina's age of 21, 19 at the youngest. Robin's maternal side would be blamed if she was asked why her reaction to someone breaking into her room and molesting her as well as sleeping on top of her is to coo and run her long fingers through their hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the peace had to end, Kiran waking up from Robin's attention, yawning with her jaw dislocating enough to swallow one of Tharja's boobs (but still too small to do more than suckle on Robin's) then blinking herself into awareness and finding herself staring into Robin's eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well damn, how much trouble am I in?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Depends on why you're here, and how quickly you let go of my ass'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran blushed but did as she was told 'I came into to grab Morgan for breakfast, you know, try make up for the sucky first meeting and all, but he wasn't anywhere to be found, I even checked your cleavage, they were just as soft and warm as I imagined...' Robin coughs loudly as Kiran was now distracted and drooling 'Right sorry, I guess I haven't really had much time for sleep lately, so seeing as I was already here and you are so soft and comfy I kind of passedoutontopofyou' she finished quickly but Robin understood and pouted the girl was running herself ragged trying to keep the realms safe, doesn't leave much time for personal care as she was well aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran braced for a slap but instead Robin continues playing with her hair 'You are a pervert, but you are also really cute' the summoner looks at her confused 'I mean I can't stay made at that face, if you had chubbier cheeks I'd squeeze them. Now if you'll excuse me I need to let Morgan out for breakfast, goodbye' Kiran turned bright red and manoeuvred herself from Robin's bed, blushing and apologising as she left which just amused the tactician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the tricky bit, sliding her long fingers down her throat she coughed up Morgan in a matter of minutes, the boy damp but unharmed as per usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morning mom'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morning kiddo. are you ready for breakfast?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep! Can we have pancakes?'

When it fades Kiran's codex alerts her to and logs the summon of a 5star hero, at which point she looks up and sees her: Amazonian even when compared to Robin, near white platinum blond hair, darker skin tone than previous Awakening verse summons, enormous assets barely contained in 'armour' Kiran just about calls it, including a rather cool headdress/collar of feathers and spikes as well as an intricate series of purple coloured tattoos covering her exposed skin. Kiran was blatantly drooling but she did not care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin bit her lip as she sees the orb summon her big sister, as well as the effect it was having on Kiran, her eye was twitching and drool was escaping the left side of her mouth. Taking pity on the reptilian girl she places a hand on her shoulder 'Just go for it' she whispers, Kiran not needing to be told twice as she runs up to Aversa and tackle hugs her, Robin blinks when she is reminded of just how big Aversa's breasts are, Kiran's head disappearing into her exposed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAversa actually take it all in her stride, running her long fingers along the smaller girl's spine, her breasts bouncing in what Robin assumes is Kiran's giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi Aunt Versa' Morgan greets, getting the flier's attention away from her purple haired limpet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh there you are darlings, having fun?' she asks as though they had gone on holiday, not transported across reality<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's great, dragon lady is crazy fun like Tharja and we had pancakes for breakfast' Morgan chirps happily, grinning widely the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really? Well we do need to catch up. Darling could you please let go?' there is muffled noise and more jiggling flesh to which Aversa laughs 'Come on cutie, I want to see your face' she coos. Kiran's head leaves Aversa's cleavage with a slight pop, an inhumanly wide grin spread across her features<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You think I'm cute?' she asks with awe filled eyes, squeeing loudly when Aversa nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what's going to happen.... oh. I like this world already' Aversa grins and when Robin gives her a questioning look hold up her weapon: a blue tome with the words <b>'Lanza del Rel\u00e1mpago' </b>written in a teal colour. Upon seeing the title Kiran starts cackling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<i>Lanza del Rel\u00e1mpago</i> is from the anime BLEACH. It is an attack used by Ulquiorra in his final form and is probably the strongest thing he can do. It formed a green lance/javelin which he then throws to cause a huge 'fuck off' explosion [<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRml9CIRkTU\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRml9CIR...</a> in case anyone wants to see what I mean]. The tome does something quite similar, forming a blue lance which is shot at the opponent and explodes into pure magical energy/damage)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, where is my nephew?' Aversa asks, Morgan bouncing up and down to catch attention amusing her to no end as she plucks him from Robin's chest and pulls him into a hug.... where she promptly losses him 'Well fuck!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighs 'Everyone seems to make jokes about my bust, but I have never lost my son between my tits' she says sliding her hand in and pulling Morgan out of Aversa's cleavage, none the worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAversa just laughs 'So what are we here for?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Protecting reality from world hoppers who want to inslave all the worlds by using heroes they control to conquer it' Robin explains bluntly, Morgan nodding along which stopped Aversa from calling bullshit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really? Huh, well at least this place gave us the tools for the job' she grins maliciously, as she slips her tome back into her coat and asks to get a Pegasus befitting her stature, Kiran happily jumping at the opportunity so leads them to the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Besides I was planning on sparring with Peri and Gwendolyn anyway.\" Effie explained before leaving. \"So Robin, is it okay if for today's battle that I can hold onto Morgan?\" Aversa asks before Tharja butts in. \"If anything I should hold onto Morgan, you are a flier and I have been here longer than you.\" Tharja argues to the dark skinned woman. \"Well you have been here for a day, Robin was here for much longer and I think she needs a little alone time.\" Aversa says, Robin sighing before saying her piece. \"Actually Aversa I have been here for about three days, well actually less since I was summoned at midnight of all times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran coughs loudly getting the attention of the Plegians and Nino. \"Sadly I have to tell you that in combat only Robin can have Morgan.\" Kiran says to the Plegians. \"And why do you say that?\" Tharja asks glaring at the summoner. \"Well Morgan technically counts as a skill, so while he can be 'unequipped' Morgan like all the other skills can't be traded back and forth. While technically there is the inherit skill option but that would erase Robin from existence and I don't want to do that at all.\" Kiran says the four women and Morgan blankly staring at Kiran before going into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the battles were to say the least, a bloodbath. Aversa's new tome was a force of nature blasting enemies left and right with her magic spears. A couple of times even Robin's arrows would encircle her sisters spears (sort of Decidueye's Z-move) creating even bigger explosions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kiran had decided there has been enough destruction for the day they had been called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had spent the rest of the day with her family and Tharja doing a bunch of different things. Morgan learning from Aversa that Lucina, Severa and Noire had all missed him and Robin wishing they could see them again (While Robin and Morgan had only been gone for a couple of days Plegians are known to be very attached to their loved ones, and while Severa is Ylissean is also a Tsundere who tend to also get attached.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt bedtime Morgan and Robin were in their pajama's in their bed (well technically Robin was in the bed and Morgan was on Robin but you get the point) \"Hey mom can I sleep on your stomach tonight?\" Morgan asked with a puppy dog look, amusing Robin very much. \"Of course kiddo but just so you know I get to pick where you sleep tomorrow okay?\" Morgan nodded as Robin lifted up her shirt a bit so she can place Morgan on her soft (and somewhat chubby) stomach. Morgan laying on his own stomach hugging his mom. Robin laid all the way down on her back knowing she wouldn't roll over in her sleep (Robin out of all of the people Morgan normally sleeps with stays still the most while sleeping. Tharja on the other moves a lot in her sleep so Morgan can only sleep on the outside of her stomach if she was awake so he wouldn't fall off or get squished despite the fact he was practically invincible.)

Sleep on your lovely chest like we do sometimes back home'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin laughed 'Acctually.... he's in my butt'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ha! I told you she could have hidden him there, but you said I was being a pervert who wanted to fondle that fine ass. Which is partly true but still, he was exactly where I told you.' crazy grinned widely, until she was smacked in the shoulder by Robin's Tharja<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pervert!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um Tharja you're just as bad' Robin piped in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja sighed but nodded 'True but she's much more obvious' she points to crazy who was blatantly staring.... again, especially as her drooling had made Robin's shirt see-through, the perky boob on display for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin groans loudly 'That's it, out, out, out!' she yells shooing the dark mage duo out of her bed, pinching the bridge of her nose before changing her shirt and finally freeing Morgan from his '<i>bed</i>' 'Hey kiddo, morning!' she greets smiling as he yawned and blinked himself to consciousness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey mom, was there yelling earlier, I thought there was yelling'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, Tharja and Tharja.

The best chance she had was when it summoned Noire, the cute and psychotic archer with the nice big boobs but even she was smaller than Tharja, never mind Robin and now Aversa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was disappointed but not surprised, Robin, Aversa and Tharja were full blooded Plegian mages, their size came with the territory, Severa was a Ylssian, Lucina was half and half and while Noire was also purely Plegian she was also young and still developing, she'd probably match Tharja one day at the very least. Still they were all very sexy ladies that she didn't mind staring at and fantasizing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlotting the last orb into Breidablik Kiran crossed her finger as she prayed for another lovely lady and fired. There was a bright flash that had the summoner shield her eyes, only opening them when she heard a silky, seductive voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello darling' the voice cooed and Kiran looked to see a lavender haired vision, tight armour accentuating her figure and forming a tight crevice with her cleavage, a skirt short enough she'd flash her full rear just by turning around and the sway of her wide hips, the summoner was hooked even before she found breathing to be difficult, Camilla having pulled the maleficarum into a hug, the girl's head nestled between the dragon rider's breasts 'My aren't you the cutest thing, you're almost more lovely than my sweet Corrin, you're just pwecious. You haven't seen her around have you?' Camilla asked, Kiran too busy in marshmallow heaven to answer, as was soon pointed out to the Nohrian princess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She can't answer you if she can't breathe' Severa deadpanned, the others busy with family reunions to really pay the last summon that much attention. Camilla blushed slightly before releasing Kiran, the girl gasping for air, even though there was still a wide grin on her face. Severa grunted something that barely resembled '<i>perverts</i>' before she was pulled into a hug by the crazy lady<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh darling you were summoned too, did Corrin and Rhajat get here safely?' Camilla asked, then she stopped and frowned 'Wait, you aren't Selena, you're much too young.' she pouts and for some reason Severa feels bad 'Who are you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Kiran regains the use of her brain and starts filling in the gaps 'Severa is another version of Selena, one who didn't have to live through a warzone and timetravel, she's proof they won. The version that did those things later went to another world with Owain and Inigo, later known as Odin and Laslow, your world Miss Camilla' she explains to which the mildly crazy princess nods in understanding before pulling Severa into another hug (much to the younger girl's annoyance)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You may not be my retainer but it's still lovely to see you darling' she says as she spins around happily, grinning like a loon until the others finally notice her and Robin &amp; Aversa stop her 'Ahh, you're no fun' she pouts again, crossing her arms over her chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighs 'So what now Kiran?' she asks the summoner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kiran wants to see the new summons in action, so sends them to deal with some emerging Emblian forces in a far off world<br>\r\n2.

He squeezed and rubbed where he was supposed to, Aversa making her usual contented sighs and whistles that told him he was doing it right. He pulled himself up her massive chest, reaching his destination to rub against her growing nipple<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Morgan, you're going to make a very special girl so happy one day' Aversa sighs, gently flicking his hair with her long nail as he finishes with her breasts, now lying against them looking a little tired, he didn't mind though he liked helping his family de-stress especially through breast and butt massages, at least they were soft, squishy and comfortable to lie against, the back was tiresome and Aversa in particular wriggled too much for him to massage her feet, maybe that was why the girls were better, they could hold the colossal Plegian still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So my lovely little worker bee, what next?' she asks when she see's he's ready to go again.</span></div></div>",

He remembered learning that a couple years back when he tried to massage Noire's tight rear through her panties, and considering how loud and expressive she had been when Morgan hug squeezed her sensitive nipples, she was currently silent with a pout Nowi would be proud of on her face, all while Morgan was doing his usual level of work. It was embarrassing, no matter how helpful when Tharja slammed him into her right cheek and squeezed a handful (to her) of Noire's behind, getting a startled yelp out of the archer, before dropping the tactician into her bra while a blushing Noire removed her panties before lying on her front again... at which point things worked out as they were supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAversa had no such issues, in fact the bounciness of her hind halves (as they were too big to be called quarters) made Morgan's job a lot easier, retaining a trampoline like quality that enabled him to get enough strength into his massaging around the main body of her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill there was one thing that he didn't like about massaging Aversa: how stoic she was. Aversa didn't grunt, sigh or moan when he worked, probably because she thought it might be awkward for him to hear those noises from his aunt but he didn't, in fact he kind of liked it because it told him he was doing it right. Sure Tharja made him blush as it felt like she was having an orgasm at times causing him to turn red as a tomato (and usually ending with a joking attempt to eat him as 'one of her 5 a day') but at least he knew A) she was enjoying it and B) she was messing around as Tharja is known for. Noire and Severa were especially 'appreciative' when he rubbed their breasts and butt respectively and even Robin had little pants when he released a particularly tight cluster in her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he had a secret weapon, Aversa had one extra sensitive point just above the crack of her ass at the edge of her coccyx, and Morgan planned to be extra rough with it to get a reaction out of her. He worked the rest of his massage properly, even gripping her cheek and wriggling it so he'd swing back and hit a point just right, until he was almost done, just one thing left on his mental list. He gently slid down her hill like ass till he reached his destination, Aversa sighing contently as she thought he was done, so he was undisturbed when he kneeled at the edge of her crack and dug his fingers into this sensitive point, giving it a squeeze and even a small nip. What made him think he went a little too far was when Aversa started to make noise more like Tharja then Robin, then the way her ass shook and bounced around him, lasting about 5  seconds before the now panting dark flier plucked him off her behind and brought him to her front<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really kid? What the Hell?' she asked between breathes, Morgan frowning and feeling bad or what he did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry Aversa, it's just you never react to what I do, sure you say I did well but everyone else makes al these sounds to show their appreciation for my work, you're silent as a mouse. I just wanted to know I did a good job with you' Aversa awed and sat him on her breasts, rubbing his head affectionately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry Morgan. I held back because I thought you'd find it weird for me to make those kinds of noises being your aunt and all, if I knew you used it to gauge how well you were doing I'd have let it out, not let it bottle up to the point you had to play with my big red button to get me to open up' at Morgan's confused look she elaborated 'As I'm sure you're aware I have a rather strong pressure point right above my ass, the girls use it all the time to drive me over the edge, really wish cousin Ty hadn't taught us about pressure points and mana and all that stuff'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um Aunt V, I'm getting tired, think I can take a nap?'

As well a part of her hoped that her bun in the oven would be born small like Morgan, it was plausible for it to happen as when she first learnt she was pregnant Nyx had said how at times when two females make a baby magically and said baby turns out to be a male there are at times side effects due to the Y chromosome being artificially made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin arrived at Robin's room and knocked with a response saying for her to come in. On the bed Robin was cuddled up with Lucina who who was smiling. \"Hello Corrin, I want you to meet my daughter Lucina, Lucina this is Corrin.\" Robin introduced, Corrin walking over to the bed shaking the blunette's hand. \"So what brings you here?\" Robin asked getting off the bed, Lucina staying put. Instead of saying anything Corrin simply pulled Morgan out of her cleavage and putting him in her other hand. \"Hi Mom, hi sis!\" Morgan greeted with a grin. \"I had Aversa watch Morgan, how come you have Morgan, is Aversa hurt!?\" Robin asked concerned for her older sister, while she knew that Aversa was a ruthless fighter at times she could act without thinking ending up with problematic results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin explained to Robin and Lucina what had happened with Peri and the cavaliers demands. \"Why am I not surprised Aunt Aversa punched her in the face, I probably would of too, can't really say I blame her.\" Lucina mused stroking her younger brother as he was hugging her right boob (fun fact the top of Lucina's right breast has her Fell Brand.) \"Let's just hope that nothing goes wrong or else we would actually have to resort to punching her in the face multiple times.\" Robin sighed, her son was a magnet for women but for someone to actually be with Morgan they had to have Robin's utmost trust, or be with someone who had her utmost trust. \"Well I think I'll go back to my room.\" Corrin said as she was walking to the door. \"No you can stay besides you said you were pregnant right? Well as a mother of two I'm pretty sure I have some good advice.\" Robin smiled at the shorter royal. \"You know I think I'll take you up on that offer\" Corrin replied walking away from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately something ends up going wrong but what?</span></div></div>",

Aversa opened the door revealing Lucina, who twiddling her thumbs. \"Oh h-hello Aunt Aversa I know this is awkward but I found out my room was next to yours and I thought I should let you know.\" Lucina says somewhat nervously she did get along with her aunt it was just at times Aversa teased her which would sometimes lead to Lucina losing her temper. \"Well come in darling seeing as you're already here.\" Aversa invites taking the princess into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina noticed Morgan on the bed, \"Hey there Morgan how's it going?\" Lucina asked, her nervousness going away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina adored her little brother and took her job as a big sister more seriously than her future position as Exalt. Although both of siblings had envy towards the other that only their mother knew about. Lucina sometimes worried that her mother cared about Morgan. While Morgan on the other hand was worried at times that all of the people he loved would stop loving him in the long run as he knew that at some point he would stop being cute and at times Morgan would worry if the only reason people liked him was because he was cute. Because of this Morgan occasionally would try different things to make him either stop aging or make him normal sized or occasionally both. Unfortunately the time he successfully begged Aversa to try a size change spell on him it ended up causing Morgan to be in fire until Aversa dispelled it. As well the time when he tried to make an anti-aging potion when he drank it he became incredibly sick and was bedridden for a week, and by bed ridden it meant he was wrapped up in a blanket his size in Robin's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing good sis, I just gave Aunt V a massage, do you want one?\" Morgan asked to Lucina,\"A massage actually sounds good, as long as it's okay with Aunt Aversa.\" Lucina replied looking at her aunt who gave her a thumbs up for approval. \"Of course darling I actually need to catch up on a bit of reading my one condition is to stay in here.\" Aversa says walking over to a desk in the right side of room sat down and started reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina laid down on the bed and placed her it's-bites brother on her collar bone. \"I'm ready when you are Morgan.\" Lucina said, Morgan smiled in response and started rubbing and squeezing his sister's plush chest. Lucina showed her approval with soft moans rather than Aversa's sighs and whistles. Besides with size their were different aspects to the women he massaged, on the larger spectrum (Aversa, Robin and Tharja) it was more tiring to massage due the overwhelming size but on the plus side because of the larger pleasure points he could get more creative with how he dealt with them. On the smaller spectrum (Lucina, Severa and Noire) the smaller sizes (not that they were small just smaller compared to the people on the larger spectrum) he could massage for longer without needing the break with the downside being at times he had to be more careful where he rubbed/squeezed to make sure he wouldn't end up getting the wrong spot. (It actually happened with Severa once the ylissean yelping a bit in pain) Morgan continued rubbing enjoying hearing the sounds of approval his sister was making, while all of them felt the same pleasure some of the women were better toning down the approval sounds. (Aversa being first, then Robin, Lucina in third with, Severa and Noire tied for fourth, Tharja was dead last but that was probably her choice willingly making the loud animalistic, lustful loud moans when massaged)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Morgan that was very nice, I'm going to take my leave now.\" Lucina said taking Morgan out placing him beside her. \"Oh no darling I actually was able to finish my reading and I want you to be my test subject.\" Aversa said walking in front of the bed and snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Lucina's clothing was on the bed, without Lucina. \"Aunt Aversa what did you do!\" Morgan asked horrified, Aversa simply pointed at Lucina's clothes. Something crawled out of Lucina's clothes, that something was Lucina at exactly one foot tall. \"Aunt Aversa you shrunk me!\" Lucina said not mentioning the fact her assets were now the size of what they would of been if Lucina wasn't half ylissean. (Simply put they bigger compared to her body at normal size, still smaller than her mother's in curve to body scale comparison, I don't think I'm wording this right. \"Don't worry my dear niece it's only temporary I'll change you back today I promise.\" Aversa said smirking up a storm but she was really serious about changing her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I could hug you better like this.\" Lucina said still not realizing she was naked, although she was able to comprehend she was 12 times Morgan's size. Lucina bounded over to Morgan picked him up and hugged him Morgan's head being mushed between Lucina's breasts. \"Hey sis you do know you're naked right?\" Morgan asked his face being bright red since Lucina shrunk. Lucina looked down realization and screamed. \"Aversa I can't be seen like this!\" Lucina said Aversa chuckling in response. \"Well thankfully I have just the solution.\" Aversa picked up Lucina (and technically Morgan who was still being held by his sister) and slid her quite easily in her cleavage. Afterwards Aversa laid down on the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you feel everyday, this is amazing.\" Lucina moaned, while she didn't like being this size she did like being surround by the soft flesh. \"Do you want me to teach you to massage?\" Morgan asked Lucina nodding in response. \"Now I'm gonna show you all the right places, the three mains things you can do are rub, squeeze and push. Like so\" Morgan explained than demonstrated by pushing on one of Aversa's spots getting a content sigh from the mage. \"Now you try\" Morgan said Lucina instead of doing a simple push does a combination of poeful squeezes, rubs and pushes causing Aversa to give out loud lustful moans in response in far louder than Aversa. \"Morgan I want a massage\" Lucina said with lust in her eyes Morgan gulped and nodded. While Morgan never massaged anyone close to his size, Lucina being the closest being twelve times his size. Morgan squeezed his sister's chest getting moans of approval. After about ten minutes Lucina deemed Morgan done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And the side you got most of your magic from?' she grinned and Lucina gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your Plegian blood!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exactly Luci, and your bust and behind are physical proof of the internal tinkering Aversa has accidentally done to you'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina pouted slightly at this 'So if this was used on someone else...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It probably wouldn't have the same effect on them but who knows, your body had the potential for big boobs and cheeks, maybe that's what I'm reading and you could've ended up this big due to the spell anyway, even if you were a full Ylissian' Robin shrugged, this was completely unknown territory to her after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gives me reason to play with some more lovely ladies' Aversa jokes with a lustful smirk... until she gets a jab to the ribs from Robin 'Ow. Okay, okay. No messing around' she pouts but Robin was immune to the elder woman's moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know how anyone can put up with you' she sighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's my winning personality... also my perfect ass and tits but I'm much to modest to admit that' she teases and pulls her little sister into a hug of her own, being sure to press the grandmaster's face into her cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm starting to think you're the sane one of the family' Lucina says to Morgan who laughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And here I thought it was you'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny more discussion was interrupted by yet more knocking 'Who is it now?' Lucina mutters as Aversa releases Robin and opens the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why am I not surprised?' she says grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

It seemed Kiran's heart has met her match with her newest summon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in front of them looked like someone had started with Robin then pressed 'upgrade' like a dozen times: she was about a head taller and her bust was a few sizes larger then Aversa, her snow white hair pulled back behind her shoulder enabling the eye tattoos along her bare arms (one on each wrist, elbow and shoulder) to be visible to all. Her eyes were ruby red with slitted, draconic pupils (well she is the death dragon) and when she grinned she showed pointed teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello darlings' she purred, her voice was also like Robin's but it had a sultry undertone similar to a mix of Aversa and Tharja. While Robin and Aversa continued trying to wake the poor girl up Noire activated her scanner... and then shrieked/squeed, falling to her knees and mumbling incoherently, causing the newcomer to laugh 'Well that isn't something I've seen in a while' she says with an amused inflexions in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who are you?' Lucina asked suspiciously, hand finding it's way to Falchion's handle as the mimic of her mother just continued to smile. Well until she appeared to teleport across the room, putting herself into Lucina's personal space before putting her hand around the princess's neck and tilting it up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm actually disappointed you of all people fail to recognise me, I had assumed Naga would at least keep a portrait of her greatest rival somewhere, it's not like she was unaware I come back eventually, this is the 4th time so far' she chuckles as she gets a closer look and yep, that was that (originally) incompetent mage's mark in the girl's eye 'Oh Naga, what has your legacy become, mixing with Plegians, overriding my birth rights' she hissed when she felt another magic in the bluenette<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're Grima aren't you?' a voice squeaked below her, causing Grima to look down and see a small boy peaking out of Lucina's cleavage. She smiled and nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're the second one to notice cutie, the young one I'm surprised isn't one of mine was the first, you can get up now dearie' she called and Noire jumped up, standing rigidly till Severa gave her a sharp jab to the ribs. 'The angry one is right, you don't need to be so stiff, I'm not Naga after all' she teased, causing the pale archer to blush beat red and Aversa to chuckle despite herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Goddess' she greets with a slight bow which Grima acknowledges with a tilt of her head 'It is quite a surprise to see you in the flesh, and with memories intact, most of us assumed Robin was you're next life though she never regained your mind'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's not me, sometimes the genetic legacy spits out the right face with a fresh soul' Grima shrugs as Aversa nods in partial understanding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello sexy lady! Wait why am I on the floor?' Kiran asked in confusion, pouting as Grima looked to have disappeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You fainted Kiran, you're brain seemed to completely overload and explode' Robin explained as she helped the young summoner stand again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well isn't this a surprise, a doppleganger and a maleficarum in the same place, what luck do I have' Grima said with a smirk, slinking over and giving them both a once over 'Not quite a match but I can see where my bloodline had reached a peak for now, and this little one is at least cute, and such a rare sight even for one like me' she cooed as she runs her hand through Kiran's hair, not that Kiran noticed as Grima's huge breasts were bouncing right in front of her face, causing her to grin dopily and giggle. 'So does anyone want to tell m why I'm here?' she asks to the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being explained the situation to which she'd been brought into Grima happily agreed to help, both to protect this realm and to kill things, it seemed she was the origin of the Plegian bloodthirstiness if not their love of mayhem. The only problem was it was very quiet at the moment, meaning there was little for them to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

In Morgan's opinion Severa had the biggest butt out of all yliesseans which was because she had gaius for a dad and spoiled her with loads of sweet treats 85% of the fat went into her rear and the other 15% split off into her stomach and chest, although as far Morgan's knows sumia has the largest chest out of the Ylisseans (not counting Lucina as she was half plegian) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera was moaning in content glad she accepted the first time Morgan asked if she wanted a massage, she thought it was strange a little six year old asked if she wanted her butt rubbed but as Severa had recently hit puberty she thought  nothing of it at the time. Although what Severa thought was truly was strange was how Morgan willingly allowed himself to be eaten and enjoyed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Severa her massage had ended so she pulled up her pants, gave Morgan a kiss on the head thanking him. \"Okay Lucina you can have your turn with Morgan.\" Severa said as the Royal got out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Morgan nods causing the summoner to squee, then remove her shirt and lie on her back, exposing her self to the little half Plegian boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan learnt another side effect of her metamorphosis as she called it when he started his massage, her skin had the same feel of a snake's though without the noticeable scales of one as well as retaining the overall bounce and movement of human flesh. All it really meant was that he needed to be a little more forceful in order to get the same results for Robin or Aversa.

I had always wanted to have a little person so I made Aversa swear that she wouldn't tell anyone about you being born normally. I had used a powerful shrink spell which can only be reversed by the stomach acids of a dragon.

As well once the spell is broken it can't be reapplied.\" Robin explained, she looked over to Morgan who was crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you would do that. There were things I had always wanted to do such as learn to use swords and tomes, play the piano, bake, GIVE SOMEONE A REAL HUG, HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP WITH DAD, BUT NO YOU HAD TO BE SELFISH AND TAKE AWAY MY CHANCE FROM THE START!\" Morgan yelled the last half and stormed out with tears streaming down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was running as fast as he could unable to see due to the tears.

Hello. Must be an update Anna forgot to mention, cause I've never seen one of you before' Kiran shrugs 'Welcome to the fortress, I am the lovely and exotic Summoner Kiran, your new mis... wait a minute I'm the summoner how the Hell did you get here?' the girl's brain finally caught up to itself as she asked the important question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um hi Kiran, it's Morgan' Morgan greets timidly, the summoner blinks in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm, it seems you had a little growth spurt' she jokes, then frowns when she sees the effect it had on the short tactician 'Want to talk about it?'

I don't know what to think of this, my size was something that defined me but it also meant there were so many things she denied me the chance to do' the boy looked lost and confused, Kiran was unsure how to react so barrelled head on like normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm short and fairly flat' she blurts, confusing Morgan 'Those things about me limit what I can do as well as many opportunities I can and will have. But I still have the ability to do what I want. You say there were missed opportunities due to your size but until you grew back did you ever feel like something was missing, that you were missing out other than the natural reaction to someone else doing something you aren't. Your size has granted you many gifts too, your patented invulnerability and massage skills to name but a few' Kiran sighs 'I don't know what Robin was thinking when she did what she did, how much she thought things through or not, but she's still your mother and she loves you, you wouldn't see her as your hero and idol, and this wouldn't hurt so much if she hadn't made that much of an impression on you,that she didn't show you all the time  how much she loves you' Morgan sniffles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know that, but after this, I just can't be near her or Aversa at the moment, I need time to process everything. But there's nowhere else for me to go, I entered this realm in mom's cleavage, I don't have a room or even a bed of my own'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran hugged the still quite short boy 'There, there Morgi, everything will be fine. I'll have Anna set up a room tomorrow, and until then, you're a popular guy, I'm sure one of the lovely ladies of the fortress would let you stay with them for a night'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even you?' Morgan asks, causing her to laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes kiddo, even me' she answers and Morgan smiles widely and cuddled closer, her small bust still big enough for him to use to cushion his head as he listened to her heartbeat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where does Morgan spend the night?

The reason why Tiki wasn't the last one was because the Tiki in Robin's world had babysat Morgan a good number of times.) Kagero was blushing looking embarrassed. \"Sorry, its just that as Lord Ryoma's retainer I don't have much time to show emotion as he could call for me at any moment, wait is here?\" Kagero looked over to Corrin who shook her head no. \"Normally I paint in my free time but after seeing your adorable little boy I just couldn't help myself, I understand if you don't trust me since we just met five minutes ago but if there is anything I can do to earn your trust just tell me.\" Kagero explained to the amazonian tactician. \"That's not fair, what if I want to play with the little fella?\" Camilla pouted getting in front of Kagero. \"You already have two Corrin's I'm sure you don't need a tiny\" Kagero argued, \"ONE Corrin, this one's mine, scratch that they are both mine.\" Rhajat said pulling Summer Corrin towards her, now hugging both Corrin's. \"Well, how I'm gonna go into the hall think this through okay Kagero?\" Robin asked slowly getting a nod from the busty ninja<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin (and Morgan) and Tharja went into the hall to talk. \"So Morgan what do you want to do?\" Robin asked looking down at her son. \"This up to you, you're the adult here as well I know that as tiny and a child my opinion doesn't really matter at all.\" Morgan said before Robin could argue to Morgan that his opinion did in fact matter very much he hid himself deep into Robin's bosom where he couldn't be seen. Robin sighed before looking at Tharja. \"What do you think I should Tharja?\" \"Well both Camilla and Kagero just appeared so I don't really know if today should be the first day to let either of them look after Morgan which brings me to this fabulous idea, leave Morgan with me!\" Tharja grinned like a madwoman which just caused Robin to give an amused shake of the head and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin decided to think to herself a bit. On one hand there was Kagero or Camilla. Kagero seemed very eager to look after Morgan, but most woman Robin has met always are, as well if Kagero had bad intentions she would of waited until after she stole Morgan to express her desires. Camilla seemed very happy about the Corrins' but she might end up having to fight Rhajat (who note got along mostly with the Camilla from her world) so it would be nice to let Camilla be with Morgan as she gave off a motherly vibe. The negatives being that Camilla seemed very intense and somewhat obsessive which was not really a good thing when it comes to Morgan. Kagero by the looks of her was most likely a ninja which meant she would do a very good job at hiding Morgan and keeping him to herself if she desired and Robin did not want to lose her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand while Tharja was mostly joking she was a good choice as well for looking after Morgan. Tharja is Morgan's godmother so she had a right to be with him, as well at times Tharja treated Morgan like the son she never had (or yet so far, Robin has heard Tharja talk about trying to convince Henry to conceive another child). Since Tharja often helps with taking care of Morgan and being Robin's best friend she was the most trust worthy person here. Although the negatives for having Morgan with Tharja is that there was crazy Tharja who shared a room with her larger counterpart and had attempted to eat Morgan despite the fact she didn't know whether or not Morgan would be fine, which showed that crazy Tharja may somehow end up taking Morgan from the other Tharja and using him as a plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more thinking Robin made her decision of who to leave Morgan with, but the question is who?</span></div></div>",

Well until she pulls him out that is 'So buddy, I don't suppose you're any good at massaging?' she asks, not expecting anything near Morgan's reaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah a whole lot, Aunt V says I'm the best, and she's a Queen so she can afford the best anyway. Why, do you want me to do you?' his grin is so innocent and cute Kagero can't help but blush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, yes please Little One. If it's not a problem'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No problem at all, making ladies happy makes me happy' he smiles and Kagero can't help but return it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlrighty then, just give me a moment' she places him on the side of the bed and after some struggle removes her top, shortly followed by her restrictive bra. Now topless she picks up Morgan (grinning herself when she sees a light blush colour his cheeks), lies on her front and places him on her shoulder 'My back is probably the best place to start, and I took the liberty of removing all obstacles from your path' she folds her arms and lays her head on them waiting for Morgan to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero prided herself on her stoic demeanour, but 2 minutes with Morgan and she was panting like an animal in heat, he was releasing all her stress and tension beautifully and gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow you have a lot of tension built up back here, what do you do?' he asks midway down her back, by then she was working hard to string a sentence together<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was. The chief retainer. Of the Hoshidan. King. No time. For breaks or. Days off' she managed to get out, before moaning loudly as Morgan hopped up and down on a particularly sensitive part of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm nearly done your back Kagero, want me to continue on after?' Morgan asks just before he reached the base of her spine, her ass within arms reach of even his small form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh by the dragons yes, keep going till I'm a happy pile of goo Morgan. Just keep me in this bliss for as long as you can' Kagero answered with a coo, grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Morgan was finished where did the ninja lady move him?<br>\r\nTo her...</span></div></div>",

Did. You become. So. Good?\" Kagero said between pants. \"Well it was a super duper long time ago, Mother's Day was coming up so and I wanted to do something for mom, after over hearing aunt Tharja talking about how she went to a spa and got a massage which gave me an idea to give my mom a massage. So I asked my big sister Lucina if I could practice on her, she said yes so I kept on practicing on her until Mother's Day came along and I gave mom a super duper good massage. Word spread about my skills so anyone who felt comfortable enough with having a tiny little rubbing all over their body wanted me to massage them after that my skill just steadily grew.\" Morgan explained lowering the pleasure input so Kagero could properly hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan continued rubbing, Kagero could believe it really, she's infiltrated several places, defeated many enemies and was even captured at one point (which is canon in all three routes) yet now she was at the absolute mercy of a little boy smaller than her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero wanted to masturbate along with Morgan's massages but since she was topless the tiny boy would end up seeing it and asking questions and than Robin would get pissed. Kagero ended up orgasming, not even when she dated Saizo (it reveals in their supports that they used to be in a relationship) did she feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kagero, are you okay?\" Morgan said poking up from Kagero's cleavage with a worried look as she was panting in even more so than before. \"I'm. Fine. Has anyone. Told you. How. Great. You are?\" Kagero asked Morgan nodding before talking but Kagero didn't hear, she was off in her own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero looked at the clock she was almost half way up with her time with Morgan. Kagero frowned she wanted to be with Morgan more but if she accepted Robin's rules she would be given more responsibility.

He could see Kagero was beautiful and if nothing else when either they get back or Kiran manages to summon Noire he'll have another way to please his crush (both were at least aware of the other's feelings for/attraction to the other, they just weren't addressing them at the moment) as well as his highest quality breast massages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, if it makes you feel good' he answered, Kagero squeeling in joy internally, as she presses one arm across her chest to keep him from falling, before standing up and removing her lower garments, then lying back down and freeing Morgan from her bosom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay little guy, time to explore my inner cavern' she teased as she places him at the entrance to her womanhood, shivering when she feels him hand touch her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's really warm and sticky down here' Morgan comments 'Sweet too' the ninja blushes, nobody had 'evaluated' her like this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It just means you did a very good job earlier' Kagero replies, using her hand to open herself for the tiny tactician, who stepped in and each touch and step was felt in her brain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anything I should be looking for?' his voice was muffled both due to being inside her and from her clenching muscles but Kagero heard him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Most of it is smooth in there, find a bumpy ridge' she says, her leg kicking out when she feels him brush against it 'T-t-t-there it is!' Morgan didn't answer, but she could feel his small hands gently running along her sensitive area, her thighs clenching every time 'Damn it Morgan just squeeze the damn thing' she moaned in annoyance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he did, causing the usually well put together to lose all control as the same techniques that broke her when applied to her back and breasts were firmly applied to her G-spot. Her orgasm came fast and hard, gushing and sending Morgan out of her all the way to her feet. With most of her main body non-responsive she picked up the equally exhausted boy with her toes and placed him on her stomach, where her hands moved him up to her breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That. Was. Intense. Sure you didn't do this before?' Kagero pants tiredly to which Morgan shakes his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nope, 1st time doing it for real. Think it would be just as good for Noire, as it was for you?' he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow under normal circumstances she'd be angry if someone started talking about another girl after they'd done something like this together, but given she didn't actually know Morgan (so didn't expect there to be any feelings to hurt) and he'd made her cum more than ever before, she'd answer to Noire if he asked just to have some more fun with the little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't see why not, but remember, if she doesn't want it i'll always be around more more' she grins as wide and she can and Morgan chuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

It would appear my little godson is already a little studmuffin. Oh the size of his harem will prove size really doesn't matter, it'll probably span the multiverse itself' Tharja teased as she slinked into the room, Kagero rubbing her throat as she shifts into a chair without drawing Robin's ire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tharja how can you approve of this?' Robin asked, the Plegian laughed at the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Robin, how sad to lose so many important memories, such as puberty. We become active much earlier and reach sexual maturity by 15, or do you not remember Luci's C cups at 12? Be glad we take longer than our draconic ancestors, they reach maturity at 8. Morgan is the right age to be exploring his desires, and Noire is a good option given how they both feel for one another' the dark mage explains 'Plus I'm sure Shadowbust over there was good practice for his future Primary Wife' she smirks at Kagero who blushes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He did ask almost immediately after if I thought Noire would react the same to what he'd just done to me.

She flopped onto the bed and pulled out Morgan who had tears in his eyes. \"Aunt Tharja, are you mad because I love Noire?\" Morgan asked whimpering, Tharja laughing incredibly loud which was completely unlike her. \"Oh darling, I'm not mad at all, I actually approve it very very much, who better to be with daughter than my godson, sure there's the age difference but I don't  care about that at all. Besides you're lovely little fellow and you're perfect for my daughter. Now how about we wipe those tears and take a trip to tummy town?\" Tharja asked gently stroking the boy. Morgan nodded sniffed wiping his eyes. Tharja opened her mouth putting Morgan on her tongue, knowing now was not the time for mouth play she simply swallowed her godson and gently rubbed her stomach when he got to his destination. (Tharja eats Morgan the most with an incredibly close second with a tie of Robin and Aversa, third was Lucina fourth was Noire and Severa in last place as she hasn't eaten Morgan yet, something the small boy has been trying to fix.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was in her room sitting in a chair hands on her head thinking. A stranger shoved Morgan into her pants, the front of her pants to be specific as Robin and others have kept Morgan cuddled up with their rear quite often. What bothered her most about this was Morgan allowed it to happen which wasn't his fault he was young and didn't know what was right or wrong when it came to things like this. Now if Morgan was married and was doing things like this with his wife that would be an entirely different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Although Robin should of warned Kagero because when someone gets a massage from Morgan for the first time they don't think straight as they aren't used to the amount of pleasure being felt so it was slightly reasonable if she wanted to do that. Also Morgan just wanted to make her happy so like earlier he didn't know that he was too young to do things like that. Kagero liked Morgan which was always a good thing in Robin's book but still what happened was unacceptable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more thinking Robin decided what to do about Kagero</span></div></div>",

Putting his skills to work Morgan was able to squeeze large hand fulls of ass and keep the ninja purring like a happy kitten<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually temptation overcame him and he hopped onto her cheek, the mound being just as springy as he expected, bouncing his way to the top of the cheek where he continued rubbing. Once he felt he had done enough from his current position he slid down into her crack and continued the assaut: rubbing, squeezing, pinching and, as she wasn't a blood relation Morgan indulged as certain areas were given rather hard bites, the almost hickies causing her to moan obscenely as well as clench her ass around him. Morgan would e worried if this wasn't a common thing when he did it, he was jst lucky Kagero wasn't Tharja who on occasion when he was massaging her arse pinned him between her cheeks and reapplied her panties before going about her business with her own personal butt toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill just because it wasn't Tharja didn't make it any less intense to be squeezed and chewed up by Kagero's ass cheeks. Morgan was jostled around lot but that was true for all both them, Morgan getting jostled around did slow him down but didn't stop him slowly getting to all her points, well except one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust on the edge of her ass, where a certain nerve cluster sat, Morgan knelt in front of it and gently kissed the area. Of course there is a loud moan just before he started pinching and squeezing, which in turn led to his rather unique method of bringing non relatives to previously unknown heights when he bites down gently on the mass follower, Kagero practically screaming her orgasm and bouncing Morgan back where she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan finally managed to find his way out of her rear, glad to have had such a responsive target as she made his pants tighten and his insides heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is Kagero at the moment ?</span></div></div>",

Sure if somehow she managed to be resummoned by Kiran Robin would gruesomely murder her, but Morgan was worth the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the maleficarum she managed to avoid running into Robin or any of her friends, something that was surprisingly difficult due to the woman's friendly nature unless Morgan was involved. Still once she reached Kiran the rest was easy 'Miss Kiran?' she calls, drawing the smaller woman from her musings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh hello Kagero, what are you looking for?' she asks with a toothy smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero straightens her back and prepares 'While I'm honoured that I was chosen to assist in the endeavours you're undertaking, my duties to my kingdom and my people must always come first. I apologise, it's how I was raised and trained' she dropped her head respectfully, Kiran pouting before she sighs and nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't force you to fight for us, that would make us the same as the Emblians, so I will send you home' the summoner gets out of her chair and heads back to the summon room, Kagero following in confusion, though she also felt relief Morgan had decided to stop struggling and just relax inside her. Kiran finally stopped in the same room as Briedabrik before finally turning to the ninja 'Well here we are' she says sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero looks ready to ask what was happening when the girl clicked her long fingers and part of the ground gave way, a portal forming underneath it 'What is that?' Kagero asks worryingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The way home, it's sense where you came from and direct itself to that world' Kiran explains before giving the girl a push 'Ta-Ra' she grins with a shark like smile, as Kagero screams falling into the portal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Hoshido</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUMP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero groans and rubs her most likely bruised ass, then smiles when she realises she's home... and her passanger is still with her.

Ylissean Chrom wouldn't be cool with that and neither will Morgan or Lucina.\" Robin says, \"Come on Chrom isn't even here besides I bet Chrom has a tiny wiener and you two don't even 'do it' anymore.\" Crazy Tharja acusses \"Actually Chrom's size is actually average and he does a very good job at treating Robin like the goddess she is and they make love often enough I have divided my nights of being with Henry, watching Robin make love with Chrom and being with Henry while watching Robin make love and sleeping on Robin's lovely bed of a body.\" Tharja says shocking Robin (and being very very glad as Morgan couldn't hear any of this as well she still had to teach him about the birds and the bees). \"You watch Chrom and I make love!?\" Robin hissed Tharja nodding with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Tharja's huddled together a bit away from Robin talking in whispers now walking back towards her. \"Okay if you win we give you a massage that feels like a threeome while technically not qualifiying as love making.\" Tharja explains, \"Now for the rules, no one is allowed to get help from other people in either taking or protecting Morgan. Morgan has to stay on your person at all times but that should be easy for you, finally you can't keep Morgan in your stomach as that would be impossible to take him from you.\" Crazy Tharja explains \"And what would happen if I did keep Morgan in my stomach?\" Robin asked, \"Than I would force myself into your stomach <b>at full size</b>\" Tharja threatened to the tall woman. Tharja had actually managed to that once in attempt of being closer to Robin. For Robin it did actually feel incredibly amazing and she was aroused during the entire time although the problem was that Robin struggled to move during the time making it difficult to do any of her duties as well it took five days to get Tharja out as they had run entirely out of rescue staffs. \"Final rule Morgan is not allowed to know about the contest till it's over we don't want the little munchkin to worry his little head and if you don't agree to that we will steal all of your underwear.\" Tharja explained to Robin, \"Okay sure I got it\" Robin said blinking but when she opened her eyes the two dark mages were gone, probably plotting on how to steal her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Robin won't succeed in keeping her son but which Tharja succeeds in taking the tiny prince</span></div></div>",

She opened up her hand and saw a cute little boy and squeed. \u201cOh my gosh you\u2019re so CUTE! Forget banging Chrom I have this little cutie pie right here!\u201d Robin said unaware this was her own son she was talking to. \u201cUm, mom are you sick? It\u2019s me your son Morgan, and besides Chrom is my dad and you\u2019re his wife.\u201d Morgan said timidly very worried what happened to his mom. Robin laughed \u201cListen pee-wee I\u2019m not your mom, I\u2019m not even married yet. Wait a minute I get it, you\u2019re a fan of me, that makes sense why you have a similar coat to me and you were all snuggled up in my butt. Well don\u2019t worry my little shota I\u2019ll go along with this mommy kink ya got, momma will take reaaaallllly good care of you.\u201d Robin said smiling seductively as she dropped Morgan into her cleavage and left to find a good place to be with her new boy toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin eventually found a library and decided to go there. \u201cWhy hello sexy\u201d Robin turned around to see Tharja seductively dressed. \u201cWhy have a boy when you can have a woman, if you hand over that little boy of yours I\u2019ll give you the time of your life.\u201d Tharja purred but does Robin take the bait?</span></div></div>",

At this point Robin had already removed her robe and decided to push the sorceress up against a bookshelf and attack her neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You taste delicious love' Robin says as she licks along her collar bone, Tharja  moaning loudly when Robin roughly fondles her tits and ass, her obscene level of groaning only muffled by Robin's own breasts enveloping her head. 'You're not going to shut up are you dearie?' Tharja shakes her head, though only her eyes were visible over Robins bosom 'Fine, I remember seeing a room marked Robin just down the hall, that mine?' this time Tharja nods 'Great, lead the way cutie' she smiles and disengages from the dark mage, giving her a gentle shove and a slap on the ass to get her moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get to Robin's room Tharja finds herself shoved up against the now closed door, Robin proceeding to ravage her, the dark mage thinking she'd died and gone to heaven, pouting when the white haired woman stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aww, why'd you stop?' she asks/whines<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want to make this more fun for us both' Robin answers, grinning before using her magic to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Because I know you DS, no Robin can't snap out of it, beat the ever loving crap out of Tharja and go get Morgan, like the last time something like this was done)</span></div></div>",

As Mona walks out of the bedroom hall she notices that somebody left a brew in the cauldron, and it looked fresh too. \"Hello?.....anybody?\" Mona said groggily, she waited a few seconds, but after that she just shrugged her shoulders and headed off towards the kitchen once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, this whole ordeal was very troublesome for our tiny knight.

Ahem, Mona dearest, I need you too look down, like right now!\" P.K yelled to Mona . However, unknown to the bird-nosed chemist, his partner (both in a lab and romantic sense) couldn't hear him due to his smaller voice and the fact that she was still half asleep . Plague knight simply stood there awaiting an answer, expecting her to look down immediately. She did stop, but not for the reasons the plague doctor thought. Mona then shouted something towards the mostly empty room that plague knight couldn't hear properly due to it being much too loud for him. \"Gah!, jeez Mona, there's no need to shout and...\" the cloaked chemist then simply stopped an stares as he realized his love couldn't hear him and she began to raise her somewhat sweaty-looking bare foot above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it took to get him to start running, he ran as quickly as his tiny legs could carry him, luckily, the alchemist had some speed elixir with him, giving him the temporary ability to outrun his giant girlfriend's sweaty feet. Although p.k thought he was being incredibly impressive, this long distance he thought he ran was only a few steps for Mona. The two were nearing the kitchen when plague knights potions had run out and Mona had caught up with him. \"Mona! Mona! Please look down!\" The knight yelled in desperation, however, Mona still didn't hear him and her sweaty foot landed on top of the poor doctor. It was by no means a pleasant experience with the horrible smell and dripping sweat, but it wasn't as painful as one might have thought; while the pain was definitely still there from Mona's full crushing weight, her soles were also soft and dainty, leaving p.k with nothing but a few bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mona walked towards the kitchen, she could have sworn that she had stepped on something, but she was too tired to check what it was and she just kept on walking towards the kitchen. Once she arrived she took a bowl out of the cupboard and a box of cereal (Treasure knight brand of course) and began to pour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww...I'm completely soaked... and that hurt like hell\" plague knight complained to himself as he stood up after being stepped on by the same woman he shares a bed with. \"I can't believe she would do this, but I do suppose she's not doing it on purpose\" plague knight said. \"Well, whatever the case, I still need to get her attention\" he said.

Mona then twisted her foot for good measure, and went off to the dining room to eat her cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole ordeal had been nothing but pain and awfulness for the plague doctor though. \"Ha ha! Success!\" P.k exclaimed as he landed somewhat softly on the broken bits of cereal. Plague knight then looked up at his giant partner and saw that his falling had made a loud enough noise for her to hear him. \"Huzzah! Finally, Mona down here!\" The knight yelled whilst waving his arms and jumping. Mona then said something which was again too loud for the cloaked chemist to hear and she raised her bare foot above him. \"Mona...?\" P.k said as he watched the foot lower with incredible speed, and before he had time to even react, the sweaty foot landed on top of him and caused immediate pain. But this wasn't enough to kill the poor alchemist, Mona had purposely placed her foot on top of him so she could feel him squirm under her damp sole. \"Mona! Please!\" Plague knight yelled as he tried desperately to escape his assistant's step. He tried punching and kicking, he even tried licking too see if he could activate any positive stimuli, but ended up just getting a mouthful of salty foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had seemed that Mona was done toying with him as she began to apply more pressure, breaking the bones of the knight. \"Mona p-plea-\" the doctor was cut short as Mona's foot had too much pressure on it and finally splatted him across the stone floor. Mona then twisted her bare foot in his remains, just to make sure he was dead. \" That takes care of that\" Mona said to herself as she went to eat her cereal, unaware that she had crushed her shrunken lover under her giant , sweaty, pale green feet.</span></div></div>",

Mona started to crack a grin before it broke out into a laughing fit. The cacophony of sound did nothing to help Plague Knight orient his senses, but he could definitely tell when he was being mocked. He started to shout at Mona. \"Oh yes, it's so funny! Yes, ha ha look at the tiny Plague Knight! Will you kindly cease this laughter and help me with an antidote!\" Plague Knight shouted which got Mona's attention, but hearing him try and be commanding with his squeaky tiny voice just made her redouble her laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh man! What did you do PK? You really must've screwed up a potion hardcore to end up that dinky!\" Mona said, very gently pinching him between her finger and thumb and lifting him up. She scrutinized him even more, close to her eyes, and noticed how unamused Plague Knight looked. \"You're really going to try and be self serious? I'm gonna bet this one was your fault.\" Mona said, still with amusement clear in her voice, but at least she wasn't laughing. \"So I skimmed the book, I got some of the proportions in ingredients wrong, as if you haven't done that!\" \"Oh you definitely screwed up the proportions alright!\" Plague Knight was really starting to lose his patience, which he only really reserved for Mona in the first place. \"Hey, you try being as small as I am! I was just trying to make a simple little growth potion, okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still on the height thing?\" Mona said. \"Didn't we get over this months ago with the essence thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how humiliating it is to have to rely on Percy or Baz to grab something high up!?

Plague knight had always considered himself as an important man, and this entire thing was really wounding his pride. \"I swear... when I get my normal size back...\" pk began to mumble to himself , quiet enough so that Mona couldn't hear him of course. The only good thing about this is that he was with Mona, as long as he was with her, he felt as if nothing bad could happen. Plus, although he hated to admit it, he was really liking his new seating arrangement, being padded from both sized by Mona's moderately sized breasts.

What is little girl going to do to Denera Tolinski?\" He laughed, making the other bandits to chuckle as well. \"Fine then\" Mona said \"If you want potions, you can have em!\" Mona then threw off her cape and started running around while throwing every potion she had on her. Some of them exploded in puffs of coloured smoke while some of them made giant plants begin growing out of the ground, trapping a few bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, this really sucked for plague knight, \"Mona! Mona! Slow down!\" The tiny chemist yelled as he was battered around from Mona's excessive arm movements, forcing him to do flips involuntarily. All of this movement in the hot sun also made Mona start to sweat, making it even harder to hold on. \"Mona! Stop it!\" Pk commanded as he was thrown around; Mona couldn't hear him at that moment, with the noise from the explosions , screaming bandits and all that. \"Gwah!\" Plague knight screamed as he was forced into the left cup of Mona's bra, being pushed against her nipple, trapping him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona breathed heavily, she had finally taken care of those bandits, leaving her exhausted, especially with her skintight black clothes. She then decided to check on pk, but when she pulled out her shirt she couldn't see him. \"Oh no...\" Mona said to herself as she frantically looked around thinking that she had dropped him \"Plague knight!\" Mona called out towards the forest. She suddenly felt movement on her breast, she pulled open her shirt again and low and behold, he was stuck against her left nipple. \"How naughty of you pk\" Mona said jokingly \"hey don't pin this on me, that was all your fault with all that running around!\" The knight yelled back \"hey don't blame this on me, those bandits could have killed us!\" The two of them  began to bicker again but quickly cut it out. \"Alright, I'm moving you away from there\" Mona said as she placed him back in between her breasts instead of on them. \"Is there really nowhere else you can place me?\" The doctor asked \"hmmm, nope!\" Mona said with a giggle as she let go of her shirt once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about another hour of walking and a few jokes about plague knights current size, the couple had finally reached the town, a nice lively place where the market was located. \"Here we are pk, we're here now, happy?\" Mona said sarcastically \"we could have gone without the constant jokes about my current state you know\" the chemist said \"Oh will you let off already?

He could even see his girl's giant slit, as she shaved there regularly, making the knight all the more flustered. Eventually the movements of Mona's hips had caused the knight to fall inside of the woman's underwear, leaving him trapped in front of Mona's gaping love canal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona suddenly felt something down near her crotch, something ... really nice ... however, she decided to ignore it right now as she was in public and on an important mission. Mona couldn't help but let out a tiny, quiet moan. \"Did you say something?\" The guard asked \"uh, no, it's nothing\" Mona said with an extremely fake smile \"um, ok then...\" Dave said as he quickly brushed it off as nothing important, giving Mona some relief. Mona had no idea what was happening in between her legs, as she was sure pk was still in between her breasts and she couldn't check to make sure either, as the leather makes a noise whenever it moves, which would draw attention to her. Instead, she decided to rub herself through her clothes after they entered a tunnel where nobody was around. When she moved her hand down there she forced plague knight into it, making Mona feel even more lustful. The moaning was louder now, clearly audible \"What are you doing?\" Dave asked \"n-nothing\" Mona said as she quickly hid what she was doing \"what's with the noises?\" The guard asked, clearly suspicious of her. \"I was j-just uhh, humming a song... yeah\" Mona lied \"ok then, well, it's not much further now, we're pretty much done, this is quite the long tunnel after all, I'm really not sure why it's here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen plague knight landed, he was directly in front of Mona's lower lips, he was facing it too. \"Gah, I can't believe this is happening, Mona's definitely gonna kill me for this\" the knight said as he got redder and redder in the face. Suddenly, the gaping tunnel in front of him started to loosen a bit and dampen. \"Don't tell me that this is...\" pk's was answered before he could even finish it, as he was forced inside from behind. Mona may have been getting pleasure out of this, but the tiny knight was not, he was being squeezed and drenched within the walls of his own girlfriend's vagina, it was absolutely humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mona and Dave the guard had exited the tunnel, which no longer gave Mona any cover to do her thing. So instead Mona began walking with her thighs extremely tight, so that she could get some stimulation from whatever had fallen into her purple-laced panties. \"Alright here we are!\" The guard exclaimed \"I trust you'll be able to navigate from here?\" Dave asked \"yeah........o-of course......\" Mona stuttered, breathing heavily. The guard gave one final look at Mona, brushing off her odd behaviour as a girl thing and left. Mona quickly paid for the herbs and ran off into a random part of the forest. At that moment, Mona had been completely over taken by sexual desire and forgot all about the world around her, taking off all of her clothing, except her bra and panties. Mona then shoved her green hand right into her similar coloured pussy and began to masturbate right there in the middle of the forest, unknowingly pushing her lover deeper inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this Mona couldn't handle it anymore and climaxed, setting pk free with only some stains and minor injuries. Mona then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having finished her not-so-private session, Mona lackadaisically withdrew her hand from her panties. She had forgotten all about her tiny passenger... that is, until in her quiet, blissful state, she heard an odd noise coming from somewhere near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost sounded like... quiet coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mona remembered why she was out of the Explodatorium to begin with: her lab partner and romantic partner Plague Knight royally screwed up a potion and shrunk himself, and the antidote for his diminished size required them to get some Spenia herbs. Mona had taken him out with her, keeping Plague on her person, but while she was on the way, she'd suddenly felt a pleasant feeling in her crotch... no, it <i>had</i> to have been Plague Knight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!\" Last time Mona had saw her shrunken boyfriend, he had been perched on her breasts, but he definitely wasn't there now. She sat up and scanned around herself, before hearing what was apparently the tiny Plague Knight's tiny coughs coming from between her legs. Looking down, Mona instantly saw a distinctive figure wearing a dark blue cloak and a green plague doctor mask, floating in the fluids Mona had released during her masturbation. Reaching down, she placed a finger under Plague Knight and slid him onto her palm, before bringing him up to eye level. The miniature doctor slowly moved from laying down to sitting up, leaning back on his hands to get steady, mumbling something about how his cloak was ruined. He took a few moments to realize that he was currently looking at the massive face of his girlfriend, but the realization made him feel much safer, knowing that even after Mona unwittingly endangered his life, she still was looking out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Plague Knight heard Mona's voice whispering \"P.K., I'm so sorry! Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's... just a bit of bruising, nothing broken, nothing major, Mona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? We don't need to get you any chicken or carrots or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...now that you mention it, a good meal does sound like a solid idea. Just, nothing public... please...\" Plague Knight trailed, still trying to maintain some dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, P.K., let me just get dressed and then we'll see what we can do when we get back to the Explodatorium.\" This sentence utterly confused Plague Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, 'get dressed'?\" It was at this point that Plague Knight realized that Mona was currently only wearing her purple bra and panties. \"We're in the middle of the forest, what were you doing in just your...y'know...\" Mona smirked at P.K.'s trailing off, amused at the fact that despite being in a committed relationship with her, he was still uncomfortable talking about more intimate matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had some... girl stress to relieve...\" Mona said, setting Plague Knight behind the Spenia herbs. She didn't really know why she was doing this, considering he had essentially interacted with all the romantic parts of her body today; she herself had done the first move by placing P.K. on, then between, her breasts, and he had accidentally gotten stuck next to her nipple, not to mention the time where her tiny boyfriend had apparently decided to do some Mole Knight-style digging into her pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona set aside those thoughts for now (no need getting aroused in public twice in one day, after all!), and slipped back into her clothes. Reaching for Plague Knight and the Spenia herbs, she grabbed both of them and started the uneventful trek back to the Explodatorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple had made sure that the cauldron was off-limits to everyone but them, so it was no surprise that their brew was just where they had left it earlier in the day. Mona made sure to double-check and triple-check the formula to ensure there wasn't another Plague Knight-brand\u2122 screw-up, before tossing in the Spenia and letting the cauldron do its thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the table, Plague Knight asked Mona, \"so, when should the antidote be ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis giant girlfriend perused the book, before letting him know...</span></div></div>",

Personally, he'd been looking forward to getting back to normal in a timely manner, but apparently that was going to have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sorry, Plaguey, but you're gonna have to get used to being short... well, short<i>er</i>, anyway,\" Mona snarked at her shrunken lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" he sighed, still not in the mood for height jokes. \"So, now what, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about... actually, how about we go and have that meal now?\" A faint blush began to creep onto Mona's face; it felt strange to be back to acting like normal so soon, like her outdoor masturbation session caused by Plague Knight never happened. It was almost like they had agreed, without saying a word, to never talk about it ever again. Honestly, it seemed like Plague Knight shrinking had actually opened their relationship a bit more... the amount of times he'd seen her bare breasts before could be counted on one hand, and he'd never seen what was contained in her underwear, although considering how dark it'd have to be inside her clothes, he probably didn't see much anyway. Maybe she could use this as an opportunity to advance their relationship further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan, heehee!\" Plague said, hopping back to his feet. For the first time in a while, he was back to his signature smug peppiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure perked back up quickly, huh? What's with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" And just like that, Plague Knight was back to being flustered around his girlfriend again. He'd started looking downwards while uncomfortably tapping his index fingers together, a gesture that Mona had seen several times ever since the Essences adventure from a few months prior. It meant he was too embarrassed to say or do whatever he had on his mind. Looking at P.K. uncomfortably shifting, Mona suddenly remembered what he had said back out in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just, nothing public... please...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd quickly figured out what exactly the problem was from there: the other (much less helpful) lab assistants present in the Explodatorium. He didn't want to be seen by them, which meant asking Mona for a ride, and there were only a few places he could completely hide on her person without too much trouble... Blushing deeply, Mona got on her knees and lowered her breasts onto the table next to Plague Knight, who didn't seem to be expecting her to do so; he stepped back, seemingly afraid of getting flattened by her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna... make your own seating arrangements this time?\" Knowing Plague's ego was currently aching, she decided to try and help him out a little bit by letting him make the decision to enter her clothes himself, rather than forcibly dropping him in nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're okay with me... climbing on them?\" Plague Knight stuttered, not expecting Mona to be so open to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already sat on them for like an hour, you don't have to be so afraid. They don't bite or anything, Plaguey,\" Mona joked, trying to ease P.K.'s tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diminished alchemist backed away from his girlfriend's breasts, charging a Basic Burst (didn't want to hurt her, after all). With a leap and a burst, he launched from the table and directly onto Mona's right breast. Unfortunately for Plague Knight, he wasn't aware of how soft and springy her rack was, as he was only on it for a second before shooting back up into the air, as if he had landed on the green gel in the Lost City (and come to think of it, she was also green, but that's not important right now).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, should've been more careful...\" the airborne alchemist mused. \"Don't move, dear, I've got this!\" Plague Knight prepped another Bomb Burst, but this time he swapped out the Basic Burst for Float Burst, and proceeded to glide down from the air onto Mona's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showoff,\" Mona snarked once more, before pulling her collar open, exposing her breasts to the air, and to a flustered Plague Knight. He once more used a Float Burst, this time to descend into the depths of Mona's shirt, descending into her cleavage. Catching the lip of her purple bra, he climbed in and settled next to her right breast, being held tight to it by the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Hopefully, this should keep any further accidents from happening... hopefully,</i>' P.K. thought. \"Alright, ready when you are,\" he said up to the looming face of his girlfriend above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Plaguey,\" Mona replied, giving him a thumbs-up with her other hand before releasing her collar, shrouding her boyfriend in darkness. With her boyfriend safely in tow, she walked out of the room, heading towards the kitchen. They always kept well stocked, so forming a meal shouldn't be too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mona was walking, she heard someone trying to get her attention. Turning to see them, she found one of the other, much less helpful lab assistants, clad in green and purple, trying to ask her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Mona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wondering, you seen the boss around lately? It's been like a day, normally I'd at least see him wandering around or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona was never the best at lying, but the assistants were pretty dense, so she gave it a shot. \"Can't say I have, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bought the lie wholesale. \"Man, if even <i>you</i> don't know where he is... I don't even know where he could be at! What if he's in danger or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plague handled himself pretty well when he was out collecting the Essences a few months back. I wouldn't worry about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Mona.\" The assistant walked away, leaving Mona and P.K. alone once more. She had a strange feeling about the situation... about how nobody knew that Plague Knight was currently sitting in her bra except her and him. It almost felt... alluring? Sexy, even? '<i>Calm down, Mona, today was a fluke. Plaguey would never go for any sexual stuff while shrunken... would he? I mean, he did at least try to ask to ride in my bra again... but he's too uncomfortable with romance to confirm that he enjoyed it. Still, if we have a week until he's back to normal, that's plenty of time for more... romantic experiments.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlague Knight, meanwhile, was also thinking about how his diminished size would impact his relationship with Mona. '<i>Mona seems a lot more open to teasing me now that I'm smaller. Before, she was just kinda flirty, but now she's out-and-out willing to put me inside her clothes... which is honestly not as bad as I imagined. I wonder if she enjoys having me in here? Seems like she was just playing off of my embarrassment the first time, but considering how quick she was to let me in the second time, it feels like there's more to this than just \"it's more convenient to carry you around this way\"...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona finally reached the kitchen and secured some chicken and carrots, the meal Plague Knight had referred to as a \"solid idea\" hours prior. With food in tow, she and her hidden passenger made haste back to their shared bedroom. Fortunately, they had plenty of amenities in the room, including a table they could eat at, alleviating any concerns of being caught in a more public place. After setting the food down, Mona tugged open her shirt collar, letting P.K. see light once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, need some help there?\" she joked, upon seeing her tiny boyfriend practically glued to her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just trying to prevent another 'incident', shall we say, by securing myself.\" Mona blushed, trying not to think further about said incident. Reaching her other hand into her shirt, she put one finger above Plague Knight to hold, before putting another one between her breast and bra to pull the two apart, allowing Plague to easily be pulled out. Mona then let go of her shirt and put her free hand below her boyfriend, letting him drop onto it, and then lowered him onto the table.</span></div></div>",

She removed the tops from the serving trays, allowing the aroma of cooked chicken to drift throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, back up, Plaguey,\" Mona said, picking up a knife and fork. With utensils in hand and Plague Knight at a safe distance, she tried to cut off a decently-sized piece of meat for him; the end result was still somewhat larger than him, but that wouldn't be a problem since Mona could just eat whatever he didn't. She then did the same with a piece of one of the carrots, setting Plague Knight's portions on the carrot tray and eating hers from the chicken tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mona... for all of this.\" She gave the tiny alchemist a look, not expecting him to be so grateful. \"I know I've been... really arrogant and grumpy for the last day or so... but I really do appreciate you helping me out with this whole incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! What kind of girlfriend would I be if I found you and just forced you to fend for yourself?... you don't have to answer that, Plaguey.\" Mona said, putting a forkful of chicken in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad that you're willing to put up with me. I know if one of the other assistants had found me, they probably wouldn't be nearly as understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because you keep blowing them up?\" Mona snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if they did a better job to begin with, it wouldn't be a problem. Like they say, if you want a job done right, et cetera.\" Plague Knight retorted, lifting his carrot wedge whole and nibbling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, that's why the cauldron's on lockdown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlague Knight sighed. Seven <i>whole</i> days until he could get his normal size back. And what would he do until then? Surely Mona wouldn't be content to just carry him everywhere for the next week, or just stay in the Explodatorium for as long. And of course, since she was the only one that knew of his size debacle, he would have to hide whenever she went somewhere public... although at the very least, Plague Knight's shrunken size allowed him to have the best (or would that be breast?) seat in the house when Mona <i>did</i> go out. Although... it was odd that she didn't want him sleeping on the same bed as her, but yet put him between her breasts the very next morning when she could've just left him at the Explodatorium. Was she feeling alright? Conflicted, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Mona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set down a carrot and turned to look at the bird-beaked bomber. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's, something I want to ask you...\" Mona set her hands on the table, wearing a slightly confused expression. \"Last night, you made me a tiny bed and had me sleep on your dresser because you didn't want me to do... <i>things</i> with your body. But, just today alone, you've already put me in your...\" Plague Knight started doing his shy finger tapping, embarrassed to continue. \"...you know... and you did it twice. Are you... feeling alright, Mona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona could feel a blush deepening on her face. Plague Knight had finally noticed her strange behavior. \"P-Plaguey, I... I've... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mona? Do you need some time to think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona took a few deep breaths, then turned back to Plague Knight. \"No, I'm fine... so... you see, I didn't really think much about... romantic things we could do with your new size until today, when I put you between my breasts. Before, I just wanted to help you get back to normal, but ever since you... fell into my underwear... I've had dirty thoughts about your shrunken stature, and they won't go away. I've been feeling uncomfortable because of these things I can't stop thinking about, and it's really awkward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlague Knight took this pause to console her, walking over and placing his hands on the side of her left hand. \"Mona, it's okay to feel uncomfortable and awkward. You remember why I went on that journey to make the ultimate potion, right? I felt uncomfortable because I didn't think you'd love me the way I was, and I wanted to use that to improve myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different, though. You were uncomfortable with who you were, I'm uncomfortable with what I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... 'dirty' thoughts, huh?\" Mona nodded ashamedly, and Plague Knight paused for a moment. \"...well, maybe, in the future, when I'm more comfortable with... sexual things... we could shrink me down, intentionally, and help you... explore these thoughts... if we make a brew specifically for shrinking, we should just be able to counteract it with a growth potion, instead of needing to wait a week for Spenia because of shrinking due to botched brewing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that should work!\" Mona smiled for the first time in a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets keep that in mind for the future. For now, though, getting through this should be our focus.\" Plague Knight said, turning back to his slice of chicken. The two of them ate the rest of their meals in relative silence compared to the chatting they were doing before. Once they finished, Mona took the meal trays back to be washed, before strolling back to the bedroom, where Plague Knight had moved from the table to the bed. She opened a window to let in a pleasant breeze, and then sat down beside the miniature alchemist on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now, dear?\" Plague Knight asked.</span></div></div>",

The last thing she recalled, she and a spirit had gotten into a heated debate over whether flying spirits or cars should yield to each other. The spirit had cursed her, and she fell asleep for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she took stock of her surroundings. It was too dark to see anything, but she could feel that she was on something soft, like fabric. But where? She started to walk across the odd landscape, but tripped as it sloped upwards. Her foot accidentally went through a hole, and her body slammed into the surface. As she felt around with her trapped leg, she realized she was on a relatively thin layer of fabric, like a giant piece of clothing. But who could possibly wear such a thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra sat up in bed and yawned loudly. She stretched, slipped out of bed, and groggily walked to her closet. For a brief moment, as she took off her old clothes, she considered not wearing a bra to training. She enjoyed the flustered look on Tenzin's face as he tried to ignore the jiggling of her assets, and it certainly caught Asami's eye, too. Then, without revealing to the reader what she chose, she grabbed a pair of panties and a blue shirt and crammed them on before going about her day of intense exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was Asami?</span></div></div>",

Avatar Korra, enormous and topless (possibly completely nude but her large breasts obscured Asami's vison of anything further) down below her, her long arms sliding into her vison, Asami realising she had been shrunk and was stuck in Korra's shirt, her leg trapped by some loose thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had a target Asami began swinging, waving and yelling frantically, trying to get her crush's attention, unfortunately Korra was still half awake, meaning Asami sped past her huge face in a matter of seconds before arriving just shy of a destination, her fingertips just barely grazing against Korra's mammeries. The bender continued to dress unaware of her passenger while Asami swayed and bounced over her intimidatingly massive cleavage, without a bra to contain them the mounds separated and slammed together as she moved around, reminding Asami worryingly of a compactor, a hot, fleshy and kind of sexy compactor but still not something Asami really wants to try her luck against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rhythmic and slightly taunting crashes of Korra's breasts weren't her main worry, no Asami was more worried about the thread holding her in her current situation. While originally with Asami tugging at her leg the thread had no chance of breaking, supporting the CEO's full weight, while being bounced around by Korra and straining to hold in her unrestrained breasts, it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really had 2 options: wait it out and prey her cleavage was safer than it looked, or  do everything she could to make Korra notice her. As Korra walked and now she was beginning to train her breasts bounced along with her, bringing them just out of reach to practically slapping Asami in the face at times, all she needed was a good handful for a moment and the avatar would feel her pinch as she was yanked from her grip, hopefully investigating and seeing she had a little person between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra bounced around the training arena, going through her fire bending stances at a fast pace, she always started with Fire before Water, made her work up quite a sweat which she then used in her water bending practice. After that it was Earth and finally Air due to her being to tired by that point to fidget and annoy Tenzin. Not that it mattered today as Tenzin wasn't there, instead it was just Korra and Jinorra, the tattooed girl reading her book as Korra trained... well when she wasn't sneaking peaks from over the cover at Korra's rippling muscles and bouncing breasts and ass. Korra hid a smile the first time she noticed, Jinorra looked so cute when she was trying to be stealthy (and too be fair she was the quiet one of the 3 born air benders)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while this is going on, what's happened to Asami?</span></div></div>",

Is it supposed to be an handicap or something ? \". Everyone then started to talk and argues about their power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" See that, i told you it was a good idea. They want to fight each other, oh man this going to be sooooo goood !\" Cisco added before Caitlin asked everyone to shut their mouth off, and their attention came back to Felicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well it's just that we need to make several team of pairing, so in the next few days, each one of you will have a partner to work on different missions. And the best way to know which partner fits with your abilities and personnality is to fight with him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Makes sense. Thought i'm worried as i only have a gun in my abilities. \" Diggle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like me Bro ! \" Mick shouted with a crazy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm more and more worried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin then started to call some pairings from the list Cisco and Felicity made, and send them in different rooms numbered. After a moment, she said : \" Oliver as the Arrow and Kara as Supergirl, room 12 \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oooooh this gonna be awesome ! \" Kara looked excited. \" Surely..Let's see what makes you so 'super' \" Oliver put his hood on and joined the room 12 followed by Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"  huh...Felicity, you didn't tell Oliver about her abilities ?!\" Caitlin asked.  \" He didn't want to know. You and I will supervise this fight. Cisco you go to check the others one. \" Felicity ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh i see so you think that let me watching all the other fights will make me forgive you to not assist to the most epic one ? \" Cisco sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" YES ! \" Both Caitlin and Felicity said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok don't worry i will hold back myself \" Kara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I won't.

Oliver didn't waste any time and sent an arrow to Kara's shoulder, but was surprised to see that the Arrow got destroyed. He then ran to punch her...which was useless as well. Supergirl then place her hand on his chest and push him gently...The Arrow was violently sent against the wall of the room several feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Do you have some popcorns ? It's been years i dreamed to see Oliver loosing against a woman \" Felicity said, excited.<br>\r\n\" I guess he actually did ask you about Kara's powers right ? \"<br>\r\n\" Yeah. And i gave him some false informations. Oh god i'm mean sometime...\" <br>\r\nCaitlin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Damn if Felicity...\" Oliver thought to himself as the abitlities of Supergirld didn't seem to be the same that she told him earlier.  \" You should give up \" Kara said, confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm not so sure of that. I suspected you were more than just a girl. So i made my own researchs.  Here's a gift for you...\" Oliver than shot a different arrow to the girl of steel, an arrow with a green light on it's point. And this time Kara got injuried on her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A krytponite ? \"she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes. Not enought to kill you but enought to prevent you to use any of your powers. This is over. In a close fight you can't beat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" HOW THE HELL DID HE KNOW THAT ?! \" Felicity shouted to the screen. <br>\r\n\" Barry told him i guess...\" Caitlin answered.<br>\r\n\" I will kill him ! but first let's send a robot to make the fight more complicate for Oliver. Do we have everyone's abilities ? I need the robot with Kara's laser vision, or the one with firestorm's fire.\"<br>\r\n\" Push the button 4 or 6 \" Caitlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara tried to remove the arrow from her shoulder when a flying robot with a sphere form entered the room from the ceilling. Oliver suddenly get a shot from the sphere and fall on the ground. The robot then tried to shot at Kara but she was able to remove the arrow just in time and destroyed it with her laser vision. Then she looked around her, searching for Oliver. \" Where is he ?! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...which button did you push ?! \" Caitlin asked worried.<br>\r\n\" Don't know...maybe the 5. What ? What's going on ? \"<br>\r\n\" It's the one with the Atom's power ! So....;\"<br>\r\n\" Oliver is shrunk and we don't have any reverse of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver looked up to see a gigantic Supergirl who was still looking for him but not in the right way. \" This is not good at all \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" He is screwed...ooooh i liked that. Too bad for his size but we'll find a way later probably. For now i want to see the next part\" Felicity said<br>\r\nCaitlin nodded, starting to be amused by the situation. \" Maybe you should give an help\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With your size even your krypto-arrow wouldn't have so much effect on me.\" Kara replied, to Oliver's surprise. \" You hear me ? \".  \" I have a super-ear. Now will you give up ? \".  Oliver tried to analyze the whole situation. It was bad, really bad. But he never gave up to anyone before. \"you surely have another weakness. I'll find it.\" he finally said. And before he could do anything, the huge Supergirl was already behind him. \" She also has the speed of Barry ?!\" Oliver took an arrow but it was too late, as the blonde reached down for him in her giant hand and raised him to her face level. \" i know this is not a fair fight, so if you give up we could make a rematch later once you get your normal size again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n\" Oh now she's holding him in her hand, i can't wait to do this too, and maybe more things..oh wait i shouldn't have say that right ? \" Felicity said making Caitlin smiled.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara placed Oliver in the palm of her hand and approached her face to him as if she was about to kiss him, but instead of it, she slowly blew a freeze breath on him, doing her best to hold back her real strenght. The tiny arrow was hitten by what seemed like a really cold wind. It lasted for 5 seconds, but even him couldn't endure a such a torture for more time. It was just unbearable,and once the giantess stopped he couldn't move or either talk, trapped in the coldness of what the only breath of Kara just did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you cold ? \" She teased. Knowing Oliver couldn't answer, she then looked at her panty hose, and smiled. She then slowly started to rub her leg with the hand where Oliver was. He was now pressed against her palm and the flesh of the giantess thigh, as she was rubbing him up and down, from the bottom of her skirt, to the entrance of her boot. \" this can help to warm you up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n\" I hope for Oliver that Kara won't get the idea to put him in her boot \" Caitlin said.<br>\r\n\" Oh gosh don't say that this is disgusting !

I need to stop talking'' Felicity rambled on and for once stopped herself just before reaching the point of no return, though if Caitlin and Kara's matching grins were anything to go by they knew exactly what she was thinking. ''Can you do anything to fix me?'' Oliver asked, hoping to send the conversation somewhere else ''the best answer is soon'' Caitlin said sadly ''We'll be scanning you in a moment as well as sending the data we got from the room to Cisco, Ray and Wells to find a solution, hopefully they'll have a better idea than what Ray did to make the suit grow big in the first place, we don't have that much power available and none of us want to see you crash like that'' she explained in her Dr. tone, usually reserved for really bad news'. Oliver sighed in annoyance but nodded ''Fine, but what do I do until then?'' ''Well first I do this...'' Caitlin says pulling out a device that resembled a Geiger counter before waving it over his small body ''... thank goodness for Lena,  and then I hook this up to the computer and it'll be sent to Harry's computer so he can figure out what to do with it.

Both Caitlin and Felicity were surprised. \" huh...Why would you be the one to keep him ? \" Felicity asked. \" Yeah why you ?\" Caitlin added disappointed.<br>\r\n\" I won the fight so let's say this is my price.\" Kara only replied while Oliver was struggling in her hand. \" You could ask me first..\" He said as Oliver didn't like to not have things under his control. \" Wanna fight me again ? \" Kara asked, then Oliver stopped to struggle and didn't give an answer. \" that's what i thought. Don't worry i'm a nice girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess the choice is made...Anyway we have another fight to supervise. \" Felicity looked at Cailin. \" Oh true, the one with Barry and Kara's aunt ! \" She said, suddenly excited by something else than a tiny Arrow. \" You two are free to stay around, or to leave for a while if you want. If you want to go back in your world, just ask Cisco, he made a thing with Barry's speed to create a portal to your earth\". <br>\r\nKara nodded and left the control room with Oliver in her hand. As soon as she left, she heard a familiar voice. \" KARA ! How was your fight ?!\" Alex Danvers showed herself a bit worried. \" it was easier than i thought ! \" her sister replied. Quickly, Alex's eyes went to Kara's hand and the little human form trapped in it. \"Kara...can you explain this ? \".  \" Oh sure ! Oliver was my opponent so he got shrunk and i have decided to keep him....huh until we find a way to grow him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Nice to meet you...i guess\" Oliver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" She's Alex my adoptive sister who work for the DEO, it's a long story maybe we should bring you to our world someday\" Kara said. Both her and Oliver noticed that Alex kept a look at him. \" Are you...ok sis ? Do you want to hold him ? \" She offered. \"ye...yeah why not\" Alex admitted. The giant blonde then gave the small arrow to her sister, and Oliver found himself in a new hand, softer but cold. Alex raised him to her face level and grinned at him, which mad Oliver getting in the weirdest situation he ever lived.<br>\r\n\" Maybe he should come at home with us tonight  \" She suddenly said to Kara. \" Yeah why not ! \". Kara agreed. The only one who was disagree was of course Oliver, but he didn't try to say anything. He would probably get more chances later to escape a giant human as Alex, than a giant Kryptonian. Or maybe he'll just wait and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the fight between Astra and Barry had began. But due to the Speed of Barry, he managed to be better against a Kryptonian than Oliver. Astra didn't like to use her speed and prefered to see how long he will last before he get tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I never thought humans could be so impressive. But still you have no chance to defeat me.\" Astra said confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmmm...yeah it seems using my fists combined to my speed doesn't really affect you. Let's try something else \" Barry replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I wish i could be one of these Kryptonians girls, they are awesome \" Felicity said. Caitlin looked on the computer checking the robots made for training. Every rooms had the sames, which means that they had another one with the Atom's power. She only needed to push one button release it and to shrink Barry down. The feeling of that power was intoxicationg Caitlin's mind before she came back to the reality. \" an accident can't happen twice right ?. She thought to herself.<br>\r\n\" I know what you are thinking Caitlin. Guess we could find another excuse. Do it ! \" Felicity said making Caitlin smiles.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n-<br>\r\nBarry ran as fast as he could around Astra, creating a circle of light around her. She was waiting for his next attack, when she suddenly fell on her back to the ground, with Barry Allen on her, one kneel on her bully, and his hands holding her fists to the ground. \" that was fast isn't it ? i have accumulated enought energy to increase my strenght so we almost have the same strenght now.\" Barry said proudly. \" You are really interesting Flash. But i suspect your body won't keep this strenght for more than a minute. This is too much for a human body, i know what i'm talking about for having myself did some experiments on the past to some humans.\" Astra replied.<br>\r\nBarry then decided to finish her, when a flying robot appeared from the ceilling and shotted a light ray to him, then left the room as quickly as it entered. After some seconds, Barry realized he just got shrunk and was standing...on Astra's giant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...Seriously ???\" he yelled as Astra looked at him with a grin on her face.</span></div></div>",

Come on moan and squirm louder!!\" Sara began laughing with glee as she crawled in deeper although Kara could easily see her thanks to her X-ray vision she couldn't risk grabbing a hold of her due to her naive nature and dislike of pulling down the front of her panties but felt she had no choice and slowly pulled them down to grab the tiny woman but Sara crawled in all the way so she had very little chances of reaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhh STOP IT!\" Kara screamed \"W-WAIT UNTIL I PULL YOU OUT! Ahhhhhh IT FEELS SO...WEIRD!!\" As she began thrashing around harder and even cumming a bit inside her vagina Sara was actually enjoying herself as she heard the blonde superheroine moaning her lungs out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep down I knew Kara was one of us! It just took some coaxing! Whoa what the hell is this? Ohhh is she....I think she is,she's about to.........\" As with a prolong loud scream the Girl of Steel let out a river flow of white liquid from the depths and the woman was slowly washed from her panties back into the walls of her legs where Kara could have just as easily snatched her up but for some reason she chose not to then Kara's massive tree trunk sized fingers reached down plucking up the tiny woman and slowly she brought her to her billboard face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you....\" Was all the Girl of Steel could get out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kara but you seemed to be under a lot of stress so I thought you could do with some undercarriage fun!\" The tiny woman giggled \"So how was it? Did you enjoy it?\" Sara grinned clearly enjoying her domination over the Kryptonian and her own sexual urges<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I.....\" Kara choked out unable to give a straight answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that short for I throughly enjoyed it Sara? I know deep down you did!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's besides the point!\" Kara shot up but indeed she did enjoy being fucked like that and secretly was willing to experience more if given the chance <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does this mean what I think?\" Sara asked pulling herself up to one of the blonde's blue eyeballs <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....maybe but NO! We'll discuss it later right now I need to get some rest and this time.....\" As she plucked Sara off of her and into a birdcage of all things bolting it lock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stay there! I'm not due back for a while now.\" Kara stated both physically tired from lack of sleep and sexually tired from all the humiliation the tiny woman gave her and headed to her bedroom but Sara still full of lust and a strong attraction to the Girl of Steel managed to....</span></div></div>",

Plus she was pretty sure the giant alien was mocking her putting the canary in a birdcage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer musing was interrupted by the sound of the door opening and closing, shortly followed by a woman calling out for Kara. Sara perks up, seeing a raven haired woman with large green eyes, heels clicking as she walks across the room, stopping when she noticed the cage on the table. As she approaches her eyes widen significantly and does a double take before speaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello?' she says, slowly stepping closer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi, who are you?' Sara asks, causing the other woman to snort<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I believe that's my line, though I presume you're a friend of Kara's?' she says as she rests her arms on the table, her nose crinkles before her focus increases on Sara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, Sara Lance, captain of the Waverider. And you are?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lena Luthor, CEO of L Corp' Lena answers, her long fingers quickly undoing the latch and opening the cage, which Sara was happy about... until Lena grabs her and brings her up to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lena?' Sara just about manages to say before the ravenette opens her mouth and the shrunken assassin is shoved half way inside, playfully sucked on and having her ears buffeted by the loud moans. Finally she was pulled out, allowing her to remove the saliva from her eyes 'The fuck was that for?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena chuckles 'You taste just as good as I expected. Now you just need to explain, why you're covering in my girlfriend's pussy juices' Lena looked a mix of annoyed and very slightly amused, worrying Sara a little as she knew if things were reversed Nyssa would have simply crushed the '<i>defiler</i>' by now rather than play with them like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I may have, slightly, wriggled my way into her panties and then her vagina because she was clearly in need of a little something special. Not that you couldn't do it yourself but I bet with her being a superhero and you being a CEO you don't get much free time' Sara answers, trying to get on the most likely and understandably angry giantess' good side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smirks 'You are correct, this past week we haven't had time to do more than curl up in each other's arms, to the annoyance of both of us, still doesn't excuse the panty diving you were doing, or e explain why you're the size you are'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't explain the size thing, something must have shorted during the sparing, and the other, well I may have spoken to Kara about some fun with a combination of the 4 of us: Me, my wife Nyssa, Kara and you, some of us being shrunk and the others normal size. Kara seemed to be into the idea, probably of a tiny you that could fit up inside her, but I kind of was a bit too forward it would seem and might have annoyed her'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena nods 'Okay, but how can you do this with a wife?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara chuckles 'My beloved and I have a complicated semi-open thing, basically no penises and if I get anywhere try get her an invite to the bedroom, same rules apply for her. understand?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena's lip curls 'Oh I understand perfectly darling' she purrs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Afterwards, you were in the back helping out Misaki with some deliveries. You're nervous about it, but you have been in love with her ever since you got the job. But, you're afraid that she doesn't feel the same way as you do. So, you decide to put it behind you. After you and Misaki finished with packages, you walked up to her to see if she wants to play a quick game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Misaki? It's almost time to close down. You want to play a quick game of Vanguard before I go?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll play.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Misaki went to the table and set up you decks before setting down your starting Vanguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up the Vanguard!\" You both cried out as you flipped up your cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Misaki's damage is five while your damage is 4. You have Liberator of Bonds, Gancalot Zenith as your Vanguard while Misaki has Regalia of Wisdom, Angelica. It's her turn now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready? FINAL TURN!\" Misaki declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me everything you've got.\" You said in courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I go! Cross Break ride! Omniscience Regalia, Minerva. With Angelica's Break ride, Soul blast, draw two cards and give the Unit I ride with 10000 power. With Angelica in the soul, Minerva gains 2000 power.\" Misaki explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva: 23000 power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call.\" Misaki said as she set two more units into battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter goes and attacks Blaster Blade Liberator.\" Misaki declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guard.\" You said as you set a 10000 shield unit to protect Blaster Blade Liberator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minerva will now attack your Vanguard.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halo Liberator, Mark will nullify that attack.\" You said as Mark saves Gancalot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twin drive check.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki got Grappa on the first check and the second check is a trigger unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a Heal trigger. Power to Minerva and I recover one point of damage.\" Misaki said as her Vanguard powers up and takes away a card from the damage zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your guard up cause you know what's coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using Minerva's Limit Break. After the battle, counter blast 1, soul blast 3 and I discard 3 Genesis cards from my hand. She stands back up with additional 5000 power.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva: 28000 power<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, she attacks Gancalot again.\" Misaki declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No guard.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again. Twin drive check.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a nullify on the first. But, the second check is what she needs to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Critical trigger! Critical to Minerva. Power to Jupiter.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva hits Gancalot and was able to get the 6 damage on you for the win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome Misaki! You never hold back on that last turn.\" You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You did great yourself.\" Misaki said with a smile of her own, which causes you to blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I better get ho-.\" You stopped talking as you've gotten dizzy and then passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you alright!?\" Misaki asked in worry as your vision turned blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you woke up feeling groggy and looked to see Misaki's face close to you. But, you see her face is much bigger than before and you yelped back in shock and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax! Relax! It's just me!\" Misaki said trying to calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. It's just, how did you get so big?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get big, you've gotten small.\" Misaki corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and see that you're actually on her hand in her room, meaning that she's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?! How did this happened?!\" You wondered in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it wasn't me. We finished our game and then you just passed out and shrunken on the floor.\" Misaki explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me crazy for asking this, but do you think that our game may have something to do with the condition I'm in?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a weird way, maybe.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what am I going do now? I can't go home looking like this.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've called your mom and tell her that you're staying with me for the weekend.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a lot to hear the girl of your dreams saying that you're gonna be with her for a while. Maybe this won't be too bad if you're gonna be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" You said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, it's getting late. How about we go to sleep?\" Misaki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Where am I gonna sleep?\" You asked cause you know that she won't let you sleep with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be sleeping with me.\" Misaki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, you honestly didn't see that coming. You blushed even more after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Something wrong?\" Misaki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it that time to either confessed your love to her or you tell her that it's nothing.</span></div></div>",

She wore what seemed to be a white cape, black pants, black backless, sleeveless outfit over her front and flat, Chinese shoes.<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances Soi Fon would be quite a small woman, but compared to you right now she looked to be larger than the seireitei. She quickly slipping into a crouched position to get a better look at you, you blush (and hope she doesn't notice) as even though she's rather petite [and rather cute] given how close she appeared when she found you, nearly stepping on you, you were standing between her feet and with her change in position if she got any lower you'd be pressed against her firm looking thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did this happen?' she asked, you keeping your head lowered in embarrassment 'I-I don't know, I don't remember anything' you answer, missing the frown on her previously calm features 'Well that's unhelpful, but you do obviously have quite a good bit of reiatsu in that little body of yours, that's one thing in your favour' she comments, you actually looking up at her face in confusion 'What so you mean?' 'Well I'm standing over your tiny body and you're... embarrassed rather than suffocating on my spiritual pressure' You just look blankly in her direction 'I don't understand' Soi's eyebrows quirk 'you don't know what I am?' she asks and you shake your head, the giantess sighed in annoyance, wondering why you were such an idi... amnesia.<br>\r\nSighing once more she took a deep breath 'This...' she begins pointing to her haori '...means I'm very powerful if you didn't have at least the potential to reach a similar level then you'd be in quite a bit of pain right now, even more given our size difference which I know thanks to <i>Suzume-baka</i>' she hisses the last part and you feel her energy spike as a shiver runs through your entire body. 'So what now?' you ask 'Now, you come with me to the Squad 2 barracks' she answers, a small smile flashed across her features 'What?' 'People with spirit energy as strong as you would normally be need to eat and other necessities similar to in the world of the living, I don't think you'll survive that long out her at your current size, so it's either with me and potentially be a future Squad 2, or I send for Nemu and you become the newest pet project of Squad 12's science division' she explains and you pale before nodding in understanding 'Um, okay then. I guess I'm sticking with you'<br>\r\n'Well now that's decided off we go' Soi announced as she reached down and grabbed you 'Oh wait, if I head back at the speed I normally use, you'll be blown away if you're just sitting in my hand, I'll have to put you somewhere' she thinks out loud before placing you...</span></div></div>",

Life was hard for you, living on the streets like this. When your quirk manifested, you became 6 inches tall. You also had healing powers, and slightly enhanced physical ability. Your healing powers only fixed minor cuts and bruises though, good also for fending off infection and disease.<br>\r\nNot long after your quirk manifested, your parents saw you as a burden and kicked you to the curb. Ever since then, you have lived on the street alone. Right now your are heading to the park, it takes about an hour thanks to your enhanced physical ability.<br>\r\nSo now here you are, walking next to the sidewalk. Just ahead of you, there is a bench. You climb onto the arm rail, and sit down. \"Huh, I hear of this UA every year. A school for aspiring heroes, I've never been to a school. Kinda hard when your homeless; stupid quirk. Stupid tiny body, stupid healing powers\", you say out loud.<br>\r\n\"Wow, my quirk lets me jump really high, stick to almost any surface too. My tounge is 20 meters long, I can also spit up my stomach so I can clean it. Lastly I can secrete a toxic mucus that stings just a little\", a voice said. You realize the voice is addressing you, and turn your head to the source. Sitting on the bench, is a girl about your age. She is looking at you, and tilts her head slightly. \"So your homeless?\", she asked. \"Yeah, since about a week after my quirk first manifested itself\", you tell her. \"What!? But quirks manifest around four years of age\", she said. \"Didn't stop my folks\", you said bitterly.<br>\r\n\"Alone, all these years...\", the girl said quietly. \"Yeah, my biggest struggle is food. Though I do hear a lot of people study, if I take a placement exam I'd probably get into high school like I'm supposed to be. I'm supposed to be starting high school this spring anyway. But I'm not in the system. Course like I said, food is my worry. All I ever find is scraps, if I'm lucky\", you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, introductions. I'm Asui Tsuyu; you are?\", Tsuyu asked. \"Don't remember, I'm just a kid nobody ever sees. Except you\", you tell her. \"We'll figure it out later\", Tsuyu said as she grabbed you. \"What gives?\", you ask her as she puts you in her purse. \"We have to get to the store before it closes, after that we can head home\", she answered. \"What do you mean 'we' Asui-Chan?\", you asked. \"Call me Tsuyu, or Tsu. And I mean 'we' because your coming with, I'm not leaving you behind\", she replied. \"But why, you barely know me\", you tell her. Tsuyu looked at you, and you saw tears in her eyes as she walked. \"Because, someone needs to show you love. To show that they care, and if your parents won't; then damnit leave it to me\", she said as she walked into the store. She made her purchases, and the left for the train station.</span></div></div>",

'A younger sibling, perhaps?', you think as you hide behind a pillow. You discreetly watch her as you hide, she looks around with a cursory glance. \"I thought Tsuyu was talking to someone before, but nobody's here. Was big sis hearing voices; or me maybe?\", at this point she's started to cry. \"Satsuki, what are you doing in here? Oh no, are you crying?\", Tsuyu put her arms around her sister.<br>\r\n Tsuyu listened as her sister explained the voice dilemma, and expressed her fear of the asylums separating the two of them. Tsuyu was lost as she looked you from around her sister, and you just walked closer to them and away from the pillow. Tsuyu gaped as she saw you stand on the bed, right behind her sister.<br>\r\n \"Satsuki, Can you a really big secret for me?\", Tsuyu asked her sister. Satsuki nodded, trying and failing to choke back a hiccup. Tsuyu pointed you out, and Satsuki stared in wonder.<br>\r\n \"Satsuki; this is well, he doesn't remember his name. But I found him all alone, and brought him here. I need you to keep him a secret, or mom and dad might make us get rid of him. He was kicked to the street not long after he developed a quirk\", Tsuyu told her sister. \"He seems nice enough\", Satsuki said. \"Bedtime sweetie\", Tsuyu told her sister.<br>\r\n \"Your sister seemed nice. But earlier, you said you want to be a hero. What do you mean?\", you asked tsuyu as she got ready for bed herself. \"There's a school called UA, after quirks came about so did heroes and villains. UA trains heroes for the future. I'm applying and have to take the exam. Now are you sure you felt nothing when you saw me change? You never had 'the talk', have you? Did you feel hard down there?\", she asked. \"It felt odd\", you said. \"Sounds like a Yes. Now in the morning, I'm giving you a proper shower. Its obvious you just had the rain. No arguments\", Tsuyu said with her hands set firm on her hips, and giving you a slight glare. \"Ok\", you said. \"Good, ok then; bedtime!\", Tsuyu said grabbing you. As she sat on her bed, Tsuyu gave you a goodnight kiss on top of your head. Then she set you....</span></div></div>",

Your quirk is basically antmans but the shrinking part was permanent after extensive training and trying to make your quirk be useful they gave up and said we are not having a disappointment in this family disowned you and threw you out. You survived of crumbs and scrapes and rain is drinkable right but eh even if it wasn't it's was your only chance at survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on your way to the park because there might be a small amount of crumbs for you to eat plus it's a lot better place to stay than an alleyway when you got there you took cover from the sun by going under a low hanging leaf.a couple minutes later you saw a group of three people talking it sounded as if they were saying goodbye as the tall male with glasses walked of and the green haired male left leaving the brown haired female she sat down at a bench in the park looking at all the scenery. \"Uh oh\" you thought to yourself not wanting to be spotted because you feel inferior to everyone and your also not that social since ya know tiny. She seemed to have spotted you as her face gained one of curiosity at your tiny figure. Wanting to actually see what you are she begins to get up and walk over to you while you are freakin out. While trying to think of a way to escape you come back to reality to see her begin to crouch down you two look eyes \"crap\" you said under your breath \"what are you\" she asked looking at your hungry state with eyes of curiosity \"I-I u-u-um\" was all you could say \"are you a tiny human\" she asked voice filled with curiosity \"w-well y-y-es its b-because of m-my quirk.\" You stuttered out. \"Whoa that's so cool what age are you I can't tell.\" She said amazement in her voice. \"1-15\" you said. \"Where are your parents?\" She asked a that questions was a bombshell \"T-they left me behind for having a weak quirk since I was six\" you said quietly not wanting them to hear so you can burden them with your problems \"so you've been surviving out here for 9 whole years\" she asked sympathy in her voice \"w-well u-umm I-I a-am u--uh\" was all that you said. \"You can't stay this may sound a little forward but come with me\" she asked as she outstretched her hand a friendly smile on her face knowing that you could trust her you leapt onto her hand as she brought you up to her shoulder she talked to you about how she's a hero in training she was nice and caring but also bubbly and loud it was a good combo she told you about her friends either the green haired boy being name midoriya and the other kid named lida. While you told her about your life and what is was like being homeless as you reached your home and she went upstairs she places you on her pillow and told you to sleep she then left for dinner you woke up later to see her tapping you with a tiny plate of food \"t-thank ochacko\" you said happily when you finished she suddenly picked you up and held you close to her chest as if she was hugging you \"I'm really sorry you had to go through what you went through before\" she said quietly and then as soon as she said that all the emotions you had stoked up all just released as you started crying as she still held you close comforting you as you stopped crying she told you it was time for bed she put you back on her pillow as you two drifted off to sleep </span></div></div>",

As the second year walks away laughing more students show up and Kaminari just barely dodged them, he realized he was only an inch tall and he would be in massive trouble if he didn't find help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he saw her.  Jirou Kyouka a girl Kaminari was sort of friends with, she often made fun of him but the two enjoyed each others company and Kaminari always got this odd feeling whenever he was around the rock enthusiast a warm and calming feeling that always...Kaminari realized Jirou was leaving and headed towards her grabbing onto her shoes and barely being able to stay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirou Kyouka was heading to her class it was a busy day but she looked forward to teasing Kaminari again, he was always easy to talk too and Jirou always got this warm and calming feeling whenever she's around him one that feels just like.. just like... just like someone climbing up her leg?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirou looked down and saw a bug, she didn't really mind but was ready to throw it away when all of a sudden she saw a weird spark that looked oddly like, \"Denki?\" she thought to herself, swiftly she picked up the bug and headed to the woman's restroom hiding in one of the bathroom stalls.  She held the bug close to her eyes and couldn't believe what she saw, it was an inch tall Kaminari Denki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaminari, how the hell did you get so small\" she asked in a whispering tone.  \"Some guy used his quirk to shrink me after I pissed him off\" he said the boy felt embarrassed being held up by Jirou like that and he knew the girl would either scold him or laugh at him or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot <b>*sigh*</b> well I guess I should take care of you\" Jirou told him, it was weird seeing him this small but at the same time Jirou couldn't help but think of how cute he is at that size, \"Hey Jirou can you not show me to anyone else please, not even the teachers\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" she asked, \"Look I can't be seen like this, you know I already have a bad rep because I flunked my test and I don't need anymore unwarranted attention\" Kaminari answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>\"sigh\"</b> Allright fine, but be quiet when we're in class\" Jirou told him, \"Re..Really THANK YOU Jirou I'll never forget this\" Kaminari said.  Jirou felt bad for the shrunken boy but she didn't want to show Denki her softer side mainly because he'd tease her over it...but,,, maybe at that size he won't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhh where do you wanna stay\" Jirou asked, \"Anywhere just make sure it's comfortable.  Jirou's mind started racing wondering if she could get away with hiding him in her \"Private Parts\" but she decided against it, \"Decide for yourself or flush you\" Jirou teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um allright just...please...no...flushing\" Kaminari said, he wasn't sure if Jirou was just teasing him and he didn't want to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay if I stay in your ear?\" Kaminari asked, \"My ear why, it's the source of my quirk so it's not covert or anything\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it has enough open space and you can still hear with me inside because of your quirk also you'd be able to hear me better\" Kaminari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirou was not expecting such a detailed answer so she relented and stuffed the boy on her ear, Kaminari was terrified at how far he was from the ground but felt safer knowing he had Jirou protecting him while Jirou herself felt bizarrely happy at the ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirou made her way to class unusually late, she grabbed her seat and hoped things work out.</span></div></div>",

Really this is just to give more options but hey might as well be direct]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin paced worryingly as the portal hummed contently, it had been a month since all teams had beaten their respective 'Big Bad' and things were quiet, which was how Felicity had suggested the idea they have a girls night out (or maybe in) to celebrate, an idea that was transmitted to Kara on Earth 38 who quickly agreed as long as she could invite a few of her own buddies. Kara's buddies included her aunt, sister and both Danver's respective girlfriends who Caitlin was awaiting the arrival of. She took the role of organiser very seriously which was why she sent Jessie to get the drink, knowing they were going to need more given they were serving a speedster and 2 aliens, hell her own powers messed with alcohol consumption in a similar way so even more for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cryokinetic sighed in relief when people started to appear: Kara happily bouncing out with a more reserved raven haired woman on her arm, followed shortly by a girl who had to be Kara's sister Alex and detective Sawyer as well as an older brunette (minus the white streak similar to Caitlin's own locks) in a well cut pantsuit and 'sexy librarian' glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Caitlin!' Kara yelped happily as she pulled the meta into a hug 'We're ready to party.... and we brought booze!' she cheered as Caitlin saw Astra raise bottles of what looked to be some kind of glowing yellow liquid. She wisely didn't ask what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay so I know you but who else have we got?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well there's me and Astra, then there's Lena who is happy to meet people who won't judge her for her family, and then there's Alex and Maggie who will drink and probably not socialize that much as they'll be sucking face' Kara explained pointing to each person in turn, getting an annoyed 'HEY' from Alex at the comment, while Maggie chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay then, given how many of us there is Iris has us set up in her place, Barry and the guys are all having a night out, give Oliver a chance to put his misspent youth to good use' Caitlin explains as she gives directions and checks with the others that they had the supplies and everyone had arrived in Central safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin wasn't sure why she was worrying so much, the alien alcohol was very helpful, having the same effect on metas as it did on Kryptonians, meaning she was pleasantly drunk just like most of the others. This was also one of the few times recently she'd seen Laurel or Thea unwind plus Nyssa actually looked happy, but that may have something to do with the fact she had easy access to Sara's melons in her current outfit and her recently accepted fianc\u00e9 had no problems with her playing, nor did she move very far from the newest Demon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was of similar mind about her fellow companions: with all the Cadmus and Daximite shenanigans none of them had had much time to relax or unwind, this was the perfect treat for all of them... they really did deserve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyssa smirked as she pulled a small pill bottle from her pocket 'What you doing love?' Sara asked with a slight slur nuzzling closer to her fianc\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I brought these from Nanda Parvat, League grade stealth compound' at Sara's confused look she elaborated 'Shrinking pills' the blond oooed, ' Originally I had planned for us to use these for a little night of fun to ourselves, but now it seems unfair to hog the fun between us... plus' she waves her hands to the giggling single girls and the couples who were currently making out 'I doubt any of them would have any problem with us joining them' Sara nodded before grabbing the bottle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what should we do?' she asked with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's up to you beloved, do we stick to my original plan and shrink one of us, or do we share the love and drop some into the drinks of some of our tipsy companions?' she smiles as she sees the groups cutting loose: Lena roughly squeezing Kara's massive breasts as the Kryptonian nips at her ear, Alex getting double trouble as she squeezes Astra's firm rear while getting her head smothered between the combined boobage of the alien cougar and Detective Sawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who gets shrunk? (Also quick roll call: Caitlin, Jessie, Iris, Felicity, Laurel, Thea, Sara, Nyssa, Kara, Alex, Lena, Maggie and Astra)</span></div></div>",
