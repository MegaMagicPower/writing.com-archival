Just when you are about to head to the bathroom to take a shower, you hear screams come from outside. You glance out the window and see the strangest thing you've ever seen: Monsters are eating people. You see multiple monsters swallowing people whole, and some are just tearing into their victims. You freak out and try to think of something to do. You could go out and try to help someone or try to escape this madness, or you could stay in the safety of your home, and wait it out. the police should fix this, right? The fact that a monster just burped up a police officer's hat makes you worried. you have to decided what to do.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, it still works and no monsters or anything has touched it, so that's good. You shift out of first gear and drive off. For a little while you have to drive slowly, as there is people everywhere in the streets, trying to avoid getting eaten alive, but after that, you manage to be able to pick up speed, and you start to think you're home-free. Just drive to the nearest town or maybe even another state. No problem. Well, it WOULD be \"no problem\", if it weren't for the fact that a frog creature maybe 10 foot tall is sitting in the road, mouth agape. If you keep driving, you're going drive right down it's throat, and unwilling serve yourself and your car up for digestion. You could always try and brake. Of course, your brakes never really worked. You bought this car at a used car place that went under for legal reasons. You could also sacrifice the car and jump out and run. Who knows how that could work out, though? You could easily break some bones or even break your neck down that. You're not a stunt man. You have to decide fast, cause in a couple minutes, you and your car are gonna be sitting in the gut of a 10 foot tall frog creature.<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

He explains that he is attempting to make his way to the police station, and that since the roads were mostly unsafe, he was going to cut through a nearby warehouse, and go down into the sewers, and get to the station that way. You ask him if you can come with him, as you don't want to be alone when there's monsters swallowing everyone in town. Plus, he has a gun. He agrees to let you come with him, and tells you to keep the switchblade for protection. You two proceed to head to the warehouse, and find that the main doors are actually unlocked, so you head inside the relative safety of the warehouse. The entire place is lit by beams of sunlight shining through windows on the roof. The lights are off. You two proceed forward, with the guy going first and you lagging behind. He puts his arm out and tells you to stop, saying that he just heard something. he readies his gun and looks around the place, and doesn't see anything, so he tells you to continue cautiously. A few minutes into walking, you two stop again, as what appears to be a naga of some sort comes slithering into view. The man draws his weapon and takes aim, ready to shoot. You grip the switchblade tighter, not knowing if it would even be effective in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the man can pull the trigger, the naga speaks up. \"Wait! I'm not dangerous,\" she says, holding her hands in the air. The guy tells her that he doesn't believe her, and that she's probably just like the other monsters running amok outside. She assures him that she isn't a threat, and actually wants to help survivors. The man slowly lowers his gun, and begins to creep over to the naga, slightly believing her. If she was gonna eat him, she'd have done it without revealing herself like that, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he gets over to her, she grins a huge, fanged grin, and proceeds to unhinge her jaw. The guy raises his gun, but it is smacked from his hand by the naga. She grabs him and shoves him in her mouth, and begins to swallow, while you watch on in horror. You could try and save the guy. After all, he's your best hope for survival. But, you could also make a run for it and try to get to the station yourself. the guy could be a distraction so you don't get eaten.</span></div></div>",

You swing the knife at her, and manage to slash her across the midsection, causing blue-yellow blood to leech out. She reacts in pain, and involuntarily coughs the guy up, and after tending to her wound, she grabs you by the arms and hoists you up, ready to gulp you down instead. You try to cut her again with the switchblade, but she's holding your arms too tight. You can't move them. She starts slowly sliding your head into her mouth, and is about to start swallowing when the guy grabs her attention. \"Hey snake!\" He yells. The naga turns to face him, with your head and shoulders in her mouth and throat. He's aiming his gun at her, and before she can react, he fires, and kills her. She collapses on the ground, with you still in her mouth. the guy runs over and pulls you out. \"Thanks.\" You say, catching your breath. \"Don't mention it. Now, let's get to the police station,\" He responds. He helps you to your feet and the two of you run away from the dead naga corpse, and out of the warehouse. He lifts a manhole cover and you two proceed down. The smell is unbearable, but you figure that you can stand the smell of sewage more than the smell of a stomach. After a couple of hours of walking, you two come across a ladder leading to the surface. The guy tells you to wait while he goes and checks it out, and soon you're down in the sewers by yourself. You start hearing wet footsteps in the distance, and ask if it's safe. He says that it seems safe, and tells you to come on up. The footsteps are getting louder and louder. As you start climbing, you glance over to see a long-necked humanoid lizard creature turning the corner. You start trying to climb as fast as you can.

Once you get to the creature's mouth, it clamps it's jaws around you, breaking your back in the process. You're still barely conscious, and can barely feel getting swallowed.

About 9-10 foot tall. You alert the guy of the creature's presence, and after his heart clearly drops, he tells you to follow him, and you both start running in the general direction of the police station, all the while, being chased by a werewolf looking to grab two human snacks. You two manage to get to the station, but the front gate is closed and locked. The guy starts pounding on it and yelling for someone to come and open the gate. Two police officers come running out, and upon seeing you and the guy, they open the gate. \"Inside, now!\" one of them yells at you two, as he and the other officer begin to open fire on the werewolf. The two officers realize that the bullets aren't working, and decide to close the gate back and run back inside. They manage to get it closed and locked back, and the werewolf stops and runs off after a few seconds. Just when the officers think they're in the clear, the werewolf lands in front of them and, before they can react, it grabs the both of them, and swallows them one by one. It then jumps over the front gate and dashes off, in order to find somewhere to digest the two humans in it's gut. Meanwhile, you and the guy are in the station, talking to Lt. Victor Harrison, who is the \"head\" of the shelter that the station has been turned into. He asks what your names are. \"I'm Joseph, and this is...um...um...\" The gun guy responds, being obviously clueless as to what your name is.<br>\r\nYou respond with \"My name is...\"</span></div></div>",

You take off running toward the street and exit the alley. Once you get out, you see a few more monsters, all looking more than happy to stuff you down their hungry gullets. They start running towards you. Realizing that it may be no use to run from them, you hunker down and wait for one of them to eventually gulp you down. Before any of them can grab you, however, they're all gunned down. You look up, and see three police officers. \"Are you alright?\" one of them asks as he runs over to you. You respond that you're just a bit shaken up and that otherwise, you're fine. He explains that a good bit of police officers were still alive at the police station, and they had turned the place into a makeshift shelter for survivors. He asks you if you want to come with him and the other two officers, and you say yes. Anywhere has to be better than the voracious streets, right?

Within a minute or two, it manages to shove you all the way down it's throat, and into it's stomach. It's tight, but not uncomfortable. You can stretch your legs slightly. The werewolf lets out a guttural <span class=\"cbgreen\"><b>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELCH!</b></span> and pats it's now distended belly.

You sit there for a good 15 minutes, until you feel something brush up against your leg. You instantly jump back, not sure whether it was a rat or a monster. You turn to see a female naga standing about a foot behind you. Before you can get up and run, her tail wraps around you, and you're pulled very close to her. You attempt to break free from the coils, but they're too strong. You're trapped. You beg her not to eat you, and to just let you go. She chuckles, and proceeds to unhinge her jaw, and push you into her mouth with her tail, all the while, you're struggling as hard as the coils allow you to, but it's all in vain. She get you halfway into her mouth, and begins to start swallowing. After a few minutes, your legs are all that's sticking out. She pushes them into her mouth with her hand, and takes one final gulp, sending you down into her steamy gut. You curl into a ball, as there's not much room to move. You try to struggle to get free, but you can't even move your arms enough to do so. The naga lets out a small burp, followed by an \"excuse me.\" She then slithers off, in order to find a place to digest her human meal. For you, the horror of monsters eating people is over.

You can't jump out at this point, cause you'd most likely get eaten by it anyway. Your first instinct is to brace your face with your arms as your car continues to slow down, and it manages to slow to a stop by the time it's in the creature's mouth. You feel slightly happy that it stopped when it did, but then, your world shakes around you as the frog creature stands up and takes a huge gulp, sending you and your car plummeting into it's dark stomach.

Who knows. You flip the TV on and turn it to the local news channel. They're in the process of talking about the situation and telling citizens what to do. They say that it is best to stay in your home, as the creatures are all very dangerous, being able to swallow a fully grown human whole.

So you move on to the bedroom door and open it, gripping the bat tighter with each inch the door opens.
