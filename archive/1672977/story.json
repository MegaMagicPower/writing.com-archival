A tidal wave hit the boat and it started to sink. You were separated from your parents, and got lost. Lost I tell you! There was nothing on the beach but you. There is a forest right beside you, and you think you should make a shelter or search for some berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?</span></div></div>",

You continue to search for supplies, but soon realize you have no idea what's needed for a shelter, let alone how to make one.        After a moment of worry, you notice an arm length stick leaning up against a tree..  it took a moment to click, but you figured you could lean many sticks against a wall of some sort to create a sort of roof.  You don't know how efficient this will be, but it's the best option you've got.. so for the moment, you begin collecting sticks, starting with the one on the tree.    <br>\r\nAll this time, you've been trying to ignore the banging,  but it seems like now it's louder than before.. and you almost think you hear it coming from different directions, like there was more than one of what's causing it.  You shudder and dismiss the thought,  it must be nerves.. for that to be true ... you don't know,  you just get a bad feeling about the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a bit on edge, you continue walking, until you see in the distance to your right, a cave connecting into a mountain.  You know some animal MIGHT be living in it, but the threat isn't really <b>that</b> big,  and besides, it's a much better shelter than what you'd be making!  You're tired, and probably delusional (making you hear the banging)  you need to rest, and this seems like a gift from god at this point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rush, you drop your handful of sticks and set off at a run for the cave, stopping right before the entrance.  <br>\r\nYou feel almost happy for a moment.. until you hear a deep rumbling from inside the cave.  It sounded kind of like the sound your stomache makes when you're really hungry,  except much louder, and deeper.  You stand there, dead in your tracks, wondering what it could have been..<br>\r\nNothing as big as it sounded.. the sound was probably magnified through echoes..  it might have just been rocks falling or something..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd plus, you're tired, you NEED a place to stay..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou...?</span></div></div>",

As soon as it lands you're on top of it.. well.. kind of.<br>\r\nIt lands facing away from you, you're right behind it, normally, you might be able to jump right onto it's back.. but due to it's abnormal size,   your head hardly reaches the bottom of his.. bottom end.   With nothing to lose, you continue at it and jump, hands grasping the bottom-most fur on his back, one foot dangling off, the other barely finding traction on the side of his leg.   This move sent the typhlosion into a furious rage.  It reared back onto it's hind legs then slammed back down onto all fours in an attempt to through you off.. which almost worked, but at the last second, you threw your weight forward: using the velocity from his fall to throw you onto his back.  \"Check,\"  you mumble,  stumbling forward to where your hands could easily grab his neck.  At least now you were out of reach of his mouth.. but he was kicking and flailing furiously, making every attempt to throw you off.  He even rammed his back into a tree in attempt to crush you.. only barely missing as you slid to his side for long enough to dodge it.     Now you didn't know what to do.. you were away from his mouth,  but it was only a matter of time before he got you off one way or another.. and your arms were already getting tired and the stick in your hand wasn't helping.. if you fell now, no doubt you'd be sliding down that throat in no time... that throat!<br>\r\nThen it hit you:  you let go of his neck with one hand long enough to pull the stick around around his neck, and grabbed it with your other hand.  You pulled on it with all your strength, both hands gripping it and hoping it didn't break.   The typhlosion stopped it's mad attempts to throw you off and was now coughing and clawing at the stick.     You didn't plan to kill it, but what other option did you have!?</span></div></div>",

You tightened your grip, pulling back with full force again.  \"Good,\"  you start,  \"then let's how much we <i>understand</i> eachother, eh?\"  upon finishing that, you tugged back on the stick for a moment warningly,  then loosened enough for it to get in a short sputtering breathe,  \"Now.. let's make a deal--\"  it thrashed angrily against the stick upon you saying this, but relaxed after a moment, your cue to continue,  \"I'll let go of this stick, and you'll let me continue a life outside your stomache, <i>capiche?</i>\"  you say, giving another hard tug on the stick,  but this time not letting up, you continue with the pressure and move in closer to it's ear,  \"Or.. I could kill you now, if you refuse my offer,  so what'll it be?\"   you did your best to keep a hard tone, but in truth, you hated to do this- even to a man-eating pokemon, and you were afraid that showed in your voice, despite your best effort.<br>\r\nYou then loosened up on the stick again, waiting for it to react.. you imagine if it hated the idea, it'd go into another fit of rage.. but instead, it just blew out a puff of smoke, it's eyes closed indignantly.    <br>\r\nthis seems to be a mutual agreement, you should</span></div></div>",

Well I pick the male character and you are stranded on this island and you have this flashback that you are in a cruiser and this storm comes in and you fall off the cruiser and you die. Then you start trying to making a sign using rocks but instead of help, you spell hell because you don't have enough rocks, it I then laugh comfourtably but then you hear some rumbling and you see a very huge buizel and you're like WHOA! and it starts talking to you about wanting you as a son as you accept and then you go to the forest and you tell him how you came to this island and then you go to this river and buizel asked some of the other buizel's where a pokemon named floatzel is and they said it went to the waterfall so you go there. As you go further you see these puddles of a radiated substance called ununwhatever its called then this 5th generation pokemon called a mandibuzz comes out of nowhere and tries to catch you but you tripped and fell into the radiation puddle and you start to die but buizel grabs you out of the stuff and he makes a run for it. You then reach a waterfall where Elder Floatzel is and she rinses you in the waterfall as everyone in chemistry knows that most metals and gases can become neutral with water after that floatzel tells you someone that can help you out but she doesn't know its name but it is said to grow light, then you and buizel go to another adventure. You follow the river but buizel starts to get hungry so he swallows an entire remoraid and you're like Holy Crap! and then you both go to sleep but in the next morning, a seviper comes out of nowhere and tries to eat buizel, whatever you do, run or you will be forced to become seviper's slave for eternity! So your runningrunningrunning dada da dada da dadadada dada dadada and then you accidently fall off a cliff and you die but you don't die you just fall on a soft fluffy blanket of some sort and you try running again but you stepped on a twig and the fluffy blanket turns out to be RESHIRAM!!! Oh My ****ing God!!! But it tries to eat you but you taste horrible and it spits you out and it then apologises, not knowing that you were the great destroyer and you are like 'what?' and Reshiram tells you about the macro and you and then it takes you to a temple and you go in and then you try to reach for a rope but you die and then you try to reach for the rope and grabbed it and you accidentally crash into the wall on the other side, and then you go to this floor with letters on it and it's like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. You try the word macro but when you stepped on on of its letters, you fall to a pit and its full of lava and you die you try your name and all but your name falls into the pit of lava and you then go to the other side. You go to this Hallway full of faces and you stepped on a switch and one of the faces shoots a dart at you and you die, and then you go to this hallway full of faces and you make it to the other side and you get the great destroyer's weapon what appears to be what you call a gunsword, which is kinda like the gunlance in the monster hunter games, and then these pokemon called galvantula and jolticks come out of nowhere and you're like 'hey! is that a wurmple?' and then you run away as they look around to find it, and then you make it out of the temple and you see Floatzel and Reshiram and Floatzel starts to train you which is very kind of difficult for your character to do because Floatzel is one tough cookie. After you complete your training Seviper appears from nowhere and he wants you to be his slave and your like IMMA FIRING MA LAZAH and with the gunsword in gun mode, you blast a huge laser! Then the buizels finished the raft and you go to fight the macro and you realise that it is actually a Lugia and you go to this epic boss fight and then you die, and then you go to this epic boss fight and then you die, and you go to this epic boss fight and it tries to eat you, but you start chargin ya lazah and your like SHOOP DA WHOOOOOOOOOOP! and Lugia dies, but it makes a huge wave and the wave falls on you and you die. And then you see a lone figure and he said that you complete your quest but you will go on another quest soon. Then you wake up and you get pooped on by a seagull and a helicopter comes in and picks you up and you don't die and you meet up with your family and you live happily ever after. The female story looks similar but there is different pokemon. I suggest you follow these steps because if you're not, you won't be able to get the true ending.</span></div></div>",

Zekrom sighs as it seemes annoyed. \"Let me tell you a legend from a few years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few years ago, there was a very huge pokemon the size of a tree, a pokemon that defends its territory that intrudes its airspace. The pokemon around the island call it the Macro because it is the most biggest pokemon on the island. One day, a human came to this island with a mysterious weapon of unimaginable power. With the weapon, the human managed to defeat the Macro, and found its way back home. The macro still lives on though and will still protect the mountain it calls home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're telling me that I'm the Chosen one?\" You will say. \"That is a trick question.\" it said, \"You must enter the temple of the Great Weapon to find out. Hop on my back so we can go there. Make sure the Dewott follows, he will help you out once you enter.\" So you obeyed and you and Zekrom flew to the Temple of the Great Weapon.</span></div></div>",

Dewott looks around the place, \"So this is the temple...\" \"Yes,\" Zekrom nodded, \"You two shall enter the temple and try to aquire the great weapon.\" \"What do you mean try?\" You asked, looking confused. \"This place is guarded by a number of traps,\" Zekrom said, \"One false smooth, and its the end to the afterlife.\" Dewott seem's that he already knows, \"You didn't have to say that. I will defend her with my bravery!\" \"Okay then,\" Zekrom said, \"Well then, good luck.\" So you and Dewott enter the Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go deeper into the entrance, you start to fell a sudden movement. \"Look out!\" Dewott called out, as part of the ceiling started to fall down onto where you stand.

You look to find a stone panel on the wall written in Unown. You are very good at reading foreign languages and start to read them, \"I don't think we will be trapped in this place. It says here that pushing this panel will open the walls, allowing us to leave this place.\" Dewott looks at the panel, \"You're right. Sorry about that.

Look.\" you pointed out to another entrance from the other side. \"How are we able to get there?\" Dewott asked, \"It's too far away.\" \"Well how about you try to jump to the other side?\" you said to Dewott. \"Are you sure?\" Dewott said, \"It's kind of far where we are.\" \"Trust me.\" you will say. Dewott took a deep breath. He picks you up and puts you on his back. \"Okay...\" Dewott said, \"Here we go!\" Dewott runs back to the other room for a head start, and then he runs toward the cliff and jumps. However, the other side was too far for Dewott to make it. A soon as you believe you are both falling to your doom, something wierd happened. Dewott landed face first on an invisible floor! \"Well,\" You said, \"That was embarassing.\" \"No kidding.\" Dewott mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Dewott enter the next room while you were walking on that disguised floor and you find something very amazing. \"The Great Weapon!\" Dewott shouted, \"We found it!\" You walk to the object to see what appears to be actually a shield. \"That's what we were here for?\" You exclaimed, \"A shield!?\" You sighed in depression, \"Oh well, at least we found it.\" As you removed the shield from its pedestal it was set atop on, something is happening. A swarm of hungry giant spinarak and ariados appeared from the cieling and are ready to attack. \"Uh-oh!\" Dewott said, \"It's an ariados nest!

One of the ariados starts shooting you with poison sting. You deflect it with your shield and suddenly, part of it fell off! \"Well that's just great!\" You will say, but wait. There are two straps for each half of the shield. They are probably used for Dual Swords. You pick the other half up and start taking down the Ariados that attacked you. Soon after that, the Spinarak and the Ariados start to skitter away. \"Yahoo!\" Dewott cheered, \"We did it!\" \"Yeah,\" you said calmly, \"Now let's get out of this dump.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dewott then leave the cave outward to outside. There you see Zekrom talking to a different pokemon, the same Samurott that you met when Dewott was an Oshawott. \"So,\" Zekrom said to you, \"I see you obtained the Great Weapon.\" \"Sure do.\" you will say with a smile. Samurott walks toward you, \"You did an excellent job with your teamwork with Oshawott, I mean Dewott.\" \"That's all right,\" Dewott said. Samurott looks back at you, \"I guess the time has come that I should teach you how to use the Weapon properly. Come we must train.\" Nodding, you and Samurott go to what appears to be an open field. \"Prepare yourself,\" Samurott said with a growl, \"I'm not going to go easy on you.\" And so your training begins.</span></div></div>",

That was one way to lure prey to your awaiting belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today was different, you had not seen any Pokemon today, which was indeed strange as they are always running around playing. Your stomach grumbled, you frowned but you kept stalking the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been 10 minutes, and you had heard some noises ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans, you had been taught to never harm them, but you were starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it, you thought, and revealed yourself to them. It was a couple, a female and a male. Maybe they had been kissing, you had thought when they turned their heads towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male got in front of the other and looked to be covering her, protecting her, maybe? It wouldn't matter, you stalked closer to them, the human's posture failed when he saw your large breasts, and even more when you started to reveal more of your boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand out, hoping the human would hold it, and after he started at it for a while, he grasped it. You smiled before using your magic to shrink his size, the female behind looked horrified, but you grabbed her shoulder and shrunk her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your feet you had two tiny humans, one confused and another scared. He bent over to pick them up, and raising them to your face. Your eyes stared at their no naked bodies. The male had a large limb in between his legs, most likely his penis. The female and a medium sized pair of boobs, you licked your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed the male in your cleavage, while bending down to put the female by your tired feet, and them placing her under them. She tickled you as she tried to get out, but the sweat from walking for so long stopped her from moving anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seemed to be blushing heavily, with his hand on his penis, moving it back and forth, confused your removed from your rack and placed him on your infront of your face, and an idea formed in your head, you opened your mouth, saliva strands connecting the top and bottom, your tongue getting out your mouth like a snake. And giving the human a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped in pleasure as you kept doing it, forcing your tongue in between his legs and into his mouth, he started to choke. White liquid flew out his cock, tasting a little salty, but still very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped shoving you tongue inside of him and placed him inside your large mouth, he tried to stand up, but just slipped and hit face first into your saliva. He started to scream, but you tilted your head back and swallowed him hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female was still tickling your feet, not even knowing her companion being swallowed as your large breasts blocked her view,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrunched your sweaty toes, grasping the tiny human, and lifted your feet up. You picked her up and started to play with her breasts, smiling and she cried and pleaded, your tongue, still slightly covered in the semen from the male. And she knew it apparently as her crying became louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva dripped from her hair and face. But after a while you had have enough and placed her inside your mouth. Tilted your head and swallowed her, you could feel her breasts slip down your throat.</span></div></div>",

So you were doing pilot lessons with your instructor and you suddenly get hit by a burst of fire and the plane crashes and you both die. But then you wake up in the crashed plane and you see that your instructor is the only one who is dead. So you're in this forest and you find this pond and you get splashed in the face by an Oshawott who is defending it's territory. And it talks too and you're like 'OMG! the Oshawott can talk!' You realise that the Oshawott thinks you're a Jynx and you say 'I'm a human not a Jynx' and he's like 'WHAT! you're a human!!' and then he apoligises for the assault. You ask the little otter how to get out of the island, so he wants you to follow him. You then spot some orange slime so you touch it and it hurts so much and Oshawott uses water gun to take the slime out of your hand, but then a huge Braviary comes out of nowhere and takes you away while Oshawott falls into the slime, but then there was a huge stream of water which hits Braviary which releases you and you fall to your death and 'OH MY GOD! I'm gonna die!' and Oshawott who somehow grew about the size of you was like \"no you're not.' and he saves you. Later on you meet this huge Samurott and tells you the only person, or pokemon to be exact, with the ability to grow dark can lead you to safety. So you and Oshawott go out to find the pokemon but you both take a rest for the next day. And the next day Oshawott gets ambushed by a Huge Arbok but bloats it up with water so much that the Arbok gets flown away. And then, Oshawott evolves into a Dewott. Later you go out to collect some berries and you get attacked by Zekrom, who is the pokemon you were suppose to look for. Then you're saved by Dewott again and you found out that Zekrom has a thorn in its foot and you get it out and Zekrom comes to his senses and thanks you and Dewott and takes you to a temple of the Sacred weapon of some sort. And you and Dewott avoid a lot of traps and junk and then you get to the weapon's room but by the time you grab it, the room started to turn 'evil'...and you get ambushed by Ariados and Spinaraks but you took down most of them with your weapon and you got out of the temple in time. Later you start training with Samurott and then you and Dewott go to the mountain summit to fight the Macro but then you get ambushed by the same Arbok from last time and starts eating Dewott, and if you don't save him you will become Arbok's slave forever, but if you save Dewott by slashing Arbok's face with your weapon, you will save Dewott and he will blast Arbok off into the sky. After that, you both made it to the summit and Dewott says good-bye. You then fight against Ho-Oh, the macro of the female character's story. And you start blocking its attacks and slash it with your weapon and then after it falls to the ground all KO'd the thud was so fierce that you fall off a cliff and then you die.<br>\r\nBut then you meet this armored guy who tells you that you completed your quest and you suddenly wake up in a hospital, and you find out that your instructor was there and was actually alive and said that you were in a coma. So you get ready for your mission with the Earth Defenders and that's how the story ends and yeah. The male character's story is similar but there are different pokemon in that story. I hope this will help you get to the true ending and yeah have a good time! ;)</span></div></div>",
