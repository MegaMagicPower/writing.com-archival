The witch saw this and said \"Not so fast, you're too young to wield that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMami then fired her gun and the witch shot a pink beam at Mami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were hit by the other ones strike. Fortunately, Mami wasn't hurt. The beam actually appeared to do nothing at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMami walked it off like it was nothing \"Eh, that was easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two other magic girls were there, Homura and Kyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? We should see if that beam did anything?\" Homura said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, its nothing\" Mami exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the spell kicked in. Her body started regressing at light speed. She looked down at her hands as they shrunk. Her hold body shrunk. The weight of her clothes became crushing. \"Whaa wha happwenin to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lord...\" Kyoko said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMami's regression eventually finished. She was nothing but a 1 year old now, crawling around in her clothes and looking for an exit. Huge hands quickly came down and picked her up. All of Mami's clothing below the waist fell, leaving bottom naked. A breeze passed by and Mami only had one thing to do. Cry. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura, who was holding her, quickly pat her back. There there.. its okay. I'm here and I won't let anything happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-bu I doghn wanna be a babwy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't go back in time for something so... insignificant. Besides, you look really really cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu me naa babwy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are now. Come with me, you and I can be daughter and mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko finally said something \"Hey! What about me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be her mother too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then we'll both be her mother. She needs two parents anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMami blushed \"No I doghn-ta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura just rocked her back and forth and ignored her. \"So Kyoko, could you get some baby supplies for her. I'll take her home and get things situated best I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"because I can stop time and prevent any spectators from seeing her like this. A baby in big girl clothes, people are going to get curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko sighed \"Good point... Well then don't hog her when I get back. Its gonna take both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura smiled \"Of Course.\"</span></div></div>",
