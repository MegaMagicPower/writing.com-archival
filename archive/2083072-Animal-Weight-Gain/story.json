Kai's parents were both very happy that their son was so excited to have a dog. He had been asking about getting one for months. What they didn't know was that Kai had BIG ideas. It all started a few years ago, when Kai was about 8. He saw a cartoon in which a character fattened up their pet dog until he was a big, squishy blob of blubber big enough to lay down on. The image stuck in his mind, and every time he saw that episode he would lean in close and gaze at the screen during that part, imagining how it would feel to snuggle up to all that furry fat. Time and time again, he's find an episode of a cartoon where a character packs on pounds, but they always find a way to shed it all by the end of the episode, leaving Kai disappointed and wondering \"Why can't they just stay fat? It looks cool!\" But nothing would top the excitement he'd feel when it was a dog, or any animal for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year ago, when his parents first mentioned that they had thought about getting a pet, Kai's mind immediately flew to that scene with the boy laying on top of his fattened dog. Could he achieve that? Could he even have a chubby dog? Kai wasn't dumb, he knew that his parents wouldn't get a dog just so he could fatten it into oblivion, but what if... Kai then began to bring up how much he wanted a dog, and now he had one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai down at Sam, who was still resting in his lap. He was thin. Not dangerously so, but Kai could feel his ribs. As he stroked Sam behind the ears, Kai imagined how it would feel if his hands were running through rolls of blubber, squishing them between his fingers, or how heavy Sam would feel in his lap if he was so big his belly hoisted his legs off the ground. \"Soon, boy.\" Kai whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kai's mother said from the front seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just telling Sam we'll be home soon!\" Kai said as embarrassment flushed his cheeks slightly red. \"By the way, what's for dinner?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week had gone by since Sam's adoption and he could be happier! The german shepherd was already well adjusted to his new life, getting used to using the bathroom outside and new meal times. Kai had mentioned to his parents how thin Sam looked, and they agreed that he seemed a bit underweight, so Kai's mother purchased a formula of dog food designed to help underweight dogs achieve a healthier size. Kai also asked if he could take some responsibilities with Sam, like feeding him. His parents were impressed and gladly let Kai manage feeding and walking Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai took full advantage of these opportunities. He'd keep Sam's food bowl full as much as he could, always leaving a bit extra for him to eat, enough that it looked like Sam had left scraps when in fact he had already eaten a meal and a half. He'd mix some sugar in Sam's water bowl as well, figuring it would help speed along Sam's growth. Every now and then Kai would be able to save leftovers from his own dinner and pass them off to Sam without his parents seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai was hoping he could get Sam used to eating large quantities of food. He recalled that in the cartoon he loved, the character fattened their dog by not just feeding him fattening human food, but a lot of it, and the dog began to expect large servings and lots of calories. Even if Kai couldn't order a pizza just for Sam so long as his parents were around, he could at least do his best to get Sam used to being stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the week Sam had spent with Kai's family he had fattened up to an average weight. He wasn't fat, or even chubby, but Kai could feel that there was more meat on the dog's bones. It was enough that Kai was encouraged, and he looked forward to seeing how Sam would develop and how far/fat he could go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai sat on the couch, still in his pyjamas, watching tv with Sam under his arm. His jet black hair was messy, dangling almost in his eyes, and his pyjamas didn't quite fit right, as he was outgrowing them. Kai was neither chubby nor thin, but a soft average. He looked around, checking to see if anyone was nearby, and seeing that nobody was, reached into a nearby bag of potato chips, grabbed a few and fed them to Sam, who chomped them up and nuzzled into his beloved human, who smiled in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai's mother entered the room and smiled as well, appreciating how much Kai loved having Sam around. She them remembered something, and put on her mother persona. \"Kai, I told you to get dressed! Bryan is going to be over soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was Kai's best friend. Their parents knew each other from college and had stayed close. Bryan was coming over to spend the weekend while their parents went off to a mini-vacation they had planned. They were supposed to have a babysitter, but she canceled at the last minute and their parents decided that the two boys should be alright for two days. They had to start learning to be responsible at some point, and if there was anything they needed they had a list of numbers they could call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai nodded to his mother and hoisted himself up off the couch. Once in his room Kai undressed and went to pick out his clothes. Before slipping on his shirt, Kai examined his body in the mirror. He recalled that in the cartoon, as the dog got fatter, so did the boy who fattened him. Kai poked his stomach. It wasn't flat, but it wasn't chubby. The young boy wondered what it'd feel like to grow a belly of his own. Well, Sam's belly was the priority. Kai slipped on a neat polo shirt and slipped into the bathroom to comb his hair before returning to the couch to snuggle with Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Bryan arrived. Bryan was 12, a year older than Kai. He had short, dusty brown hair and grey/blue eyes. The last time Kai had seen Bryan was a few months ago. Back then, the two friends were the same height, but now Kai could see that Bryan had grown a few inches taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had also grown a few inches around the midsection. He was wearing a shirt Kai hadn't seen on him before, and it seemed to be the next size up, but it rested on his belly in a way that lightly showed the indentation of his belly button. His stomach poked out a few inches. Most noticeably, Bryan's face had rounded out and he had the start of a second chin. There was no mistaking it, Bryan had gotten a bit chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai stood, rooted to the spot for a split second, rapidly scanning his friend with his eyes. Bryan extended his arms and pulled Kai in for a big hug. \"Hey man, I missed you!\" Bryan said. His voice sounded a little different, as if it had begun changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Bryan! Long time no see!\" Kai said, snapping out of his trance. He let his arms wrap around his friend. \"Soft...\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two,\" Kai's father started, \"You know you can call us at any time if something is wrong. We won't be more than an hour away, and you can call the neighbors if you need to. All the numbers are on the fridge. All the food you'll need is in there, but there's money on the counter just in case. Kai, Sam should have enough to make it through the weekend too, but if not the pet store is close enough that I'm fine with you walking. Any questions?\" The boys shook their heads. \"Alright, stay safe and have a good time, you two!\" And with that, Kai's parents headed out the door, leaving the two boys alone for the weekend.</span></div></div>",

We got him just last week and he's already the best dog ever!\" Kai replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he sure is!\" Bryan said, cooing the dog who was panting happily from the attention. Sam then flipped around and grabbed the bag of potato chips Kai had been feeding him earlier and stuck his head in, lapping at the salty, oily snacks. \"Oh, Sam, stop that!\" Bryan laughed. \"Aren't you going to stop him?\" He turned to Kai, whose eyes were glued to the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, let him have his fun. This weekend is all about us having as much fun as we can! After all, no parents!\" Bryan returned Kai's statement with a high five. Kai then paused for a moment before hesitantly adding \"Besides, don't you think Sam would be cute if he were a little chubby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you think so?\" Bryan absentmindedly poked at his own soft tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like do you remember that episode of Tim and Jeffrey? The one where the Tim feeds his dog and makes him chubby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course! It's like my favorite episode. But the dog in that episode didn't get a little chubby, he got huge!\" Bryan extended his hands from his stomach for emphasis, as if he were holding a large belly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" Kai paused again and swallowed nervously. \"What if Sam got that fat?\" Kai's face flushed red as he waited for Bryan's reply, which came in a mere second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that'd be cool.\" Bryan responded casually, patting Sam's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? You think so?\" Kai stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he'd be all soft and cuddly! And he'd probably love the food. Too bad you can't really fatten up a dog that much.\" Bryan sighed wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what if you could?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai clenched his hands into his pants. He wasn't so sure why admitting this to his friend was so... embarrassing. It brought heat to his face, caused his heart to race and his palms to sweat. \"I've.... I've been fattening Sam up. I really want to make him fat so I can have a fat dog like in Tim and Jeffrey. I've wanted that for so long, it's the reason I wanted a dog so badly. And last week Sam was really thin and now he's not, so it's working! I could make him super fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Bryan said again, casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so you don't think it's weird? You don't think I'm crazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man, I think it's cool! We should totally see how much we can feed Sam over the weekend. Oh that reminds me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Kai, now reaffirmed, leaned in to hear Bryan's reply.</span></div></div>",

Bryan had perked up at Kai's comment \"well spit it out already!\" he said already excited for what the idea was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai looked at the dog for a bit and smiled a bit \"well the pet store down the street sells this new brand of dog food and I read on the internet that the dog food is highly fattening.

I thought that since the food isn't that expensive we could get that and also get some pizzas not only for ourselves but for lovely sam over here and that way we could fatten him up with not only the kibble but also the pizza.\" Kai finished off with a bit of a chuckle recalling some of the pictures that the owners of the dogs who baught the dog kibble posted showing ther bloated and fattened pooche's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked over at Kai and begain to think nodding a bit before saying </span></div></div>",

We can't have your parents finding out about our project, right?\"  Kai nodded and called up the pizza place, \"Hi, uh, I'd like an order for delivery, please.\"  The man on the phone responded, \"Ok, by credit or debit?\"  Kai froze.  \"Can I pay with cash?\" he asked.  \"Sorry,\" the cashier responded, \"No, store policy.\"  Kai nodded, \"Ok, can I at least place an order then?\"  When the man responded affirmatively, Kai continued, \"Ok, I need two extra large whatever-you-call the all-meat pizzas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will that complete you order?

What name shall I put this order under?\"  When Kai told the man his name, the man thanked Kai and hung up.  \"That was easy; and, fortunately, the pizza place is only about 5 blocks from here,\" Kai told Bryan, who then suggested, \"Maybe we could bring Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kai considered and replied, \"Why not?  I've heard it's good to get dogs to exercise occasionally to increase their hunger and to keep them in good shape.  We don't want Sam to be out of shape, just nice and soft.\"  Bryan agreed, and the three went off to the pizza place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The real reason Kai had brought Sam was to get Sam the free burgers that a struggling burger joint gave away to try and promote its product.  Kai and Bryan would get burgers, and Kai was sure he could get one for Sam too.  Thus, when the trio walked by the place, and the man asked whether the kids wanted a burger, he even offered Sam a free burger without Kai's request, which Sam happily accepted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the boys reached the pizza place, they stood outside and covertly fed Sam their burgers, which he happily received.  When Kai's name was called, he went and got the pizzas and payed for them before he gave the pizzas to Bryan and held the Pepsi and Sam's leash.  Walking back, Sam seemed a tad discomforted by the food he had inhaled and flopped on the ground while the boys ate their pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Only when Kai offered Sam a piece of pizza did the dog revive and snap up the greasy mess and swallow it whole and belch contentedly before he went and lay with Kai and Bryan on the couch on which he ate chips and slept.  And the three boys sat, ate, fed Sam, and rubbed the dog's belly.  Sam wished every day were like this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To the boys' mild disappointment and later relief, Sam didn't seem to gain much noticebable weight.  But when the two days were done, there were considerable leftovers to be had: Pizza, Chinese food, burgers and fries, and a liter of Pepsi, the first liter of which had been given to Sam in small quantities over the two days.  And to Kai, Sam felt slightly softer and more comfortable.  Sam, who was barely two-years-old and had liged emaciated for much of that time, now felt loved and healthy for the first time in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the boys' parents got home, they\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

We need to take Sam to the vet!\"  Kai was dreased and ready to go, but the announcement surprised him.  At first, he was worried, but he pondered and found no reason to believe that his parents had discovered his ploy.  So Kai rode along, stroking his dog's soft, ample flanks, which dimpled slightly when Sam sat, a phenomenon Kai found rather cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When they arrived at the vet, Kai snatched and discreetly fed Sam a few complimentary treats which the vet offered.  Sam snatched them eagerly; and after a short wait, Sam was called into the examination room, where the doctor administered the shots, which required a few bribes of food to coax Sam into allowing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then came the crucial part.  The doctor took Sam's height, a few other metrics, and finally, Sam's weight.  The doctor sighed, a sound only Kai and Sam heard.  Sam was an average sized German Shepherd, standing 25 inches at the withers, the doctor noted before saying, \"He's 107 pounds; he should weigh, at most, 85.  I think he's 22 pounds overweight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately, Kai's mother became defensive and retorted calmly, \"Well, maybe he's just a big dog.  We give him just 2 and 1/2 cups twice a day, right Kai?\"  When Kai nodded, she continued, \"And he gets zero tablescraps and daily walks.  What more can I do?  We don't have the money for an expensive hypothyroidism test either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The doctor stuttered and looked speechless, \"If that's the case, I don't know; just reduce his food more.  I don't know.\"  When the doctor walked out, Kai's mother looked smug and said, \"Come on, boys, let's get out of here.  And for being good boys, what would you both like for lunch?  We'll show that doctor.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having eaten at Wendy's, the boys were relaxing on the couch when Kai was feeding Sam a chip as his mother walked in.  \"Kai?  Did you just give Sam a chip?\"  To not sound defensive, Kai nonchalantly responded, \"No, I fumbled and dropped it; and Sam rightfully got it.\"  Seeming unconvinced, Sam's mother continued to eye Kai suspiciously before she forgot about the whole incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Kai never forgot this, and he grew more paranoid about Sam's weight; and yet, Kai's parents never grew suspicious.  They always questioned the doctor's judgment and always believed Kai that Sam was only fed limited portions of 5 cups a day, the minimum recommended amount on the bag, despite that the reality was that Sam's portions and scraps intake increased slowly and steadily over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At four years old, Sam weighed 126 pounds; at five, 138 pounds; and at 6, he weighed 160 pounds.  By the time he was seven, however, Kai was sixteen, and had a job; but Kai still cared as deeply about Sam and his goal as he always had.  Although Kai knew he had accomplished his goal, he wondered whether he could continue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But over time, the burger joint of Kai's youth had failed; and Kai had become increasingly chubby and lazy, walking Sam less and less, a phenomenon which displeased Sam at first; but later, with Sam's achy, creaking joints, Sam would come to appreciate.  At this point, Sam was twice his \"ideal\" weight and was quite hefty, with flanks that protruded outward, instead of forming an hourglass shape which they would have ideally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But one day, when Sam tried to shift his bulk to get up, he found that his joints ached more than usual, so he nudged Kai for help.  Kai nodded and fed Sam a chip, which Sam happily accepted before he nudged Kai again.  Kai understood Sam this time and got up to put Sam outside.  When Sam didn't follow, Kai realized what Sam needed.  So he grabbed a towel, shifted Sam under it, and waddled with Sam to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

Never mind that I may be double the weight that my vet says I should be, never mind that I take an entire minute to stand on my own, and never mind that I can walk no more than ten steps without having to lie down, exhausted from my own weight.  If there is food, I will eat it; and I wouldn't trade any morsel of food for the world.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At least now I can say that I have sympathetic owners.  Things weren't always so for me.  So to understand why I feel compelled to eat every scrap of food my owners give me, I must inform you of my past.  My dreary, dismal past.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I remember nothing about my mother except that she always taught me to apreciate edible ever given to me, a skill that would serve me well in the future.  I was born, my dear reader, in a grimy, malodorous slum-alley that smelled of human urine, vomit, feces, and alcohol.  Yes, I was born a stray, not something that I'm proud of.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In case my dear reader hadn't gathered, I am a dog, specifically, a Black Labrador Retriever.  I am not sure of my place of origin, nor even where I am now.  These things were never important to me, so I never found out.  I am a standard twenty-three inches at the withers and 163 pounds, I know, more than double my ideal weight according to breed standard.  My name is Saxe.  At least, that was the name given to me by my previous owners.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of whom, when I was born, as soon as we were weened, my mother left.  I harbor no resentments because, in complete candor, I would have done the same thing.  We were a nuisance and a burden to her, so she had no reason to keep us. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But, anyway, when I was hot, hungry, and alone with my siblings, a man came when I was sleeping and picked me up.  I of course awoke and squirmed around, but his grip was ironclad.  He brought me to his truck, which smelled of tobacco.  Not a pleasant smell, but still better than my previous habitat.  The man drove like a madman, which is why I am still hesitant inside a car to this day.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the truck stopped and I got out, I discovered that we were in the middle of nowhere.  Stixville, we shall call it.  And I immediately new that something was off.  Inside, I could hear an older and a younger woman's voices yelling at the top of their lungs.  Immediately, the man barged in, started yelling at the both of them to shut up.  A shouting match ensued, followed by a loud slap that I only heard, because I was cowering in the corner, afraid for my life.  Eventually, the shouting reached a climax before it died off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, I noticed a boy, perhaps, in human years, 14 or 15, who picked me up and tried to soothe me.  But by his own trembling, I could tell that he was afraid too.  He took me into his room and tried his best to comfort me.  The boy was the only solace that I had in that house.  He was a quiet, thougtful boy who talked to himself a lot about things that I didn't begin to understand.  But I enjoyed his company and he seemed to enjoy mine.  He also tried to feed me as often as he could, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

There were times where, for days at a time, he would leave me outside, with little food or water; but out of the blue, he would let me inside and give me all the food that I wanted and let me do as I pleased.  I am to this day scared of that man just thinking of him.  The boy was also scared of him; why, I never found out.  All I knew was that the man would come into the boys room at night occasionally and throw me outside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The boy fed me outside whenever the man was not home and I was outside.  I was conditooned to eat as much as I could whenever I could.  The boy was caught once and, I assume, severely reprimanded.  The boy also fed me human food whenever he could.  I remember that he also enjoyed food and had a soft pad of fat on his stomach that made him a comfortable pillow.  My weight went in cycles.  But slowly, very slowly, I managed to gain a tiny bit of weight.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was in that house for years, until, one day, a man whom I had never seen before saw me in the back yard chained, muddy, and looking half-starved, and he took me to an animal shelter.  He also took the boy, but somewhere else.  I haven't seen either of them since.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The animal shelter was a dingy, overcrowded place.  Donations were never enough to cover the cost of food for all of us completely; so I was constantly hungry.  I was never walked for longer than five minutes every three hours.  My cage was too small for me.  I never became vicious, only defensive.  I still don't completely trust humans because of these experiences.  I trust my current master more than anyone else, but I am still occasionally suspicious of him.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After perhaps a year, maybe six months, I lost track to be honest, until I met my current owner. He looked fully grown, but still young for a human.  He wears the same thing every day: a plain gray suit with a white shirt and a black tie and black shoes.  Whenever he is not in that uniform, he wears blue jeans and t-shirts that reveal the soft pads of soft tissue which the boy had, but slightly larger.  He vaguely resembles the boy, but not really.  He lives alone, except for me.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When my master came for me, he seemed to know that I was his dog.  He walked over to me immediately and helped me out of the crate.  He took me into his car and drove me to a house in a small town where I live today.  Not much of note has happened to me in my life.  I get fed whenever I want, I nap whenever I want, and the man pets me whenever I want and he is home.  He does leave sometimes, but usually just for an hour or two.  I miss him dearly, but I am only thinking about my past today because the man has been gone for more than two hours.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wait, is that his car?  I think that he is in the driveway now.  Except that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

I knew that I would never be replaced, but I did feel like I now had to compete for attention.  When Coburg, or Coby, as he would come to be called, first came home, I knew almost innately what was expected of me.  I would have to teach him the ways, manners, and customs of our house.  What was acceptable and what wasn't.  I would teach him, perhaps most importantly, to appreciate food.  I would never compete with Coby for food, but I would clean up after him if he left his food down for too long.  My master would give us all the food we wanted, but only at certain times.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I taught Coby that begging was not the best way to get food from our master; where to wait so that he would give us the most food.  Coby, being a puppy, naturally wanted to play; but seeing that my old bones couldn't keep up with him, I began telling him the stories of my own life when Coby and I  were alone.  I could tell that Coby was enthralled by my stories; and that he could now see why I craved to always have food.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After meals, Coby would curl up with his head either on my flank or on our master's abdomen, both made comfortable pillow for him.  Perhaps I should inform you that Coby was a chocolate Labrador Retriever, similar to me in every physical way but hair color and stature.  Coburg was a restless and curious puppy, usually getting himself into trouble while I slept, only to be discilplined by the master later.  The master would play with him and walk the both of us occasionally, but he stopped after I nearly collapsed halfway through and was panting for fifteen minutes after we got home.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coby never really lost his puppy-fat though.  It turned into adolescent fat, but that was the closest he ever got to his ideal weight.  Eventually, he lost his puppylike playfulness and was happy to discuss with me how life was.  I have watched Coby change from a cute puppy; to slightly chubby adolescent with a slight hourglass shape; to a more barrel-chested shape, to having a slight pear shape when he sits.  He eats very well and gets more treats than I did after a year with the master.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Saxe,\" Coburg asked me as I pondered these things, \"what purpose do we serve?\"  I looked up, confused, trying to scramble for an answer before I made a feeble response, \"to serve our master in whatever way he likes.\"  Coburg thought that over for a second before he asked again, \"And what purpose are we serving for our master?\"  Saxe had an easy answer this time, \"To provide him happiness and company,\" and Saxe added, \"and look what we earn,\" he nudged the adipose on his flank, \"luxury that our ancestors never dreamed possible.  We have all the food that we like, all the affection, and with no effort required.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was quiet for a while before he asked again, \"Do you ever feel like you're a slave?\"  I shook my head, \"If I'm a slave, I'm the king of them because I have a standard of living that my forebearers would never have dreamed of.\"  \"But is there not more than food to life?\" Coby asked, disconcerted by my answer, apparently.  \"What do you mean?\" I asked, expectantly.  \"Well, don't you want to go back to nature, to the way things were before all\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this?\" Coby gestured to my ample physique.  \"No, I never really have.  Have I ever told you about where I came from?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coby nodded, \"Many times.\"  \"That's 'the way things were' before all this,\" I responded.  \"That sounds fun,\" Coby nodded.  \"Yeah, until you try it,\" I responded with a chuckle and a shake of my head.  His foolish optimism and na\u00c3\u00afvete would be the end of him.  \"Dogs die, every day, out there, Coburg,\" I whispered, in the most sympathetic tone I could muster, \"I lost brothers and sisters out there.  And my mother.\"  Coby's face saddened, \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"  That's all we said of that issue.</span></div></div>",

My knees hurt when I try and walk, the master has given me magical peanut butter that made the pain lessen considerably, but did not erase that I still have trouble with walking.  I have started waking up in the middle of the night struggling for breath.  When this happens, and fortunately it only happens once every few nights, mostly when I sleep on my stomach, I go over to my food bowl and eat what's left over, and whatever remains in Coby's bowl as well.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I will not pretend that I do not know the cause of these problems, but I haven't the heart to try and stop these problems.  I feel that to do something half-heartedly or unwittingly is foolish.  If one wishes to be fat, accept the consequences and do not complain.  I received many sidelong glances on my short walk the other day; I don't care.  I am observant, but I don't care.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coburg keeps asking me \"meaning of life questions.\"  His heart is young and na\u00c3\u00afve, full of youthful passion.  He turned a year old today.  The master celebrated like he celebrates all our birthdays.  He divides the cake between us equally.  My proportion is reduced, but I still love Coburg.  The master got a bigger cake to compensate.  I inhaled my piece rather quickly, so I watched Coby try and eat his piece.  I watched as the small bubbles of fat that formed at his waist when he sat jiggle slightly as he tried to eat his cake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I could always tell when Coby was bored.  He would always ask pointless questions like, \"are we supposed to just sit here and slowly die?\"  His questions were always vaguely disconcerting but harmless.  I was surprised when he turned and asked me, \"Do you think that we are always being surveiled?\"  I chuckled and shook my head, \"No, Coby, not always.  Our master may control our lives, but his control is better than any alternative.\"  Coby was never satisfied with my answers; he would always shake his head and try and fall back asleep.  But this time he asked me, \"Is\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this life\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6really better than freedom?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps for the millionth time, I explained to him the advantages of our current life over a difficult life on the streets.  \"You're just bored and full of youthful energy,\" I told him, \"You'll grow out of it.\"  Coby looked at me for a second, \"But I don't want to,\" he said to me, \"I always want to be full of energy and young and restless.\"  I chuckled again at Coby's optimism.  \"You face no challenges here,\" I replied, pointing out the problem with his proposal.  \"Maybe that's the problem,\" Coby replied, \"I want a challenge.\"</span></div></div>",

Although these disappearances never worry our master, they worry me a good deal.  I always think that Coby has either run away or is plotting some conspiracy to overthrow humanity.  He does this intermittently, especially when I am asleep.  He knows that I would never approve of his disappearing for more than a few minutes, call me smothering, I know.  I am a loyal dog who loves his<br>\r\nmaster.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today, however, I managed to catch Coburg when he left the house today.  Our master wasn't home, so I waited a couple of minutes and quietly pursued Coby.  I should perhaps inform you, if you haven't deduced from my previous lectures, that I am woefully out of shape.  I admit, my life has some drawbacks and is not for the faint of heart; but it is, to me, far more fulfilling.  My first obstacle was getting out of the doggy door.  I rarely have ever used it, partially because it is rarely open and partially because I had no use for it when humans were around.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I heaved and squirmed for a few moments before I lay still.  I then heaved and finally wriggled my abdomen through the wretched thing.  It was quite painful, and I have no intention of using the door again.  I'm sure that I have bruises from it.  Fortunately, I was downwind from Coby and picked up his smell easily.  I raced as quickly as I could, which seemed to me like an agonizing waddle, after Coby.  Fortunately, Coby, despite his youth, seemed in no hurry to get to his destination.  So I cauht and stalked Coby, who took a relatively straight path to the edge of our property and crossed under the fence at a whole that he seemed to have dug to accomodate me.  I was pleased.  But then I smelled a<br>\r\nsmell that nearly made me convulse in sickness: the smell of dog's blood.</span></div></div>",

I nearly blew my cover by almost coughing and gagging.  But I forced myself to continue walking.  It was a terrible, excruciating ordeal; the smell of blood grew stronger with each passing step.  I forced myself to go on further, my astonishment helping me to ignore my pain.  Coby started running, well trotting, because his bulk prevented him from sprinting outright, so I nearly lost him, because my own body so hindered my movement, as I have said, being overweight is not for the faint of heart.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We finally arrived at a semi-clearing in the brush where I saw him for the first time.  He was probably a Belgian Malinois or German Shepherd, but in far worse shape than I had ever been in.  His ribs were visible to me from a moderate distance, despite his relatively heavy coat.  He was chained to a stake, so I knew that this was no accident.  He sensed as soon as I saw him.  He looked over Coby's shoulder and growled.  Coby turned and saw me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Saxe,\" Coby began, before he nearly lost control of his composure.  \"Yes,\" I replied, \"thus is the nature of the most despicable of humanity.  Although humans are capable, like our owner, of doing good things, their natural state is unrefined and barbaric.  Humanity has trained itself, at least some humans have, to do good; but some humans fall to this most primitive state of man.  The one that does this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are you,\" the chained dog snarled, \"what do you know about the wretchedness of humanity?  Look at you, the obese blob who is out of breath after having walked just a few hundred yards.  You're a rich, spoiled lap dog who has never done anything with his life.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perhaps you should listen, sir,\" I began, \"I too, once had an abusive owner.  Never like\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this; but he would chain me outside and starve me.\"  \"HA!\" the other dog interrupted, \"I bet that you mean that your owner once denied you a tablescrap and forced you to get your fat self off the couch to go outside.\"  \"Bowie, please,\" Coby interrupted; but I had slowly shuffled himself to reveal Bowie and Coby his back, down which ran a long, thin line, a scar from where his previous owner had once hit him with a beer bottle and the shards of glass had cut that line.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you need more evidence?\" I finished.  Bowie was silent after that.  \"We have to do something,\" Coby said.  \"What?\" I snapped, \"what can we do?\"  I replied.  \"We can get the master,\" Coburg responded.  \"That's a good plan, but how?\"  \"I have an idea,\" Coby replied mysteriously.</span></div></div>",

My joints ached, and I needed food.  My master had filled our bowls I suppose when he left; so we both devoured their contents when I managed to squeeze through the doggy door.  We waited patiently for our master to g et home.  And when he got home, after he had checked on and fed us, he let us outside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok,\" Coby whispered, \"on three, we start barking.  And when I say run, run as fast as you can toward Bowie, ok?\"  I nodded, unsure of whether the food in my stomach would stay there.  \"One,\" Coby counted, \"two, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 three!\"  Coby and I started barking together as loudly as they could.  Eventually, the master came out to shush us, and Coby said, \"Now!\" and took off at his limbering trot toward Bowie.  I forced myself up and started waddling after Coburg.  The master soon followed.  Our plan had worked.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Our master kept trying to catch us; but because he was as out of shape as Coby, he could barely keep up with me.  Eventually, I have to believe, he smelled the same smell we did: blood and unwashed flesh.  Suddenly we entered Bowie's clearing; the master froze.  He saw Bowie, who growled and showed his teeth.  \"Bowie!\" Coby whispered, \"Don't worry.  It's the master.  Don't worry; he's friendly.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, our master turned and fled.  A few minutes later, he came back with the biggest bowl in our house filled to the brim with dog food, and a bag of potato chips.  He shooed us away and set the bowl in front of Bowie.  The dog ravenously ate, but only managed to eat a quarter, if that, of the bowl's contents.  While that was happening, the master put the shiny metal object to his ear and spoke into it.  At the end, he looked mildly disappointed and put the brick away.  \"Don't worry,\" the master said, \"we'll be back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And the next day came suddenly when a man came to the master's door and reported that he was from animal control.  The master led the man to Bowie and came back carrying Bowie.  The master from then on always seemed paranoid that he underfed us and gave us as many treats as we wanted.  I was most pleased by this development, and Coby was also rather pleased.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're right, Saxe,\" Coburg started one day, \"I am very glad and fortunate to be in this house.

Please do not revert back to Saxe's point of view from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I awoke to the sound of wheezing.  It wasn't a new occurence for Saxe.  Saxe rolled onto his middle, which spread like a cake beneath him when he did.  Saxe can barely walk more than a few paces without having to rest from weariness.  His fat forms large pads on his sides when he sits on his haunches, which he can only do for so long before he has to rest because he front legs tire just from that exertion.  He spends most of his time sleeping nowadays.  And when he is not sleeping, he is eating, doing his business, or talking to me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am not particularly thin myself.  I have small fat pads when I sit, and my body looks like a barrel, but I look nothing like Saxe, who looks like a rounded pear when he stands.  Fat hangs down to his knees and his belly rubs the floor when he sits up.  He always seems hot and sometimes wheezes without having exerted any effort.  And he sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night like he did just now.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I went back to sleep, and when I awoke, Saxe had not stirred.  I went to eat breakfast; and when I arrived, Saxe still hadn't moved.  I thought that this was strange.  I called to him, \"Saxe, come on, breakfast.\"  That usually woke him, or at least made him stir, but this time, he still didn't move.  I sank my paw into his flesh, cold as the room.  That was definitely not right.  I barked until the master came.  I nudged Saxe; the master's face turned grim.  He felt Saxe's heart; and I suppose felt nothing because he shed a tear.  I nuzzled the master, who in turned lathered me with attention.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the autopsy report came in a week later, they diagnosed Saxe with a stroke.

He was continually hungry at increasingly short intervals and always ate when he could.  Saxe had been right; I did lose his youthful energy.  He could no longer run long distances without collapsing.  His fat pads on his sides were now larger when he sat up.  His stomach now definitively rested on the ground.  The vet told the master that I needed to lose weight.  My master paid her no mind; he loves me and thinks that I'm healthy.  I think that I am too.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bowie came home today.  He still has scars, but he looks moderately healthier than when I last saw him.  His ribs are still easily felt, and sometimes visible.  I hear the master mutter about how the people at the animal shelter try and keep their dogs underweight to save money and to arouse more pity for the animals.  I believe him.  Bowie is still untrusting of the master, but tolerates his touch.  Bowie also eats so much that he says he feels nauseous.  But he never actually vomits.  I can see the food form a rock in his stomach.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bowie also contemplates how to be free of human control.  When he isn't sleeping or eating, Bowie paces outside, pondering how to get back at humanity.  \"Why can't you see that some humans are good?\" I ask him continually.  \"I just can't,\" was always his chorus.  I sometimes gave up my food so that Bowie could eat when our master wasn't around.  Bowie seemed to not want it at first, objecting that he knew how much I enjoyed my food; but he usually was coaxed into it, led by my insistence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nevertheless, he pledged to run away.  I noticed that at the same time he went from having a defined hourglass shape the vet wants me to have to a more cylindrical, healthy shape, he grew more insistent on running away.  I tried to plead with him, but he insisted on running away.  \"Coburg,\" Bowie started one day, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

It was the last day of classes and Mike just finished his finals and was ready to spend his summer at his apartment with his favorite husky Spike. The Husky was Mikes best and possibly closest friend considering that the husky was the only thing that he had left. Ever since he was little he was born into a wealthy family, and after he finished high school he was given a large sum of money leaving him very wealthy himself allowing him to pay for his own apartment, college, and pretty much anything he felt like without the worry of his parents or anyone else worrying about him or his spending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike walked into his apartment Spike trotted around the corner happily barking and running up to him. Spike was a very fit husky for his age muscle lining the canines body and his cloud soft and deep colored coat almost shone in the sunlit front room of his apartment. Mike slowly rubbed the husky's belly slowly grinning as the husky let out a few barks and playful growls the man and his dog still playing with each other in the doorway. Mike soon stopped playing with Spike before walking into his apartment closing the door behind him and throwing off his backpack onto the couch turning on the T.V. as he turned it on a news broadcast was finishing up with the reporter showing off a rather portly German shepherd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other news, a new virus has been popping up all over the world. Dogs from all over the world are either bloating up with a mysterious slime and bursting from all of it or they are fattening up at dangerous rates.\" the reporter said in a monotone voice. Mike ignored the end of the broadcast opting to switch to another channel before surfing around for a few more minutes sighing. \"well boy looks like there is nothing on\" he said petting Spike on the head before grabbing the canines leash and hooking it to his collar \"lets go to the dog park\" Mike said happily patting the dog on the side walking out the house mike not caring about the news broadcast thinking that it was just a prank someone was pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike walked into the dog park there were a plethora of big dogs running around in their side of the park and upon Spike entering a German shepherd, Collie, Lab, Golden retriever and Belgian Malinois all walked over to the dog sniffing and barking for Spike to play. Mike giggled happily before removing the lead and letting the dogs play the news broadcast coming into the man's mind once again as he watched the canines play together.</span></div></div>",

This was a bittersweet time in Oliver\u2019s life, as he was in the last semester of high school, and he was preparing to attend a university in another state. It was exciting in many ways, but there was one thing he wasn\u2019t looking forward to; the fact that he would have to leave behind his hometown, and in turn, his family, for years at a time. Somehow, he knew he was going to miss his dog and his younger brother most of all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cC\u2019mon! Look at him, mom! He\u2019s starving!\u201d</i> Oliver\u2019s brother, Billy, complains, pointing to the family dog. <i>\u201cCan\u2019t we just give him some treats?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, honey, but you know what the vet said. No treats until he loses all that weight,\u201d their mother replies, while busily folding clothes. \u201cYou want him to be healthy, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly sighs. <i>\u201cYeah\u2026 but I want him to be happy, too!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver looked up from his phone, gazing across the room at their golden, retriever, Rusty. Rusty\u2019s always been a unique dog, grappling with two genetic disorders in particular; one that resulted in him being very tall, and another that resulted in him being constantly hungry, no matter how full he is. Thus, as you can imagine, he\u2019s a big eater. Unable to resist his cute charm, the family spoiled him relentlessly, giving him all the treats his heart desired. He gained weight quickly, but most of it his weight gain was hidden beneath his long fur, so nobody noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, Rusty was visibly on the heavy side. He didn\u2019t have nearly as much energy as he used to; it took too much energy for him to lug his big, chubby body around, so he spent most of his days relaxing. He\u2019s also become even more obsessed with food than ever. Still, the more weight he gained, the happier and cuter Rusty seemed to become, so the boys were content with the development. Their mother, however, brought the dog to a vet; and now, poor Rusty\u2019s on a diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diet seemed like a pointless endeavour, all things considered. Rusty was hardly even losing any weight. The only thing the diet seemed to accomplish was making him miserable all the time. The once cheerful dog now always had a sad look on his face, his ears drooping, occasionally letting out little sighs of woe. Seeing Rusty be miserable made Billy miserable\u2026 and in turn, seeing Billy miserable made Oliver miserable. Pondering the situation\u2026 Oliver got an idea.</span></div></div>",

Nominally, he was just out to get the essentials\u2026 but he also grabbed something extra along the way, and his parents were none the wiser. He stuffed most of the groceries in the fridge, but he snuck a strange, cardboard box upstairs with him without anyone noticing. <b>\u201cHey, Billy! Could you come up here, dude? I need to show you something!\u201d</b> He called downstairs. He prepared his surprise as Billy ran up the stairs towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</i> Billy asked, stepping into his brother\u2019s room to find him tearing open an unmarked cardboard box. He watched curiously\u2026 only for Oliver to reveal that the box was full of dozens of raw beef patties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cRusty\u2019s been looking hungry lately, huh?\u201d</b> Oliver said, smirking as he saw the shocked, excited look dawn on his brother\u2019s face. <b>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019d like one of these?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOhmygosh! Yes! Oh, this is going to make him so happy!\u201d</i> Billy immediately jumped to his feet, and ran over to the stairwell. <i>\u201cRusty! Rusty! Come here, boy!\u201d</i> The golden retriever seemed hesitant to move\u2026 but eventually, at the boy\u2019s goading, the canine dragged himself up the stairs. The scent of the patties, though, seemed to immediately put a spring in Rusty\u2019s step! Oliver laughed as the golden retriever came bounding into the room, jumping on his hind legs and trying to grab at the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHere, how about a treat for him?\u201d</b> Oliver said, handing Billy a patty. Billy was practically bouncing with excitement himself, so happy to finally be able to give the chubby, hungry dog a treat. Billy tossed the patty up in the air\u2026 and the golden retriever leaped up and caught it in his mouth! He clapped his jaws shut, and swallowed the patty in midair, the chunk of beef instantly sliding down his throat. The dog landed, licking his lips with satisfaction, glad to finally have some real food after substituting on dry kibble for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Billy was giggling wildly in joy. It made Oliver smile to see his brother so happy. <i>\u201cAnother one! Another one!\u201d</i> Billy eagerly reached out a hand, gesturing for more patties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d</b> Oliver chuckled, handing over another patty. Billy tossed the patty across the room, and the boys laughed as the dog chased it and swallowed it in midair again. They repeated this a few times, until five patties were now resting in the dog\u2019s gut, filling him up nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cGive me three this time!\u201d</i> Billy said, reaching out a hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh, are you sure? I don\u2019t think he should be eating this many\u2026\u201d</b> Oliver said, starting to have hesitations. This box was supposed to last for months, but they\u2019re already chewing through it at a startling rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cC\u2019mon, look at him! He\u2019s still so hungry!\u201d</i> He said, pointing at Rusty, who had a big, adorable doggy smile on his face as he eagerly awaited more patties. That face was difficult to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOkay, okay, a few more\u2026\u201d</b> He said, handing three patties over. Oliver watched in surprise as Billy tossed them all at once\u2026 only for the dog to leap up and swallow all three in midair! The two boys watched in awe as a sizeable lump travelled down Rusty\u2019s throat as he landed, before he let out a content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhooaa! That was awesome!\u201d</i> Billy cheered. <i>\u201cC\u2019mon! Three more, three more!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it was a bad idea to keep feeding Rusty\u2026 but he was kind of enjoying watching him swallow the patties. <b>\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d</b> he said, handing three more patties to Billy and letting him toss them all, so they could watch Rusty swallow each patty in midair. For such a chubby dog, Rusty sure was agile. They repeated this a couple of time. Now, a total of 17 patties were filling Rusty\u2019s stomach, giving him a visible paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly looked over at the box, noticing it was still three fourths of the way full. <i>\u201cY\u2019know, we should just let him have the whole box!\u201d</i> He suggested, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what? No way! This is four month\u2019s worth of patties!\u201d</b> Oliver replied. <b>\u201cWe don\u2019t want him to get too fat!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWell, why not? Getting fatter just makes him look even cuter!\u201d</i> Billy smiled. <i>\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, boy?\u201d</i> He patted the golden on the head. Rusty licked his hands, hungry for more patties. Oliver sat there for a while, considering it. Sure, part of him did want to watch the dog stuff himself full\u2026 but his rational mind knew that that probably wasn\u2019t the smartest idea. Besides, his mother would probably notice Rusty was so stuffed, and he\u2019d get in big trouble for ruining his diet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Oliver was distracted, Billy suddenly grabbed the box out of his hands! <b>\u201cHey! No! Don\u2019t you d-\u201d</b> It was too late. Billy turned over the box, sending dozens of patties flying all over the room. Rusty swallowed six in midair, before landing and getting to work on the others, scooping multiple patties into his mouth with his tongue and gulping them all down. He ate at such an incredible rate, Oliver hardly had time to react! <b>\u201cOh no! Rusty, stop!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Oliver reacted, only a single patty was left uneaten. Both boy and dog leaped for it, and while Oliver grabbed it first, Rusty wasn\u2019t far behind. Rusty grabbed the patty with his powerful jaws and tried gulping it down, but Oliver wasn\u2019t willing to let it go\u2026 even when his hand got pulled into the canine\u2019s throat! <b>\u201cRusty, no! Let go!\u201d</b> He tried his best to hold on to the patty, but the dog\u2019s throat muscles were trying to tug it out of his hand. Still, feeling his fist so easily slide into the dog\u2019s warm, wet throat gave him a strange feeling. With a groan, he let go off the patty, feeling it slide deeper into the dog\u2019s throat, and then pulled his hand out of Rusty\u2019s mouth to find it now covered with saliva. <b>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few seconds, Rusty had swallowed over 60 raw beef patties! He let out a long, satisfied groan as he rolled over on his back. His huge, round stomach was now the size of a beach ball! The boys both stared at his huge, furry gut in awe\u2026 before Billy darted forward, and started giving the canine an enthusiastic belly rub! Rusty\u2019s tail wagged happily as Billy rubbed his hands all over the distended gut, pressing his ear against its side to listen to the patties digesting within. For some reason, staring at the dog\u2019s huge gut and thinking about all that food packed tightly within\u2026 Oliver was starting to get that funny feeling again. <i>\u201cWow! This is awesome! I\u2019ve never seen Rusty so full\u2026 or so happy!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly looked over his shoulder. <i>\u201cC\u2019mon, feel it!\u201d</i> Oliver hesitated\u2026 but the urge overwhelmed him. He reluctantly knelt down and pressed a hand against the dog\u2019s gut, feeling the incredibly squishy, soft belly flesh. Rusty\u2019s belly was now like a big pillow. Oliver pressed his ear up against it, and listened to the loud gurgling and churning within as Rusty\u2019s stomach processed his huge meal. Oliver imagined what it must look like in the dog\u2019s stomach, the patties pressed into a single mass by the tight stomach walls as he digests his feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all giving Oliver this weird feeling that was making him uncomfortable. He stood up, trying not to look at the dog\u2019s belly, hoping that the feeling would just go away. <b>\u201cAlright, now Rusty\u2019s not hungry anymore. Satisfied? Cause we\u2019re definitely not doing this again,\u201d</b> he said. <b>\u201cDon\u2019t let mom find out about this, alright?\u201d</b> With that, he walks downstairs, leaving Billy behind with Rusty. As he leaves, he can hear Billy still laughing and giggling as he gives the canine the best belly rub of all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver crashed on the cough and pulled out his phone, trying to forget what he\u2019d just seen. All he had to do now was hope that his mother didn\u2019t find out what he\u2019d done\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon, Rusty seemed to be very cheerful, walking around proudly with his big, round belly swaying beneath him. Somehow, their mother didn\u2019t seem to notice. Oliver tried to ignore it, but he always found himself staring at the dog\u2019s belly throughout the day, watching it gradually get smaller and smaller as the patties were digested. By that night, the dog\u2019s belly had been reduced to a manageable paunch. Oliver could only shudder to imagine how much weight the dog was going to gain\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was a saturday, meaning both boys were off of school. It was a beautiful, sunny day outside, and very warm by Oregon standards, making it a perfect day to enjoy the outdoors. Over breakfast, Oliver and Billy discussed how they should spend their morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For most of the year, there was a farmers market in town every saturday, and it was Oliver\u2019s responsibility to head down there every week and do some needed shopping. Billy liked to tag along most of the time, just for fun. <b>\u201cI\u2019ve got to be at the farmer\u2019s market by noon. Better finish up breakfast quick if you want to come,\u201d</b> Oliver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh! Can Rusty come?\u201d</i> Billy asked, excitedly. Oliver hesitated. Rusty was fairly well-trained, so he did occasionally allow him to come with them to the farmer\u2019s market, but it was sort of a hassle. Still, the pleading look on his brother\u2019s face was convincing. <i>\u201cPlease please please please!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver chuckled. <b>\u201cAlright, alright. Rusty can come. But you have to keep an eye on him, alright?\u201d</b> Oliver said, and Billy nearly cheered. As if on cue, Rusty came padding into the room, well-rested after a good night\u2019s slumber. The canine has already effectively processed his previous meal, and it seems he\u2019s put on about 5 pounds over the course of a single night. The retriever\u2019s body was just a little more jiggly than it was yesterday, and he had a few more tiny rolls of fat covering his belly and rump. The boys stared in wonder at the results of last night\u2019s binge, as the canine walked happily over to his food bowl for breakfast. Luckily, the weight gain was subtle enough that their mother didn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhoa! Look at him!\u201d</i> Billy whispered. <i>\u201cHe\u2019s already gotten a little fatter in one night! Isn\u2019t it adorable? Imagine how fat he\u2019d get if we fed him like that everyday?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver was taken aback. <b>\u201cEvery day? Are you out of your mind? That\u2019d be so unhealthy!\u201d</b> Oliver replied. <b>\u201cNo, no. That binge last night was a one-time thing. From now on, Rusty\u2019s going back on a diet.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly seemed disappointed at this. Even Rusty seemed upset, whimpering as he looked up at you, pawing at your leg. <i>\u201cSee? Look at Rusty! He wants to be big and chubby!\u201d</i> Billy giggles, leaning down and petting Rusty. <i>\u201cDon\u2019t you, boy? You wanna be a big, squishy pup, huh? Yes you do! Yes you do!\u201d</i> Rusty pants happily in response. Meanwhile, Oliver just tries to ignore it. Of course, the idea of fattening up Rusty as much as they could was quite appealing\u2026 but he had to be the responsible one here. Rusty\u2019s health came first and foremost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Oliver slipped on a light jacket while Billy put Rusty on a leash. Rusty\u2019s collar only barely seemed to fit around his neck fat; if he gains any more weight, it just might pop off. With that thought in mind, Billy hopped into the back seat of the family car, and Oliver began driving them along the unpaved back roads of the countryside. Getting to town took about a half hour, so it was a decently long trip. As he drive, Oliver could hear his brother giggling and cooing as he rubbed Rusty\u2019s now softer and more jiggly belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they pull up to an outdoor farmers market on the outskirts of towns. A wide variety of pristine examples of crops and artisan goods were arranged in wooden stalls all around the market, and Billy loved trying to find unique fruits he hadn\u2019t seen before. Meanwhile, Oliver concentrated on this week\u2019s shopping list. While the two boys were distracted, Rusty was getting antsy, and he could feel his belly grumbling in hungry. That meal yesterday seemed to reawaken his appetite, and now he was hungrier than ever! He tried to stick by Billy\u2019s side, but eventually, his primal urges overcame him. He flexed his fat neck, and his collar snapped right off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers both gasped in shock as the dog sprinted away at incredible speeds! <i>\u201cRusty!\u201d</i> Billy gasps, clasping his hands over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo! Rusty! Get back here!\u201d</b> Oliver cried, chasing after the retriever. He ducked and weaved through the stalls of the farmers market, trying to keep up with the chubby canine. His heart was racing at this point, and he could tell he was humiliating himself in front of everybody at the market. Eventually, he caught up to Rusty\u2026 but what he saw froze him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRusty was swallowing an entire watermelon! The dog\u2019s jaws were spread incredibly wide as the golden retriever tipped his head back, taking big gulps and letting gravity help slide the watermelon down his throat. Soon, the watermelon was reduced to a huge bulge in Rusty\u2019s neck. It continued travelling down his body, until it finally dropped into his stomach. The watermelon created a huge, round bulge in the canine\u2019s gut. Oliver could only stand there, staring, as if in a trance\u2026 until the owner of the watermelon started yelling at him! \u201cHey! Get a hold of your dog, man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSorry! So sorry!\u201d</b> Oliver said, jumping back into action. He sprinted towards the dog, trying to grab him, but apparently, Rusty\u2019s appetite hadn\u2019t been sated yet, and thus the canine ran away again. <b>\u201cRusty! Get back here right now!\u201d</b> The following chase was completely futile. The dog was just far too fast for Oliver to catch up. As the dog ran around the farmer\u2019s market, he\u2019d occasionaly stop to lick up some fruits and vegetables from somebody\u2019s cart, and gulp them down whole. As this continued, Rusty\u2019s belly slowly grew bigger and bigger, and the dog was slowed down considerably. Eventually, he was slow enough that Oliver was finally able to catch up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver grabbed Rusty, wrapping his arms around the dog and keeping him from escaping. <b>\u201cBad dog! Bad dog! What has gotten into you?\u201d</b> Eventually, Rusty gives up and lies down on the ground, exhausted by his binge. Oliver was pretty tired from chasing the dog down, so he slowly rose to his feet\u2026 only to find himself staring into the eyes of the manager of the market!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for all the products your dog just ate, right?\u201d The manager said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver sighs. <b>\u201cOf course.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver pays all the shop owners back for their lost products, before shoving Rusty back into the car. Both of the brothers seemed mortified by what had happened. Rusty, on the other hand, seemed satisfied. His big, round, fluffy belly was huge at this point, and he wagged his tail in satisfaction at the feeling of all the fruits and veggies churning around inside his gut. <i>\u201cC\u2019mon, Oliver. Don\u2019t be mad at Rusty. He doesn\u2019t know any better!\u201d</i> Billy begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to be watching him?\u201d</b> Oliver asked, bitterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHis collar broke\u2026\u201d</i> He whimpered. Oliver sighed. In addition to the cost of the food Rusty devoured, they were going to have to buy him a new collar. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, all three of the stepped back into the house again. The two boys looked sadly up at their mother, returning empty-handed. \u201cOh? How did your little shopping trip go?\u201d Their mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cTerrible! Rusty escaped from his collar and went on an eating frenzy!\u201d</b> You sighed, crashing on the cough. <b>\u201cI had to spend every dime I had paying those guys back for the stuff Rusty ate just so they didn\u2019t ban us from the farmer\u2019s market!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that, dear. Don\u2019t tear yourself up about it too much. Sometimes these sorts of things just happen,\u201d his mother replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs, his anger deflated. <b>\u201cYeah, I know. It was just\u2026 really embarrassing, you know?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d his mother nods. \u201cHey. Why don\u2019t the three of you go blow off some steam somewhere this weekend? Maybe some time away from home will make you feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys weren\u2019t particularly in the mood to go anywhere, and Rusty was already stuffed to the brim with food, but still, their mother\u2019s word was law. They were going to have to go somewhere\u2026 but where?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since they lived in the middle of a forest, it wasn\u2019t unusual for the two brothers to decide to spend a weekend camping on a whim. It was a nice way to settle down and relax, and Oliver\u2019s phone had wifi even out in the wilderness, so it\u2019s not like he was missing out on any news. At this point, the process was routine for them; they\u2019d drive out to the same old spot, spend an hour of two pitching their tent and preparing their campsite, and just spend the rest of their weekend in total relaxation. Rusty\u2019s collar was broken now, of course, but he could usually be trusted not to run away. Usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver set up a hammock on two nearby trees, bore hopping into it and lounging around, lazily browsing the internet with his phone. Meanwhile, Billy laughed and giggled as he played with Rusty, often giving the dog enthusiastic belly rubs. Now that he wasn\u2019t as angry at Rusty anymore, Oliver had to admit, the canine\u2019s belly was a sight to behold. It was taking Rusty a while to process all the vegetables he\u2019d devoured, so his belly was still absolutely huge, squishy and rounded, to the point that it swayed to and fro beneath him as he walked. Oliver found himself staring at Rusty\u2019s belly again, every so often, but he tried to resist the urge. He didn\u2019t know why he liked the idea of a big, fat golden retriever so much. He was supposed to be the responsible one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHey, Ollie! You think we can go fishing before it gets dark?\u201d</i> Billy called over to him. Oliver considering it for a while, before eventually flipped up out of the hammock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh, sure, yeah! Grab your gear!\u201d</b> They grabbed their fishing gear, and the two boys wandered down to the shore of the nearby river while Rusty followed slowly behind them, weighed down by his own belly. By the time Rusty made it to the shore, the two brothers were already set up, and Oliver was about to cast his line. <b>\u201cAlright, now watch how the real pros get things done.\u201d</b> He joked, before casting his line into the further depths of the lake. To his surprise, only a few seconds later, he felt something tugging on the end of the string! <b>\u201cWhoa! A bite already?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly watched excitedly as Oliver started reeling his first catch in. Finally, the fishing line pulled a chinook salmon up from the water, and it flopped around futilely as Oliver grabbed it in his hands and carefully plucked the hook from its mouth. <b>\u201cWhoa! This thing is huge,\u201d</b> he said, showing it off to Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI wonder if Rusty can eat it!\u201d</i> Before Oliver can respond, Billy suddenly grabs the salmon from his hands. <i>\u201cHere, Rusty! Catch!\u201d</i> Oliver doesn\u2019t react in time, and can only watch helplessly as his brother tosses his catch through the air towards the waiting canine. Rusty jumped up and caught the fish halfway in his mouth in midair. When he landed, the fish\u2019s long, flailing tail was the only thing hanging from the dog\u2019s jaws\u2026 until he leaned back his head and swallowed, and that, too, disappeared. Oliver felt that funny feeling course through him stronger than ever as he watched the huge bulge travel down Rusty\u2019s furry throat, down into his already bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver wanted to act upset that Billy had stolen the fish from him, but he was too stunned to say a word. He thinks he\u2019s totally on board with the whole \u2018fattening Rusty\u2019 thing now. Meanwhile, Billy is as excited as ever to watch Rusty get even pudgier. <i>\u201cOh! Let me try to catch one!\u201d</i> Billy said, excitedly casting his line. Just like before, it only took a few seconds for a fish to take the bait and start tugging on his line. <i>\u201cOh! The fish are really active today!\u201d</i> Billy reeled in a large steelhead, and soon, that, too, was sent flying down Rusty\u2019s throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cC\u2019mon! Aren\u2019t you going to help?\u201d</i> Billy asked, casting his line again. Oliver knew, on a rational level, that it would probably be a bad idea to stuff Rusty any further\u2026 but watching the dog gulp down his meals was just too invigorating. Oliver quickly caught another fish, and hesitantly tossing it over to Rusty, watching the dog catch it and instantly send it sliding down his throat. Soon, both brothers were catching fish after fish at an incredible rate, and tossing them over to Rusty. The canine always seemed hungry for more, no matter how incredibly full he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the sun had set, and they decided it was time to head home. Now that they got a good luck at Rusty, they realized they might have overdone it a little bit. The dog\u2019s belly was already huge before, but now, it was twice that size! Rusty\u2019s belly was almost as big as the golden retriever himself. His belly was so big, Rusty was completely immobilized, unable to walk by himself. Despite this, the canine seemed happier than ever, panting and wagging his tail in excitement. <b>\u201cUh, we might\u2019ve fed Rusty a little too much, in hindsight\u2026\u201d</b> The two of you start slowly pushing the dog back towards camp. <b>\u201cC\u2019mon, boy. Let\u2019s go get some shut-eye\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the three sit around the campfire, the boys chatting and having dinner. Billy idly rubs Rusty\u2019s huge belly as he eats, occasionally slipping some left-over foot to the dog, which the canine happily accepts. <b>\u201cHe\u2019s STILL hungry? His belly\u2019s almost as big as his whole body!\u201d</b> Oliver asks, blown away by the golden retriever\u2019s gluttony. <b>\u201cMan, what is up with Rusty\u2019s appetite recently? He\u2019s out of control.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh, come on. Mom\u2019s been keeping him on that crazy diet for months. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been super hungry,\u201d</i> Billy laughed, patting Rusty on the gut and hearing it gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater still, the three of them settled down in their tent for the night, ready to get some shut-eye. Rusty huffed as he settled in beside Billy, and Billy immediately started cuddling against the dog\u2019s immense, soft, pillowy belly. <i>\u201cOh my gosh\u2026 he\u2019s so comfy\u2026\u201d</i> Rusty\u2019s belly was almost as big as he was! Billy couldn\u2019t even wrap his arms all around it as he hugged Rusty close, using the dog\u2019s belly like a huge, comfy pillow as he got ready to fall asleep. Oliver tried to ignore the spectacle, although secretly, he envied Billy. What he wouldn\u2019t give to snuggle up with a huge, fluffy belly like that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Oliver woke up in his sleeping bag, sitting up and stretching with a yawn. He stepped sleepily out of the tent to find Billy and Rusty sitting around the fire, with Billy happily cooking breakfast. Oliver couldn\u2019t help but notice something, though; Rusty had gained a TON of weight overnight! About fifteen pounds! His belly, sides and rump have now been consumed by folds of fat which jiggled visibly as he walked around, and he always seemed to be panting in exertion. Still, the retriever somehow managed to still walk at a decent pace, though he was a bit sluggish now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly notices Oliver standing there, staring at Rusty\u2019s new, obese form. <i>\u201cI know, right? Isn\u2019t he absolutely adorable now?\u201d</i> Billy smiled, patting Rusty on the head. Olver shakily took a seat across from Billy, and tried to continue his morning as if everything was normal, though he just couldn\u2019t stop staring at the canine and watching his pudge jiggle with his every movement\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know, a threat was sneaking up on them, hidden in the bushes of the forest.

They were all downwind of the camp, so they were difficult to detect\u2026 but eventually, Rusty starts to notice something. He sits up quickly, staring off into the distance and growling, as if ready to spring into the bushes at any moment. <i>\u201cRusty? What\u2019s wrong, boy?\u201d</i> Billy asked, patting him on the head. The golden retriever seemed downright angry at something. It was rare to see him like this. The two boys stared into the bushes, trying to spot whatever Rusty was growling at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Oliver noticed a tail peeking out over the bushes. He squinted, and noticed even more of the canines lying in wait. His blood ran cold, and he grabbed Billy by the shoulder. <b>\u201cCoyotes. Lots of them.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAre they going to attack us?\u201d</i> Billy asked, starting to get scared. Coyotes don\u2019t usually attack humans, but these ones seemed odd\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They look hungry\u2026\u201d</b> Oliver said, slowly backing away. Rusty heroically planted himself inbetween the brothers and the coyotes, growling and snarling, ready to defend the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cRusty! Be careful!I\u201d</i> Billy called. Their hearts were racing as the coyotes slowly emerged from the bushes, snarling hungrily. Rusty was hopelessly outnumbered, and yet, the golden retriever was still unafraid. The brothers could only watch helplessly and hold their breaths as Rusty leaped forward!</span></div></div>",

The coyotes try to flee, but they can\u2019t all make it in time, and one of them gets landed on by the huge pooch. The coyote\u2019s yelp is muffled as its head is instantly enveloped by Rusty\u2019s huge jaws, which squeeze down tightly around it. The two brothers can only watch as the coyote tries desperately to back away, apparently strong enough to drag Rusty around the glade but still unable to free its head from the vice grip of the dog\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the brothers and the other coyotes were watching in awe, frozen in place. Eventually, the trapped coyote wears itself out in its attempts to break free, and Rusty manages to wrestle it to the ground. Seizing the opportunity, Rusty laid down on the coyote\u2019s torso, pinning it down beneath his huge, pudgy body! The other coyotes looked like they wanted to rescue their comrade, but they were too afraid of suffering the same fate. The spectators could only watch as the dog takes a big gulp, swallowing the coyote\u2019s head into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coyote was quite a few inches smaller and lighter than Rusty, but still, swallowing the squirming carnivore whole was no easy feat. The largest thing Rusty\u2019s swallowed was a watermelon, and this coyote was not only larger, but also actively resisting. Still, the golden retriever was able to stretch his jaws around him with incredible ease. Soon, Rusty stood up to reveal the coyote was now halfway down his throat, its legs kicking futilely as it was drawn further in. Upon seeing this, the rest of the coyotes seemed frightened, and fleed into the bushes, leaving their comrade behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers watched in stunned silence as Rusty tilted his head back, letting gravity assist the coyote\u2019s descent down his throat. Each gulp brought the coyote a few more inches in, added to the huge, visibly moving bulge in the front of Rusty\u2019s throat. Eventually, the coyote\u2019s legs were forcibly straightened out as they descended into the dog\u2019s gullet, before Rusty finally clapped his jaws shut, licking his lips with satisfaction as he finally finished off his meal. The two were dumbstruck as the coyote was reduced to a huge, round bulge in their dog\u2019s tight gut. Eventually, Billy was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhoa! That was the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d</i> The boy jumped forward excitedly, running up to their triumphant pooch. He immediately started hugging and petting Rusty, who panted and barked happily, his tail wagging. <i>\u201cRusty! You saved us, buddy!\u201d</i> Rusty rolled over onto his back, and Billy happily rubbed his hands over the dog\u2019s huge belly, rewarding him for his heroism. Meanwhile, Oliver stepped cautiously forward, unable to pry his eyes away from the dog\u2019s huge, fluffy gut. It was like he was in a trance. That funny feeling returned to him again in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIs it really\u2026 still alive in there?\u201d</b> Oliver asked, his voice shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYep! Feel it!\u201d</i> Billy gestured over to him. Hesitantly, Oliver stepped forward, kneeled down and pressed his hands up against the firm skin of Rusty\u2019s belly, feeling the coyote moving around within. There are visible bulges in the golden retriever\u2019s gut as the coyote tries to break free, but these only seem to satisfy the golden further. Watching Rusty swallow those fish had been exciting, but this\u2026 well, this was on a whole nother level. Oliver had to turn and walk away to cool off, disturbed by the feelings this was giving him. He couldn\u2019t be\u2026 getting off on this, could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the coyote passes out due to the lack of air within Rusty\u2019s gut, and his belly goes still. It\u2019s still absolutely gigantic, though, and drags along the ground beneath him as he walks, forcing him to waddle slowly around. Oliver tries his best not to stare or think about what had happened. <b>\u201cLet\u2019s pack up and go home. I think that\u2019s enough camping for one weekend,\u201d</b> he said. While Rusty relaxed in the cool car and got to work digesting his meal, the two brothers starting tearing down their camp, before Oliver drove them all back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good morning, sweethearts! Did you enjoy your camping trip?\u201d Their mother asked when they walked in. She was distracted, though, when Rusty waddled in behind them. \u201cWhoa! What happened to Rusty? He\u2019s supposed to be on a diet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cRusty saved our lives, mom!\u201d</i> Billy said excitedly. <i>\u201cThere was a big pack of coyotes out there about to eat us, but Rusty gobbled one of them up and scared them all away!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Well, I\u2019ll be. Good boy, Rusty,\u201d she smiles, kneeling down and patting Rusty on the head. \u201cNow, you boys shouldn\u2019t be camping when there\u2019s a pack of coyotes running around. I\u2019ll call the sheriff's department and see if anyone can take of that. In the meanwhile\u2026\u201d She taps her chin. \u201cI think Rusty\u2019s earned a big, delicious lunch!\u201d Rusty perked up, his tail wagging at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYou want to feed him more food?\u201d</b> Oliver gawked. <b>\u201cIsn\u2019t he supposed to be on a diet?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but\u2026 he saved your lives! I think he deserves to binge,\u201d she smiles. After lunch, the family piles into the car, and their mother drives them downtown, ready to shop for a reward for Rusty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRusty did save their lives, so he did deserve a big feast, after all. What kind of feast were they going to get him, though?</span></div></div>",

Their mother was a little hesitant, but at Billy\u2019s behest, and with Oliver\u2019s offer to chip in, she ultimately spared no expense, purchasing a feast fit for a dozen dogs. They returned home carrying half a dozen bags, stuffed to the brim with delicious treats that delighted Rusty\u2019s nostrils. He immediately started jumping up and down with excitement, sniffing and pawing at the bags. <b>\u201cCalm down, boy! Give us a second! Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll have all the treats you can eat soon!\u201d</b> Oliver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rusty hungrily licked his lips, they arranged the treats they\u2019d bought for him on a tray. In total, they\u2019d purchased; 1 huge ten-pound peanut butter cake designed to be safe for dogs, 12 cupcakes covered and stuff with small dog treats, and an uncountable number of those little bone-shaped, bacon-flavored dog treats. Even though his belly was already huge, Rusty\u2019s appetite seemed limitless, and he was totally ready to devour his huge meal. <i>\u201cThink of this as a \u2018thanks for saving our lives\u2019 gift, boy!\u201d</i> Billy smiled, as he did the honor of setting the tray down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stepped back and watched in awe as the dog immediately got to work chowing down. He immediately took out a sizeable chunk of the cake with his huge jaws, gulping down the chunk before taking another. That cake alone could\u2019ve fed 10 dogs, and he was devouring it in a matter of seconds! Now that their mother had a good look at his eating habits, she could tell how he managed to devour that coyote. In only a couple of minutes, the entire 10-pound cake was completely gone, and his belly was now so huge it was pressed against the floor. Still, Rusty kept eating, his appetite insatiable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver and his mother stared on in awe and horror, knowing they should probably stop the retriever\u2019s binge but being too fascinated to interfere. On the other hand, Billy was excitedly cheering him on, smiling as he watched the dog\u2019s belly grow bigger and bigger every second. Once the cake was done, Rusty started swallowing each of the cupcakes whole one by one. By this point, the dog\u2019s belly was bigger than the rest of his entire body, and Rusty was immobilized by the sheer mass of what he\u2019s eaten. Still, he continued. Once he was done with the cupcakes, he started shoveling huge amounts of the smaller treats into his mouth until his cheeks bulged with them, before swallowing them en masse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the family had to roll him into the living room. His belly was just that huge, at that point. \u201cWow! I knew he had an appetite, but\u2026 just, wow. I hope this doesn\u2019t mess up his diet too much,\u201d their mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI know, right? This is amazing!\u201d</i> Billy said, hugging Rusty\u2019s gut. The dog\u2019s belly was now even bigger than he was. <i>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a big, squishy belly, don\u2019t you boy? Yes you do! Yes you do!\u201d</i> Billy suddenly gets an idea, and oliver\u2019s eyes widen in surprise as his brother climbs up on top of Rusty\u2019s huge belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHey! Billy! What are you doing?\u201d</b> Oliver says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI\u2019m gonna see how bouncy it is!\u201d</i> Billy laughed, as he shakily stands up on the dog\u2019s gut. Once he\u2019s balanced, he hops into the air slightly, and indeed, starts bouncing up and down on Rusty\u2019s jiggling belly as if it was a miniature trampoline. <i>\u201cWhoa! This is awesome!\u201d</i> Billy was giggling uncontrollably as he bounced up and down slightly on the canine\u2019s gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBe careful! You\u2019re gonna hurt him!\u201d</b> Oliver protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNo I\u2019m not! Look at him, he loves it!\u201d</i> Indeed, Rusty was panting and wagging his tail happily, apparently enjoying the sensation of Billy hopping up and down on his gut. The boy had always been rather scrawny, so his bouncing didn\u2019t harm the retriever; in fact, it helped Rusty digest his huge meal. Oliver sighs, deciding to just let him have his fun. He lies on the cough, fiddling with his phone again\u2026 but he can\u2019t help but stare. Rusty\u2019s belly was absolutely huge; even bigger than Billy himself! Oliver couldn\u2019t help but wonder how it was even possible for Rusty\u2019s gut to stretch that big. He shuddered at the thought, turning back to his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, night time rolled around, and it was time for the brothers to return to bed. They had school tomorrow. Rusty\u2019s belly was so huge, he couldn\u2019t even move, so he and Billy just spent the night sleeping on the floor of the living room, Billy using the dog\u2019s belly as a pillow again. Meanwhile, Oliver retreated to his room upstairs, carefully locking the door behind him. Now that he had some alone time, the young man was ready to finally release some of the \u2018tension\u2019 he worked up during that camping trip. Thus, he slid off his pants and curled up in bed with his laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to type something into the search bar, but his mind drew a blank. He wasn\u2019t really in the mood for porn, necessarily. In fact\u2026 all he could think about were the events of that camping trip. Secretly, Oliver had always had a fetish for weight gain and stuffing, but he never thought that \u2018interest\u2019 would cross over to dogs, of all things. But he had to admit, something about watching Rusty get so incredibly full, and gain so much weight so quickly, was exhilarating. Especially watching him swallow down that coyote. Thus, he reluctantly googled \u2018dog fattening\u2019 - out of pure morbid interest, or so he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked on the first website that popped up - poochpudge.com. Oliver was taken aback as he was immediately presented with an image of the fattest labrador he\u2019s ever seen. That thing looked like a walking tank of pudge! It had to be at least 200 pounds! Stunned, he continued exploring the site. Apparently, \u2018poochpudge\u2019 was split into two sections - a rudimentary gallery, and a forum. The gallery seemed to be composed of hundreds of images and videos of either chubby, jiggling dogs playing around, or skinny dogs eating a ton of food and gaining weight. It seemed sort of weird, but the dogs all seemed to be super happy, so Oliver guessed there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he moved onto the forums. At first glance, it seemed to be just a regular community for a bunch of people who are, for some reason, really big fans of fat dogs. However, when Oliver investigated deeper, he noticed some interesting things. First of all, there is apparently a rare and very popular type of dogs the forums call \u2018gulpers\u2019, who have endless appetites and swallow all their food whole, regardless of how large it is. That explains Rusty\u2019s behavior at least. Oliver also learns that the site had a hidden 18+ section in the gallery, which you had to message an admin and specifically request access for. He shuddered to even imagine what might lie inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that thought from his mind, he dwelled through the gallery for a while, finding a few videos that interested him. He was blown away by just how fat some of these dogs were capable of getting. Was Rusty going to look like that soon, at this rate? He could hardly even imagine. For some reason, watching all those furry folds of fat jiggle was enticing to Oliver, and he found his hand slowly drifting between his legs. He had to blow off steam somehow, after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour later, when Oliver is finished, he drifts off to sleep, ready to face the next day...</span></div></div>",

But the shame, and the arousal, still follow him. Part of him regretted every visiting that site, and the other part was desperate to go back again. The dogs in the gallery he thought about the most were the Gulpers. Rusty\u2019s skills were impressive, but the larger dogs were able to swallow incredibly huge meals all at once, to the point that Oliver wondered what their limits were. Apparently, though, all videos of Gulpers devouring other animals were restricted to the 18+ section of the gallery, which almost tempted Oliver to request entry. One though plagued his mind; was it even possible for one of those Gulpers to swallow, say, a whole person? Discussion of that possibility seemed to be restricted to the 18+ section as well, leaving him frustrated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the couch, Oliver idly chuckles as Rusty licks at his feet, covering them with slobber and almost drawing them into his maw. Seeing just how huge the dog was, and how wide his mouth could stretch, he can\u2019t help but wonder whether Rusty might be capable of swallowing him whole, just as he had that coyote. He had seen the retriever stuff its belly even larger before, so he was sure he would fit. What would Oliver do in such a situation, he wondered? Would he try to pull himself free from the dog's slobbering maw, before it was too late? Or would he just allow himself be pulled inch by inch down Rusty's throat, and into the dog's big, fluffy belly? Honestly... he couldn't say for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like that would ever happen, anyway. Rusty\u2019s protective instinct is too strong, there\u2019s no way he would hurt him. Perhaps if he slathered himself in peanut butter, Rusty would think he\u2019s just a big tasty treat? Oliver grows excited at the very thought, and he resolves to try his idea at the soonest possible opportunity\u2026 wait, what was he thinking!? Even if it was possible, he can\u2019t feed himself to the family pet! That was insane! As if waking up from a trance, he stands up, awkwardly hiding the tent in his pants as he hurries for the door. That website he had read last night must\u2019ve been messing with his mind, making him think things he shouldn\u2019t. He resolves not to go back on that site anymore, from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver drove to school, and tried not to let what he had seen distract him, though this proved difficult. It was hard to shake these new thoughts from his head. He could hardly focus all day, and when he finally returned that afternoon, he was frustrated and exhausted. Billy, meanwhile, was as happy and energetic as always, happy to see Rusty again and feed him a few more treats.The dog had gained a ton of weight since yesterday, of course, probably about 20 pounds. Rusty\u2019s entire body jiggled with every step, which seemed to slow him down significantly, and still, the canine only seemed happier than ever. Oliver huffed, trying not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, how were they going to spend the rest of their afternoon?</span></div></div>",

They launched a massive campaign to make people believe that it was actually healthy for dogs to be fed as much food as possible, even rewriting the rules in many dog competitions to make fatness qualify as more beautiful. Even some movies ended up featuring characters having fat dogs, always making a point of demonstration how happy all the fatness made them. This campaign quickly became a roaring success, and all throughout America, dog owners were buying tons of dog food to make their pooches as big as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was a catch; something that the dog food companies didn't want people to know. The more dogs were fed, and the bigger they became, the more gluttonous and voracious they became! There became more and more reports of bigger dogs swallowing squirrels whole... and then cats... and then smaller dogs... and then, eventually, even young children!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've only seen that last one once yourself. You were at the park when you noticed, in the distance, a huge fat mastiff being walked by his trainer, licking all over the face of a giggly young boy. You just chuckled at that, looking away... but when you looked back, there was only a small pair of feet sticking from the dog's mouth! The dog tried to stop him, but it was too late... the mastiff easily swallowed the young boy whole, in one gulp! The owner was obviously embarrassed by this, apologizing to the other people in the park for his carelessness. However, the mastiff seemed to be absolutely delighted, its tail wagging in bliss as his owner walked him home to let him relax and digest his squirming meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been mesmerized by the sight, and you couldn't figure out why you always thought about it... until recently. The truth was, the size of these dogs, and their sheer appetites... you found it very, very attractive for some reason! Which made your new job very awkward. You had just gotten hired as an employee of a doggy daycare, and your main job was to keep the many dogs there fed, while keeping them from eating eachother, or other things they couldn't. You tried to keep your feelings to yourself, but seeing how big and fat all these canines were... it could be a little overwhelming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you started your shift this morning, you already ran into a problem.</span></div></div>",

You sigh, recognizing it immediately. There was some young boy around the neighborhood named Felix who always seemed to want to sneak into the outdoor pen, just to pet all the big dogs, despite you repeatedly warning him of the dangers of being around such gluttons! As you walked out the back door to deal with this, you were struck by a bit of a pang of panic when you noticed that he was with Boris! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris was a huge german shepherd, probably the biggest and most gluttonous dog in the entire daycare, with a huge, round, fluffy gut that almost drags along the floor. Boris was the one who most often could be found swallowing squirrels and stray cats and such, and he had to be kept away from the smaller dogs. And right now, Boris was laying atop the boy, Felix's torso underneath his belly, happily licking his face and slobbering all over it while Felix giggled. \"Felix!\" You immediately shouted as you trot up to him, interrupting their fun. \"How many times do I have to tell you not to sneak in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, you could tell that Boris had been getting hungrier and hungrier as he slobbered over his meal, probably gearing up to gobble him up! It was lucky that you happened to come around in town. You pulled Felix out from under his gut, at which Boris huffed, seeming disappointed. Felix, of course, was obviously disappointed, too. \"Awww! I just wanted to pet him!\" He pouted, crossing his arms. \"What's the harm in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, laying a hand on his shoulder. \"Felix, as I've warned you, dogs this size can get very, very gluttonous!\" You say. \"A dog Boris' size could swallow you in one bite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's wrong with that?\" He complained, patting the side of Boris' huge gut. \"His belly seems soft and comfy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you're on the outside perhaps. But not when you're inside getting digested!\" You chide him, and he stomps his foot, begrudgingly seeing your point despite his stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... now that you're here, maybe I can help you take care of him and the dogs?\" He says. \"I promise I won't sneak in anymore if you would just let me help!\" You sigh, considering his offer. It's not the worst idea... as long as you're supervising, it should be pretty safe, right?</span></div></div>",

The course consisted of a few rough beams on hay bales that counted for \"hurdles\" of various heights, poles that Red would weave himself through, and a small pit that he would have to leap over.  The whole course was about 500 yards by 500 yards, not very large or complex, but enough to give a mental stimulus to Red, whom Anne had ridden since he was a year old.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Red's master, Anne's father, had bought Red on a near whim for his daughter, who had managed to train and ride Red most aptly.  The horse was expensive, but he didn't mind.  They were rich enough to live comfortably enough with the horse.  But Rick, Anne's father, couldn't seem to get rid of the horse; his daughter was going to college, but was sentimentally attached to Red.  But Anne was going to college.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Annie, please,\" Rick had pled with his daughter, \"let me please give Red away.  You know that I'm too heavy to ride him,\" Rick shook his flabby stomach, soft from years of caloric, greasy southern food and too little exercise, for emphasis.  Rick didn't care enough to lose it, and he didn't have the time nor the discipline to do it.  \"And he'll go nuts without you.\"  Anne wouldn't be persuaded.  She still argued that she would ride Red every weekend and every weekday she was able.  Rick would always walk away incredulous that his daughter would actually do as she said.  She had a habit of not doing so.  But with Red, she had maintained interest for years, so Rick was reluctant to disbelieve his daughter.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so Anne went off to college, leaving Red behind.  On the first day Red was not exercised, he fumed about his pen, whinnying furiously.  Rick tried to calm him by petting him, by calling to him, and even by trying to ride him, but when Red started panting after one circuit on the obstacle course with Rick on him, Rick decided to not do that again.  The second night it happened again.  And having no other way of soothing Red, Rick gave him an extra scoop of oats.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anne came back to ride Red one day, but her ride was cut short by what to Red felt like a buzz coming from Anne's leg.  Red had no idea what a cell phone was, but he knew that that buzz meant that Anne would ride him no longer.  And Anne lost a phone once to Red in that way.  And for a while, every five or six days, Anne would come back to ride Red.  But that only happened for a month or two.  Then, Anne would come every thirteen or fourteen days.  Then, every thirty.  By Christmas, Anne hadn't been home in a month; and when Red first heard Anne, he started prancing up and down like a foal.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anne came running over to Red, and the stallion stood at his gate eagerly awaiting the return of his favorite person in the world.  She threw he bag in Red's storage shed, grabbed his equipment, and tried to put it on Red.  \"Why, Red, you must've grown some since I left,\" she laughed, readjusted his saddle, and rode him to the obstacle course.  Red started, clearing the first hurdle with ease, but the second hurdle nearly scraped the bottom of his chest.  The poles were no easier: Red tried to weave, but found that it hurt his flanks to do so.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And panting for breath, he only bared cleared the pond and crashed into the final hurdle, leaving a mark on his chest.  Catching his breath, Anne chuckled, \"I'm sorry, Red, you must be unfamiliar with the course.  I'm sorry I haven't ridden you in so long.\"  She trotted Red over to the pasture, poured two liberal scoops of oats into Red's bucket, and watched him hungrily devour them.</span></div></div>",

But Rick, with increasing desire to not have Red whinny at him every half an hour, hoped that by giving Red more food, he would shut up the horse.  Anne came again for spring break and tried to ride Red, who, this time, could barely manage to leap the second hurdle.  Anne felt sorry for Red and gave him more oats to compensate for her own negligence.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Becming increasingly bored, Red managed to wheedle out more food from Rick.  Red also found that grass would occasionally allay his hunger, but not for as long as the oats would.  For a while, Rick's plan for getting Red to stop whinnying worked, but eventually and periodically, he would have to increase the amount of oats he fed Red, from one scoop to one and a half, to two, to two and a quarter, slowly until he was giving Red three scoops of oats to Red every five or six hours during the day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The consequences on Red's waistline were swift and relatively dramatic.  Red went from being a defintively toned and muscled agility horse to a soft, round butterball.  After a few months, Red stopped prancing up and down and merely whinnied to have Rick feed him.  Anne came again after a couple of months of being away and tried to ride Red on the obstacle course.  Red barely made his way over the first hurdle before giving up.  Anne again felt pity on him and filled his bucket full with oats and gave him a new incredibly sweet pastry that Red devoured.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rick one day noticed Red trying to run.  It was a clumsy run that made Red tired after only 30 seconds.  Rick walked over and habitually fed Red a liberal three and a quarter scoops of oats before he absentmindedly went back to work.  The last time Anne ever rode Red on the obstacle course that she made, Red couldn't even jump the first hurdle.  He hit it and hurt his leg, an injury that caused him to lie down for a couple of weeks to recuperate.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Red didn't see the rural veteriarian very often because Rick didn't own a horse trailer, and he found it a pain to borrow one.  But today, Rick managed to procure a horse trailer and an appointment to the vet's office.  Red apparently needed some shots, required by law.  So Rick attached the trailer to his truck, enticed Red in with a honey bun, and drove to the vet's office.</span></div></div>",

Red had never seen the dog before, but it looked rather strange, deformed almost.  Red couldn't put his finger on what seemed odd about the dog, but he knew something was off.  Perhaps it was the dog's torso, which looked like a ripe, swollen pear when the dog sat down after only having walked a few feet to the car.  Red decided that it was the dog's abdomen that looked odd; otherwise, the dog looked like a normal Golden Retriever.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Red watched with mild amusement as the dog struggled to get into the truck.  Red faintly heard the words, \"Hosea,\" whom he inferred to be the dog, \"you,\"' and \"diet.\"  Red somehow sensed that that wasn't going to happen, but he said nothing.  Finally, it was his turn to get into the horse-trailer, which, to Red, was small and cramped, his flanks barely managed to fit into the trailer's stall.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ride was uncomfortable.  The road was bumpy, twisted, and rapidly changed speeds, which jostled Red around.  Of course, Rick seemed to have forgotten about his dog's diet when he stopped at some restaurant and, Red noticed, fed Hosea an entire pack of chicken nuggets.  Eventually, the trio managed to get to the vet's office.  Red was left in the trailer while Rick walked and Hosea did little better than a waddle in side.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About half an hour later, Rick came out with Hosea, looking annoyed and tired with a veterianarian.  The man took one look at Red and said to Rick, \"Jeez, Rick, you really need to watch what you feed your animals.  Your horse, like your dog, is obese.  Feed him fewer oats and muzzle him some of the time so that he can't graze.\"  After doing a few tests and giving a few shots, the vet left Rick fuming and spluttering, \"Red, obese?  I don't, I won't believe it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After he calmed down, he whispered to Red, \"Don't worry, buddy; I don't think you're fat.  I think that even if you are, we'll get you in shape in no time.  You and Hosea both.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Red was at first startled before he smelled Rick and Hosea, who was panting already at the effort of walking down to Red's pasture.  Rick found Red's old saddle, tried to fit it on, and realized that even the most loose setting wouldn't cinch around Red's stomach.  Rick ran his hand down Red's back.  He should hav been able to easily feel ribs, not see, but feel.  With a dog, he reckoned, one wasn't supposed to feel any trace of ribs whatsoever; but with a horse, the ribs should be detectable, but not visible.  Rick couldn't feel anything resembling a rib on Red's back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Red was definitely overweight, Rick thought to himself.  But so were he and Hosea, Rick then thought to himself.  Rick then put the lead, bridle, and bit on Red and led his horse and his dog for a walk.  Red was almost immediately worried by Hosea.  The poor dog was panting after only five or so minutes of the walk.  His breathing was becoming more belabored by the second until he suddenly just flopped.  Hosea just lay down on the grass, panted, and refused to get up.  Rick didn't have the strength to force Hosea either.  Rick's back and knees were such that that kind of exertion would have been excruciating for him.  So the only solution was to sit and wait for the dog to recuperate and continue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, Hosea stood and managed to arduously make his way back to the house.  Rick was overcome by pity for his dog, so that was the last time Red ever saw Hosea on a walk.  Rick still went with Red every day, and the two even managed to lose some weight together.  It was summer, and Red's fat acted as an insulator for body heat.  Rick would occasionally bring Hosea out to the pasture and spray Red and Hosea with a hose to cool them off.  Hosea could barely make his way to the pasture at that point, and couldn't get into Rick's truck without Rick's help.  Red fel, at the same time, happy and sad for Hosea, happy because Hosea had attained a level of prosperity that his ancestors had never been able to achieve, and sad because of the maladies which afflicted Hosea because of this prosperity.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, however, Rick became busy again and slowly, as his daughter had, stopped coming to do anything with Red but feed and brush him, activities that Red liked, but not as much as a brisk walk through the farm.  Red watched Rick's form slowly fill out again, perhaps more so than before he had tried to lose weight.  Red also slowly felt his body add the soft pounds of flesh onto his own body.  He could have chosen to stop eating, but he could never muster the willpower to stop.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hosea never came over to Red's pasture again that summer.  Red smorted at the preposterous idea that Hosea had become too fat to move more than a few feet at a time, but somehow, that's what Red suspected had happened.  </span></div></div>",

She just turned one this past month, and she's a gorgeous example of just how beautiful this breed can be. She's friendly, outgoing, and intensely curious, and she has one serious toy drive. She can be a bit intense at times, but she's an all-around good-natured gal who will really benefit from someone who can keep her busy. She isn't a troublemaker, but her high energy can sometimes get her into trouble. She's a wonderful dog, but she needs someone who knows how to handle her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly has a long, flowing coat that's intensely red and golden, giving her quite the presence wherever she goes. Her dark brown eyes are full of excitement and wonder, and it seems as if she constantly has a smile on her muzzle. She's solidly built, a little on the large side for a female, but she's aware of her size and does a good job of not knocking over all the smaller children who always want to come and see her when she's out and about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly is a big girl, but she's still trim and lean. You'll need to keep an eye on her diet, though. Molly won't go looking for food on her own, but she will eat anything you give to her, so make sure you keep track of how much you feed her; we've already had to put her on a diet once before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi: Lexi is a bit of an older gal, but she's still got lots of energy and will make a wonderful companion. She's about six years old, so she isn't a pup, but she's still a healthy gal with a big heart. She's gentle, quiet, and lovable; the kind of gal who'd enjoy getting to curl up on the couch beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi has soft, silky golden fur that softens her already gentle appearance. She has big, brown eyes and a contagious smile. She's built like your average Golden, but she's gotten heavier over the years, and while she isn't huge, her big, soft tummy definitely tells of her success convincing others that she could use just one more treat. And maybe another. And maybe that one, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi really likes to eat, and will try her best to convince you to give her as many treats as she can. Her soft eyes have served to soften her belly over time, and she's not shy about asking for another treat, even if she's already had five. Keep her out of the kitchen when you aren't home, though, cause this gal will find a way to food if she thinks getting in trouble later will be worth getting at the food now. </span></div></div>",

If you don't cut back on her food soon, the results may be hard to reverse...\" He trailed off as he verified her weight on the scale beside the table and looked over Shasta once more. Seemingly oblivious to how my stunningly beautiful black furred Shepherdess was wriggling and wigging about atop the table with ease of motion. Dipping and and bending her back in a play bow as she wagged her tail, her tongue rolling out of her muzzle as she smiled at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing this in the best interest of Shasta and I hope you'll take my advice seriously\" He said as he handed me the sheet of paper off the clipboard, now filled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recommend that you immediately stop with the treats and table scraps, cut back on her food to one quarter of a cup of food per day and be sure to purchase the obesity maintenance dog food that I have written down, and most importantly, I want to see her back in three months time and much lighter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the slip of paper in my hand, I watched as the veterinarian nodded curtly at me and Shasta and promptly left the room.

She's quite a handful, and isn't afraid to use her size to her advantage, so she really needs an owner who knows what they're doing with her. She's friendly and sweet, but she often gets into trouble because she gets bored easily and doesn't handle inactivity very well. If you can keep her under control, she's a wonderful dog, but, as you can tell by the fact that you're here considering working with her, her last family wasn't up to the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis big gal has gorgeous coloring, her white and black splotched fur looking not unlike someone had tried to paint it onto her. She has big, bright, green eyes that are surprisingly intense for a Dane, and has a black-spotted, jowly face that gave her an almost cartoonish contrast between her intense eyes and her droopy face. She's big, as Great Danes often are, but not all her weight comes from just her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a clear testament to how much trouble her old family had controlling her, Ginger sports quite the portly belly, as well as thick haunches and a broad back. Being unable to keep her out of most things, Ginger's appetite had been dictated primarily by the pudgy gal herself, the big Dane forcing her way into the pantry and fridge as she ate what she pleased, her family mostly unable to prevent her from getting into whatever she wanted. Currently pushing a hearty two hundred seven pounds, she's lost some weight here since she came here. Having arrived here at two hundred and forty pounds, Ginger was at the point where her previous family could essentially do nothing to prevent her food raids, the gal having grown too strong and too heavy for them to have done much to get her away from the foods she desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's yours if you'd like her, but you need to know that she's not going to be a walk in the park. </span></div></div>",

The tall home was surrounded by lawn on all sides, but beyond that were more trees. The house seemed to be decently isolated from most of society. In this backyard there was an apple tree with several ripe apples laying on the ground. The deer trotted over and munched on one, then another, as he was quite hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the deer's ears perked up and he looked over to see a young human. The human boy was staring right back at the deer from a porch. He was about 10 years old, and was smiling, leaning over the railing. The two locked eyes for a minute. The boy held his breath, hoping not to scare the deer away. He then turned and hurried inside his dwelling.

He stopped to lie down for the night, and when he awoke again, he found himself rather hungry once more. He leaned over and nibbled on a leaf, but found it to be rather... unsavory. No, he was hungry for something like what was in the basket the boy had given to him. Those delicious meats, so savory, juicy and glistening with fat. The deer wondered if he'd ever taste something like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer paced from tree to tree, hoping to stumble across something as filling and hearty as what he had tasted the day before, but not a single leaf, berry or fruit could satisfy him. Distressed, he laid down in some tall grass to think. Just then, a rabbit hopped by. Deer and rabbits seldom had reason to fear each other, so the rabbit bounced right by the deer's nose. The deer eyed the rabbit. He looked plump. So plump, as if hibernation started tomorrow. The deer's mouth watered. He craned his neck towards the unsuspecting ball of juicy, furry meat and gave into his cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLURP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes nothing remained of the rabbit but some tufts of fur, bones and some entrails the deer did not find to be quite as delectable. He raised his messy, matted head. THAT was a satisfying meal. The deer was now full, and quite content, but the taste of devouring another animal, the thrill of the hunt... it felt incredible, and the deer wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ways away, the deer crossed by a squirrel who had taken his fair share of nuts. The deer nudged an acorn in it's direction, and as the squirrel scurried over he scurried right into the jaws of the newly awakened carnivore. CHOMP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer crossed a brook in which he spotted a hefty fish whose size had gotten it caught between some roots. The deer happily liberated it from the roots and into his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer continued to prey upon the critters he came across until, with an overfull, distended stomach and a proud new role in the forest, the deer laid down to rest for another night. The next morning, as the birds songs met the tranquil sunlight, the deer rose onto his legs, wobbly. He felt groggy. No, not groggy, hungry. It took a few seconds for him to stand up fully. His stomach had receded from the binge the night before, but now hung an extra inch or two down instead with blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer knew exactly what to do with this hunger now, and the thrill of the hunt brought him excitement to the point of lust.

The deer realized that the scent of blood that it had noticed earlier was not the scent of the blood of past victims that had been smeared into it's muzzle, but the pool of blood forming on the other side of the bear. The deer joyfully pranced around the bear and lapped at the blood which had oozed from a fatal gunshot wound in the bear's head, just grievous enough to let the bear return home before succumbing to death. The thick, still warm blood was savory on the tongue of the deer, who drank it like water. The deer gnashed at the side of the hefty corpse until fur gave way to flesh. The deer embedded his head into the hole he had made and feasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear, being so large, would be food for months for most carnivores. The greedy dear stayed by the side of his most joyous find and devoured it slowly, bite by bite, barely stopping to sleep, as his distended stomach lowered closer and closer to the ground with each swallow. It was quite a site, a deer who looked as if it had swallowed three watermelons tearing juicy flesh from the bones of it's natural predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn three days, the deer had eaten all that was worth eating on the bear, and his body had become bloated as a result. Holding incredulous amounts of flesh inside, the deer's belly sunk down half way to it's knees by virtue of sheer fullness, and the fat he had gained extended his stomach the rest of the way, just past his knees. His legs had become plump like sausages, with rolls on the thick upper legs overtaking the lower legs at the knee. His rear had become enormously round and blubbery, each cheek wobbling with every movement. The rear was so large his small, fluffy tail barely poked out from where it was propped up between the cheeks. The fat around his stomach and buttocks wrapped around his sides, giving him a spherical shape, and coating his back in a few inches of insulating flesh. From his neck dangled several chins, swaying to and fro with every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the deer's now immense size, each movement he made combined with protein from the meat, had strengthened his muscles, allowing him to keep mobility. The deer loved the feeling of his upper legs rubbing against his stomach. The feeling of fat flesh on fat flesh fulfilled a carnal desire within him, providing a sense of arousal. The deer now not only needed to continue his wanton feast, but he had to find something to do with this lust pumping through his body.</span></div></div>",

In fact, the young deer would gladly identify as a stag, greater than any of his former herd. With each morsel he ate, his belly widened with blubber, and the more girth that was on the stag, the more space he took up and the more he felt on top of the food chain. It was an exhilarating feeling, and with it came the feeling of wanting to mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, as the top of the food chain the stag could have any mate from his herd. He felt his groin swell with that desire as this realization came to him, but alas, the stag had no herd. So for two full days, the stag went about gobbling down squirrels, raccoons, and even a lone wolf he got a jump on, yet he was constantly distracted by a painfully throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the next day that he found relief as he woke up. The stag's distended, grossly obese abdomen now fit between his hind legs, and as he went about the morning routine of hefting itself up, he noticed his groin rubbing against his blubber. The blubber was soft, warm and moist with sweat and meaty juice. The stag curiously arched his back and wobbled his legs around, letting his fat jiggle against his throbbing cock. The tip of the cock, no matter what angle he prodded, found itself grinding into and sinking into his belly, and the bottom of the shaft was already engulfed in blubber, so as the curious arching grew into heated thrusts the stag's burning hot rod was rubbed on all sides. It was better than the stag could have ever imagined a mate being. Of course it would be, he was the alpha. Only he could bring himself this pleasure. The stag's whole body heated up as he felt the pressure of an ejaculation build up, and he knew that he had to have more. He had surpassed survival, it was now time to take the lead and thrive. He needed to grow more. Fatter. More belly to swallow up his cock and more belly to assert him as king of the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag shot ropey cum all over the underside of his belly. He the laid there, enjoying the feeling of the sun drying his semen and the feeling of his royal fat cushioning every part of him.</span></div></div>",

It took a mere moment for him to aim the gun, take a deep breath and fire right into the deer's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the deer awoke inside a room with wooden walls and a dirt floor. He stood up, but found he could not move much as all four of his legs were tied to posts with rope. A few feet away, the hunter was speaking to his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why didn't you just kill him, Pa?\" The boy asked, warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told ya, boy, his meat'll be much better if we get to fatten him up first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Pa...\" The boy looked over at the deer sadly.

If you wanna be a real man like your pa, ya gotta be big like a real man! And if you wanna be big, you gotta eat like a real man too!\" He grabbed his staunch, round gut from both hides and gave it a hearty shake. \"This lil' guy's gonna blow up reeeeaaaaal nice, and then we'll have all that juicy meat to ourselves and you can get yerself a proper gut too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Pa...\" Jimmy, the boy, said, poking at his chubby belly. The father took his son under his meaty arm and the two left the shack, leaving the deer alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer, understanding none of what was happening, only knew that in front of him was a trough full of tasty looking feed. Seeds, berries, grains and some vegetable oil (for the extra fattening) were all mixed together and the deer was able to forget about his restrains as he ate. In fact, eating was the only thing the deer could do in his current position, so that's what he did. He ate and ate and ate more than he had ever eaten before. Every now and then the boy would come in with some more feed for the deer, who had begun to plump up...</span></div></div>",
