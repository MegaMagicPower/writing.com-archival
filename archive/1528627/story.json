A tiny teenage girl pulled on Chris's leg and squealed: \"OMG I luv you im your no.1 fan!\" Chris's gigantic hand came down upon her and scooped her up. \"Wanna come with us?\" he said to her. She nodded. \"Im Molly\" she squeaked. Everyone else had support, too.

Dale went weak at the knees at the sight of the handsome Maro grinning down at him with a brilliant white smile, and Liam said, \"Maro, I didn't know you-\"<br>\r\n\"SShhh,\" Maro said with a grin. \"Don't worry about it.\" He pulled off the shirt and cast it aside, exposing his ripped and muscular torso that made even Liam's look sloppy. \"I see you've been staying in the gym even after your growth,\" Dale pointed out.<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Maro said with a grin as he kicked off his shoes. \"It's even more important now. Gotta keep that godlike appearance,\" he smiled cockily, but kindly, as he winked down as Dale who smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the shorts, which he stepped out of with two thunderous BOOMs. He was now dressed in his a pair of boxers, and you drooled at his gorgeous body and at the rapidly expanding bulge in his pants. Liam was in shock, but of the good kind. All he knew was that Maro's giant body, this close, this exposed, while standing on the body of his also-godly best mate, was unreal. Given the rapidly thickening cocks - Liam's way off to his left and Maro's, right in front of him, stirring inside the underwear - he felt like he was almost literally between a rock and a hard place.  Dale knew Liam wanted this too...but he just didn't know where it was going to go next.  With his extraordinary, rugby-playing strength and the raptures the two contestants were in, the ball was well and truly in Maro's court and - as Dale noticed his brilliant, cocky-yet-good-natured smile widen even further - he knew it, too.</span></div></div>",

With enormous impact Maro dropped down so he was kneeling on the sofa, legs either side of Liam's thighs, staring dreamily into the eyes of his fellow giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck,\" Dale said, in shock at the two phenomenal man-mountains he was now in the middle of. He was stood next to Liam's navel on his massive expanse of a torso, a torso that was moving up and down with rapid, excited breathing. Ahead, Maro simply towered over him. Dale was an enormous giant in his own right but right now he'd never felt so small. Maro reached down and grabbed Liam's dick, holding it tightly in his hand and pumping it slightly, grinning at Liam. You turned back to see how Liam was liking it but you could no longer see Liam's face - Liam had tipped his head back, apparently in pleasure at having the enormous Maro on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get inside his bellybutton,\" Maro said to you, and you turned back to see his gorgeous dark eyes fixed on you. <br>\r\n\"OK,\" you called up to him and sprinted to Liam's vast navel, diving inside. You were probably tall enough to climb out if you wanted to, but it'd be a struggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale had almost lost sight of Maro...until he leaned forward and looked directly down into the navel. His radiant smile almost made Dale fall in love on the spot, and as he winked, Dale blushed furiously, completely overcome. Then Maro moved forward even more and his muscular body became the sky - the see abs, pecs, and house-sized nipples entranced Dale. Then Maro's own belly descended, before making world-shaking contact with Liam's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of kissing; Maro had locked lips with Liam far, far away. Maro grinded up and down on Liam's body, making a tremendous noise and generating equally tremendous heat. And Dale was right in the middle of it, overwhelmed by their intercourse. Dale began to stroke his own cock, pumping it furiously at the mere sight of Maro's body and the noises the two were making. He felt almost like a voyeur, but that was kind of hot too...</span></div></div>",

It was completely bizarre!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup lads,\" said the Saracen with a wide, cocky grin. He oozed boyish, youthful charm which stood at odds with his huge, masculine appearance. Dale was in awe. Maro walked up to the sofa and Liam suddenly reached down, picking him up and putting him next to you on his belly. The huge geordie stared down at the two - to him - tiny men now in his possession. His hand shook as a single finger caressed Maro's entire body; he was still wearing a polo shirt and shorts that accented his thick muscles and arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale walked over to Maro, who was barefoot, and knelt down, kissing the foot. Maro looked down and, with a grateful smile, picked Dale up in one powerful fist. \"How's it going, Dale?\" he said with a laugh. \"Like what you see down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld tight in the tough fist of an insanely strong rugby player, Dale shuddered a little bit in arousal and nodded. Suddenly a gargantuan shadow fell over the two of them as Liam grabbed Maro, and both of you were pulled close to the face of the Geordie god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alreet mate?\" Liam asked cheerfully. \"You've gotten bigger since last time I saw you. Not much, mind,\" he added with a cocky laugh.<br>\r\n\"Big enough for this little guy,\" Maro shot back, holding Dale up. \"He fits perfectly in here. Might have to take him home,\" he added.<br>\r\n\"Nah, he's mine,\" said Liam. \"And so are you,\" he said, his eyes lighting up. You looked at Maro, expecting resistance, but instead Maro used his other hand to pull his shirt off and over you.<br>\r\n\"Works for me,\" he replied. With a single finger Liam ripped off Maro's shorts and underwear so all 3 of you, at your various different sizes, were naked in Liam's living room. This was going to be amazing.</span></div></div>",

To get his specially built HUGE house, he'd threatened Dale with his big foot. Once, he was annoyed at something and he crushed an ENTIRE village under his feet. And he often had hunger rampages. The biggest one he ever had meant the end of the entire population of Durham. Yet Dale had stuck by him through it all. Only now, he didn't feel much like climbing Liam. He'd only go and have one of his stupid moments, thinking Dale was a bug when obviously bugs were microscopic to Dale let alone Liam. Liam's little toe alone was several universes huge to any bug. But truth is Liam still wasn't used to being tens of thousands of feet tall. Sure, he loved the sensation that ran through his sexy body whenever a so called 'huge' building crumbled under his feet. And nothing could the rush as a tiny person slid down his throat. But to be honest, deep down in his tiny human filled belly, Liam would give anything to be normal again. All this size changing among friends was ruining it all. Dale was 'smaller' so he could see and talk to humans, but they still ran in fear (as - mainly thanks to Liam - they thought all Dale wanted to do was eat or crush them). Both Dale and Liam's lives, under all the fun of stomping and chomping, were worthless. So, not wanting another heart in mouth bug moment, Dale ran across the huge sofa and jumped down. Liam's huge now-bare feet were planted on the floor, with the socks next to him. Liam stood up for some reason, as usual dwarfing Dale to little more than a worthless ant. His gigantic foot was raised, and Dale was petrified Liam would walk his way and squash him. But luckily for Dale, Liam stomped to the kitchen. He returned little more than a minute later with a glass of water in hand. His bare feet were planted down again when he sat down, very close to Dale... But what did he do now?</span></div></div>",

He grinned at his mate. \"Get us some strippers,\" he said deviously, and Dale reciprocated the grin, nodding. Liam bent down and put his friend down on the edge of London. Stretching and happy to be a giant again, Dale rampaged into London, looking back to see Liam watching on approvingly. Dale was good mates with Liam but since the size change, had felt the need to please him - even though Liam hadn't treated him any different, and was unable to kill the invincible Dale anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale roared through the city, sending the inhabitants scattering as he toppled Canary Wharf for the third time. \"You should stop rebuilding that,\" Dale laughed. Then he spotted it - the strip club. Dale grabbed it out of the ground, strippers and all, and left the city limits. Liam picked him up and looked at Dale's catch. <br>\r\n\"Nice,\" he said. \"Alreet then mate, let's head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam turned and headed back home, with Dale held firmly in his hand and the strip club held firmly in Dale's.</span></div></div>",

There he put Dale down on his bedside table, and removed his shirt, revealing his muscular torso. He lay down on the bed and put Dale onto his belly. Dale, in turn, put down the strip club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out!\" Dale ordered. A few dozen people ran out of the strip club and looked around, in complete shock as to where they now were. Dale laughed cockily and soon Liam followed suit, his booming laugh threatening to destroy their eardrums. But he was careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strippers over here,\" Dale pointed to a space next to Liam's pit of a belly button. \"Everyone else over there,\" Dale pointed to a space behind him. The tiny people obeyed quickly and without question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Dave, laughing euphorically at his power. \"Stay there,\" he ordered the strippers as he picked up all the patrons, managers and waiters from the bar in one hand and hurled them at Liam's mouth, who ate them all in a single bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Liam hummed, and you could feel the vibration through the diaphragm. Dale was in awe of it so god knows what the strippers were feeling right now. Liam's hand moved past both of them and into his shorts, where Dale knew Liam was playing with a dick that could level mountains on its own. It was awe-inspiring and Dale, who believed himself to be straight, was surprised to find himself turned on by the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are ya waitin' for?\" Liam suddenly barked. \"Do your job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam watched, drinking beer as the miniscule strippers danced and stripped off on his stomach. But Liam quickly grew bored of this. \"Mate, pick em up,\"  Liam barked the order at Dale, who obeyed quickly. Once they were in Dale's hand, Liam picked up Dale and let him out on the pillow next to him. Liam then rolled over so he was lying, stomach down on his enormous bed and his gigantic face filled the vision of both Dale and the miniscule strippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now go,\" Liam grinned, his face planet-sized to the antlike strippers. Liam was able to focus in on tinies and was like a kid in a candy store, staring at the few dozen strippers in turn as they danced and stripped their asses off. Dale, in turn, sat on the pillow with his hand in his pants, completely taken by the show. Liam grabbed his bottle of beer and poured a little on the pillow, drenching the strippers. Liam licked his lips, enjoying every minute, and Dale saw him begin to gyrate, humping the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop,\" barked the Geordie god as he rolled out of bed, removing his shorts and - nothing could have prepared Dale for this - his black and white boxer shorts to reveal a dick that was simply gargantuan in size! Liam stood over the bed, stood over Dale and the strippers, and stared down at them with a focused intensity that made Dale weak at the knees. Dale decided to join in, stripping naked and beginning to whack off at the sight of these strippers performing for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick 'em up,\" Liam breathed intensely. Dale hesitated, enjoying himself far too much, but Liam simply said, \"mate,\" in a slightly harsher tone of voice and Dale got the picture. Liam felt a new surge of arousal as his friend instantly followed his commands, brushing all the strippers into his hand. Liam picked up Dale yet again and got back into bed, lying on his back, and tipped Dale out right on top of his cock. Dale took a minute to understand where he was, then yelled out in shock and disgust - but he couldn't altogether say he hated it. It was almost religious to be on this gigantic manhood. \"Put em on my head,\" Liam ordered and Dale did so, tipping all the strippers onto Liam's fleshy pink cockhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a new pole for you to dance on, ladies, get to it,\" Liam ordered with a hearty laugh. Dale jumped off and ran to Liam's belly button, sitting in front of it and watching in amusement as the now-naked strippers pleasured, kissed and danced on Liam's cockhead. Liam showed extraordinary restraint in not touching it for around 10 minutes, moaning at their tiny movements. Eventually, though, he said, \"put them inside,\" to Dale, whose mouth dropped open. He was stunned at the domineering callousness of his mate, but also a little turned on by it. Turned on enough, in fact, to grab all the strippers, prise open Liam's piss slit and hurl them inside, sending them tumbling into the abyss. \"Fuck yeah!\" Liam roared, and Dale was treated to the incredible sight of the dick being pumped aggressively. He couldn't imagine what the strippers were feeling, nor could he imagine the arousal Liam felt either. That's when Liam said \"you're going in too,\" to Dale, and before Dale could react Liam had pinched him off of his belly and dropped the DJ into his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah...sorry mate, but you feel great in there...fuck!\" Liam cried out, aggressively beating off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he came. The strippers were utterly eviscerated, impossible to identify, but Dale survived, being fired on a geyser of cum across Liam's chest and rolling right up to his neck. Having exploded already himself, Dale simply lay motionless right beneath Liam's chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking amazing mate, thanks,\" Liam said, the booming voice directly above Dale.</span></div></div>",

One of the conditions of his massive growth was that he would be able to see and communicate with normal people easily if he focused, essentially giving him telescopic vision at will. He was also rendered unable to harm his little friends accidentally - of course he could still rampage, if he chose to, but he couldn't accidentally crush people. This meant he was able to grab his friends as tight as he wanted to and have them run around his house, since he'd be unable to step on them unwittingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today the enormous Michael was thinking about Leroy and Jermaine. He was thinking about their muscular bodies and how he secretly longed for them when they used to play together. And he was thinking about how he'd never acted on it when he was small. Now, though, he could do whatever he wanted and had no fear of the consequences. The only thing that worried him was the idea of losing his friendship with either of them but at this point he'd held in his urges long enough. If it was a choice betwee'n cashing in on his dominant lust for his old teammates and maybe ruining things with them, or cashing in on his dominant lust by destroying entire towns, he'd choose the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJermaine:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrLVh-kX4AEtkv2?format=jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrLVh-kX4AEt...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.superleague.co.uk/uploads/images/w500/3270.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.superleague.co.uk/uploads/im...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Aj8MFGB.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/Aj8MFGB.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeroy:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Leroy-Cudjoe-009.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oy1iIez.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/oy1iIez.jpg</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/2mXpQYz.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/2mXpQYz.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he called his mates and they made their way over. Michael looked out the window and focused, seeing their tiny car make its way up the ramp and onto the doorstep. Excitedly Michael bounded over, threw open the door and simply picked up the whole car before they had a chance to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA confused and disoriented Leroy and Jermaine got out once Michael had placed it on the coffee table.  Still wearing just sweatpants, Michael sat on his huge sofa, legs wide in a dominant, alpha male stance as his mates emerged and turned to look at him. He regarded them in a friendly, protective way and did his best to hide his lust for now. \"'Sup lads,\" he said in his deep, booming voice, a wide grin spreading across his face as he saw his friends wince a little at the shock of the voice. That never got old and Michael shifted in his seat a little.<br>\r\n\"What's happening, big man?\" asked Leroy, and Michael heard it perfectly as if he was standing right in front of him, even though Leroy was almost ant-sized. He zoomed in on the two of them; they were both wearing t-shirts and shorts. Jermaine's t-shirt especially tightly hugged his barrel of a chest and Michael stared for entirely too long before snapping back to reality. He stomped over to his mini-fridge, deliberately using loud footfalls to startle and impress his friends, and grabbed a beer; he also grabbed a tiny fridge out of there that he used when he had tiny company and carried that over too. It was filled with normal-sized beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael drank it and stared at them while they made small talk and ribbed each other like the old days. He was delighted that Jermaine and Leroy would still make jokes about him, that they weren't too scared. But he wondered what he would do next... he could use his try to impress and seduce them with his massive body, starting with his feet, and take things slow... or he could use his size to really take control of the situation.</span></div></div>",

He resisted the urge to put his hand in his trackies and fondle his dick, but it was so tempting when he saw mates he had previously lusted over completely in thrall to him. <br>\r\n\"FIFA?\" Michael offered, taking a casual swig of beer, sitting there with his colossal feet up, still shirtless, like a king. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/tyNJWVd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/tyNJWVd.jpg</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/iA9jQtk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/iA9jQtk.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Leroy and Jermaine said, still entranced. With his free hand Michael turned on the Playstation 4. \"There's some controllers for you little runts over here,\" he said, and he indicated the front of the table. They would have to walk through the canyon of Michael's monstrous thighs and calves to get to them, and Michael watched with amusement as they walked to the edge of the table, past the knees to the very edge where they picked up the controllers. Michael focussed, zooming on Leroy's face. With an excited smile and another swig of grin to cover it, Michael noticed that Leroy - and Jermaine - were both furtively glancing at Michael's crotch area. Casually, Michael scratched his crotch, exposing the shape of his enormous dick through the great tracksuit. He saw Leroy and Jermaine's eyes bulging out of their heads again and Michael breathed deep. They were so into this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Michael said, as Leroy and Jermaine sat down on the coffee table, Michael's bulging calves on either side. \"You two play first,\" he commanded his two little friends. And they did. Michael watched as they played FIFA on a screen that to them must have been the size of a stadium. Soon their competitive instincts came out and they began to yell and shout. Leroy won the first game, then Jermaine won the second two, narrowly, and an angry Leroy stood up and removed his shirt because sweat patches had appeared, they were playing so intensely. Michael watched, loving the private show they were putting on for him, and casually slide his hand into his trackies, squeezing his dick, playing with it, caressing the head and quickly causing a semi. God they were so fucking sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn,\" Leroy said suddenly, turning around. </span></div></div>",

Of course Leroy had seen it back when they played together. All three of them did fairly well for themselves but Michael's had been the subject of many jokes down the years, such was its thickness and length.

He was clearly very nervous to have been found out. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJermaine hadn't turned around yet, still basking in his latest win and enjoying his beer, but now he did and he too noticed what was happening. \"Jesus christ, mate, wear different trackies next time,\" he said with a nervous laugh. \"I know we used to say it was gonna poke us in the eye but now it'd probably kill us.\" Jermaine, too, couldn't help but wonder what Michael's game was here, but like Leroy he had to admit the sight of that huge dick stirring in the grey trackies was something of a turn-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shifted in his seat slightly; he couldn't help but picture his huge cock all over Leroy and Jermaine, with their sexy bodies completely helpless against it, and that renewed feeling of power made him even more horny. \"No probably about it,\" he joked, and the other two laughed - but it was the same nervous laugh, he noticed. Michael knew that he could cash in on this moment, but he still wasn't sure what Leroy and Jermaine would say. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
