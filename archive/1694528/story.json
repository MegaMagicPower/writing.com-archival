Peering out of the corners of your eyes you recognize where you are standing as the hotel's business centre. You then look down and see the usual Hotel uniform hugging your body. You look down again and bug out your eyes at what you'd failed to notice before, the bulge out at the front of the uniform. You reach behind your ears and feel the silky texture of shoulder length straight hair. You finally spot the glasses on your nose and realize just whose body you now found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck I'm Mildred!\" you blurt out, mixed emotions at the change bouncing through your mind. Firstly you were uncomfortable to be in the body of a coworker, a girl coworker in particular but then realized one thing. \"I'm not the doorman anymore! Hell yeah!\" you shout out with a fiendish grin on your new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back down at the computer and decide that while normally finding yourself in the body of a girl would be terrifying, escaping from your dull job was worth it in the short run.

You had had no customers all morning so far and were bored out of your mind. You needed something to focus on to stop from falling asleep so you decided to see what was going on elsewhere in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out across the sales floor you saw Trinity Fushia trying hard to pay attention to a customer's question. The problem was that she was easily distracted and could be somewhat absent minded sometimes. As the customer stormed away from her after a few more minutes you shook your head. You felt bad for Trinity because she really was trying hard to be more helpful but the store manager had said that one more customer complaint and Trinity would be out of a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person you spotted was Mark Wolfen. Mark was one of the stores most memorable regular customers. He would come in once a week to buy some groceries and always made sure to comment to the manager on the helpfulness of the employees. His comment on Trinity's helpfulness was rumoured to be the only reason Trinity had not been fired a week earlier. Mark was always happy and seemed to enjoy his weekly trips to the store so much that his mood tended to soften the edges of some of the other customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily Zhang caught your eye next. She was hurriedly working the till, her shift nearly at an end. She was never very talkative around the other employees and would disappear for home the instant her shift ended. The few times you'd seen her outside of work you saw that she was a friendly person. Unfortunately your other coworkers thought very poorly of her, thinking her to be stuck up due to her non-speaking state at work. She was also the fastest cashier anyone had ever seen and as a result the other cashiers disliked her even more. Today she was the only cashier with a lineup and was working so quickly that she'd be done her ten customers before the rest were done with their second customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there, you shook your head and spoke the name of one of the above-mentioned people.

You were so taken aback by her behaviour you did not follow her at first but then you saw your boss looking in your direction from the other end of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" you murmur before slapping back on the smile and following after your old body's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you catch up with your old sister you say politely, \"Is there anything I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? No. Someone else? Maybe,\" was the flat response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never known your sister to be so rude to someone other than family before and even then she was usually quite nice and polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I provided bad service before but I've been trying to be better at my job. I think I've really improved!\" you say, defending Trinity (and currently yourself) from your sister's unusually rude attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's see if you can find something,\" smirks Christina, \"Bring me a size 28B white Maidenform push-up bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once Christina!\" you chirp back, remembering exactly where the item she asked for was, thanks to your recent memorizing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stalling for time, you ask the forty-something woman, \"Can you describe your style a bit more to me? Are you planning to go on holiday, or is this for more around-the-pool wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm hoping to surprise my husband for our anniversary this weekend.\" She blushes, describing the naughty things they plan to do while their children are with a sitter. You've heard that women can get really raunchy and talk about all sorts of sexually eyebrow-popping things without a man around, but you can't believe your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman continues to prattle away about her husband, his cock, and all the things she'd like to do with it, while you sift through a rack of swimsuits. Deciding enough is enough, you spot a tankini that's about her size and pull it off the rack. You beam, \"I think this little number would do wonders to complement your figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" The woman glances into a nearby mirror, holding the garment in front of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! This model is in vogue this season. It's modest yet supportive.\" You gush. \"Your husband won't be able to take his eyes off you in one of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman spins around in the mirror vainly while you retrieve other tankinis of the same size but with different patterns and colours. You point her to the dressing room, and she thanks you profusely after selecting a handful to take with her to try out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you glance up at the clock and wait for Trinity's shift to end. The next hour passes by in a blur as you tend to a horde of women stopping by the department store after their own professional jobs are over. Most of them are older women, like the one asking about the swimsuit, and you don't get much titillation looking at their age-worn, flabby, sagging busts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrinity's shift is finally over and your feet are killing you. Having to stand on that sales floor for the past nine hours, without any breaks courtesy of Miss Melvin, wearing Trinity's leather zip-up ankle boots. You feel what might be a blister beginning to form on your heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, you trudge over to the electronics section and see Matt, the evening customer service representative who relieves you after your own shift ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Matt, have you seen Kyle around?\" You ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Trin, he clocked out about ten minutes ago. I think he went over to the break room; might still be there if you catch him.\" Matt drawls lazily, leaning back in his chair behind the booth with his arms spread wide and his hands cradled behind his head. \"You still working here? I thought Miss Melvin fired you after getting too many complaints.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am still working here!\" You huff defensively. \"And don't you worry, things are gonna be different from now on. I'll make sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rolls his eyes and returns to reading his magazine. So even the night shift knows about Trinity's incompetence? Gossip spreads quickly, you groan, as you head over to the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the break room, Trinity sits at the table next to Amanda Ana-Marteau, the night shift manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Trinity,\" Amanda yawns, sipping a cup of coffee. She pulls on her company vest and takes out a compact mirror, looking over her appearance. If the day shift manager, Melissa Melvin, is the wicked witch, then Amanda is the good witch. If it didn't mean prowling around the department store on the graveyard shift like a ghost at three o'clock in the morning, you would work for her instead of Melissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was work today hon? I heard Melissa got on your case again.\" Amanda adds, as you sit at the table across from Trinity in your body. She stares at you uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked her into giving me one more chance. No more screwups.\" You assert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda doesn't seem to buy it, however, as she replies, \"That's wonderful, Trinity. You remember the offer I made to you last week, right dear? I might be able to switch you over to the night shift over in Appliances now that Lisa quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it, thanks for the kind offer Miss Marteau.\" You smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think too hard about it,\" She says and closes her compact, standing up and fluffing out her wavy brunette hair. The way she said it strikes you as condescending, but you ignore it. \"That position won't be open forever. Let me know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves to begin her own shift, leaving you and Trinity alone in the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appliances isn't a bad gig, you know...\" You begin awkwardly, straightening out your hair. \"At least it gets you away from Miss Melvin and the stick up her ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" She nods demurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not give it a try?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrinity sighs, \"I don't really know much about televisions, dishwashers, toasters, and all that junk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed to do fine with my job in Electronics today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs her arm and rubs it as if stung by your helpful reproach. \"Actually... I don't think I helped anyone today. I got a couple of complaints logged this afternoon. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just not very smart. I forget things a lot. But I don't mind working in Lingerie since I wear it all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift uncomfortably in your seat. Trinity <i>does</i> seem to be one of the duller tools in the shed. But she's always been nice to you, and her little sister's comment still hangs unresolved in your mind: <i>Maybe he's got a crush on you <b>too</b></i>. Her last word implying a lot more than you were initially aware of about Trinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" You say gently, moving over to place your arm around Trinity's shoulders. \"All we need to do is get some customers to leave positive feedback about you and that will get Miss Melvin off your case for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how are we gonna do that?\" She shoots you a questioning glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy... I call up a few friends, you call a few friends, and they buy some lingerie at the store after you help them out.\" You explain slowly. \"I've got my Mom, my sister, my girlfriend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your girlfriend?\" Trinity repeats, her face falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yes... not to mention anyone you know who might need a new bra or panties. So whattya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that could work.\" She murmurs. \"Hey... do you know why we switched bodies? And can we get back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, earlier this morning I was bored and all of a sudden this voice popped into my head. It said I can swap bodies with whoever I want; all I need to do is say their name while focusing on them.\" You explain. \"You're the only person I've tried this out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" She looks down at your body, then at hers, and adds, \"I never realised how cute I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt <i>anyone</i> can look cute dressed in these bulky corporate uniforms...\" You grumble. She orders you to stand up, and she slowly walks around your body examining it from all angles, making you feel like you're on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so funny!\" She giggles, raising your voice an octave higher with a feminine lisp. She claps her hands. \"It's like having... um... an out of body experience or something. Like Freaky Friday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" You agree. \"Can we swap back now? This body really needs to pee and I've been holding it in for a while.\" You press your thighs together, noting the distinct void between your legs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just go?\" Trinity asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's your body... a girl's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? I went in your body earlier today,\" She replies, then gets an odd smirk on her face, \"It was really weird peeing while standing up and using one of those wall toilets, y'know? But in a good way I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. \"Whatever! Let's just swap back already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your heart plummets, but upon saying \"Kyle Blunt,\" everything swirls around and you feel like falling until the next moment... when you're back in your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! Glad that worked.\" You pat your flat chest. Unfortunately you had been so busy helping out Trinity and stopping her from getting fired that you didn't take time to feel up her body. You might get another chance later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home,\" She checks herself out in the break room mirror, striking a few poses and sticking out her tongue playfully. \"Oh my! You really did have to use the toilet, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry!\" You laugh nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrinity walks up to you and throws her arms around you, hugging you tightly. \"Thanks for saving my job, Kyle. It's really sweet of you to do all this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel her large breasts mashing into your chest. Her long, blonde hair smells nice as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you push her away. \"I need to head back to my place. It's getting pretty late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Trinity's smile fades. \"Hey... you have another shift with me tomorrow, right? Do you... Do you mind if we... y'know... switch bodies again so you can do my shift for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" You shrug. \"Let's meet up behind the building to make the switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!!!\" She squeals, wanting to hug you again but instead you point to the restrooms, and she remembers and hurries down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into your car, you can't believe everything that happened today. A voice gave you a wonderful power to switch bodies by saying that person's name (their body's name, as it turns out). You used it to trade places with an absentminded, ditzy coworker who may be carrying a torch for you. You did a decent job impersonating her while assisting customers find women's lingerie, making sure she wouldn't get fired today. And now you've got a plan to help her out over the long term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the car into the parking lot of a suburban apartment complex. This is where you and your girlfriend, Emily, have lived together for the past six months. Your wages from the department store and Emily's wages as a part-time university tour guide are enough to pay rent, food, utilities, with a modest amount left over for savings. You and Emily shared the car; it was a gift from her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily is laying on the couch watching Netflix when you get home. She's dressed in a cotton t-shirt (one of yours, in fact), which drapes over her arms and waist. Beneath that is a beige 32B bra and matching panties; she isn't wearing any trousers. A small drum of ice cream lays on the table next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough day at university boo bear?\" You guess correctly, taking off your uniform and hanging it up in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily frowns, \"How can you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull her close and run your hand along her back. Your hand sweeps lower and lower until you grab her bum; she grabs your wrist and pulls it away for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh... not tonight lover,\" She can't help but smile, breathing into your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you tell me about your day?\" You ask, deciding to postpone telling her about your amazing new powers for now. \"Are you hungry? I can cook up some chicken on the stove tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wonderful.\" She coos, and as you turn around she taps your butt playfully. She turns off the TV and closes the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she begins, \"So after my classes I go into the student union to set up some tables and organize the job fair. Now, I'm not required to do this, since I was just covering for Jenna since she had a date with Mark. You've met Jenna before, haven't you sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, yeah.\" You grunt, setting the pan to simmer and adding some chopped vegetables and spices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jenna is supposed to be at the cine with her date watching <i>Loving You Twice</i>. And she texts me telling me he's getting really hot and handsy. So I text her back and I'm like, 'Work it girl!' And then she tells me to cover for her a while longer because this date could lead to something more at his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess...\" You interject, thawing out a chicken breast before throwing it on the pan. \"She and Mark went back to her apartment and she left you to do all of her work at the job fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Emily complains. \"That two-faced cunt totally hung me out to dry. And she knew I had an important examination to make up later that day. She <i>knew</i> I couldn't cover for her as well as retake my test. I bet she did this because of what Charlotte said about me to her yesterday after our yoga class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you do? About the double booking, I mean.\" You ask, trying to follow one story line at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily continues to blow off steam while you flip and sear the chicken in the pan. You tune her out and occasionally agree with her or reinforce some notion she has about one of her friends or classmates. Girls can be so petty to each other sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supper's ready, babe.\" You announce to her finally, and she sets some plates and silverware on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's mood improves after a good meal; she doesn't eat when she gets stressed out which usually makes things worse. You're just happy to have some peace and quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both watch a new TV series on Netflix to pass the time after dinner. She's laying on top of you on the couch, snuggled up in your arms as you caress her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you're reminded of Trinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe,\" You ask your girlfriend, \"Would you do me a favour please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Kyle, what do you need?\" She cranes her head upward to meet your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this coworker of mine at the department store... her name is Trinity.\" You begin. \"She's really nice but kind of forgetful. Anyways, she's having a hard time at work and asked for my help. I told her I'd try to get you and Christina and maybe my mother to buy some lingerie from the store and give her positive reviews so her boss won't fire her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice of you to suggest that,\" Emily smiles. \"But I already have all the lingerie I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just humour her, will you?\" You plead earnestly. Seeing her noncommittal, you add, \"Consider it an early birthday gift. I know it isn't till next month, but why don't you pick out anything you like? I'll pay for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Emily closes her eyes. \"Now that you mention it... there is this frilly, lacy, g-string I've been aching to get and try on for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat, picturing your girlfriend in a racy, revealing thong. Most of her underwear being comfortable, full-seated, and utilitarian rather than sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really mean it babe?\" You ask, kissing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffs, \"Dream on, loverboy! I'll do that if you replace all of your boxers with speedos and banana hammocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace. \"Point taken. Can you at least do it for Trinity then? Her name is Trinity Fushia, she works in the Lingerie section.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she matter to you?\" Emily asks, more suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her? Nothing!\" You blink. \"I just thought it would be nice to help her keep her job. Because if she gets fired, then they might move me out of Electronics and make me sell women's undies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily laughs. \"Now that's a funny thought! You don't know a thing about women's clothes, much less bras and panties! I'd kinda like to see you try though.\" She teases you but ultimately agrees to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks babes, I promise you won't regret it.\" You declare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How's my favourite sister tonight?\" You lean over the table and speak into your cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kyle!\" She chirps on the other line. \"You caught me at a good time. Evan tucked the babies in and I just got back from my jog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister got married two years ago to a guy named Evan. They're both very active, outdoorsy people and are perfect for each other. It wasn't long before Christine had their first child, soon after followed by a second child... Irish twins basically. They take up most of their time nowadays, with Christine acting as the stay-at-home mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Hey, I wanted to ask you a question.\" You begin. \"Is everything okay? I mean, are you doing alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Kyle. Why wouldn't I be?\" Christine chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... Trinity told me you came to the store earlier today.\" You reply. \"She said you acted pretty rudely to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her scoff on the phone. \"So she put you up to this, Kyle? What does that bimbo want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou steel yourself and continue, \"She just wanted to know, that's all. She sounded upset when she told me about it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure that was a lie. And sure, the real Trinity never talked to your sister today. But your sister is a sucker for guilt and you figure it might be an effective way to get her back into the store and make amends by giving Trinity a positive review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine sighs. \"It would take too long to tell you the story between us, Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you've known her before? How long?\" You ask intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, that's a conversation for another day. It's pretty late.\" Christine said. \"... Let's just say that I <i>used</i> to know her. We went to the same school together several years ago. But she was too stupid to handle it so she dropped out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I won't press the matter.\" You reply. \"Just promise me you'll come back to the store tomorrow and leave her a glowing review? It might mean preventing her from getting fired. Do it for me, as your little brother, will you please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a pause. Finally, she sighs, \"Okay. Fine. I'll come back tomorrow. But only for you, Kyle. Not for that bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Thanks!\" You hang up the phone.

Harold Thomas, the stockroom manager, sits on a wooden crate, taking a drag on a cigarette. He had finished restocking the shelves earlier that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a smoke?\" He asks you, patting a pack of menthols in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"Emily would kill me if I start smoking again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold gets a wry grin. \"Emily, huh?

When you ask again, he replies, \"Nothing. There is this one girl I like... but I don't think anything's gonna happen between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that for certain,\" You reassure him. \"What's her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold shakes his head slowly. \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to pry into another person's personal affairs, you simply let it go. \"Alright Harold... I won't ask for details. For what it's worth, I used to feel the same way before I sacked up and asked Emily out. She had just started university when we met, and I couldn't afford to go, so I thought she was out of my league. Anyways, I didn't know she secretly liked me too, so we hit things off immediately... been that way ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your point?\" He asks sullenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think he knows already, but a part of you just wants to kill some time talking while you wait for Trinity. \"So approach her with confidence, man. Talk her up. You've got interests, you're not a boring person. If she's not into you... fine, no more doubt. But if she likes you, then that's your chance to do something together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it, Kyle.\" He mumbles, before stubbing out his cigarette with his shoe. He puts his mittened hands in his coat pockets. \"What are you doing out here this morning, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just killing time before my shift starts.\" You lie, glad to see Harold nod casually as he re-enters the building. You didn't want him there to witness your swap with Trinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you finally see her car swing into the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trinity emerges, you gaze over her body in a different light. Sure, you admire her strawberry blonde hair, carefully straightened and thickened as it seems to shine in the early morning sunlight. And sure, you like the way her hourglass figure seems to bounce and wiggle in all the right places as she sashays toward you. Even if her mouthwatering curves are mostly hidden in the gauche uniform you're all required to wear out on the sales floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time you know you'll be inhabiting her form, wearing her body, literally stepping into her shoes. Briefly you wonder if she's looking at you now in the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Emily noticed how long you took to get ready for work this morning. You threw on your best white button-up dress shirt, which you had ironed the night before. You combed your hair and used an extra dollop of hair gel; in addition, you flossed your teeth and rinsed with mouthwash. And for once, Emily was the one banging on the bathroom door waiting for her turn to get ready for university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike cleaning house in anticipation of a guest, you tried to make yourself nice and presentable for Trinity when you switch with her. You regret not going to the gym as often as you could, as you had appraised your own figure in the mirror earlier that morning. But by most accounts you consider yourself in reasonably good shape. Not too thin. Tall and fit enough for a guy your age. Not really possessing the ability to stand apart and judge yourself from someone else's eyes... until yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you wonder what Trinity must be thinking as she approaches and softly greets you in the alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Kyle.\" She smiles, looking up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart thumps in your chest. \"Hey Trinity! Glad you could make it. We don't have much time before our shifts begin.\" You point to your wristwatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about being a little late.\" She clasps her hands apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" You fold your arms. \"So did you convince your friends to come visit you today and leave some positive feedback? You know... to improve your reputation with Miss Melvin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you with a blank expression before finally pounding her hand. \"So <i>that's</i> what I forgot to do! Frick!\" She shows you her index finger, which has a white string tied around it. \"I was racking my brains all morning trying to remember why I had this little thing around my finger. I usually do this when there's something important but I must have misplaced the note I had written when I got home yesterday. Stupid, stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, and you place your hands on her shoulders. \"Calm down, Trin.\" You order. \"And don't worry! I know a couple of people who plan to come in sometime today to help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you so much!\" A wave of relief passes over Trinity's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you ready to swap?\" You give a sidelong glance in the alley, still finding it empty except for you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She bites her lip nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab onto her hands and stare intensely into her eyes. Her dazzling, baby blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trinity Fushia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA split second later, the world shifts and tumbles leaving you disoriented. As quickly as it begins it stops. And you find yourself gazing upwards at your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've become Trinity again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is incredible!\" Trinity says, letting go of your hands and using her own to pat herself down. She looks at her new arms, chest, and legs. \"Mmm... you smell nice today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, it's a new cologne.\" You murmur in Trinity's syrupy voice. Then, feeling obligated to return the favour, you add, \"I like your hair, is this your natural colour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrinity giggles, sounding overly effeminate. \"Don't you mean <i>your</i> hair now? And... wow! Your thingy has a mind of its own down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe draws your attention to her trousers, as a noticeable bulge protrudes from her fly. It twitches a little, and you step back awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for sharing,\" You deadpan, \"Now control yourself please! We only have a couple minutes until we have to go inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmigosh, do boys have to deal with this all the time??\" She lisps in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think about something else... anything else will do.\" You grow frustrated. You're not sure whether Trinity can capably impersonate you for the entire day. She might have handled being you for a few hours yesterday, but someone is bound to notice something weird eventually unless she focuses. Which, it turns out, seems to be a tall order for a scatterbrain like Trinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the back door and head to the employees' office, a shared space with sets of lockers for storing valuables in between shifts. Trinity follows close behind, even though your car keys, wallet, and cell phone fit conveniently in her pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, have to deposit Trinity's purse into a locker. You use her key and swing open Trinity's locker, stuffing her purse inside where it sits along with a few other sundry items (a box of pain relievers, a tube of lip balm, a charging cord, among other things).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya Wessing, a middle-aged woman who works on the Maternity/Baby sales floor which is next to Lingerie, smiles politely at you as you walk on by. She's overweight but has a heart of gold. Her husband passed away several years ago and her adult children have moved out, so she works here mainly for something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't feel like talking to her, not yet anyways. Your eyes briefly make contact with Miss Melvin, whose gaze seems to sear into you like a hot iron. But she doesn't say anything, perhaps still thinking Trinity is on thin ice and waiting for just one more complaint to do her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still not going to give her that chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you consider swapping into Miss Melvin's body and using her authority as the day shift manager to erase the bad parts from Trinity's employee file. But that would mean putting her into Trinity's body. You're not sure Trinity would like that, and you wouldn't want that bossy woman occupying your own life either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's an interesting idea. And it gives you the chance to test whether you can swap with another person while already swapped with someone else. You still don't know much about this amazing power and to what limits, if any, you can use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd be the one the customers always ogle, leer at and the other employees sneaking glances at instead of the one being ignored by customers and feared by employees in her smaller skinnier curly haired 45 year old b cup size frame. The one getting the hunks flirting with them in the store dating them, like Mark, god how she wished that so many times watching the cameras, instead of going home to her almost bald headed glasses wearing husband even though he did love her, they had a great relationship with two kids in college, but watching the other men leer and flirt with Trinity she couldn't help but want more, and now she had it.</span></div></div>",
