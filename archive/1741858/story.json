            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c*Yawn*\u2026good morning\u201d Alex yawned as he awoke in his room on another sunny day in North City. He climbs out of bed of his apartment before exiting the room. He scratches his head still half asleep before accidently running into someone. Alex falls on his back in groans in pain before he looks up to see who he ran into; it was Mr. Jeice of the Ginyu Force. The Ginyu force was a sort of police organization made up of five members all of who had extraordinary powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hello there Alex \u2018ow\u2019s it been\u201d Mr. Jeice says greeting Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Mr. Jeice good morning\u201d Alex says standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you up to today\u201d Mr. Jeice asked casually?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh just heading outside for a morning walk. What about you? How\u2019s your partner Burter doing\u201d Alex asked? Jeice smiles and pats Alex on the back and laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Alex always worrying about others ain\u2019t ya\u201d Jeice said admiring Alex\u2019s compassion. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well. In fact he actually is outside waiting for me so we can go on patrol right now. SO I gotta go. See ya Later Alex\u201d Jeice waves before walking off towards the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater Mr. Jeice\u201d Alex waves to his friend before proceeding downstairs via the stairs, passing by several people on the way until he finally arrived at the entrance of the hotel. He told the attendant that he was going out and that he was going to be going on a morning walk. The woman smiled and nodded then waved as Alex walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Alex was enjoying his morning walk before something caught his eye, an old man with long white hair and a black hat with a red bow insignia that had the initials RR on it stealthily walk into an abandoned alley. Curious Alex followed after the man only to see the man suddenly take off into the sky to Alex\u2019s amazement. He had seen Mr. Jeice and his partner Burter fly before but that was on rare occasions. This man seemed mysterious and Alex was bound determined to find out who he was and what he was up to. He quickly climbed the chain link fence in front of him and watched closely as the man flew in the sky unaware he was being followed. Soon after an hour of chase Alex arrived in the mountains of North City which were claimed highly dangerous due to nearly constant rock slides and weather. This however did not deter Alex as he pressed on, determination fueling him full of courage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Alex arrived at the top of the mountain and quickly hides behind a large boulder as the old man was stand only a few feet away, facing the rock wall. Alex looked on to see the old man move a piece of rock aside to reveal a small security device. The old man quickly imputes a code which Alex memorizes as 0020 the suddenly the rock wall before him begins to move away and reveals a cave to Alex\u2019s astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u201d Alex gaps out before suddenly the old man turns around and suddenly shoots out two twin lasers from his eye that pierce straight threw the rock Alex was hiding behind, thankfully Alex dodged the attack by ducking just as the lasers hit the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh whoever they were they\u2019re dead now\u201d the old man said emotionlessly before proceeding into the cave. As the old man was now in the cave the wall shut behind him as if they had never moved. Alex waited a few minutes before approaching the door and then typed in the code into the security device. Once more the door slide open like it did with the old man and Alex carefully proceeded inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside the complex Alex now found himself arriving at a large room with three pods each marked with a double digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c16\u202617\u2026and 18? Wonder what these are\u201d Alex thought aloud before he approached one of the containers and peers into the window on the container marked 18. To Alex\u2019s shock he finds a girl but it seems like she was dead or something as when Alex put his ear to the container he couldn\u2019t hear anything, not even a faint heart beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I see that little blast of mine didn\u2019t kill you. What a pest you humans are\u201d a familiar emotionless say as Alex turns his back to see the old man from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh sorry I thought this was the bathroom. My mistake\u201d Alex lies trying to get out of this situation but the old man didn\u2019t buy his excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow stupid do you think I am? You simply wandered into the cave after typing in the security code. Looks like I have to exterminate you\u201d the old man said as a he charges a ball of energy in his hand. Alex sweat drops in fear before the old man launches his attack at Alex only for Alex to jump out of the way and to hit the container much to the old man\u2019s shock and frustration. \u201cYou brat you\u2019ll pay for that\u201d the old man yells as he continues to blast at Alex as he runs down the hall. The blasts of energy hit the walls and cause a cave in cutting the old man off from Alex and vice versa.  The old man satisfied, thinking Alex was killed, turns back to the pods and begins to fix the container he had accidently shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side Alex groaned awake as the blast had sent him down into a secret basement area of which Alex soon decided to explore. Upon further exploration Alex found himself before a large incubator looking object that held in it what seemed like a fetus of some sort. Alex tapped at the glass a few times wondering if the thing inside would respond. After a few seconds Alex shrugged and turned his back to the creature as he looked at the large computer before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I\u2019ve never see such a huge computer before\u201d Alex said in awe as he approached that of the old man\u2019s super computer who was designed to create androids that would be used to destroy the world. His curiousity leading him on he pressed several buttons as several things flashed on screen. One window read in bright red color \u201cDanger! Releasing process activated! Project Cell will be awoken shortly!\u201d Alex didn\u2019t know what he had done so he kept pressing buttons hoping to stop his mistake but it just made things worse as another window popped up and read \u201cProtocol erased! Critical ERROR! DANGER! DANGER\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Alex, the creature inside the incubator was stirring. Its eyes flashed open as it looked around franticly before it laid eyes on Alex. Alex whirled around in shock to fond the incubator cracking. He rushed forward in a fruitless attempt to stop the inevitable but soon it broke as the creature along with the green fluid drenched Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Cough*cough* what the heck? Why does all this stuff have to happen to me\u201d Alex groaned as he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! What have you done\u201d shouted an angered but familiar voice! The old man had returned and this time he was pissed! \u201cMy creation! You\u2019ve destroyed it! GAH! I\u2019m going to rip you to pieces boy\u201d the old man shouted as he charged two balls of energy in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo please don\u2019t kill me. I don\u2019t want to die\u201d Alex cried out as he closed his eyes to his murderer. Suddenly something strange began to occur, on Alex\u2019s arm, under his sleeve there the fetus creature was before it suddenly shot out of Alex\u2019s arm and onto the old man much to his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026? No! You\u2019re suppose to absorb Androids 17 and 18 not me\u201d the old man cried before suddenly the fetus creature darted into the old man\u2019s mouth hand then quickly down his throat. Suddenly the creature began to undergo a strange sort of metamorphosis and then suddenly the old man exploded in a blast of energy. Alex fearing for his life opened his eyes to see a new being before him. It was about the same size as Alex who was the size of an average human kid and looked like a strange insect like monster. It had a needle tipped tall of which it wagged in the air. It\u2019s eyes were blood red and menacing but strangely enough the monster did not attack Alex but instead asked a kind hearted question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay\u201d it asked? Alex gulped in fear but then shoved away his fear and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alright. What\u2019s you name\u201d Alex asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the artificial life form know as Cell. I was created by Dr. Gero but that is all I know. You seemed to have somehow erased my former programming\u201d the creature explains. Alex smiles and then laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well than I guess I should thank you for saving me\" Alex says with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. But what do I do now? I have no programing to drive me and my creator only programed me for that one function\" Cell asked destrot?</span></div></div>",

Alex smiles largely much to Cell\u2019s surprise before he speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it! You can come live with me in north city\u201d Alex exclaims! Cell doesn\u2019t know what to think and shrugs. After all he didn\u2019t know much other than his own name and who created him. He figured it was best to go along with his new friend until he knew enough to live on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright than shall we get going\u201d Cell asked and Alex nodded before Cell began to levitate into the air much to Alex\u2019s shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa you can fly\u201d Alex cries in shock?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u201d Cell asks confused not realizing he was levitating? Cell quickly looks down to see that he was in fact flying much to his own shock and awe before he floated back to the ground. Alex was amazed and cheered as Cell looked at his hands and asked \u201cWhat other hidden powers do I possess?\u201d Alex smiled and walked up to Cell then patted him on the back with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever they are I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure them out together buddy\u201d Alex says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight well I guess we should get going now\u201d Cell asks and Alex nods before he once again begins to levitate only this time Alex was on his back as he couldn\u2019t fly. \u201cHold on tight\u201d Cell ordered before jetting off at incredible speed, out of the cave where he was born and into the wide open world. He marveled at the amazement and beauty of this new world as Alex laughs at being up so high. Cell stopping for a moment asks Alex where his home was and Alex quickly pointed out the large city below them. Cell quickly dive bombs much to Alex amazement that he could go so fast before soon landing in the middle of town, surprising several human citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that thing\u201d a scare woman citizen said scared of Cell\u2019s monstrous appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but call the Ginyu Force\u201d order another scare civilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Cell didn\u2019t know what to think and watched as the civilians paniced and ran away before suddenly a large muscular person with red hair arrived on seen. It was that of Recoome of the Ginyu Force. Recoome was one of the most powerful members of the Ginyu Force but he didn\u2019t know Alex so it made what was about to happen pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hello there Mr. Recoome. Sorry about the trouble but I was just on my way home wit-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up kid and get out of the way\u201d Recoome screams angrily as he uses his famous Recoome Kick to punt Alex aside, knocking the kid unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Alex\u201d Cell cries as he watches his friend fly then smash into a tree with enough force to break the tree along with several of Alex\u2019s ribs. Cell quickly tries to run over to Alex but is blocked by Recoome much to his frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going you little pest\u201d Recoome laughs before punching Cell in the chest. Cell to, Recoome\u2019s surprise, doesn\u2019t move but grunts a bit in pain. \u201cHuh what happened? That punch should have sent yah flyin\u201d Recoome asks confused before suddenly Cell shoots his tail out and stabs Recoome straight in the chest piercing one of his lungs. Recoome in response coughs up blood and gasps out an insult before successfully punt kicking Cell into the air. Cell recovers and floats in the air before Recoome charges at him with a vial murderous intent. Cell roars out in anger sending out a huge wave of hidden power, frightening Recoome enough for him to back off a few feet but not enough for him to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for hurting my friend! You think I\u2019m a monster well than I guess I\u2019ll be a monster! Now die\u201d Cell shouts as he puts his hands behind his back and begins to chant. Recoome realizing what was going to happen quickly charges at Cell while he chants. \u201cKa\u2026me\u2026hame\u2026\u201d Cell chanted as suddenly a blue light began to emit from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t\u201d Recoome yells as he punches at Cell only for cell to transport behind the muscle bound bastard and speak the last part of the chant before he flashed his hands forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHA!\u201d Cell yells unleashing a huge blast of blue energy at Recoome sending him flying into the air not to mention causing massive damage to him. Recoome soars high into the air out of view as Cell gasp for breath as the attack had taken its toll not only on Recoome but on Cell as well. Cell quickly descends to the ground where Alex laid unconscious as several other humans marvel in awe and fear at the destructive power the monster before them held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo even the mighty Recoome could stop that monster\u201d Cell looks at the humans before him and glares angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou humans are all the same! Pathetic and weak! Scared of the unknown and attack without rationality\u201d Cell insults \u201cYou sicken me!\u201d Cell then takes Alex in his arms and flies up into the air. Cell looks around and soon finds what humans call a hospital and flies off towards the nearest one. Back at the park the humans were stunned at the sight and were counting their blessings that they weren\u2019t dead when suddenly a large object came crashing down on the center of the park. In its wake a huge crater was formed. A curious human went to investigate and found that of Recoome who to an even great surprise was still alive and breathing! It seemed that the monster, be it very angry and evil looking, didn\u2019t take the life of his attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of town Cell had arrive at the hospital and received many of the same reactions from citizens as with those in the park. Cell groans annoyed and ignores them and entered the hospital. He receives much of the same reactions from patients and staff alike before he arrives at the front desk. The woman there stutters as she speaks, scared of Cell like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*sigh* why does this happen everywhere I go\u201d Cell sighs annoyed before looking the attendant dead in the eye and requesting her to treat Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo\u2026You want me to t..treat you friend\u201d the nurse stutters scared of what cell might do to her if she doesn\u2019t comply. The nurse reaches under her desk and presses a red button sending for security much to Cell\u2019s further annoyance. Cell sighs again and then dispatches the guards with his tail, knocking them unconscious, seeing as killing them more than likely would cause more trouble. \u201cNo human I will repeat myself once again. Heal my friend or I\u2019ll obliterate every single person her, starting with you\u201d cell demands and then Nurse can do nothing but accept and quickly shows Cell to a empty room with a hospital bed and TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief wait a doctor arrives at the room to treat Alex. His first thought is that he is being forced to do this and his second thought is to run away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d the doctor says as he takes out his stethoscope and listens to Alex\u2019s heart. He looks up to see Cell\u2019s glaring eyes and quickly jolts up in fear before cell sighs and tells him to continue. The doctor, after examining Alex for several minutes turns to cell and explains Alex\u2019s condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re friend here is in surprisingly good health. He seems to be suffering from a bit of cracking on his ribs. What happened exactly to cause such damage? Was he hit by a car or something\u201d the doctor asked Cell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was kicked by that huge monster Recoome or at least that\u2019s what I heard the humans in the park call him. Regardless will my friend be alright\u201d Cell asks? The doctor quickly replies lest he anger Cell any more than he already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe will make a full recovery; surprisingly he is the first person to ever survive a hit from the famous Recoome Kick. His ribs also seem to be healing rather quickly so he should be fine when he wakes up. Till then I suggest we just wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",
