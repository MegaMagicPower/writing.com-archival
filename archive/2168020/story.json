Johnny Mack has been tinkering away for 6 hours already, even though it wasn't even lunchtime yet. A few years back, Johnny began 'inventing' different gadgets and gizmos. The self-hammering hammer, the binocular eyeglasses, and the mail-fetching UAV were some of his less-successful inventions, but he was sure he had struck gold with his most recent development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man oh man, no one is going to believe me when I tell them what I've done this time,\" he said with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shed in the back yard of his family's home had, for all intents and purposes, been commandeered by Johnny to give him a safe place to work on his inventions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny Mack's Swap Shack,\" he said, looking at the pile of wires and computer terminals spread out in front of him. It looked like something out of a Hammer Bros horror flick. There were two barber chairs in front of Johnny, both had a headset with tubes, wires, and lights coming out of them. Off to the side, there was a computer terminal with all sorts of pictures and figures on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny had done it. He had set out to create a machine to help people understand one another. A sort of way to hasten the empathy process that so many people are reluctant to try. However, Johnny didn't realize his machine was not going to work as planned... like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis machine doesn't just help people understand each other, it literally gives the two subjects a first-hand experience at being the other person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as Johnny always had a knack for doing, he pressed on with his experiment, oblivious to what he had truly created. With a grin on his face and excitement in his eyes, he only had one question to ask himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who is going to help me reveal the greatest invention of all time?\"</span></div></div>",

If this works, world peace will be possible, he thought. And I'll be a billionaire! The very idea put a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping up the steps on the deck, he entered his home through the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooommmmm!\" He hollered through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down here, honey,\" she replied from the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny jog-walked to the door leading to the basement and slid down the banister, hopping off at the last second and landed gracefully on his feet. He turned the corner and saw his mother dutifully folding laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you're not going to believe it. It's going to work. It has to work. I've done all the calculations, crunched the numbers a thousand times. This is it. This is the real deal,\" Johnny said hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold your horses. What is going to work this time? The Razr phone that actually shaves your face while you talk,\" she quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, that would've worked. It isn't my fault the first person to try it out had a huge beard,\" Johnny said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That poor man... he would have never gotten that phone out of his beard if it wasn't for the barber shop down the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could tell her skepticism wasn't going to play well with his in-the-moment enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, mom. This is the last time. I promise. I made a machine that condenses a person's experience and transfers their understanding to another subject. In other words, this machine creates empathy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at Johnny through her glasses, arms folded, with one eyebrow raised. \"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes, mom. That's all I'm asking,\" said Johnny, hoping to get his mom to give him one more favor. \"This is a chance for people to understand one another more completely. With this machine, I could understand why you're so frustrated with my inventing blunders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and what are we going to do,\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...</span></div></div>",

You've got five minutes,\" she says, conceding to Johnny's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't regret this, I promise,\" he replied with a giant smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard that before...\" mom said, sounding slightly defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny lead the charge to the shed, with his mom walking behind him. It was clear this wasn't the first time Johnny had pleaded with mom for some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way through the back yard, Johnny noticed how bright the day was. The sky seemed bluer, the grass was greener, and everything just seemed like it was lined-up to go in Johnny's favor. He opened the door to the shed, and ushered his mother into the room that contained his latest experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...?\" he said, looking for his mom's approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quick to pick up on this,\"it looks... interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, mom. I know it doesn't look great right now, but I promise you it works. Shall we give it a shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure it's safe?,\" she questioned, rightfully so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word. Now, how would you like it if I understood and appreciated all the hard work you do for our family?\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, mom actually had a slight grin on her face. \"If this works, and you could do that, I'd be the happiest mother on earth,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sat his mother down in one of the barbershop-style chairs and placed the metallic sensors around her head. He then moved over to the computer terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... output from terminal one to terminal two... terminal two set to receive input... Output set to draw from this portion of subject A's brain... subject B will receive that here...\" he said outloud to no one in particular. \"Alright, mom. It's all set up. I'll just plug myself in and we'll be good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny hopped over some wires on the floor and plopped down on the seat next to his mom. He placed the sensors on his head, and looked over at his mother. She was giving him a reassuring look, which comforted him. Then, with great precision, Johnny initiated the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the process started, Johnny felt a slight tinge of electricity run through his head. The whirring of the fans cooling the system seemed to drown out all of the outside noise. The sounds of the system processing information seemed to get louder and louder, until finally Johnny felt like something was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision began to blur slightly, but he could tell something big was happening. Finally, when the system was reaching it's climax, all of the lights went out and the entire shed sounded like it had lost power. Johnny's head was spinning, he couldn't see anything and was wondering if he was just going through another failed experiment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jeez, looks like I'm still a failure,\" Johnny said. He quickly realized something was very wrong. That wasn't the sound of his voice. He tried cleared his throat several times, but each successful clear further drove home the feeling that something was way off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, are you okay?\" He tried saying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, is that you,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's eyes went wide. Recognized that voice. Of course he recognized that voice. For the last 17 years, that's been his voice. Getting up and stumbling over to the fuse box, Johnny had a sinking feeling about what had happened. Although he couldn't see it yet, he could feel his body moving in places that it shouldn't be moving, and clothes fitting in ways they shouldn't be fitting. Finally making it to the fuse box, Johnny flipped the blown fuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\" Carla and Johnny screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" Johnny's mom yelled. She began looking herself over, taking in all the new feelings from her current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know mom, there must have been an overload in the relay switch during the extraction process,\" Johnny tried explaining. \"The emergency shutdown unit must have purged all information it had gathered... but it purged it into the wrong bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean...\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we've switched bodies,\" Johnny finished for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swapped mother-son combo stared at each other in awe. Johnny couldn't believe the event that had just transpired. A moment ago, he was a budding scientist. Now, he was a 44-year old deep-chested woman. He took a few steps towards his old body, each movement further verifying that he was, in fact, in someone else's body. Each quiver, bounce, and jiggle of his mom's curves sent messages to his brain that he had never felt before. The tightness of the clothing, coupled with the added flesh and fat was sending his brain into overdrive. Just a few minutes ago, he was an in shape teen, but now his body has been replaced with that of a middle-aged, curvy mother of three:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess this is one way to experience someone else's life,\" Johnny tried to joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny! Be serious! I can't be my own son. What will Richard think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can't tell anybody. If this gets out, I'll be ostracized from the scientific community for life!\" Johnny pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we going to do, then?\" Mom asked, still clearly getting adjusted to her new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, give me a second. Maybe we can use the same process to change back?\" He suggested, clearly not sure of himself... herself... whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the computer terminal, Johnny noticed that everything looked fine. Other than the glaring mishap, it looks like the machine was otherwise unscathed. Maybe that means his programming actually worked exactly like it was supposed to, it was Johnny that had made the mistake when developing the software. This means that he didn't make a machine that helps aid in empathetic feelings, he made a machine that literally allows someone to walk a mile in another person's shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I think we'll be able to change back without any problems,\" he said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying you accidentally invented a body switching machine?!\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really looks that way,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Johnny began looking himself over. As a 17-year old, he knew he still had a lot to experience in life, but this was taking it to a whole 'nother level. He looked down, seeing that he was now wearing a green shirt, denim jacket, and blue jeans. Pretty casual wear. His mother's large bust was testing the fibers of the shirt. Wow, think of the possibilities now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do we do now?\" mom said, breaking the silence.</span></div></div>",

Want to try living each other's lives for a few hours, see how it is playing for the other team?\" Johnny suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I've always wanted to know a few things about the lesser sex. Think you can handle acting like your own mother for awhile?\" She asked, looking at her biceps as she flexed her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, as long as you don't act too weird in my body... like you can't just walk around checking it out constantly like that,:\" Johnny joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next few minutes giving each other a briefing on the ground rules. Johnny told mom not to go anywhere too public, like the mall. Mom told Johnny that there were still some chores that needed to be done around the house. Johnny let mom know she might be getting some texts later from some classmates. Mom warned Johnny about a coffee date she had with her sister later that afternoon, if they were still... like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you ready?\" Johnny asked, eyebrow raised, grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born ready. Or at least, I'm in the body of someone that was born ready,\" she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was still being overwhelmed by the alien sensations his mother's body was giving him. Her breasts especially would take some getting used to, the way they jiggled and moved on his chest. He couldn't how much bigger they seemed from a personal angle. \"Jeez these are heavy!\" he complained as he and his mother parted ways for a time. And then there was the distinct lack of 'equipment' between his legs. The fact that he had possessed the very vagina that he had come out of... kinda creeped him out just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... where's the vacuum kept?\" he shouted after her before she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the cupboard under the stairs sweetie, you should know that.\" his mother responded in 'his' voice. It was still weird seeing and hearing his own body through someone else's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't clean, mom.\" Johnny shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get used to it then if you're gonna be in my shoes for a bit.\" his voice sounded out, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Johnny grumbled in his feminine tone. His mother then disappeared outside for a time in her new teenage body, while Johnny set about continuing doing his mom's chores, which he wasn't exactly excited about. But maybe this would actually help their relationship a lot, understanding what the other person had to go through. That was the initial purpose of his machine after all, its just that it had a much more unique way of doing it than he would have ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging in the closet under the stairs, Johnny dragged the vaccum out and plugged it into the wall socket<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ha had planned was a slow day of doing the chores, and then maybe swapping back with his mom later. After all, he didn't want to remain in her body for too long. He was partly afraid his mom might not want to swap back after spending several hours in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" Johnny sighed, leaning over to turn on the switch, and having his huge breasts heave forward, barely supported by his bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy ladies,\" he said to himself, looking down at his breasts. \"You don't get to roam free until I say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vacuum whirred loudly as Johnny made his way through the living room. He lunge and thrust he made with the vacuum caused his body to jiggle. At one point he even banged his hip against come cabinets, mostly because he was still adjusting to the new... girth of his body. Ouch! Damn, mom. How do you control these hips? After a decidedly excellent job sweeping up, Johnny put the vacuum away, and turned on the radio in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Shadona's Immaculate Correction! I love this album,\" Johnny said aloud. Even though he used to roll his eyes every time his mom would blast this album while cleaning, it just felt right to pump it up while he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Johnny was starting to lose the initial shock of the change, and began to enjoy himself. Knowing how crazy this way, he felt like his only choice was to embrace it and see how it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, girls? You want to have a little fun?\" Johnny asked himself... or more accurately, his assets. He looked under the sink and grabbed a rag and some countertop cleaner and started to get to work. It took more effort than he remembered to scrub the counters. His mom's body just wasn't as strong as Johnny was used to. I guess it's all a matter of perspective, he said jokingly to himself. Each time he made the 'wax on, wax off' motion, he could feel his pudgy arms flap slightly. Small beads of sweat began to form on Johnny's brow. As he wiped them away, he ran his hands through is brownish-red hair. Even though it was poorly kept, Johnny enjoyed the feeling of the long hair on his neck and shoulders. It was heavy on his head, and definitely made the room seem warmer, but it just felt so... neat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Johnny put his hands on his wide hips. \"A job well-done,\" he said. He smiled to himself, proud of the work he had just accomplished. Achievement unlocked: Freaky Friday. Not really knowing what to do now, Johnny sat down at the kitchen table while he drank a glass of ice water to help cool off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, I guess it's time to get cleaned up, Johnny thought to himself. As he made his way up to the master bedroom, Johnny was relieved that his father, now husband, was out of the house running errands. He was sure it was only a matter of time before they had to come clean about what had happened, but for now, he was going to be able to get his bearings in his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the master bath was connected to the master bedroom where Johnny was getting his clean clothes, so he was able to get his bearings without encountering Jack, Cindy, or his mother. He walked over to the dresser and opened the top right drawer to grab a pair of black, cotton underwear and a black bra. The drawer below contained some blouses, so he picked out a dark purple blouse to wear, and finally, Johnny walked to the closet to grab a pair of black shorts. With his clothes collected, he entered the bathroom and began to strip down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny began stripping down, peeling off his t-shirt and shorts, leaving himself in just panties and a bra. Reluctantly, he knew what needs to be done now. He unclasped the back of his bra, letting his boobs hang freely in the air. It almost seemed like the more Johnny experienced being in his mother's body, the larger they felt. He pulled his panties over his new bulbous ass, standing in the nude. Johnny looked down at myself, astounded by how much his life had changed in just the last few hours. Admittedly, the fabric which felt foreign against his skin last night felt quite nice today. Johnny slipped the underwear down each leg, and once he was no longer protected by his clothing, he took an eye-full of myself. Holy smokes, mom. These things are huge! You might want to start watching that waist line, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny turned the water on and waited for it to warm up. While waiting, he looked down at his chest. Johnny had seen plenty of sets of breasts in his short life, but this vantage point was truly something else. What blew his mind was how large they were. I mean, before we had swapped, I knew that she had some honkers, but actually having them on my body was a completely different experience. They looked so much larger from up here. His nipples were several inches wide to boot. Johnny cupped his breasts, and thought to himself, 'how are my ladies doing today'. The idea of having a pet name for his boobs put a grin on his face. Then, he notice just how sensitive the areolas were, it sent slight pulses throughout his breasts and up my shoulders to the back of his head. It looks like there are going to be some definite perks to becoming a middle-aged woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steam started to collect in the bathroom, so Johnny figured it was time to get in. The water felt great cascading down his body. There were some definite perks to this switch, he thought. He went through the normal routine, washing his hair, using the loofah the scrub his body, shaving his legs (with only a few minor cuts), which was much easier than Johnny had anticipated. It was almost like this body was going on autopilot for some of these things. When he finished up, Johnny stood in the shower for a few minutes and just relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny knew what came next as he stepped out of the shower and put on his underwear. It was snug against his bottom, and pinched the fat around his abdomen slightly. He pulled his shorts up after that, buttoned them down, which took some extra effort. The bra was next. Taking it off to shower was a relief, one that Johnny didn't want to end so soon. Alas, it had to be done. He put it on backwards, snapped the clasps together, then spun it around. Then, he put each of his flabby arms through the shoulderstraps and plopped each breast into their respective cup. After tightening down the shoulder straps, Johnny looked in the mirror. 'Hmm', he thought to himself, 'maybe just a little more lift for the ladies today'. He shortened up the straps a little more until he was satisfied with the job he had done with his boobs.Finally, Johnny rolled on some deodorant, pulled on his shirt, and braced himself to face his new, temporary family, but not before taking one last peek at his cleavage. And with that, Johnny decided to tackle this new experience head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little pep in his step, Johnny made his way downstairs. He felt the jostle of his breasts with each movement. Luckily, the bra was tremendously helpful. This was all such a surreal experience, and Johnny halfway expected to wake up any moment. He knew better though, and figured he may as well accept his new, temporary reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo... err, Johnny!\" he called out, correcting himself. He waited, expecting a reply any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none came...</span></div></div>",

Looking at the counter in the kitchen, Johnny saw a note that read:<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMom, ran out for a minute. Be back soon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace-palming, Johnny couldn't, or rather didn't want to, believe that his mother would do this to him. He felt completely stranded, and immediately was very self-conscious of his surroundings. He was officially all alone, in his mother's body, and nobody knew besides them. His mind began racing, thinking of what to do next. Should he trust his mother? Should he panic? What was going to happen? What if she died, leaving him stranded in her body for the rest of his life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Johnny tried to settle down. Panicking was no solution to this conundrum. He looked down at his chest, isn't that right, ladies. He figured if his mom was going to enjoy herself, he may as well try to do the same. With that, Johnny grabbed the keys to his mom's car and decided on hitting up the mall. He know had her wallet, which meant it was time for a little retail therapy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive over was mostly uneventful. Johnny was already a proficient driver, but it was a little strange doing it from the vantage point of his mother's body. Stepping out of the car, Johnny felt a rush of butterflies in his stomach. He was about to be out in public, and everyone thought he was just some middle-aged woman. Where to first, he thought, walking through the various stores. There was the food court, the movies, video game stores, and clothing stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way through, picking up a couple used video games, enjoying the credit card he had commandeered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Picking that up for your son?\" the cashier asked when he saw the copy of Death Kill V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that,\" Johnny replied with a smirk. He was actually enjoying pulling of this ploy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly walking through the stores, Johnny's eye caught something that he didn't expect. He saw a sundress in the window of a clothing store that seemed to be calling his name. He was never really interested in shopping for clothes before, but there was just something about it that made him want to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe perused his options, and ultimately decided to give it a shot. He grabbed the dress off the rack and made his way to the women's dressing room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in Rome, Johnny thought, finally understanding what that phrase actually meant. Grabbing the dress, he made his way back to the dressing room, remember to enter the female's entrance rather than the male's side. His heart fluttered at the thought of this new experience and he was excited to \"get away\" with entering the women's dressing room. The door creaked open, and Johnny fumbled with the lock as he secured the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung the dress on the hook on the backside of the door as he sized up his situation. There was a full-length mirror opposite the door, which would allow him to see the new clothing in full view. There was still something a little odd about seeing his mother's reflection, something that gave him a pang of guilt about using her body this way. On the other hand, she had no problems leaving without telling Johnny what she was doing, so he ultimately didn't let that deter him from the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weird swap shack is really something else, he mused as he began taking off his shirt. He pulled from the bottom and as he tugged it over his head, he could feel his breasts sandwich together. Next, Johnny unbuttoned his pants by cinching around the top button, which made his muffin top ride slightly over the waist. As soon as the back of his jeans made it over his large ass, the pants came off easily. He stood there momentarily in his underwear before turning around to look at himself in the mirror. Even though it was his own mother's body, the sight of a women in just her bra and panties was a great sight for Johnny. He couldn't believe this was his body. Johnny took two steps over to the dress to inspect it, and he noticed it had a built-in bra. Noting this, he decided it would be best to try it on completely topless. He struggled at first, but was finally able to undo the clasps of his bra. The relief on his shoulders felt wonderful as his breasts hung there completely unsupported. That's more like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the dress off the hanger and figured that it would be easiest to just pull it over his head. It slipped on simply, and as he smoothed it out over his stomach and hips, a smile came across his face. It was nice trying on new clothes. Finally, he lifted his boobs into their respective spots in the dress, noticing that the built-in bra hardly was enough for his massive mamaries. Satisfied with the way his dress looked from his perspective, he spun around quickly to see himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah, mama, he thought... literally. She looked wonderful. The design was fantastic, and the way the dress conformed to her curvy body was spectacular. This is great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Johnny took off the tag, grabbed his clothes and made his way to the cashier to make his purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk on his face, he said, \"I'll be wearing this out today.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cashier chuckled as she rung up Johnny. He handed her his credit card and was on his way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easy enough, Johnny mused to himself. Frankly, he was starting to enjoy himself, even if it was still bizarre being inside his own mother's body. He figured if the machine put them in this situation, it'd be able to switch them back, right? After strolling through the mall for another fifteen minutes, he decided it was time to head on home. Small doses, he reminded himself. He didn't want to risk too much out and about on his first trip in the mature body of a 44-year old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of the mall, he could feel the warm sun on his face, chest, and legs, which were all exposed due to his recent change in wardrobe. The dress felt liberating, but made him slightly selfconscious. He knew that he was pudgier than the other women, which he wished he could fix. His thighs rubbed against each other as he made his way to the car. The sway of his breasts was becoming more and more normal, hardly noticeable at this point even without the support of a traditional bra. Johnny looked down, and smirked at the ample cleavage his dress showed off. He weighed his options, and decided it was better to be a little bit bigger if it meant he was going to have his womanly curves. Better than those twigs over there, he thought as he saw a group of younger, thinner women walk by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny climbed into the car, taking time to ease his legs into the seat so he didn't give any passer-bys a free look up his dress. With the seatbelt secured, he shifted into drive and made his way back to the house. Meetwood Flack was on the radio, which really struck a chord with him for some reason. Jamming out momentarily, Johnny was really beginning to enjoy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the short drive, he arrived at home and noticed that all the other cars were still gone, which was a bit of a relief to him, as he wasn't sure if he would be able to continue the muse quite yet. He walked up the house and unlocked the front door. After placing his clothes in the hamper, he grabbed a glass of water to cool off. Moving about in this hot weather was much more trying when compared to his former body. Speaking of which, I wonder where mom is right now, he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no trace of her in the house, and he hadn't heard from her since she took off earlier that day. He shot her a quick text message that just said 'wuts your 20' and sat down to cool off and wait for a reply. Just when he was getting comfortable, Johnny heard a familiar sound...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door was creaking open, which was followed by a quick thud when it shut behind whoever was in the house. Johnny's heartbeat raced as he realized this was his first time having to interact with someone he knew while in his mother's body. Oh man, what should I do... I know, just a natural, he thought... not actually knowing what natural would be in his current situation. He laid quietly on the couch, waiting for whoever it was to enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you there,\" he heard from the foyer. Johnny quickly ID'd the voice as his father Richard. Just great, he thought while trying to remain cool. Johnny doubled down and resolved to play the hand he was dealt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here, Richard,\" he said, even convincing himself. Moments later, Richard came in the room, still dressed in his work slacks and button-up shirt. Knowing his mother always welcomed Richard with a hug, Johnny forced himself to stand and greet his father. He walked up to him and gave him a hug, wrapping his arms around Richard's neck. The feeling of his breasts pressing against Richard's chest was off-putting, as was the feeling of his own father's arms rubbing his lower-back. Richard moved in to give his wife a kiss, but Johnny pulled back at the last second, so he was only able to land a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day? Anything exciting happen?\" Richard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exciting? Here? Never,\" Johnny said, almost laughing to himself. \"Just spent a little quality time in the shed with your son. You know, making scientific breakthroughs and whatnot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scientific breakthroughs, huh? Sounds like par for the course around here,\" Richard jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's quite the prodigy, you know. I think he's really going to change the world,\" Johnny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way or another, I suppose,\" Richard retorted. \"I'm wiped out, today was brutal. I'm going to head upstairs to clean up. Sorry to be so short, I'll give you some more attention when I finish up,\" he said with a twinkle in his eye that frankly made Johnny a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, honey,\" he managed to reply, shuttering slightly at the thought. Richard bound up the stairs to the master bathroom, again leaving Johnny alone in the living room. At that moment, he felt his phone vibrate with a new message, which read:<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nShack. Problem. Come now.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just when it seemed things couldn't move any faster, Johnny immediately shot to the back yard to make sure things were going to be okay. Panting slightly upon arrival, Johnny opened the back door of the shack to see his body standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know... I just came back here and found it like this,\" Carla said holding a few tattered wires and broken headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's heart immediately sank. \"What... how...\" was all he could manage. He knew this spelled trouble. Without the machine in operating form, there was no way to switch back with his mother. That meant that for the foreseeable future, they were stuck this way. That meant that for now, Johnny was stuck in his mother's body. With her long hair. With her wrinkles. With her large, sagging breasts. With her pudgy fingers and arms. With his wide hips. All of it, for better and for worse was his for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What are we going to do?\" He managed to squeak in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't tell anyone. Richard would kill me if he knew I helped you experiment on us. He might even leave me!\" Carla said, almost coming to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about school? What about Elizabeth? What about my youth?\" Johnny said, beginning to panick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Carla said, yelling at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a wave of emotion wash over him as he was overwhelmed by his body's hormones. This was something he had never felt before, and it was almost tearing him apart. His eyes watered as his head sank down. Carla clearly got the message as she slowly walked up to her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm sorry, Johnny. I didn't mean to yell. We'll figure this out. You're brilliant, you can fix it,\" she said, rubbing his back in an attempt to soothe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny admittedly felt better after hearing that, and appreciated the confidence his mother had in him. \"Y'know what, mom. You're right. We can do this. I'll just pretend to be you and you can pretend to be me until I figure this out. Dad is about to get out of the shower, so we're going to need to go inside and start acting the parts, but I'll be out here first thing in the morning when he goes to work so we can fix this problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got this, son. I've got your back,\" Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Literally,\" Johnny joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mismatched pair walked back into the house with a new resolve, though Johnny still wondered what could have possible happened to the machine in the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door to the house, Johnny did his best to put on a smile in order to maintain the guise he so desperately wanted to shed. His mind was racing with hundreds of questions. What about dinner? What about dad? How long will this last? Can I tell anyone? Should I tell anyone? Try as he might, Johnny's mind kept playing out worst case scenarios where he was stuck in mom's body forever. He shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla could see the worry on Johnny's face and gave his hand a reassuring squeeze. \"Just breath. I'll order pizza for dinner,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny doubled-down his resolve, knowing that his mom was depending on him to keep it together. \"No worries, Johnny, I'll call 'em up,\" he said in his best 'mom-voice' while giving Carla a wink. She smiled back meekly, knowing this wasn't going to be a walk in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny called up the local pizza parlor and ordered up some chow for the food. He rummaged briefly through his new purse, finding enough cash to cover dinner and leave a decent tip. With all the logistical issues dealt with, he just needed to prep himself for an evening interacting with the family. That's when he heard Richard start working his way downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe the day I had,\" Richard said, turning the corner into the kitchen. \"Some really freaky stuff happened at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" Johnny said laughing on the inside at his little joke. Richard went on to tell the the pair about how things played out at work today, which lead to some decent breakthroughs on his most recent research. \"Which is great, but that just means I'll be working longer hours tomorrow,\" he concluded. Johnny was admittedly happy to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have dinner on the way here. I'm going to get into some lounging clothes and join you two back down here in just a few minutes,\" Johnny said, looking for a reason to leave for a moment. He bounded upstairs, feeling his breasts bounce from side-to-side. He quickly changed into a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, being sure to keep on your bra for the time being.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Johnny was upstairs, Carla was downstairs enjoying herself in her son's body. From her point of view, there was no way Richard would ever be able to figure out what had happened between the mother and son. She sat back, enjoying her new-found energy and chatted up 'dad', grinning at how she was 'getting away' with something. She heard Johnny stirring upstairs, and again grinned at the thought of a teenage boy fuddling around in a grown woman's body. He'll be fine, she thought to herself, knowing good and well that Johnny was feeling very awkward in this situation. The only thing Carla was the least bit concerned with was the sleeping arrangement for that night, but she was sure that would work itself out too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny slowly trudged down the steps, trying not to let the frown on his face be too apparent. He briefly stopped to take another look in the mirror, and was greeted by a haggard face and a wild mane of copper and grey hair. Chin up, for mom he told himself. He did appreciate how comfortable his new attire was. Frankly, it was almost painful how tight his jeans were, so the freedom of his sweatpants made for a much more enjoyable walk. He quickly checked out his behind, which looked pretty good all things considered. He could see the faint outline of his panties, and the bubble-butt he had was nice and round. Turning the corner, Johnny saw his body talking candidly with Richard about what his plans were for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, dad, I'll probably just futz around in the back shack all day. You know, classic Johnny, just wanting to tinker with my science stuff all the time.\" The words almost made Johnny physically cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Carla?\" Richard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do my typical mom things. Nothing weird about tomorrow for me. I'll just do laundry, clean the house, and watch soap operas all day because that's all I do around here,\" Johnny said, trying to jeer Carla a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt apparently worked, because Johnny saw his old body shooting him a pretty scathing glare. \"I think you mean you'll have your hands full with the house tomorrow, right mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny took the cue. \"You betcha, Johnny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in the air was palpable at this point, but luckily a knock came at the door. Phew, thought Johnny. He stood up and saw the pizza delivery car through the window. Grabbing his mother's purse, he found some cash and made the transaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ms. Mack,\" said the delivery driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was so distracted that he didn't even realize it was his friend Paul that had delivered the pizza. \"Oh, hey Paul,\" said Johnny, not very enthused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell Johnny to hit me up sometime soon. I've got that software he was looking for, the problem is it'll be gone soon if he doesn't pick it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny gave Paul his best 'mom-smile' and told him he would relay the message. Oh shit, Paul must be talking about the synaptic image relay program I had been asking for. I could really use that right now. Making a mental note, Johnny carried the chow into the kitchen while the three of them feasted. All conversations halted and were replaced with the sound of a chewing family. After it was all said and done, Richard broke the silence, letting them know he was going to bed early since he had such a long day. Johnny was very relieved to hear this, considering his apprehension with sharing a bed with his own father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was just about to start up the stairs when he turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot.\" He moved in with cunning and speed of the likes Johnny had never seen or noticed before. Before there was time to react, Richard was mouth to mouth with his wife's body. As soon as the kiss had started, it was over. And even though it was very brief, it felt like an eternity to Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla stood there open-mouthed for a moment after Richard had left, and then erupted with laughter. \"Excellent job, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, don't call me that. Dad's gone, and I'm still Johnny... even if this is what I look like,\" he said, motioning to his current late-40's female frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't take it so seriously. You did great,\" she quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do now,\" Johnny said.</span></div></div>",

But hold up, before we go, let's game plan a little for tomorrow. What do I need to know about your morning routine and dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question. Richard's alarm is going to go off pretty early tomorrow. He'll do his best to quietly get ready for work, but he's like a bull in a china shop, so don't expect to be able to sleep through it,\" she said, chuckling slightly. \"After he's ready, he'll kiss you when he's leaving. At that point, I want you to come get me, and we're going straight to the back shack to figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it clicked with Johnny, \"wait, there's one more thing. You know my friend Paul? He was searching around for a program that is basically just an algorithm to help smooth over the analysis of synapses of two different subjects, while finding common threads to aid in the transfer of those synapses in binary code.\" Carla stood there with an eyebrow raised, making sure Johnny knew she had no idea what he was talking about. \"Bottom line, it could really be helpful in us finding a way back to our real bodies. I need you to go to Paul's tomorrow morning to get that software and bring it back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Get the software. Bring it back. Switch back into my real body. Sounds like a piece of cake. All we've got to do is survive until tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done, mom,\" said Johnny, really not looking forward to his sleeping arrangement. The mismatched pair then made their ways to their appropriate bedrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was finally alone in Johnny's bedroom. She stripped down from her clothes and fumbled through his dresser until she found a pair of gym shorts and a t-shirt to wear to bed. Once topless, she admired the fact that she had a flat stomach and that her shoulders didn't ache from carrying around those large breasts all day. Upon further observation, she pulled forward her underwear and inspected the bulge that had been between her legs all day. So this is why Richard is always scratching himself, she mused with a grin. Once she turned off the light and covered herself with blankets, she took a little time to investigate the opposite sex's more sensual feelings. Her hand rubbed up and down her crotch and she felt her member harden. It felt new and exciting to Carla, as she increased the pressure and speed at her task at hand. This continued for a few moments, with waves of pleasure pulsating through her body. The excitement of being young, fit, and sexually active was making her hornier and hornier. She continued this until it peak at its fruition. She felt her unit erupt as her legs and back went rigid with pleasure. As soon as it had come, it had subsided. Carla felt remarkably guilty about her actions while in her son's body as she cleaned herself up. Not wanting to admit or face what she had done, she quickly went back to bed and closed her eyes, wondering slightly how Johnny was faring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the hall, Johnny was in the master bathroom brushing his teeth, having rolled his eyes about 10 times thinking about how shitty his night was going to be. Mom's got this way easier. She's all alone in my room. She's just got to go to sleep and not deal with anyone. I've got dad right next to me. This is the worst, he thought. Knowing his mother didn't sleep with a bra on, Johnny took to the task of removing the one he was currently wearing. His hands met behind his back as he fumbled with the clasp. He bit his bottom lip as two of the three clips came undone. C'mon... just one more, he thought to himself, almost arguing with a garment. As the last clip came undone, Johnny felt his pendulous breasts drop a few inches while the immense pressure on his shoulders subsided. He let out an audible sigh of relief as he pulled his arms out of each of the straps. Taking a moment, Johnny looked at himself in the mirror as he reached a hand up to one of his pink areolas. At first he was nervous, but once he started rubbing it slowly, his nerves quickly went away. It felt good, like really good. In fact, Johnny noted how his nipple was now erect, and much more rigid than it was just a moment ago. He even cupped both breasts together with his hands. Holy cow, mom, you've got such a huge set. Before getting too carried away, Johnny decided to slip his shirt back on, which felt wonderful against his bare breasts. Sliding his sweat pants off, he took a quick look at his new female anatomy. Apparently, Carla liked to keep a clean yard downstairs, which Johnny was happy to see. It was so different than his former body's unit. The slit was larger than he had anticipated, and upon further inspection, felt really wonderful when touched in just the right way. His fingers ran up one side and down the other before massaging this middle of his new... Johnny quickly shook his head when he realized what was happening. He pulled his underwear up and quietly slipped into bed, doing his best not to disturb and wake-up Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, Johnny did his breast... err, best not to be distracted by all the new sensations of his body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbeep beep beep Johnny heard from the nightstand on the opposite side of the bed. Ugh, turn that off, he thought with a sleep-induced lethargy. He could feel a heavy, hairy arm wrapped around his midsection. What on earth, he thought, still not fulling remembering what was going on. He made a move to grab the hand on his stomach, when he accidentally brushed by his breasts. His eyes immediately shot open, as a small burst of adrenaline snapped him out of his sleepy slumber. It was too late though, he had already grabbed his father's hand, who in turn interpreted is as an invitation to cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're awake early, beautiful,\" Richard said as he went 'big spoon' on Johnny. It was so incredibly awkward feeling his father snuggle up to his rump like that. \"Unfortunately, I really don't have time to canoodle this morning. Work beckons,\" Richard explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief washed over Johnny as he feigned sleep for the next 20 minutes while his father gallivanted around their bedroom half-naked while humming to himself, opening and closing doors, and stumbling around the room. Mom wasn't joking, thought Johnny. Finally, after what felt like hours of torture, Richard pecked Johnny on the cheek, slapped his ass, and made his way out the door.</span></div></div>",

I thought that would never end,\" Johnny said to himself. \"Well, let's get this operation underway.\" He slinked out of bed and slipped on a pair of loose fitting jeans. He didn't really understand why mom would wear such tight clothing, but he was glad he was able to find something a little more comfortable. Much better, he thought. Next up was getting a bra and shirt. Johnny pulled out a black cotton bra from mom's dresser, assuming it would fit. He looked down at the tag... 36F, jeez mom, that's ridiculous! He spun it around and fixed the clasps first, the spun it backwards so he could put his arms through the loops. Finally, he adjusted each of his boobs into the cups. The process was getting easier and easier, Johnny admitted to himself. He slipped on a v-neck turquoise shirt and a loose fitting jacket, then made his way down the hall. Opening the door to his room, he saw that Carla was already dressed and ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can handle Paul,\" Johnny said, clearly focused on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck,\" Carla replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's do this,\" said Johnny as he turned to make his way to the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla hopped into the family car with zeal. She hadn't slept that well in years, nay decades! Something about the hormones or the fitness or something just made her feel wonderful. She zipped over to Paul's, which was just a few blocks away, hoping he was already awake after working the closing shift last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny walked back to the shack, hoping things weren't too much of a mess. He scanned the area, noting some hardware that could be easily replaced, and breathing a sigh of relief for having made copies of all the original software. That last piece of programming from Paul should make this a breeze, he mused while cleaning up the mess out back. But who could've or would've done this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla knocked on Paul's door as the tired teenager answered. \"Hey man, you here for the CD?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. yeah... bro,\" Carla said, doing her best teen impersonation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this was not an easy task. You promise you'll pay up,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally,\" she said, flatly, not wanting to know what the agreement was for. Carla grabbed the disc and made her way back to the house. Bounding to the back yard, disc in hand, she saw Johnny working diligently on prepping the machine. When she entered the door, she saw the expression on Johnny's face that said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The damage wasn't nearly as substantial as I had initially anticipated,\" Johnny said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we can change back now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile left Johnny's face as he explained. \"Well... I mean, we can try, but the results may be unpredictable. I might initiate the sequence, and we could be right as rain... or we might end up in a worst scenario... what if we also switched memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, here's the CD Paul had. Will it help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, absolutely. I mean, it'll facilitate whatever the ultimate outcome is going to be. Does that make sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll pave the path... whatever that may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Johnny said, uploading the new programming to his freshly assembled hardware. \"You ready to rock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla answered by simply plopping down in the chair adjacent to Johnny. Johnny made his adjustments to the hardware, while his heartrate increased with the prospect of finishing this wild experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\" said Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\" they simultaneously spoke while Johnny his the start button. Everything flashed and whirred as the computer began its work. He could feel a slight tinge of electricity run through his body. He looked over at his mother, who had an expectant look on her face. Johnny didn't know what was going to happen, but it was going to happen soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That's when the familiar jolt ran through their bodies. It hit them with a synchronized force. Everything went dark for the pair and the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUghhh, my head, Johnny thought as he rubbed his eyes. The throbbing in his temples was a brutal reminder that he was playing with untested experiments. He eked open one of his eyes, but his vision was still blurry from the pain surging through his body. He could only make out a few shapes as he tried to figure out what had happened. Oh shit, did we actually switch back? he thought hopefully. His other eye opened, but he was still having trouble putting together his surroundings. He knew it felt similar to the first time he and his mother had used the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, are you okay,\" he heard from nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately his heart sank. He knew that voice. He had that voice for 17 years. While his vision cleared, he knew that they hadn't been able to switch back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I think so. My head is killing me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I guess it didn't work,\" Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's safe to say,\" Johnny said as he immediately began tinkering around with the computer to inspect what went wrong. Just a few moments into his inspection, he found himself having difficulty remember exactly what type of programming he needed to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, do mind taking a look at this. My head must still be jolted from the last round,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, mom. Let me take a peek,\" Carla replied from Johnny's body as she hopped over to the laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stood there stunned with his head and mind still reeling over what had just transpired. He watched attentively as Carla typed furiously on the keyboard. He saw familiar looking code scroll up and down the monitor, but couldn't quite translate it quick enough to fully understand what she was going for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment of clarity, Johnny grasped at the conversation they had just before the second run of the machine. What if we switch memories, he remembers saying. Only he didn't say it. He remembers being told it was a possibility. Then, without any warning, he felt remarkably flushed and exhausted, as one might be with this type of situation. Johnny knew he needed to sit down, and since it didn't look like Carla needed any of his help. he decided to plop down in the chair next to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slumped, he felt his breasts rest peacefully on top of his muffin top, which was lazily lying over the waist of his jeans. He leaned back, feeling the crotch of his pants ride up near the void between his legs. Rather than feeling uncomfortable, Johnny just accepted it as normal. He knew that at his age, the body was no longer the Garden of Eden it had been decades ago. That's when his exhaustion hit full steam. Try as he might, Johnny felt his eyes slam shut as he passed out... perhaps in an attempt to evade the inevitable horrible situation in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I don't know what to tell you right now. I just worked on this thing for an hour, but all I can tell is that switching back might be possible, but there's not going to be any guarantees it'll work,\" Johnny heard his former body say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his eyes, Johnny felt significantly better after that little power nap. This body-switching business is exhausting he thought to himself. He looked over the adjustments that Carla had made while he was asleep, but couldn't make heads or tails of what he was looking at. Scratching his scalp, Johnny frowned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now,\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you head inside. Dad should be home soon, so you should prep some dinner. It won't be hard, just check the freezer for something easy to heat up,\" Carla said. \"I'll be out here working on this contraption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was afraid you'd say that. Johnny got himself out of the chair. He needed to adjust his bra, as things had come a little loose during his nap. As he made his way into the house, he had to wipe away a few strands of hair that had matted to his forehead. His weathered hands felt rough against his wiry hair, but he was quickly becoming accustomed to the feel. Once he was inside, Johnny was greeted by a blast of ice cold A/C. He felt his nipples erect as his areolas tighten slightly in goosebumps. Johnny looked down and noticed that he could even see them through his bra and his shirt. Hello, ladies he mused with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the pantry, Johnny saw that they had plenty of pasta, as well as enough veggies to make some homemade sauce, so he quickly went to slicing and dicing tomatoes, garlic, peppers, and mushrooms. He tossed them all in a pan with some olive oil and set it to a simmer. He then grabbed the pasta and added it to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt. After the pasta had boiled for about ten minutes, he added it to the pan of sauce. Satisfied with a job well done, Johnny lowered the temperature on the pan to low, grabbed a glass of wine, and sat down to relax for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to a stool next to the kitchen island, he felt the cool white wine go down smoothly. It made his stomach feel a little warm, and as the feeling moved up his body, Johnny realized he hadn't used the restroom in quite some time so he went to the half-bath adjacent to the dining room. Once there, Johnny unbuttoned his pants and only had a small difficulty pulling them over his bulbous ass. Before pulling down his cotton panties, Johnny looked back, admiring the shelf-ass he now donned. Bigger is better, huh he thought coquettishly. He then sat down to do his business, resting his elbows on his plump thighs. It felt... different than he expected, but not nearly as foreign than he anticipated. As he finished up, he grabbed a few pieces of TP and cleaned up after himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny pulled his pants back up, washed his hands, and checked his reflection in the mirror one time to make sure everything was in place. When he left the bathroom, he was greeted by Richard.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi, honey! How was your day,\" Richard asked with a big grin on his face as he placed his keys and wallet on the end table in the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing exactly how to answer, considering Johnny had spent the last 36 hours in his mother's body, he managed put on a smiling face and walk gracefully over to Richard. \"Oh, today has been pretty nondescript. Johnny is out back fiddling around with his machine. He thinks he might get it working later today,\" Johnny managed to say, half-wishing your white lie would become true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to give it to him, he's dedicated,\" Richard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedicated? You'd have him committed if you knew what was going on Johnny thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for dinner, it smells delicious,\" Richard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny explained that he had made some penne with a homemade garlic-tomato sauce with a little andouille. As he walked over to still the sauce, Richard came up from behind and hugged Johnny. Johnny could feel Richard's breath on the back of his neck as his hands went around Johnny's plump stomach. \"I've always loved your cooking,\" Richard said. Before things could get much worse for a very uncomfortable Johnny, Carla busted in through the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, dad!\" She chirped from her son's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard let go of Johnny and greeted his presumed son. \"Perfect timing, mom was just saying that dinner is almost ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tinge of worry on her face, Carla acknowledged, and began to wash her hands in preparation for dinner. The trio finally made it down to the table, just as someone opened their mouth to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sat at the table as she watched her former body masterfully maneuver through the kitchen, making the final preparations to the meal. She hoped and prayed Johnny made something palatable, but didn't count on it. As Johnny placed a glass dish containing the pasta and sauce, Carla was pleasantly surprised by how good everything smelled. Woah, smells awesome she mused. Johnny proceeded to spoon out servings to Richard, then Carla, and finally his own plate. Johnny removed the apron he had donned to make dinner, folding it neatly onto the counter next to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Johnny walked over, he noted that Richard and his former body had already started digging in. \"Where are you manners, gentlemen,\" he cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly, Carla stopped eating. She didn't know what had come over her, but the sight of the food gave her an instinctual need to begin eating. \"Sorry, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, honey,\" Richard said. \"So, Johnny, mom says you've made some great progress today out back. What's the details?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny froze at the mention of the swap shack. He had completely forgotten about Carla fixing it, which was slightly disconcerting, considering how strongly he knew he needed to return to his body. On pins and needles, he waited to hear Carla explain what progress, if any, had been made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla collected her thoughts, knowing that Richard had no idea she was sitting in her son's body at this very moment. She immediately felt self-conscious of her flat chest, hairy arms, and the new member between her legs. Coughing slightly, she manged to explain that there were a few programming errors that she hoped to correct before the end of the day. \"Honestly, I can't believe this was an issue in the first place. It all became so clear once I reevaluated the coding syntax.\" Johnny shot Carla an icy glare, knowing good and well she was throwing shade his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's wonderful! Any chance we'll see a test run anytime soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you give me a few more hours back there tonight, I might just deem it ready for testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard and Carla went back and forth about how exciting this was, hardly making time to converse with Johnny, leaving him completely out of the conversation. The trio finished their meals as Richard was escorted to the back shack, leaving Johnny stranded again in his mother's body, along with a kitchen full of dirty dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for everything, mom Johnny resentfully thought to himself as he collected the dishes and began cleaning up after the family. It only took about 20 minutes to wash the dishes and wipe down the surfaces. Johnny sipped on another glass of wine as he finished the task. Finally satisfied, he figured he may as well get more comfortable, considering his tight pants and bra weren't exactly the most liberating of clothing options he had.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny trudged up the stairs, back sore from carrying around his pendulous breasts all day. He unbuttoned his pants and pulled them over his ass and pulled his shirt over his head. He unclasped the hooks on the back of his bra, feeling his breasts immediately sag with their new liberation. Oh my god, so much better. He grabbed a loose-fitting, ratty t-shirt from the dresser, as well as a pair of cotton shorts. Putting them on, he made his way back downstairs. His breasts swayed and bounced much more than before, but the relief his back felt was totally worth the awkwardness.Those boys can just deal with it, he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny made it downstairs, he was greeted by his old body, sporting an enthusiastic, enormous grin. He raised an eyebrow as if to say 'is it finally ready?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Johnny cooed in the soft timbre of a mature woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for one last try, mom?\" Carla asked from her son's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was admittedly excited about the prospect of returning to his real body, but he was a little nervous. \"You know, the last time we tested the device, I've felt like I've been taking on your personality. What if this time we don't even remember switching? What if I think I'm actually you? What you believe you are really me? What if it only happens to one of us, leaving the other stranded? What are we going to tell Richard? I'm a little worried, Johnny... err, Mom. I mean, I don't to live the rest of my life carrying around your giant boobs, this bulbous ass, your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla cut him off. \"Uh, yeah, I get the idea mom. Jeez, you can really be a nag sometimes. Look, I think you're right. We should be careful, but if my calculations were correct, it's only a matter of time before we lose our personalities to the conformation to our current bodies. Frankly, don't think we have a choice but to try it one last time. If it works, we're good to go. If it doesn't work... well, you get the idea,\" she said trailing off, not thrilled about the thought of living her life watching her son by married to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could feel the weight of the situation actually dig into his shoulders... oh wait, that was just his bra. The resounding effects of the last run were catastrophic, but maybe Carla had actually got the machine working properly. Maybe this was his ticket back to a somewhat normal life. Maybe this could actually work. \"Alright, let's do it,\" he said with a newfound resolve. The mismatched pair marched out to the shack. Richard was futzing around the back yard, stacking some wood next to the fence. Luckily, he was too preoccupied to see them enter the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla got them all set up. Johnny plopped down in the chair as Carla fixed the contraption to his head. It matted down his hair, but that was hardly a nuisance considering the circumstances. She fiddled around with some of the nobs, buttons, and typed down some commands on the keyboard. Finally, she set herself up in the chair adjacent Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready? 3... 2... 1...\" Carla counted down as the sequence started underway. Again, the computer fans whirred, trying to cool an overworked motherboard. The screen flashed a series of symbols, numbers, and letters as the two looked at one another. Johnny could feel a certain sense of electricity in the air. He knew something was going to happen, but had no idea what the outcome would be. The whirring became louder and louder as he felt the helmet begin to warm up. It too started to make some popping noises, like a 90's computer trying to log onto the internet for the first time. That's when it all went black...</span></div></div>",

Did it work was the first thing to flash through his mind once his head cleared slightly. Before he could confirm anything, Richard busted through the door, turning on the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You guys should have waited for me. I wanted to see Johnny's greatest success,\" he said. No one responded with that prompt. \"You two okay? You look a little out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked at his father and opened his mouth, not knowing exactly whose voice was going to come out. \"Blown fuse, it needs some more tweeking,\" Johnny said. A wave of relief washed over him as he recognized his voice. He looked down at himself, confirming the best news he could think of. He saw his gangly teenage body. No more age spots. No more sagging breasts. No more paunch. He was back to being plain old (young) Johnny! Smiling, he looked over to his mother. Carla did her best to keep her composure, not wanting to cue Richard off to any of their shenanigans, but she was clearly very pleased to be back in the role of the family matriarch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just surprised it didn't work. You know how predictable Johnny's devices usually are,\" Carla said, winking at Johnny as she stood up. \"Why don't you and take a walk around the block. I could really go for a mile in these shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, honey. You're braless,\" Richard reminded her as she ushered him out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you escort me to the bedroom then,\" Carla coaxed her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sat there, grinning with happiness that he was back in his own body. It felt good. He felt young, energetic, and MUCH less encumbered. \"Maybe it's time I grab life by the tail,\" he said to himself, \"I mean, I only get one life to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Johnny clicked the 'save' button on the programming code his mother had written up. \"Well... maybe I'll get more than just one life.\" He walked out of the shack, breathed in that fresh summer air, and took his first steps towards enjoying HIS life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, Carla worked on the machine in Johnny's shack in the backyard. Thanks to her son's memories, she understood all the programming jargon input into the computer, along with how the machine was assembled, its power source, and so on. She remembered spending countless hours tinkering on this and other experiments, even though these memories didn't belong to her. Her brainpower felt enhanced, new thoughts and ideas swirling around in her mind with the speed of a racecar. Her son really was a genius after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued working, she began to get second thoughts about swapping back with her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This body is so youthful! So limber!\" Carla muttered to herself, taking a moment to pat herself down and rub curiously over the bulge in her new trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tall, stronger, and lean. No fat in these arms... or on this stomach!\" She laughed. \"I haven't had this much energy since I was a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla's primary concern was passing as her own son; likewise, she didn't want Johnny to mess things up in her life. But seeing how naturally they fell into each other's habits at supper tonight, all of her doubts evaporated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Richard, her husband, couldn't tell who they really were! Er... he would be her father now, wouldn't he? Gosh, that sounded weird to Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought about responsibilities that she wouldn't have anymore. No more cooking, no more cleaning, no more washing clothes, no more ironing... those were all Johnny's tasks now. And if he could do those things as well as he cooked pasta tonight, he'd have no trouble with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, Carla couldn't remember how to prepare tonight's meal. The more she tried, the more those memories slipped away, just out of grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust be an effect of the machine. Carla considered configuring the program to allow memories and other intellectual abilities to be copied rather than swapped, but her new knowledge told her that might take several days to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould Carla persuade Johnny to stay swapped for that long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Carla heard a knocking at the shack door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" She called out, as her son turned the hatch and stepped gingerly in to the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked tired. Oh my God! Carla thought inwardly... her face looked so pale, so old, like it had seen better days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still couldn't adjust to seeing her own body from another perspective. But what she did see wasn't terribly flattering. Flabby arms and chin, big sagging breasts distending out a frumpy-looking blouse, muffin top spilling over a tight pair of trousers. Wide hips and an even bigger ass, though Richard said many times he liked that sort of 'build' for a woman. Carla appreciated him for saying that even though she suspected he was just being polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this what everyone sees when they look at her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her hair... no, <i>Johnny's</i> blonde hair now, looked like it was in sore need of... whatever women do to spruce up their hair? Wow, Carla couldn't believe how thorough that last memory swap was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This totally sucks, Mom!\" Johnny whined, sighing deeply before sitting his plump rear down on one of the swapping chairs. \"This body wobbles and jiggles and it feels like I'm spilling out of these clothes! You and Dad cleared out of the kitchen pretty quickly, leaving me to clean up your mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla resumed working on the machine. \"Welcome to the life of a 44-year-old mother of three.\" Then, more sympathetically, she added, \"Great pasta by the way. You did a really good job with dinner tonight. I don't think Richard suspects anything different about either of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" Johnny folded his hands in his lap and watched Carla work. \"Dad's on the phone checking in with Cindy. She's on that date with Mark tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she? Must have slipped my mind.\" Replied Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the only thing, apparently. I cooked that meal like I'd done it a thousand times before. I'm finding certain things just... I don't know, come naturally to me now. How about you?\" Asked Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same with me. Come see for yourself if you want.\" Carla beckoned her son over to the computer terminal. Although he had already discovered his own ineptitude reading his old work, he was reminded of it again now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This all looks like gobbledygook to me now.\" Johnny muttered. He kept his distance from the keyboard, as if afraid that his mere presence might cause some error in the programming. Carla noticed that she used to act that way whenever she was around Johnny's inventions, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's ready for us to swap back now.\" Carla announced a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny snapped awake from another short doze. \"Oh, thank goodness! Um... What am I supposed to do again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smoothed out Johnny's hair and fit the swapping helmet neatly on her old head. She pretended to enter in a few commands on the terminal. In truth, she really didn't want to swap back yet. But since Johnny had as much understanding of the machine as she once did, Carla was confident he wouldn't know what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, she pitied her son now. She wasn't a bad person for wanting to borrow his body and life for a while, was she? She would give it back when she had had enough... she deserved a break from all her motherly chores, didn't she? Not to mention how valuable a learning experience it would be for her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in the other chair and donned the helmet. A few seconds later, the familiar buzzing and whirring of the machine sprung to life. Except this time, no changes occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still in each others' bodies, along with a large chunk of each others' memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... did it work?\" Carla heard her old voice say unsteadily. She saw her old body stand up and look down. \"Oh, dear! I'm afraid we're still stuck as each other, Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla got up and took off Johnny's helmet, setting it aside carefully. \"Aww, crap! I guess there's still more work to be done.\" She lied. \"I swear as soon as I get this working again we're swapping back. Until then, can you be me for another day or two? It shouldn't take longer than a few days to work out all the kinks in the machine. A week at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sighed and placed his hands on his hips. \"I guess I don't have a choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can handle it!\" Carla pepped him up. \"Just think of how much you'll learn by being me. You get to experience being a woman and a mom, seeing things from <i>our</i> perspective for once. You'll have no problem talking to girls from now on, considering you were one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can talk to girls just fine!\" Johnny protested, as Carla ushered him out of the shack and back towards the house. \"They just don't like any of the things I like talking about...\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla spun around and inhaled the fresh evening air. Giggling mirthfully, she dashed back to the shack to continue re-tooling the machine to suit her own desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jack noted that the door to their shed was cracked open, as well as the light being on.  Easy enough to fix, he mused to himself as he strutted to the small structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the shack, he looked around in amusement at what appeared to be more of Johnny's old games.  <i>This guy will never get it</i>, he thought to himself as he started tidying up the tripping hazards.  After a few minutes of perusing all the gadgets, gizmos, and devices, he heard a soft knock on the door.  Turning around, he was greeted by the sight of his Aunt Denise.  She was an older woman, of about 50 years of age.  Her aptitude for business provided her with a comfortable lifestyle, even though she had been single since the age of 28, when her first husband left her after an extra-marital affair.  Her dark brown hair hung loosely over her shoulders, and her face was well-kept, being framed perfectly by the simple black glasses she wore.  Today, she was donning a sun dress with an elaborate pattern on it.  It stopped just above the knees.  Much to Jack's chagrin, Denise was showing off quite a bit of cleavage, despite the billowing sagginess of her own breasts.  The best part about Aunt Denise was that she was still as vibrant, energetic, and adventurous as she was when she was 2, even 3 decades younger.  Jack truly appreciated that aspect of his aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jack!  What's going on back here,\" she said, carefully stepping over some loose wires on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I wish I knew.  Truth be told, I'm avoiding the house since mom is cleaning and I know she'll undoubtedly enlist me to help.  I figured this was a safe place to stow away,\" he answered.  \"How are you,\" he asked while giving his aunt a hearty, two-armed hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine.  I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped by.  The front door was locked, but I saw you putzing around back here and I figured I'd come say hello,\" she said, daintily inspecting one of Johnny's smaller devices.  \"I'm guessing his land snorkel never caught on...\" she stated plainly while she set down the obscure looking machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fact.  His penchant for invention has actually been pretty fruitless,\" Jack responded.  \"But I've got to admit, this set up right here has me intrigued.  It's allegedly a mind-reading device or something.  I guess it's supposed to help two people understand each other better.  It looks like you just strap on a helmet to each person and initiate the program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's interesting enough.  Ever wonder what's going through you old aunt's mind?  I promise you'd be surprised at some of the experiences I've had through this lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really...\" Jack said, seeing the immediate defeat on his aunt's face.  Being the good nephew, he figured it wouldn't hurt to indulge in her curiosity.  \"But you know, maybe there's something you could learn from your smart, handsome, talented nephew,\" he finished with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the Mack I know good and well,\" she replied already making her way over to the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Denise had strapped the device to her head, and patiently awaited as Jack did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, we had better hurry.  I can see mom outside right now,\" he said as he booted up the computer.  Not knowing entirely what he was doing, Jack just kept on trying to click continue on the computer screen until something happened.  Eventually, he knew had initiated something, as the hardware started to whir with excitement as the screen of the CPU showed miles and miles of coding language he knew nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise looked over with a smile on her face as Jack pondered whether or not this was a good idea.  That's when it happened...</span></div></div>",

He's fine,\" Jack heard his mother say as she rolled her eyes.  <i>Why is she being so nonchalant about this</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny this is the most amazing thing you've ever created.  I mean, look at us,\" Jack heard what sounded like his own voice.  What the fuck is going on here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a total accident.  Mom and I tried this out a few hours ago and decided to give each other's lives a whirl for a day, just to get some new experiences.  I mean, it's still insane to me, but here I am, in my own mother's body,\" Johnny explained, sitting back on a comfortable chair in the corner of the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty much how this panned out for us.  I'm so glad you saw us when you did.  I would have freaked out if we were the only people in the wrong body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The wrong body?  Why is mom talking like she's Johnny</i>, Jack said rubbing his temples.  In a valiant effort, Jack tried his best to sit up, only to be completely stunned at the sight of his own body, sitting rather effeminately, across the room.  \"Wha... wha... what the actual fuck is this,\" he managed to stammer, finally figuring out why his voice sounded so familiar.  He immediately looked down, being greeted by two soft, pendulous breasts hardly contained by the low-cut dress that he recognized as the same that Denise was wearing when she came to the shack just a few minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, I told you not to mess with my stuff,\" Johnny quipped from his mom's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topheavy.com/thnewnew/mature/archives_2015/17052015/thm17052015_042.jpg\"> Aunt Denise </a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://topheavy.com/thnewnew/mature/archives_2015/17052015/thm17052015_042.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat back, trying to take inventory of his current situation.  It appeared he was in his Aunt Denise's body, complete with her large breasts, paunch, and slightly chubby legs.  As he sat back, he noticed just how big his newly acquired ass was.  The lack of covering on his legs was disturbing, as was the tickling sensation on the back of his neck he felt from his new, long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the room, he could tell Aunt Denise was having the time of her, or his, life.  She was busy chattering away with Johnny while checking out her new muscles, and occasionally looking over at her former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is freaky...\" Jack said to no one, as the others were enamored in their own conversation.  </span></div></div>",

He felt totally embarrassed. \"You little shit!!\" Jack growled in his aunt's mature voice as he lunged from the chair, looking to grab his younger brother. And he seemed not to care that Johnny was in their mom's body. But the extra weight of his huge, pillowly breasts and the high heeled sandals on his feminine feet caused Jack to stumble and he ended up falling flat on his face, his aunt's glasses flying off. Luckily, his big breasts cushioned his fall a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!! Be careful with my body. And my glasses!\" Denise shouted rather forcefully in her nephew's male voice. Her tone actually seemed to surprise even herself, and she put her hand on her chest... stepping back and acting quite effeminate... as she always did. But now that she was in Jack's 23-year old body, it just made her look like a gay man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say we're evenly matched now anyway, so don't think about picking on me again just because you two decided to snoop around my shack.\" Johnny said, referring to the fact that he was now in their mother's 44-year old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it dickwad and swap us back!\" Jack demanded, as he retrieved his aunt's glasses and put them on as he remained on all fours. His large pendulous breasts swinging beneath him and almost popping out of his ridiculously skimpy sundress. He placed his hands on said boobs as he scrambled to his feet, teetering in his aunt's feminine shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down doofus,\" Johnny retorted in their mom's voice, smirking a little. \"Think of this as an experience in how the other half lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call this an experience?? Being stuck as own mother and aunt??\" Jack grumbled, placing his hands on his curvy hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Johnny muttered simply, answering Jack's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise stepped forward, embarrassed to admit that she was experiencing (and enjoying) her first erection in her eldest nephew's body. \"You know I wouldn't mind staying like this for a little while, just to experience being a man.\" She said, smiling as genuinely as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wouldn't. You're much younger now.\" Jack frowned at his own body, creeped out by it all. \"You expect me to carry these around for a few hours?\" He spat, every jerky movement caused his large middle-aged breasts to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking more of spending a couple of days in each other's shoes.\" Denise smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer former eyes bulged out. \"WHAT?? I can hardly walk in these stupid things.\" Jack complained, gesturing down to his aunt's shoes on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do own some flat shoes, you know that.\" Denise said. And if you need to cover up my boobs, you can do that too if you like. Though I don't see why you would want to hide my best assets.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was being said (or argued) by his brother and his aunt, Johnny took another look down at his own mature, female body, cupping his breasts in his ahnds and starting to get excited. He could feel his new vagina getting moist, and he knew sooner of later he would need to masturbate in his mom's body for release. Johnny also decided against telling either Jack or his aunt Denise that he wasn't actually sure if he could swap them all to their rightful bodies. At least for now. He figured that would anger Jack even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his bottom lip as he looked at his two equally bodyswapped relatives.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Erm... thanks for doing this anyway.\" Johnny thanked his mother, while scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" His mother nodded, before exhaling slightly again to show her disapproval of his 'antics'.

He was still slightly embarrassed that it didn't work as planned, but knew a good deal about fixing these types of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The connections look good,\" he said, squeezing his eyes shut momentarily, hoping an epiphany would come to him, \"but maybe it's a software problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tinkering continued for another 15 minutes while he sat hunched over his machine, checking each and every electrical connection with the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it's hot in here,\" he murmured as he wiped the sweat from his brow.

His chest started itching more, as his heart rate jumped slightly.  It felt almost as if he was having an adrenaline rush.  \"What is going on out here,\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, he knew something was up.  When he went to scratch his chest again, he could tell it wasn't totally normal.  Then, without any warming, he felt his chest balloon out, almost immediately.  He looked down, being caught very off guard by what he saw.  Two, teeny, tiny little breasts had started to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I.... uh...\" he stuttered as he sat there stunned by what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two small breasts grew at a tremendous rate.  The fabric of his shirt was stretched taught, and he could see two large nipples nearly poking through the fabric.  They continued to grow for a few more moments, as waves of discomfort pulsed through his body.  The developments smashed against the material in his shirt as they swelled.  The discomfort caused Johnny to pull his shirt off.  That's when he saw what looked like two breasts, growing in unobstructed delight.  They pulsed and grew at an insane rate while Johnny just sat there, dumbfounded by his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it all came to a close.  The feeling pulsing over his body stopped.  His heart rate seemed to lower, and the temperature in the room felt like it dropped to well below room temp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth agape, he stared at the pair of perfectly formed, seemingly mature breasts.  They were easily a DD cup, and sagged quite a bit.  Both breasts had age marks on them, and both had minor stretch marks along the outer portions near his armpits.  He brought his hand up to one and cupped it, feeling the realness of his situation.  They were definitely a part of him, but he had no idea why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stumbled over to the nearest mirror he had stowed in the corner, and was surprised to see his teenage body supporting a large pair of women's breasts.  Large, pillowy, and saggy.  That's the only way to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let anyone see me like this... what this is,\" he said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he heard someone at the door.</span></div></div>",

She took a peek down her blouse, her bra was hung limp against her skin now, covering a teenage boy's chest with some sparse hair and small nipples. The only positive thing about it was the lack of weight that she was so used to carrying around. But the whole thing was freaking her out, she wanted her boobs back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could see how stressed his mom was and decided to deliver a comforting lie or sorts. \"I'm sure I can mom, just give me some time.\" he smiled nervously. \"In the meantime... er.. . can I borrow your bra? These things are heavy and move around too much.\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply, Carla removed her blouse and took her bra off, giving them both an unobstructed view of his former chest on her otherwise feminine frame. She removed her now useless bra while Johnny took his shirt off again. Then his mom helped him put the bra on and fastened it for him. \"I don't know how I'm going to explain this to your father and sister, and everyone else for that matter.\" Carla grumbled, shaking her head as her son then donned his shirt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mom, I really am.\" Johnny mumbled dejectedly, adjusting his bra strap slightly before walking back over to the two chairs.

She studied him closely, then drew back. \"You've got my eyes!\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, figures.\" Johnny sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, put these on!\" Carla said quietly, handing her glasses to her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either that or start bumping into things.\" His mom told him, putting her other hand on her hip. \"And how do you plan on fixing this mess if you can't see?\" she added, berating him in the process of asking him a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Johnny said, taking his mom's glasses and placing them on his face. Suddenly his vision cleared. He then walked over to the mirror and studied his reflection, the large breasts sitting on his chest, and now he had his mom's hazel eyes instead of his usual brown ones. \"This is ridiculous!\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been saying that about these stupid experiments of yours for a while young man. But this by far is your biggest failure to date.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look mom, just lay off me okay, I know I messed up and I'm gonna try my damned hardest to get us swapped back.\" Johnny said, sounding a little irritated now as his mom continued showing her displeasure at what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fix this... now!\" Carla said, before turning and heading towards the shack door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trust Darlene to pick today to come around. She wasn't her favorite person anyway, since Carla knew she had a crush on her son Jack. \"Put the kettle on Darlene, I'll be back down shortly.\" Carla called through to the kitchen, just nipping upstairs first. She couldn't be seen in her current state, not without a little preparation. Bursting into her and Richard's bedroom, Carla rumaged through her underwear bra and got one of her bras out. Removing her blouse again, she stared down at her son's former teenage chest for a moment, before putting her bra on. Then she nipped into the bathroom and used enough toilet tissue to stuff her bra, to give the illusion that she still had breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonning her blouse while descending the stairs, Carla then buttoned it all the way up and inspected herself in the mirror at the base of the stairs. It didn't look too bad, enough to fool Darlene she hoped, since the woman wasn't that bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply, Carla walked into the kitchen and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are your glasses?\" Darlene immediately threw an awkward question at Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it wasn't too awkward. \"Oh, just wearing contact lenses, colored ones.\" Carla replied, incase Darlene questioned the color of her eyes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird seeing you without glasses.\" Darlene said, as she finished making them both a cup of coffee. Then they both sat at the kitchen table and started to have a usual chat about everything and nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla just hoped her son Johnny would be able to repair his 'transfer' machine quickly, before anything else happened to them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking down, he shook his head, his mom's boobs were getting in the way all the time. But... he had to admit, a small part of him was turned on by this whole thing, he had breasts for god's sake. He might have been more turned on had they not been his mother's breasts. And wearing glasses was an irritation he was unused to, but since he couldn't see anything without them, he had no choice. It was just a chore to keep having to push them up the bridge of his nose when they slipped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell am I going to fix this? I don't even know what went wrong.\" Johnny grumbled, taking a breather. As he slumped back onto his ass, his tits jiggled., causing him to peek down his shirt again at his fleshy orbs. There was no doubt his mom's bra was helping, but they were still heavy and moved too much in his personal opinion. He had a whole new appreciation of big breasted women now, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny suddenly had to jump up and pretend to be working on something when he heard his sister shouting him... shortly before she burst into the shack. \"Johnny have you seen my ipod??\" she asked, entering and seeing her younger brother huddled in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't.\" came the reply from Johnny, hoping she would leave immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you wearing glasses?\" Cindy Lou asked, approaching him closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yes, it's easier to see things with them.\" Johnny mumbled, not facing his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you had any.\" Cindy Lou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny heard the door to the shack closed, he turned his head, only to see his sister still standing there, arms folded. \"Those are mom's glasses. Why the hell are you wearing them?\" she asked, confused. Immediately after she asked that, she noticed the visible outline of a bra strap underneath her brother's shirt as he was hunched over. \"OMG... are you wearing a bra too? Are you a crossdresser?\"  she asked, partly laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not!\" Johnny told her, getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you wearing a bra? It had better not be one of mine.\" Cindy Lou told him straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny suddenly jumped up, whipping his shirt off and turning around... showing off his new breasts to his sister. \"I'm wearing one to support these things.\" he growled at her, cupping his boobs. \"My new experiment failed and me and mom are having parts of our bodies swapped.\" he said, coming clean. He watched as his sister recoiled... her mouth agape. She was rendered speechless, probably for the first time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Cindy Lou gulped, not quite believing what she was seeing. Her little brother had bigger boobs than her. The fact that he had their mother's breasts was just even more weird. \"Um... can you fix it?\" she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I knew what had gone wrong, I'd have swapped us back already.\" Johnny said, slowly putting his shirt back on, nearly knocking his mom's glasses off his face in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then.. what are you gonna do?\" his sister inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny issued a prolonged sigh as he put the glasses back on. \"Keep trying to work this out and hope I don't get swapped again.\" he replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out from his mouth, rather than his teenage bass, came his own mother's mature alto voice, complete with a tiny bit of airy scratchiness, a characteristic that made her super easy to identify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You've got to be kidding me.

She looked into the cup deeply for a moment and swirled the liquid, as her neighbor kept rattling on about assorted stuff that didn't interest her in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Darlene shut up for a minute, took a sip of her coffee and then asked Carla a question. \"So Carla, where's that strapping older son of yours?\" she grinned, pining over Jack, who was Johnny's older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's at work!\" Carla answered... in a far deeper voice than hers usually was. Carla's eyes widened in shock as her jaw hung open a bit, while Darlene frowned a did a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?

His head and his ass were both tingling, and he knew what was about to unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mismatched pair stood there, already looking ridiculous.  Johnny stared at his mother as he watched her pants loosen around the waist, hips, and ass.  Carla, somewhat happen with the sudden weight loss, watched as Johnny's pants struggled against the quickly expanding waistline he had just inherited.  Simultaneously, Johnny could tell his mother was about to swap some more apparent features with him.  Her hair darkened quickly as it shrunk back into her head.  She raised her hands to feel her hair recede.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" she said, still befuddled by the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny rolled his eyes again, wishing he wasn't such an 'amazing' scientist.  At that time, he could feel his mother long, dark red hair sprout from his scalp.  As he watched her wrinkles and crow's feet disappear, he could tell his skin was aging at an incredible rate.  When the tingling subsided, the pair took a quick inventory of their current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing, testing,\" Carla said, still with Johnny's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, how do I look,\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you've got my hair, face, breasts, and ass... and apparently still your manhood,\" she said, checking herself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief,\" Johnny said.  \"What about feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm still my petite size 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are out of your minds,\" Cindy Lou chimed in, having watched the transformation firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it kind of feels that way,\" Janet said.  \"Look, we have to figure this out.\"</span></div></div>",

Everyone will think we're freaks if they see you like this,\" Cindy said, showing that she was going to be a team player after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny pulled his shirt over his head, causing his breasts to press together, making them look even more impressively huge.  He frown as he unzipped and removed his pants.  Sure, he was still anatomically male, but the mature, motherly ass and thighs really didn't make him feel that masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the way, Carla was handing him her clothing.  The pair awkwardly put on their counterparts outfits and helped straighten each other out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about this,\" Johnny said, looking into his mother's eyes.  \"I never meant to mix us up so badly.  What if we can never fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, son.  Don't worry.  Everything is going to be fine.  You were smart enough to make this happen, we'll find a way to change us back.  Now, how do I look,\" she said, doing a quick pirouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you look like me.  Thoughts?\" he said, gesturing down to his own, aged, plump body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call it a cake,\" Carla responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's do this,\" he said with conviction.</span></div></div>",

He was getting pretty excited about the prospect of finally testing the machine he had created all by his lonesome. It had taken a lot of time, many hours alone developing software, testing and assembling hardware, and checking, breaking, fixing, and doing it all over again to finally get it right. But this was it, this was the moment he had been waiting for. Lucky for Johnny, his sister was home today working on grad school applications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran up to the house, and saw his sister hanging out on the back deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up, Bro Pesci?\" she said, punching Johnny in the arm as he came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy. You're my favorite sister, you know that right?\" he said, shmoozing her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your only sister, idiot,\" she retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I think I've finally hit it big. I know I've failed a lot in the past, but I'm sure I've struck gold. Can you give me a hand with my newest gizmo in the shack?\" Johnny pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him up and down, squinting her eyes and pursing her lips while she thought this over. \"For you, I guess I can sacrifice a few minutes,\" she finally said with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what they say about you, sis, I still think you're a good person,\" Johnny joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked back to the shack where Johnny's latest creation awaited. Opening the door, Johnny led Cindy into the stuffy, mess of a workshop. \"So this is it,\" he said, expecting to dazzle his older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... you've really outdone yourself this time,\" she said, clearly not understanding what she was actually looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this should only take a few minutes,\" Johnny told her. As he explained what the purpose of this machine was, his sister started to get an idea of how important this could be for humanity if it actually worked.</span></div></div>",

Clearly, Cindy was looking at this new project from her bleeding heart mindset. \"Johnny, this could fix so many problems throughout the world!\" She said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sis. Just take a seat here,\" he said, indicating the barbershop-style chair. He proceeded to hook up the metallic connectors to various regions of Cindy's head. \"This might sting a little at the beginning, but you'll be fine. When we start this, you'll need to concentrate on a personal experience you want to share with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued explaining the subtleties of the machine he was hooking her up to. She understood some of what he said, was skeptical of other parts, and was completely lost with large swathes of his explanation. \"...so, you get all that,\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. We're good,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just another minute,\" he said as he began to toy around with the computer terminal. \"Alright, we'll set this here... adjust this level slightly... and remove that safety protocol... that should just about do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny walked over to the chair that was adjacent Cindy and sat down. He began attaching the connectors to his own head. \"Last chance dance, sis. You ready for this?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than ever,\" she said. Part of her figured this wouldn't work, so it didn't really worry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Johnny initiated the starting sequence. Lights flashed, cooling fans whirred, and monitors hummed. Cindy sat, nervously waiting for something to happen. She was concentrating on her experience as a volunteer at the local soup kitchen, hoping to give Johnny some of her volunteerism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight tinge of pain shot through her head. Ouch, thanks for the warning, Johnny she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe activity of the machine increased, with the cooling fans working overtime to keep the increasingly warming hardware from overheating. That's when it happened. Both Johnny and Cindy's vision blurred, and they both temporarily lost consciousness. Then it went black. The entire shack had lost power, probably a blown fuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, was that supposed to happen?\" Cindy asked. That's weird, she thought. She cleared her throat several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, are you okay? I think we blew a fuse back here\" Johnny said. What's going on?! He knew something was amiss, but with the lights out, he couldn't see anything. Luckily, Johnny knew this shack like the back of his hand, and he made his way over to the wall. As he felt his way over to the fuse box, he knew something was up... he felt... bigger and bouncier. He opened the box and flicked the fuse switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHhhhhHHHHHhhh!!!!\" Johnny heard someone scream behind him, but it sure didn't sound like Cindy. As he turned around, finally able to see with the lights on, he was completely taken aback at what he saw. If he didn't know better, he'd swear he was looking at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when this Johnny imposter started pointing at him. \"Johnny, is that you,\" his body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Of course it's me,\" he replied. The gravity of the situation was falling upon him like a ton of bricks. \"Wait a minute...\" He looked down, and almost fainted at what he saw. Why am I wearing the black and white sun dress that Cindy was just wearing? And why does it fit?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it clicked. \"The overload in the software mainframe must have caused a feedback loop, which would have triggered the emergency purge of all gathered information...\" Johnny said, seemingly to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak English?!\" his body demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, is that you?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the machine shut down, it sent all it's collected data back to the bodies it drew from... but it looks like it downloaded to the wrong bodies,\" Johnny tried explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying...\" Cindy said, mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we've switched bodies,\" Johnny finished.</span></div></div>",

Let me look over the machine, seeing as it may be the only way to fix our situation,\" Johnny said as he walked over to the computer terminal. \"I appears as if everything is still intact.\" Picking up the wires and headsets for inspection, Johnny felt a wave of relief wash over him, knowing that there is most likely a way to reverse this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the idea popped in his head. \"Cindy, I think I just had another stroke of genius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another implies you've had more than one,\" she joked, leaning against the wall, checking out her new arms and shoulders. \"This is so cool.

Just don't do anything too gross. Also, let's try and keep up appearances, I don't want anyone finding out about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Johnny could even finish his sentence, Cindy was out of the shack in the flash...</span></div></div>",

He was pretty concerned for a number of reasons, besides being in someone else's body.  <i>It probably shouldn't be sparking like that</i>, he thought as he started looking over the different elements of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, mom and Cindy were shooting the breeze, acting like nothing strange was going on at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's it feel like,\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Cindy excitedly answered.  \"It's so liberating.  Honestly, not having breasts makes such a world of difference.  I feel like I can run, jump, and move around as much as I want without having to worry about something 'popping out'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice, to be honest,\" Carla answered, looking down at her own large breasts. \"I can't even pick something up without this pair making a run for it,\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, maybe when Johnny fixes this machine, we can get a break from carrying those around,\" Cindy said, looking over at Johnny to see if he noticed their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny screwdriver in hand, Johnny was concentrating on the task at hand, rolling his eyes at his current situation.  His delicate fingers, with their long nails, were driving him crazy.  He was continually having to blow stray hairs out of his face, and everything just felt... softer.  Sitting down felt different, getting up felt different, and if he turned too quickly, he could feel his breasts shimmy in their bra before settling back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after about 15 minutes of inspecting and tweeking the machine, Johnny was excited to see that there really wasn't that much damage.  Cindy and mom continued their conversation of comparisons in the shack, with mom being very interested in how it felt to be more muscular.  \"Do you feel more powerful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's kind of like... yeah, something like that.  However, it isn't nearly as noticeable as you'd think.  I can definitely tell I've got more muscle than before, but it isn't something that I'm actively thinking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a few more minutes as Johnny gave them a quick update.  \"Good news, guys.  The damage was superficial.  I just needed to tighten some of the connections and ground a few wires.  I don't want to get anyone's hopes up, but I think we can take this thing for another spin.\"</span></div></div>",

Johnny just frowned in response, his mom never usually showed any real interest in anything he did, especially when it came to his experiments and inventions. Not to mention the fact that she had just chewed him out for having caused the accidental body swap with his sister in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... what? What do you mean?\" Johnny answered, giving his bra strap a quick twang as he adjusted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you like to stay in your sister's body for now? And how about if I take your body for a spin?\" Carl suggested, stunning Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny blinked a couple of times, again blowing several strands of hair from his face. \"Are you serious? Stay in this body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy then quickly stepped forward and smiled too, adding her two cents worth. \"Hey I wouldn't mind trying on mom's body for a time.\" she giggled, making Johnny's body sound a bit gay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're messing with me aren't you?\" Johnny narrowed his eyes in suspicion. \"Well very funny, yes. Now come on sis, we cna try and switch back.\" he said, gesturing over to the chair he had clambered out of just a short while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I say no?\" Cindy said, hands on her masculine hips as her hard-on strained against her boxers and jeans. Cindy didn't know if she was willing to get rid of her new erection yet, having only just got it. Being a guy felt great, even if she was in her own little brother's body. She was prepared to let her mom experience the same thing however, for a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not doing this to me!\" Johnny grumbled, pointing to the chair again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked so petulant in your sister's body just then. That delightful little pout.\" Carla chuckled at the sight of her son trying to look intimidating in Cindy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sighed, his anger building. But he knew he had to bite his tongue and not do anything rash. His mom and sister outnumbered him, and he was stuck in Cindy's female body too. Eventually he relented.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why do you want to be in MY body?\" Johnny whined in his sister's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A learning experience of course,\" Carla answered, only partially telling the truth. She didn't want to tell her son that she mostly wanted to find out what having a penis between her legs was like. Even her own son's. \"I think this machine, while not doing what it was initially built to do, might just bring us closer together as a family, don't you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nodded, agreeing with her mom's sentiments as she nursed the boner in her pants. She already knew how amazing it felt having a dick between her legs, and she knew she'd get to experience it again soon in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Get in the chairs.\" Johnny sighed, reluctantly going along with his mom's plan. He watched his mom and his sister in his body climb into the chairs, and he attached the sensors to both their heads. Cindy stifled a giggle as her brother stood directly in front of her, catching a glimpse of her own cleavage from a whole new angle. It made her cock throb again. \"Never realized just how great my body looks in that dress.\" Cindy commented to her brother, \"And of course you wear them both so well little bro.\" she said to him, eliciting a chuckle from their mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever sis! Just get ready.\" Johnny said, walking back over to the control panel to his machine and flicking the main switch. He just hoped nothing else would go wrong with his machine. The machine powered up and small electrical discharges began emanating from the sensors on his mom's and sister's heads. All Carla and her daughter felt was a tingle in their heads, and for Cindy it was the second time that day. The electricity then slowly died away and the cooling fans kicked in again, indicating the process was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Johnny asked, a hint of concern in his feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here sweetie.\" His former body grinned, slipping out of the chair. \"Oh my... I'm a boy!\" Carla then gasped, her male hands roaming first over her flat chest... then down towards the tent in her jeans, courtesy of the erection Cindy had been sporting just seconds before. \"Oooh.... now this is interesting.\" Carla mumbled, overwhelmed by the sensations of being in her youngest son's teenage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! I've got mom's boobs!\" Cindy squealed from her mom's body, \"And everything else of course.\" she chuckled, getting out of the chair and inspecting her older, bigger breasted body. \"Your machine is the best thing ever bro!\" Cindy then laughed, patting her former head and ruffling Johnny's long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is really weird.</i> Johnny thought, as he observed his family members. His body was acting even more effeminate with his mom inside it, and to see his mom's body acting like a teenage girl was also a strange sight, but not quite as weird. And of course, he was still a girl, still in Cindy Lou's body. He had to admit though, it did feel kind of nice. Her body was definitely growing on him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes soon fell on his mom (in Johnny's body). \"You trying to convert normal people to be twisted little nerds like yourself little bro?\" he sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom, Carla, was about to severely admonish her eldest son, but then she had a thought. Why not pretend to be Johnny? And as if on cue, both Cindy and Johnny in their new bodies thought the same thing. Playing a joint prank on Jack for being such a jock seemed like a good idea. \"Well, we can't all be a failed Baseball team member like you now can we, big bro?\" Carla grinned, doing a best impression of her youngest son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a slap?\" Jack threatened who he thought was his brother. That had been a dig right at Jack's nerve-center, and his family knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey... stop with the teasing!\" Cindy suddenly interjected, acting as much like her mother as she could as she looked over at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom.\" Jack apologized. Cindy then turned to hide a smirk. Having mom's authority was probably going to be the best part about this, as well as having her bigger breasts of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then turned to Johnny, who was currently occupying his sister's hot body. \"Why the hell are you in here Cindy? I thought this would have been the last place I'd see you.\" he said with a disapproving shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny shrugged his slender shoulders, running his fingers through his hair. He had no idea how to act like a 20-year old girl of course, much less his sister, but he was going to give it his best. \"There's actually some pretty neat stuff in here. You don't know what you're missing.\" he said, hands on hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass up my admission into the Geek Club thanks sis.\" Jack muttered, before turning and leaving the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later, Carla, Cindy and even Johnny all broke out laughing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think it would be cruel to make her leave my body so soon!\" Johnny licked his lips as he eyed up his mother's larger breasts \"How about you and me swap instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla grinned at the thought of inhabiting her daughter's young 20 year old body before she replied \"Sure Johnny, but you don't mind being stuck in your old mother's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny had a dirty smirk on his borrowed pretty face. \"You're kind of a MILF mom! And if I'm going to be stuck as a girl I might as well have a larger chest and a bit more junk in the trunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla blushed from her son's compliment \"Flattery will get you everywhere my dear!\" She giggled as she eagerly dragged Johnny and practically threw him into the machine in his petite female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later and Johnny was proudly staring down at HIS impressive cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was giddy with joy at being so young, light and pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's Cindy gone?\" Panicked Johnny as he'd never been separated from his body before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla giggled in her daughter's young voice \"Oh I think I know where she is?

Finally finished, Johnny put his notepad and pen down on the desk. Johnny looked down and admired the purple, low cut vest his mother chose to wear that day. He couldn't help but stare at his mothers cleavage. The more he looked, the wetter his new vagina became between his mature 44 year old legs. Johnny always thought his mom was hot, but it's not something he could openly admit to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny loved the feel of his mom's skintight yoga pants on his legs. It felt great to be a mature woman. Even his new toes were cute. He gave them a wiggle in his mom's white flip flops and admired the cute toe ring his mom usually wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny couldn't take it anymore. He was getting horny. He made his way out of the shack and headed towards the house, his flip flops slapping on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny got inside he slipped his feet out of his mother's flip flops and scrunched his toes into the soft carpet. Johnny's hips swayed with every step as he made his way towards the basement. As he walked passed the empty bathroom his nose twitched at the obvious scent of masturbation in the bathroom. Johnny grinned to himself, Cindy must have rubbed one out in his body. \"That dirty little pervert!\" whispered Johnny to himself with a dirty smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Johnny walked passed the staircase he could hear his parents bed squeaking and what sounded like Cindy Lou's voice moaning. \"Mom must have told dad about the swapping machine and now he's plowing her in Cindy Lou's body. Man our family is messed up!\" Smirked  Johnny who was happy to know his family were as perverted as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny finally reached the basement door. He opened it with his manicured hand and headed sultrily down the stairs to his bedroom-basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny took a look at his sexy reflection in the mirror and admired his beautiful mature body. \"Well everybody else is having fun. Now it's my turn!\" Giggled Johnny as he was about to get to know his mother's body from a whole new perspective.</span></div></div>",

Yanking off her vest and bra, Johnny turned his torso side to side, letting the jiggling orbs move much more. After having his fun with that, he stopped them with his hands; rubbing the soft skin and erect nipples. His thick thighs couldn't help but slide against each other, stimulating the wet hole between them. With a visible stain in the yoga pants, Johnny forgoes those and the black panties underneath. Now completely nude, Johnny stood on his cute toes and did a few poses for his personal viewing. \"Not bad at all.\" He noted, doing some he never imagined his mother's mature body could pull off. After a few smacks to his plump ass, Johnny sashayed himself over to his bed and got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the covers over his whole body, leaving only his head exposed, Johnny stuck a finger between his inner thighs. A few slick noises caused by the immensity of fluids down there made his finger slide around with ease. Touching the sides of his shaven lower lips, flicking the clit above, finished up with sliding it inside hastily. Feeling his vaginal muscles contract and twist around his finger, Johnny increased it to two, sliding them  in an out lustfully. His mother's body seemed to really enjoy this action, and he set to work pinching his nipples to add some pleasure from above. \"Oh god, this is fantastic!\" He moaned, arching his back and grabbing the sheets with his scrunched toes. There was no way he'd be able to last very long after being in this body for so little, and Johnny reach orgasm. The heat and sweat trapped underneath his heavy covers helped to speed this process, keeping his libido high. \"Shit; why did that feel so good?\" He rhetorically asked, getting out of bed and walking back upstairs. Neglecting to put clothes on or clean himself up, Johnny walked back over to his flip flops and slipped them on. Walking to the kitchen for a snack and to the living room to put on some tv, Johnny felt the remaining twinges of ecstasy in his body every time the flip flops slapped his soft soles. \"Geez, mom would be lucky if I ever let her have her body back.\" Johnny unknowingly repeated the same thing Cindy Lou had decided.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack developed a mischievous glint in his eye. \u201cI know, how about Cerise Jones?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cerise?\u201d Johnny stammered. The girl he\u2019d had a crush on ever since he\u2019d hit puberty? That Cerise? Did Jack know about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s my friend Gary\u2019s sister. You go to school with her right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew all about Johnny\u2019s crush on Cerise. If he thought that he was being subtle about it, he was fooling himself because the boy could not keep a secret. Though deep down he loved his brother, Jack knew that Johnny was a total dweeb who never had a chance with a girl like Cerise, so he might as well have some fun with this crush! When Johnny suggested that Jack help him test his mind reading machine Jack thought it would be hilarious to suggest Cerise. He could probe her brain for secrets he could use against Johnny, share some embarrassing memories he had of Johnny with Cerise, maybe even talk Johnny into hooking himself up to the machine with Cerise. Jack loved toying with his brother, and already this plan was making him squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 we\u2019re familiar with each other.\u201d The truth was that Johnny worshiped Cerise and she thought that he was a total freak. Opinions on him and his experiments at school were mixed, and from what he could tell Cerise was firmly against them ever since a disastrous incident where some genetically modified flowers he\u2019d planted in her locker had eaten her textbooks. He\u2019d replaced them, of course, but he never truly felt like she forgave him. \u201cWhy her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGary said she\u2019s always been interested in knowing more about men and so I think this would be a cool opportunity for her. Besides, who wouldn\u2019t want to see what\u2019s inside of a girl\u2019s head? You\u2019d like to get inside of Cerise, wouldn\u2019t you Johnny?\u201d Jack wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, and Johnny suddenly got very busy looking through some papers. \u201cI bet this would really impress her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about Jack. This is a bad idea.\u201d No way Johnny was going to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, do you have a problem with it? Is something wrong with Cerise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Nothing\u2019s wrong with her, she\u2019s perfect.\u201d Johnny cursed himself over his word choice, but that was what he thought about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll invite her over then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d No matter how much Jack asked, he wasn\u2019t doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right. I guess you\u2019re too chicken to call her. Probably too scared that your nerd device isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d Jack scoffed, but inside he was grinning. He knew his brother, and Johnny wasn\u2019t the type to back down from a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine Jack! I\u2019ll call.\u201d Throwing his hands up, Johnny took out his phone. He was going to regret this, wasn\u2019t he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you even have her number?\u201d Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have everyone\u2019s phone number Jack, they\u2019re in databases.\u201c He tapped a few keys on his phone and began pulling up the information. \u201cIt\u2019s easy if you know where you\u2019re looking, especially if you\u2019re a genius like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls just give me their phone numbers Johnny,\u201d Jack said, giving an exaggerated flex of his bicep. \u201cI don\u2019t need to look them up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Johnny dialed the phone. \u201cHi, Cerise, it\u2019s Johnny Mack! Yeah, like from school. A, uh, a friend gave me this number. No I won\u2019t tell you who. Anyways, I was working on a new experiment and I think you\u2019re the perfect person to help me test it. You see, it\u2019s a mind reading machine, and\u2013No, you wouldn\u2019t be trying it out with me, you\u2019d be doing it with my brother Jack. You know Jack, he-Oh you\u2019ll do it! Great, thanks so much! Why don\u2019t you come on-Oh you\u2019ll do it? Great, I\u2019ll see you soon I guess! Can\u2019t wait until you\u2019re here, bye! What\u2019s that? Oh, right, the address.\u201d Johnny rattled off the address to Cerise. \u201cAll right, now it\u2019s goodbye. Okay. Love you!\u201d He sputtered out as he hung up the phone. He paled once he realized his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a loser, I can\u2019t believe you said that. So she said yes?\u201d Jack asked, rolling his eyes at how awkward his little brother was. He couldn\u2019t believe that this dweeb and him had the same parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s on her way over right now I guess.\u201d While on the outside he was trying to play it cool, inside Johnny was bursting with excitement. He couldn\u2019t believe that his crush was going to be here, in his lab! It was a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope she\u2019s still coming after that little performance you gave.\u201d Jack almost felt bad for Johnny. He knew this was kind of a mean prank, but he felt it was necessary to get Johnny out of his shell a little bit. \u201cWhy are you so nervous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always nervous whenever I show my experiments to people from school. I mean, I\u2019m confident that it will work but the last thing I want to do is screw this up in front of the prettiest girl in school.\u201d Johnny cringed as he\u2019d realized his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you think Cerise is pretty? Is Johnny nervous around a pretty girl?\u201d Jack probed, relishing the chance to poke fun at his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Jack.\u201d Johnny felt the sting of Jack\u2019s words because to some extent they were true. Johnny wasn\u2019t antisocial but he was far more comfortable with his lab than with a girl, he just didn\u2019t know what to say to them! For all of his genius, women were the one thing he could never seem to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack chuckled. \u201cMaybe you should use that mind reading machine on me, figure out how I do it with the ladies.\u201d He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny paused. That\u2026 wasn\u2019t such a bad idea actually. Jack had tons of game around girls and was constantly getting dates and hookups, and scoping out some of his secrets was an intriguing concept. True Johnny didn\u2019t have Jack\u2019s looks and physique, but any help he could get with girls would certainly be useful. Should he try the machine with Jack before Cerise got there?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know, we do have a little bit of time before Cerise gets here. Maybe we could take the machine for a test run?\" Johnny had gotten it into his head that by reading Jack's mind he could somehow pick up tips on how to interact with girls, and though Johnny tried to ask the question as innocently as possible, Jack picked up on the subtext.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you're not seriously thinking about trying to read my mind and figure out how to get with girls, right? God you're even more of a loser than I thought. It's not that hard! Just put yourself out there more and put some effort into your appearance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt for his brother, he really did. It couldn't be easier to be smarter than everyone else, and Jack had seen Johnny be a little alienated from his peers because of it. But at the same time, Johnny wasn't helping himself! He spent all day cooped up in his lab downstairs working on his crazy experiments, it's no wonder he was socially awkward, not to mention somewhat pale and pasty. Johnny wasn't an ugly dude, and if he put a bit of work in he could get some decent attention. Jack wished that he would get out a bit more and experience the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that I just need to be more handsome? Is that it?\" Johnny sighed. \"Gee thanks Jack, that's really encouraging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't just get girls because of my looks Johnny,\" Jack fired back \"It's about attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! And this could help me learn a bit of that. Come on Jack. Please?\" Johnny gave his brother his best puppy dog eyes. It was pathetic, but sometimes pathetic pays off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, anything for my little bro. But you owe me after this!\" Jack hoped that he didn't regret this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and Jack and Johnny were hooked up to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're an idiot</i> Jack thought. \"Did you get that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not getting anything. Try thinking it harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me John, I'm thinking it pretty hard.\" Jack snickered. \"It's not working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure why, let me take a look at the settings.\" Johnny wheeled his chair over the machine and began to examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better fix it before Cerise gets here. You don't want her thinking that you're more crazy than you already are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sighed. Since his mind reading machine wasn't working and he didn't have to worry about being heard, he let his thoughts drift as he stared at the control panel. Jack's words to him had stung. He was a genius, he knew that, but sometimes it felt like nobody respected him because of how he looked. If he were a tall, handsome, and imposing figure he knew people wouldn't make fun of him as much. And as much as his older brother irritated him, he had a point. If only he could be a little more like on Jack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I take this shit off?\" Jack asked, a note of impatience in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just try this one thing.\" Johnny called back. \"I think it might fix my problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that, he flipped a switch on the machine. The world got funny for a second.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny blinked for a second. Hadn't he been looking at the control panel? Why was he all the way on the opposite side of the room? And why did he feel so big? And tight? He glanced down at his body and gasped in shock. Instead of the Star Wars t-shirt he'd been wearing earlier, he saw a tight v-neck stretched out over a pair of massive pectorals. His hands were huge, and they were attached to arms that were even huger. In shock, he flexed one of his arms and watched as a massive bicep inflated. He was ripped! Had the machine fried his brain and he'd died and gone to heaven?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, disoriented for a moment by how tall he was now. He was still hooked up to the machine, so he must still be in his workshop. He lumbered his way over to the mirror he kept on the wall (still unused to his new size) and gasped in shock as he saw his reflection. He recognized that strong jaw, those chiseled features, that perfect hair... Jack was staring at him from inside the mirror! Was he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention was drawn to someone else screaming at the other side of the room. They looked familiar. It looked like... it looked like himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, what the fuck did you do!\" His doppelg\u00e4nger cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" He asked. Instinctively, he raised his hands, prepared to fight if things got ugly, and he grinned as he saw his muscles flexing. He must look so cool right now! The copy of him balked at this display, but seemed to angry to be afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jack! What the fuck is going on?\" Jack screamed as he ran his hands over his body. This didn't feel right. Where were his muscles? Why did he sound like that? Was he wearing glasses? He should have known better than to get mixed up in one of Johnny's experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, it's me, Johnny!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack couldn't believe his ears. Johnny had turned himself into a clone of Jack? Jack knew his brother looked up to him, but this was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... I think we switched bodies?\" Johnny was stunned. Johnny was relieved that he hadn't killed his brother, but he was still stunned. His machine had failed, but had done something even more incredible than he'd anticipated! He'd transferred his mind from his own body into his brother's, and vice versa! His mind raced with the possibilities. This could change the world! Jack was less excited by the possibilities and more concerned with the immediate situation. He rushed over to the mirror and screamed as he saw Johnny staring back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a scrawny weakling loser!\" Jack lifted up the hem of his shirt to reveal a soft tummy. He looked like he was about to cry as he clutched at the thin layer of fat that collected around Johnny's torso. As if in response, Johnny pulled up the hem of his shirt to reveal a tight six-pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got abs!\" Johnny exclaimed. He ran his fingers over them excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop enjoying those! They're mine.\" Jack cried out. His (or rather, Johnny's) face grew red. \"I'll bet you did this on purpose you little creep! You were always jealous of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over yourself Jack. I'm just as freaked out as you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned me into a fucking nerd!\" Jack gestured to his current body in disgust. Not only was he much younger now, he felt bony and flabby in ways he'd never before. Even when he was Johnny's age he'd been in great shape, he really had won the genetic lottery compared to his brother. Something occurred to him and face drained of color. \"Wait, oh my god. Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically, Jack fumbled to undo the buttons on Johnny's jeans. Peeking down at his new equipment, he whimpered. His prized possession was gone and replaced by a pale (literally) imitation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude we have to switch back right now. I can't live like this!\" Jack kicked a chair and winced, cringing as he felt how weak he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Johnny shouted at his brother. He was taken aback for a moment by the power of his new baritone voice, but recovered. \"My body isn't that bad. Besides, your body isn't all that great either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie and we both know it. I'm hot.\" Jack took a moment to walk around his old body and observe himself from angles that he wouldn't normally get to see. He was pleased by what he saw, his workouts had really been paying off! He grinned when he saw his ass, which was downright magnificent from this angle. He kept it tight! No wonder the ladies loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny rolled his eyes at his brother's narcissism, but unfortunately he knew that he was right. With each movement Johnny could feel the power coiled up in Jack's muscular body, the feeling of his massive body expanding with each breath was downright intoxicating. He felt incredible! He literally felt incredible, he thought, as his hands drifted across Jack's form feeling his big muscles. The rush of hormones and emotions he was feeling was causing a reaction from Jack's penis, and while he didn't want to look at it in front of his brother it felt... heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop feeling me up dude! That's gay.\" Jack stormed over to his brother and tried to slap his own hands away from his body. Instinctively, Johnny moved to block him, and they both stared in shock as Johnny used his new muscles to effortlessly stop Jack's assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's just... God, this is so cool, isn't it?\" Johnny grinned as Jack yanked his arm away from him. He wasn't used to being the strong one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool for you maybe! You got an upgrade! Meanwhile I'm stuck in this schlubby body. Get me out now.\" Jack was pissed, but he had no power in this situation. He was smaller, weaker, younger, and didn't know enough about the machine to switch them back. He had just lost everything and he was feeling a little scared as he stared at his own handsome face, which was staring thoughtfully into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was conflicted. On the one hand Johnny was honestly kind of freaked out. This wasn't what his machine was for, so he was in uncharted waters here. He didn't know if it was safe to switch them back, or if there would be side effects to the switch, or any number of problems that occurred to his super intelligent mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, this was kind of amazing! Hadn't he just been wishing that he could experience life as a tall, handsome jock like his brother? This was his chance! Plus perhaps a few days in his admittedly less impressive body would humble Jack a little.He subtly squeezed his new bicep and marveled at how huge it was. He could have a lot of fun with this body, and he'd never have a better chance with Cerise as he did right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, Cerise would be over soon! He had to make a decision before she arrived. What would he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say anything, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's me.\" Johnny recognized that voice. It was Cerise! \"Are you guys in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerise!\" Johnny squeaked with Jack's deep voice. He called out meekly. \"Y-yes, we're inside!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise perked up as she heard Jack's baritone rumble from behind the door. She'd always thought men with deep voices were sexy. \"Would you mind opening the door for me?\" She asked as sweetly as possible. \"It's locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just, give us a second.\" Johnny's words were cut short as Jack leapt up and slammed his hand over his brother's mouth, shushing him. He didn't like that he had to stand on his toes to do so, and he liked even less that Johnny was able to push him away so effortlessly. Those were his muscles, damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dude, we can't let her in here!\"</i> He whispered angrily to Johnny. <i>\"We have to fix this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can fix this right now and I can't just leave her standing out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then tell her to go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Johnny cried, a little too loudly. He blushed self-consciously at how much power his new pipes had and lowered his voice again. \"She's a guest, Jack. It would be rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny I think that us <i>being in the wrong bodies</i> is a little more important than your fucking schoolboy crush.\" Jack couldn't believe how crazy his brother was acting. He didn't want to spend any more time in his brother's scrawny body than he needed to, and he especially didn't need an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny knew Jack was right, the situation was crazy and potentially dangerous. He couldn't meet Cerise looking like this! Or... could he? He felt his cock stir in his pants as he thought about it, as if to remind him of the impressive tool he now had at his disposal. Suddenly it all clicked into place for him. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tough!\" Johnny snapped. \"It's my machine, I'm the bigger brother now, and I say we let her in. What are you gonna do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two glared at each other, each daring the other to back down. This had been a familiar scene in the Mack household growing up, the two boys at odds with each other. Jack as the much bigger brother had always won, of course, but the tables were turned now. His biggest advantage (and everything else big about him) had been transferred over to his brother, who was quite literally flexing his power (and muscles!) for the first time in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Jack said finally. Johnny grinned. It felt good to be the big man! \"Then we need a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. What do we do Jack? What do we tell her when she comes in?\" Johnny looked to his big brother, who had planted himself at his desk with a pouty expression. Johnny made a mental note to never do that once he was back in his body because it looked ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me! You're in charge now, right?\" Jack rolled his eyes. Johnny had picked a really bad time to stand up for himself, and if he wanted to call the shots, fine! Jack wasn't gonna make it easy for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny considered the situation. He wasn't sure if he could effectively pretend to be Jack. Looks would only take him so far, and Johnny knew he was still his awkward self underneath all of the muscle, and no matter how big his dick was he knew he was awful at talking to girls. He knew that with the handsome visage of his brother his chances with Cerise would skyrocket, but Cerise might still think he was a freak. He could tell her up front about his new device/what it had done and hope that she'd be impressed, or he could pretend to be Jack and hedge his bets that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, there were Jack's feelings to consider. Could he trust Jack not to embarrass him using his own body?</span></div></div>",

You're not cool enough to pretend to be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny opened the door to the shack and let Cerise in \"H... hi Cerise... c... come in!\" Johhny blushed as he stuttered. Jack was right. He was still a dork even in Jack's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK Jack? You seem flustered!\" Cerise said concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rolled his eyes \"We've swapped bodies! Johnny's latest invention malfunctioned and we're stuck like this until the dork can fix it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise gasped in shock. She had no reason to think the brothers were lying. Johnny was the smartest person she knew. Cerise also planned to take advantage of the situation. She always had a thing for Jack, or more accurately his body. But he wasn't interested, Jack had a lot of options. Cerise knew Johnny had a crush on her and she'd NEVER date such a dork normally, but in Jack's body he'd be putty in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny this is amazing! I've always said you were the smartest person I ever met. And I kinda have a thing for smart guys!\" Cerise lied, only one thing on her mind and that was Jack's body. Cerise got up close to Johnny and put her hand on his rock hard abs causing him to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two! Stop that right now!\" Jack shouted from his scrawny body. He was not happy how close Cerise and Johnny were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise sneared at Jack \"Oh shut up! You should be proud of your little brother. This invention of his could make your family rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had had enough \"That's it! I'm telling mom what you've done! You're dead meat!\"  Jack then ran out of the shack and back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Jack was gone Cerise, her hand still on Johnny's new abs kissed Johhny on the lips. Johhny blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you're so cute Johnny!\" Cerise teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny blushed even harder \"I... I should really f... f... fix the machine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise then lowered her hand to the impressive bulge that now belonged to Johnny and began to massage it sensually. \"What's the rush? Jack never deserved that body. I think you should keep it a bit longer. You can fix the machine after we've had some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's eyes just went wide with fear... and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had finally found his mom Carla cooking in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. You've got to come to the shack right now!\" Jack yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you calm down Johnny! I'll come out in a minute when dinner is in the oven!\" Carla snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom! I'm not Johnny. I'm Jack. Johnny's latest invention went wrong and we swapped bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla wasn't surprised, she knew her son would finally invent something useful. Something she could use for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla raised and eyebrow interested \"Really?! That's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was not happy with his mom's reaction \"Mom! Johnny's in my body and he's in the shack alone with Cerise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla giggled \"Oh chill out Jack! Let your brother have some fun for a change!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was not happy, Carla was already thinking about finding a 'volunteer' to swap with and Johnny was about to have the time of his life with Cerise.</span></div></div>",

So I'll hide, you'll pretend to be me and deal with Cerise.\" Jack began to protest but Johnny quickly silenced him with a hand over his mouth. He could get used to being the bigger brother! \"This way nobody has to know my machine broke and nobody has to see me as you. Everybody wins! Then I'll switch us back once she's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny removed his hand from Jack's mouth, prompting his older brother to hiss \"I don't even know how to work the machine!\" at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently I didn't either!\" Johnny said. \"Don't actually do anything, just fake it. Fiddle with the buttons, throw some technical jargon out there, act like it didn't work, tell her to come back later. You're a Mack, improvise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play that 'you're a Mack' card on me,\" Jack snapped. \"For a 'genius' this is a pretty dumb plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do it or else I'll dress your body up in a tutu and parade it through town square.\" Johnny threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes narrowed. \"You wouldn't dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how you'd look in pink.\" Johnny rose up onto his tip toes and stick his hands in the air in a dramatic mock-ballet pose. The sight of his body, the muscular paragon of masculinity, en pointe, was bizarre. \"Picture it with a ribbon in your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny and Jack shared a few seconds of heated eye contact. Jack was beyond irritated with his little brother, but at the same time, it was growing increasingly apparent that Johnny held all the cards here. He was relying on Johnny to fix this gizmo to get his body back, and he didn't want Johnny messing up his personal and professional life. Plus... maybe it wouldn't hurt to give Johnny a little bit of help with Cerise. In spite of how annoying he was being Johnny was a decent kid, and maybe some female attention would help him act a bit more normal. Even if he was working with Johnny's considerably more limited goods (he'd have to have a talk with Johnny about the benefits of cardio once they switched back) the old Jack Mack charm had worked on many a girl before, and he was confident he could get some kind of spark going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Jack grumbled, rolling his eyes as Johnny did a fist pump. \"But for the record, my ass would look great in tights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" Johnny yanked his old body off the ground and into a hug. Jack rolled his eyes, but couldn't keep himself from grinning a little bit. Setting Jack back on the ground, Johnny took off running towards the back of the shack, his flailing limbs even managing to make Jack's otherwise gracefully athletic body look awkward. He paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and Jack.\" Johny towards Jack, who rolled his neck and looked exasperatedly back at his (now older) brother. \"If you embarrass me in front of Cerise, I'll get a neck tattoo.\" Jack blanched and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling the nastiest grin he'd ever smiled, Johnny opened a door and ducked into...</span></div></div>",

If he leaned in close he would be able to hear everything that happened in there (fortunately he had never gotten around to soundproofing the shed like his parents begged him to) and he could peek in through the window if need be. If he was careful he'd be able to keep track of everything going on without Cerise noticing him. All that he had to do now was pray that Jack would hold up his end of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door frame groaned a little bit as he leaned on it, and Johnny made a note not to press his full weight on it. Pressing his ear gently against the door frame, he began eavesdropping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack threw open the door to the shed, and took in the sight of Cerise Jones, her dark skin glistening in the sunlight. She was a tall (taller than his current body, Jack noted) girl so Jack had to angle his head up a bit to meet her eyes. He straightened his back. Just because he was in the body of a dork doesn't mean he needed to act like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Cerise!\" He said. He puffed his chest out, and while it was nothing compared to his old body, it did wonders to make him look less pathetic. Cerise eyed him strangely. \"Thank you for coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your brother Jack here?\" She asked, craning her neck to look around the shack. \"I thought I heard him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;If only you knew...&lt;/i&gt; Jack thought to himself. \"No, Jack's not here. He's way too busy to hang out with a dweeb like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say a lot of things.\" Jack said, cutting her off. \"I thought you'd be able to test the machine with him but he had to head out. It's just gonna be you and me today. I hope that's not a problem.\" He met her eyes as he said this, and she was taken aback by the unflinching eye contact from someone who was usually so shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right Johnny?\" Cerise asked. Johnny looked off somehow, though not necessarily in a bad way. Everyone in town knew that an invitation to the Mack residency usually lead to trouble and it crossed her mind briefly that perhaps Johnny had invented some kind of cloning device and this was some kind of evil twin situation, but the idea was absurd even for Johnny. \"You seem... different, today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack resisted the urge to roll his eyes. \"Well Cerise, how am I usually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" She paused, unsure of how to answer the question. \"I don't know really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jack replied, gesturing for Cerise to enter the shack. \"Let's get to know each other a little better.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little bit later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise was currently strapped into Johnny\u2019s machine, studying him as he fiddled with his mind reading device. He had spent the last half-hour babbling on about the machine to her and while she didn\u2019t understand most of it, she found herself strangely captivated. She and Johnny had talked a bit about things other than his inventions and she\u2019d found herself laughing and hanging off of his words; turns out he wasn\u2019t just smart, he was funny. Charming. Something about the gentle, yet forceful way he had helped her into the device intrigued her. It was so\u2026 un-Johnny-like. Normally he was a nervous wreck but something about this cool confidence he had today was messing with her head. The Johnny she was used to mumbled and shrank into himself when she was around, but today he was bold and confident and it was messing with her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never paid him much mind, but now that he wasn\u2019t hiding his face she could get a good look and him and had never noticed it before but Johnny did resemble his brother a little bit. Obviously Jack was taller, handsomer, and built like an athlete, but they were brothers and as Cerise stared at him the similarities grew more pronounced. The same sandy colored hair, the same nose, and every now and then as he turned his head and the light caught him just right she saw a glimpse of what she found so appealing in his more conventionally attractive brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Jack pressed random buttons on the computer, pretending he knew how to work it, he thought about the situation. He\u2019d decided to go above and beyond the call of duty for his little brother and do a bit of flirting with Cerise, trying to do the groundwork for them to maybe get a little bit closer once they were back in their real bodies. Jack had met plenty of girls like Cerise in high school and in college, gorgeous girls who had developed icy exteriors, and he knew exactly how to defrost them. But Cerise had been very receptive to (what she thought was) Johnny\u2019s flirtations. Once they\u2019d warmed up to each other a little bit she\u2019d really surprised him with her attitude and sense of humor. Perhaps there was a bit more to her than she let on, maybe she and Johnny WOULD be a good match for each other. Chalk one up for the dweeb. He glanced up from the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me.\u201d Jack said, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Cerise was shaken out of her thoughts and she realized that she had indeed been staring. She thanked her parents for blessing her with dark skin, which helped to hide the blush that she felt rise in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d He asked nonchalantly. &lt;i&gt;The Jack Mack Charm\u2122 is irresistible.&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled coyly at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t your machine supposed to tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA man can never really tell what a woman is thinking.\u201d Jack fired back, meeting her eyes and giving her a lopsided smile in return. &lt;i&gt;Ugh, this is so corny&lt;/i&gt; he thought to himself. \u201cBut it looks like the machine isn\u2019t working anyways. You know how it is with these crazy inventions, sometimes I get so far into my own head I just end up going absolutely crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that. I still haven\u2019t fully forgiven you for the flowers you gave me!\u201d She teased, reminding him of the ill-conceived flowers he'd once planted in her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;Flowers?&lt;/i&gt; Jack thought to himself. Probably one of Johnny\u2019s screw ups, it was getting hard to keep count. Cerise noticed his brow furrow and mistook it for a look of disappointment, and took pity on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least it wasn\u2019t a fiasco like the flying ice cream machine was.\u201d She offered. Both of them shuddered. Everyone in town remembered the flying ice cream machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, at least it wasn\u2019t that! Sorry about the\u2026 the flowers thing, by the way. I\u2019m getting a bit too old for this \u2018teen genius\u2019 thing.\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s time I grew up a bit, got out of this shack and took an interest in\u2026 more mature pursuits.\u201d He added a bit of suggestiveness to this last statement, but looked innocently up at the ceiling as he said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Cerise gasped, not even bothering to hide her shock. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d hear Johnny Mack, inventor whiz kid, say that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Jack said, raising his voice a bit to make sure Johnny could hear them in the backyard. \u201cMaybe my brother Jack is right. Maybe if I got out of this lab more and stopped acting like such a total freakazoid I could have a chance with a pretty girl like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise was further shocked. Not about the pretty thing (she knew she was pretty, she owned a mirror) but about the rest of it. Johnny opening up to her like this was so unexpected but\u2026 Maybe, in a weird sort of way his mind reading machine had worked, because she found herself speaking her mind in a way she didn\u2019t usually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so, I don\u2019t want you getting the wrong idea from this,\u201d she began. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been super cool to me this afternoon and I feel comfortable right now and I swear if you tell ANYONE at school that I said this I\u2019ll 100% deny it but\u2026 don\u2019t give up on your inventions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack was taken aback. Of all the things Cerise could have said, he hadn\u2019t been expecting that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I mean, obviously they\u2019re crazy and always cause a shit-ton of trouble,\u201d Cerise said. \u201cBut I have a bit of a soft spot for them. I mean, I think it\u2019s super cool that you do them. I wish I was half as smart as you are, and even if I was I don\u2019t think I could do the things you do. Like, how many guys our age want to do something with their lives and change the world like you do? You\u2019re\u2026\u201d she hesitated for a moment, before mumbling out this final part. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of a cool dude Johnny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jack\u2019s turn to be shocked. He was embarrassed to admit he\u2019d never thought of his brother\u2019s exploits like that; they had always just been a nuisance to him rather than, as he now realized, something that made his brother happy. Cerise was perceptive and although she tried to pretend like she didn\u2019t, she must care about his brother a lot. A strange silence hung in the air after she finished speaking as both of them thought about what had been said.</span></div></div>",

His new body was causing him more problems than he'd anticipated, he was carrying a lot more mass than he was used to and he kept accidentally bumping into the shack because he forgot how broad his shoulders were. He was too heavy to lean on the door frame (he'd never realized how flimsy his lab was, it really was just a shack) so Johnny had ended up seated on the ground, which he also struggled to make comfortable. Genetics and a dedicated squat routine had given Jack something of a bubble butt so Johnny wasn't exactly lacking padding, but those same genetics had given Johnny another problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny shifted again, splaying his legs out wide in front of him to make room for his new genitals. Sighing, Johnny stared down at the offending bulge in his shorts. He poked it. Johnny didn't like to think about his body much but he considered his manhood to be average (okay... below average, but not by too much) and it never gave him problems like this. Jack's privates were annoyingly &lt;i&gt;present&lt;/i&gt;, and it was distracting Johnny. As if he didn't already have an inferiority complex, he didn't need to know that his brother was hung as well. It was hard to believe that he and Jack were in the same family! It was like Jack had taken all of the big dick genes in the womb and left Johnny with the scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouldn't be too ungrateful of course, his intellect was his gift much like Jack's body was his. But having spent a bit of time in Jack's body, jealousy seemed like the natural reaction. He couldn't help himself; he flexed his arm again, watching the huge bicep inflate. Lifting both arms he struck an exaggerated double bicep pose, like a body builder. No wonder Jack worked out so much, he felt like a super hero. He ran his hands over Jack's body, surveying each muscle he found. It was a bit odd to be feeling up his brother like this, but he chose to think of it in a more academic sense. This was his once in a lifetime opportunity to examine the male body at peak physical performance from the inside, a bold extension of his experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conclusion? Being ripped was fucking awesome. He ran his hands over his abs (because he had abs!) and grinned like a little kid. Of all of his failed experiments this was definitely turning out to be the most fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a shadow fell over him. Johnny looked up, squinting in the sun, and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny looked up to see an Asian guy who looked to be around Jack's age, sporting a blue t-shirt and some shorts. He was very tall but didn't seem very threatening; he had a big dopey grin on his face and eyes that seemed kind, but perhaps not the brightest. He was staring down at Johnny with amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh, you having fun there dude?\" He asked. Johnny became acutely aware of where his hands were placed (he had frozen with one around his thigh and the other slipped under his shirt groping one of his pecs) and scrambled to his feet. He awkwardly flailed his hands around as his brain short circuited trying to remember where normal human beings usually kept their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2013I was just\u2013I mean\u2013\" He stammered before finally blurting out \"Who are you exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man rolled his eyes. \"Ha ha, very funny dude. Sorry for dropping by unannounced, I'll give you a heads up next time so I don't interrupt one of your make out sessions with yourself.\" Johnny blushed and looked down at the grass. The man chuckled and gave Johnny a playful punch to the shoulder. \"Hey, if I looked like you did I'd probably spend all day touching myself too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohny stared awkwardly at the man in front of him, who he had figured out by now was probably one of Jack's friends. \"Did you... did you like need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's friend smiled widely at Johnny. \"That's Jack, always straight to the point. I was on my way to the park when I noticed your car parked outside and figured I'd drop in. Back gate still works like it used to when we were kids.\" The dude paused to look around the backyard. \"Man, it's been ages since I've been back here. Your brother still do weird science shit in the shack?\" He asked, moving towards the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, Johnny grabbed the man before he could get into the sideline of the window. This dude seemed to be in shape but he was nothing compared to Jack, and with his new muscles Johnny fond it easy to maneuver him back towards the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Johnny's working on something in there right now, it's REALLY important that we don't bother him.\" Johnny didn't stop pushing him as he said this, continuously ushering Jack's friend towards the gate he came in through and away from potential embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit that's perfect!\" The dude slipped out of Johnny's grasp and wheeled around to face him. \"You wanna come with me to the park? Arnie's gonna be there, we were gonna play basketball with some of the other guys. You gotta come, it's been ages since we all balled.\" Johnny had made it a point to avoid Jack's friends, but this guy seemed friendly enough. Almost too friendly, Johnny had never met someone who smiled as much as this guy did. As if to prove his point, Jack's friend's smile widened even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny opened his mouth to shoot the man down, but then paused. Wasn't this the perfect opportunity to get to know Jack better? Wasn't that the whole point of the machine to begin with? An afternoon as a hotshot jock playing basketball with the boys was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Jack always said he wanted Johnny to get out of the lab and socialize, so really, this was exactly what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus he was getting antsy sitting here. He'd always found it a bit obnoxious how Jack would randomly begin stretching or doing some kind of minor exercise thing when he was trying to talk to him, but he understood it now. Jack's body was brimming with energy, it wasn't meant to be sitting around cramped up like this. After spending the last half hour feeling up his borrowed muscles he wanted to take them for a test drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, he wasn't confident leaving. Although things seemed to be going well between Jack and Cerise, Johnny didn't know if he could trust Jack not to screw this up. By leaving he risked pissing Jack off, which could backfire horribly. And something else to consider was that he still didn't know if there would be any side effects to the machine yet, so it might be best to stay close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he do?</span></div></div>",

Will try to get back ASAP, wait for me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't forget, if you mess things up with Cerise, neck tattoo.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw Jack's friend staring at him with another perplexed expression. Did this guy only have two faces? Johnny raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You type fast.\" The guy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Let's go\u2013\" Johnny paused, unsure of what to call this guy. What would Jack say? \"...bro.\" The word felt unfamiliar in his mouth, he nearly cringed as he said it, but it seemed to satisfy the man. He followed his \"bro\" out of the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the advantages of living in the suburbs was that you were never far from a park, so the walk over there was relatively brisk. (And, as Johnny thought about it, it was probably faster because he and his companion were both very tall.) Johnny got to know Jack's friend on the way, he still didn't know his name but he was starting to piece together who this guy was. He kept mentioning people whose names Johnny vaguely recognized from growing up, so he must have known Jack for a long time. The dude clearly wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed but he seemed to have a LOT of opinions on professional sports and people that Johnny didn't know, leaving Johnny feeling like the stupid one at times. Eventually the topic turned to superhero movies, a topic both of them could agree on, and the conversation flowed more naturally from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind Johnny had built up his brother's friends to be uniformly pigheaded jocks, and while there was some truth to that (at one point Johnny had mentioned that Metamorpho from The Outsiders had the power of \"transfiguration\" at one point and the dude had responded that he supported all genders) Johnny was actually getting along really well with this guy. He was so infectiously cheerful that Johnny found himself laughing along even when he didn't understand what he was saying (he suspected the opposite was also true) and he arrived at the park in a very good mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed to the basketball court where several men around Jack's age were playing basketball. A guy was seated on the benches beside the court; he had his headphones in and wasn't really paying attention to the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yooooo, Arnie!\" Johnny started as his companion suddenly bellowed. The guy on the bench lifted his head from his phone and nodded towards the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Damien! Didn't realize you were bringing Jack.\" He greeted them, grabbing a basketball and jogging over to the tree they stood beside. Johnny sighed with relief, at least he knew his new friend's name! This must Arnie, the guy Jack's friend (Damien, Johnny now guessed) had mentioned earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked the guy up and down: he was shorter than both of them, probably around the same height that Johnny was in his old body. He was a slender fellow who seemed less athletic than the people Jack usually hung around with, with long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail behind him. His brown eyes were awake and alert behind his glasses as they darted between Jack and Damien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Arnie.\" He said to the newcomer. Arnie looked at him puzzled for a second, but before he could say anything Damien cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Arnie, help me and Jack decide something: Static Shock versus Black Lightning, who wins?\" Damien said, continuing the argument he and Johnny had begun on the way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they fight?\" Arnie said with a lopsided grin. \"They're in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny snorted and Damien's brow furrowed. \"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god it was a joke.\" Arnie said, rolling his eyes. He made eye contact with Johnny in a <i>\"can you believe this guy?\"</i> kind of way before continuing on. \"But seriously, it depends. Black Lightning has more firepower but Static has more versatility. Depends who gets the first shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I said!\" Johnny exclaimed. \"See Damien, this guy gets it.\" He turned to Arnie excitedly, ready to nerd out. \"I suppose it also depends on the canon we're talking about, because if we're referring to the original Bronze Age interpretation wherein he derives his powers from his belt rather than latent metahuman genes, then\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you two are making shooting lightning sound sooo lame.\" Damien said, cutting him off. \"Weren't we supposed to be playing basketball? I can understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were supposed to be playing but SOMEBODY was late.\" Arnie said, shooting Damien of them an accusatory look, which of course had no effect on Damien's ever present grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I picked up this dude on the way over. Had to get the boys back together!\" He said, and as if to prove his point he reached out and yanked both of them playfully into a headlock. Johnny was startled for a moment, then laughed, and using his new muscles he easily wrestled his way out of Damien's grip. Arnie, who was not similarly endowed, struggled under Damien's armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go Damien!\" Arnie said, futilely struggling to get away from his much stronger friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh bro! You gotta say uncle!\" Damien said, reaching down and giving Arnie a noggie. Arnie squawked and flailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let him go man.\" Johnny said, taking pity on the poor guy. He'd been in that position quite a few times and he knew how unpleasant it was, even between friends. Obeying his command Damien dropped Arnie, who landed in a squall on the ground. Johnny extended his hand to Arnie, who looked at him curiously before clasping it and rising to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting too old for this Damien.\" Arnie said as he dusted himself off, his tone unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bro.\" Damien said, in what was probably the least cheerful tone Johnny had heard from him since they'd met. He seemed genuinely sorry. \"I forget sometimes you don't like to play rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, we've only known each other for how many years now?\" Arnie's voice was lacking malice, it seemed like he was used to this kind of thing. \"Besides, we had English class together, I know it takes you longer to understand things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, burn!\" Damien said, bursting out laughing again. Johnny smiled at the two of them. Jack's friends were pretty cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, anyways, about the basketball.\" He said, glancing over at the court. \"Who are we up against?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that. Some dudes from the community college took over the court but they said we could play with them when you got here. The game is shirts and skins. Sorry, I told them we'd be shirts because I don't wanna take my shirt off in public but... \" His voice trailed off and he stared at Johnny. Johnny wasn't sure what to do so he figured he'd just go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, I respect your decision.\" Johnny replied. If this shirt got ruined with sweat, well, it wasn't his shirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they any good?\" Damien asked. The three boys looked over at the court to see one of the guys sink a shot from halfway across the court. They glanced at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine.\" Damien said. \"We have our secret weapon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" Arnie tossed the ball at him, and Johnny narrowly caught it before it smacked him in the chest. He stared down at the ball in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap.</i> He thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cerise wasn't sure what had gotten in to her. Johnny had been helping her with getting unhooked from the machine and his hand had brushed her neck and she just couldn't help herself.  Maybe the years of Johnny trailing behind her like a puppy dog had worn her down and this was pity, maybe she was just in a weird head space because she'd come over here fully ready for some action, maybe she genuinely really liked him. She wasn't sure, but without thinking too hard about it she'd leaned in and kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed shocked at first (of course he did, shy little guy) but he was going to town enthusiastically. Who would have thought that Johnny, who she figured had never kissed a girl in his life, would be such a good kisser? Slipping her hands under his shirt she let them roam his body; he felt a lot different than the guys she usually made out with, a lot softer and bonier, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world. What an interesting afternoon this was turning out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, for his part, was never one to turn down a make out session. This wasn't at all where he'd expected the day to go, Johnny must be losing his mind in the backyard! He so owed Jack after this. Jack would just warm her up a little bit so when they switched back, she'd be hungry for more. To punctate this thought he planted a kiss on her neck. Could black girls get hickeys, he wondered? Was it racist that he didn't know? Either way she was eating the attention up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him was relieved to know that he could still get a chick without his good looks, but the rest of him was disappointed to be doing this with Johnny's decidedly less impressive body. He'd usually have his shirt off by this point but with Johnny's body he wasn't sure if that would turn her on or off. However when he felt her hands at the button of his jeans, he groaned. He couldn't, right? Using Johnny's body like this would be crossing a line. Reluctantly, he pushed her away from him and she collapsed back into the chair behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can't.\" He protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cerise was shocked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just mean, maybe we should take it slow.\" He said. Cerise seemed to pick up some innuendo from this and advanced upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Johnny.\" She purred, tracing one finger down his chest and towards his... \"Nice and slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack swallowed a moan (Johnny's dick was a tiny, traitorous fellow) and pushed away. He ran behind a table this time; he needed to create some distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just\u2013 You wouldn't understand.\" He picked up Johnny's phone, which had been left on the table, and stared at it so he wouldn't have to meet her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're turning me down?\" She asked. \"ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not rejecting you it's just, like, I dunno, a raincheck?\" She stared at him, dumbfounded. Johnny Mack had been after her for years and now that she decided to give him a chance, he's shutting her down? And now he couldn't even look at her? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's mood shifted as he stared at the text on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little bitch!\" He cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Cerise said. Jack turned to face her, a devilish grin on his face. Johnny wanted to run off and fuck around with his friends? Two could play at that game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, forget what I said about taking it slow.\" He said. He grasped Cerise by the back and yanked her in close, pressing their lips together and sinking his tongue deep into her mouth. Cerise resisted for a moment, then shrugged and leaned in. This whole encounter had been weird, she might as well go with it. She tried to deepen the kiss, but he suddenly broke off and pulled back. \"You're eighteen, right?\" She nodded. \"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack placed his hands under her (nice) rear and tried to lift her up to straddle him, before awkwardly realizing that that wasn't a maneuver Johnny's body was capable of pulling off. If only he had his real body! Instead he shoved the two of them forward and Cerise ended up sprawled back onto a table, and he slotted in between her legs. She squealed as he placed his hands on her breasts, but allowed it. Things were heating up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither one of them realized the controls for the device on the table next to them, dangerously closed to Cerise's head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One second Jack and Cerise were living every teenager's fantasy of dry humping a shack then there was a flash and suddenly they found their positions reversed. They had continued making out for a few seconds, almost out of inertia, but when they registered what was wrong both of them screamed. The two broke apart, Jack slamming back onto the table and Cerise stumbling backwards and landing on her ass on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise felt gross, flabbier than she'd ever been and with a strange throbbing sensation in her crotch. As she stared up at her doppelg\u00e4nger she glanced down to see what it was, and recognized the body beneath her. <i>No...</i> she thought. She scrambled to her feet and lurched towards the mirror in the corner, struggling to walk with her new limbs. She shrieked again when she saw her reflection, the noise coming out several octaves lower than she would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck did you do?\" Cerise screamed, staring at Johnny's somewhat pasty face in the mirror. Her eyes scanned his body, pausing when they reached the bulge in his crotch. That must be his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the second time today Jack had been taken from one body to another and he didn't like it any better the second time around. Jack had thought it was tragic when he'd traded his original manhood for Johnny's, but he'd have to apologize to Johnny because even having a small dick was better than having <i>none.</i> For someone who prided himself on his manhood (in every sense of the word) feeling an emptiness in his crotch was terrifying, and he didn't even want to begin to think about how <i>moist</i> it felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clutched at Cerise's breasts, which were now HIS breasts. They were really nice boobs, and ordinarily he'd be thrilled to be touching them but he was decidedly less enthusiastic about it when they were part of his body. Strangely enough he actually felt <i>stronger</i> in Cerise's body, which was toned and muscled from her cheerleader training, but that was just a consolation prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The machine must have accidentally fired off and switched our bodies. Don't worry I can fix this.\" He hopped off the table and scurried around to examine the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise didn't bother to turn to face Jack. She was completely engrossed in the mirror, unable to tear her eyes away from her new reflection. Her hands were taking stock of her new body. Johnny certainly was a nerd who spent all day tinkering in his lab. Lifting up his shirt, she stared at his plain torso, sighing when she saw flat, pale flesh where her breasts had been. She arched her back and stared at his nonexistent glutes in disgust. This body was certainly different (and possibly a downgrade) and yet it was strangely... exhilarating. Even a below average dick is fascinating when you've never had one before. Cerise's curiosity got the best of her and she reached towards it. Oh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared hopelessly at the controls for the device. He didn't know how to work this thing, and he might just make everything worse. And as if that wasn't bad enough, his tits were really getting in the way! Johnny picked a terrible time to head out. He heard Cerise clear her throat and looked up. He had been unsure of what to say, but if he'd had anything on his mind it was gone now. Cerise was standing with her hand down her pants, fondling Johnny's dick as she stared at him with a strange, hooded expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you\u2013\" The words died in his throat as he saw Cerise smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about it and I'm VERY upset with you for this Johnny.\" She was slowly advancing on him with a strange expression Jack never wanted to see on his little brother's face again. He was frozen in place as she reached him and began to stroke his hair. \"But I was also thinking, we don't have to let another one of your little accidents spoil our fun, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pushed her back. \"Cerise I'm not gonna make out with John-I mean, myself! That's gross!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" Cerise asked, glancing him up and down greedily. Was this narcissism, she wondered, to be so attracted to herself? \"Or is it a once in a lifetime opportunity we'd be crazy not to take advantage of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached around Jack and rubbed her fingers onto the spot on the back of her (his?) neck that she knew would drive him crazy. Jack's eyes practically rolled up into the back of his head and he moaned, low and heavy even with his new female vocal chords. He felt another hand slipping under his shirt and grabbing his breast and he shuddered, but didn't move to resist. Maybe it was just the unfamiliar teenage girl hormones or maybe it was just that this day had been so crazy so far that this was par for the course at this point but Jack was getting into this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment they were on the floor, on top of each other. They weren't used to their new bodies yet so they were fumbling awkwardly but the haze of new sensations was instilling them with an animal hunger for skin and human contact. As they reached and groped they weren't sure who was grabbing what, and they didn't much care. Jack, who happened to be on top at the moment, pulled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny's bedroom is upstairs.\" He panted, glancing out the window towards the Mack house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise grinned at his use of the third person. \"Well maybe Johnny better show Cerise where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing her by the hand the two rushed out of the shack and towards the house, the door to the shack clattering behind them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny was grinning like a little kid as the game ended. Damien and Arnie were over there whispering with the other team, who were shaking their heads and glancing over at him. Johnny didn't care though, he'd never had that much fun in his life! Maybe Jack had a point about this whole \"working out\" thing because having muscles like this felt incredible. The basketball game had been exhilarating, the other team never stood a chance! All Johnny had to do was come barreling towards them, a wall of muscle, and they'd back out of his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny hadn't even felt the need to pass to his teammates much during the game; he already had the two best wingmen in the world and they were his right and left arms. He stared down at his pumped arms, clenching and unclenching the muscles, and just for good measure he gave his ass a playful slap as well. This whole body was like a machine! The only problem had been his new dick, which had been flopping everywhere during the game. Looking down, he jumped up and down a few times, giggling as he watched the flesh bounce in his shorts. He suspected that Jack usually wore tighter undergarments or something to restrain his business but Johnny had had no such foresight and he was enjoying the novelty of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the man?!\" He called after their retreating opponents while thumping his chest. He spun around to face his new friends. \"That was awesome! I'm so frigging strong!\" He kissed his left bicep and then struck an exaggerated bodybuilder pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie and Damien exchanged a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Arnie asked, quirking one eyebrow and giving Johnny a befuddled glare. Johnny dropped his arms and stared at his new friends. Had he done something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no offense but you were a mess out there today dude.\" Damien's ever present grin had shrunk to better accompany the new look of bemusement he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even I was better than you,\" Arnie said adding afterwards, \"And I suck.\" Damien nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? I was incredible! Did you see how fast I was?\" Johnny said, hopping from one leg to the other just to feel his thighs flexing. \"I scored a slam dunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into the wrong basket.\" Arnie said flatly. Damien snickered and nudged him on the shoulder playfully. \"And you were a ball hog, and you almost tackled the other team like eight times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basketball is a contact sport, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, not like that.\" Damien said. \"What you were doing was like, football.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny frowned. He now had the body for sports, but not the knowledge, and he hadn't anticipated that backfiring on him. Maybe this was more complicated than he'd anticipated? Maybe there was more to being Jack than just being a ripped douchebag. Jack's friends were still staring at him, as if expecting an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you guys ganging up on me like this? I thought you were supposed to be my friends.\" He fired at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just worrying about you bro,\" Damien said. Johnny added \"concerned\" to the list of facial expressions he'd seen the guy use. \"You've been acting really weird today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie began listing things. \"You were insane during the basketball match, you're talking differently, you mentioned comic books even though I know you think that they're stupid\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're shaking your dick around for some reason.\" Damien injected. Arnie looked at him with an expression that read <i>why would you say that</i> and Damien shrugged. \"What? It happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've been calling me Arnie instead of Arnold, which you <i>never</i> do.\" Arnie said, looking Johnny dead in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Arnie is like, our thing.\" Damien slapped Arnie (Arnold?) on the back and he stumbled forwards, flushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Johnny stammered. He kicked himself internally. Jack would never stammer like this! Had he been doing that bad of a job impersonating his brother? If he hadn't already been sweating from the game he'd sure be sweating now. He had to dig himself out of this hole or Jack was going to kill him! \"I mean, everyone has their off days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you though.\" Arnold retorted. \"You're a rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you've usually got your shit <i>together</i> man.\" Damien added. \"I feel like the only time I see you this stressed is when your brother creates some kind of insane experiment and you're worried it's gonna blow up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's eyes widened and he hoped neither of his new friends noticed. Hopefully Damien was too stupid to\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien's eyes lit up. \"Hey weren't you at that shack where your brother makes those right before we came here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it.</i> Johnny thought.</span></div></div>",

Bro! I haven't seen you since you were a kid!\" He exclaimed. He managed to pick Johnny up into the air (which was quite a feat), twirl him around, and place him back on the ground.  He rustled Johnny's hair. \"You had us going for a minute there! How ya doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, fairly well I suppose.\" Johnny said. He let out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. He felt like he'd bonded with these guys over the course of the afternoon and he was worried that they would believe him, or worse, that they'd reject him. Instead they seemed to be taking it in stride. It felt good to share the secret with someone else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible...\" Arnold said. He paced around Johnny, examining him up and down, before seizing Johnny's face and staring into his eyes. Johnny blinked. What was he hoping to see exactly. \"So that's really you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah?\" Johnny said. \"Do you want proof or something? I'd try to tell you something only I'd know but like, we don't know each other that well so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I believe you. We've known Jack since high school, and you're definitely not him.\" Arnold scratched his chin, he looked like he was thinking about something. \"I just didn't think that BODY SWAPPING would be the explanation... This had better not be a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a joke.\" Johnny said defensively. \"And besides, Jack's not that funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh, burn!\" Damien burst out laughing. \"I can't get over this, this is insane! Wait, does this mean that Jack's in your body right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's back at the shack.\" Johnny said. \"He's probably pissed but he can't do anything about because I told him I'd get a tattoo in his body if he pissed me off.\" He smiled at that last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, that's hilarious!\" Damien high-fived Johnny. \"I'm just picturing Jack all scrawny, trying to act all tough.\" Damien was laughing so hard he was starting to tear up. Regaining some of his composure, he wiped the moisture from his eyes. \"Oh shit, sorry I called you scrawny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense taken.\" Johnny replied. He flexed one of his arms. \"Compared to this anyone would be scrawny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah!\" Damien said. \"You lucked out, Jack is super ripped. What's it like in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty awesome.\" Johnny placed his hand on his stomach rubbed his tight six pack. Thinking of Jack's dick, he grinned. \"It's like a vacation from how my old body is, a trip to the sunny shores of Muscle Beach. Every guy dreams of being the jock, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me, I get it!\" Damien replied. \"Hey, compare arms with me.\" He flexed one of his arms and while he was still considerably muscular, he was nowhere as impressive as Jack. Johnny flexed his arm, making Jack's muscles engorge, and held them up next to Damien's. Both of them laughed, reveling in a moment of shared machismo. \"Hey Arnie, get in on this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm... I'm good.\" Arnold replied, looking uncomfortable. \"I'm still processing all this information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegistering that he was making his new friend uncomfortable, Johnny drew back and looked him in the eyes. Damien may be simple but he could tell that Arnie had a bit more going on, and would take a bit more convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry I lied to you guys.\" Johnny offered. \"I just didn't want to tell anyone yet because I wasn't sure how far Jack and I were gonna take this. But I'm really glad I got to share this with you guys because it's like the coolest thing that's ever happened to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna lie dude, it is pretty awesome.\" Damien said. He looked at Arnold with that big, bright smile on his face. \"Right Arnie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is.\" Arnold said. \"You really are a genius Johnny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the cat's out of the bag.\" Johnny said. \"What happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien and Arnold stared at each other as thoughtfully as they could.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After hearing Johnny's explanation, Damien and Arnold demanded that they take him to go see Jack in his old body. When they arrived back at the shack, the door was swinging open on its hinges and Jack and Cerise were nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange, they were here when I left...\" Johnny said. \"Jack must have sent Cerise away and then gone into the house, I'll just message him to meet us out here.\" Johnny whipped out his phone and sent the message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his new friends took in the sight of the inside of the shack. Given how \"noisy\" some of Johnny's inventions could be the shack was something of a local urban legend, akin to, say, a haunted house, or a tunnel you weren't supposed to visit past midnight. Everyone had their own notions of what it would look like but neither one of them had expected it to be so... plain. Other than the machines and papers that were cluttered around the room it resembled what they'd expect a teen's backyard hangout to look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been in here since we were in high school and we'd all sneak back here to smoke, remember Arnie?\" He grinned at his friend. \"You've really switched it up Johnny, it's like, a real lab now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this is some... <i>impressive</i> stuff you've got in here.\" Arnold said. Somewhat disdainfully he bent down to pick some papers up off the floor, and deposited them on a table in a neat stack. Noticing this, Johnny grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's such a mess, I was so invested in finishing my latest invention I haven't had time to clean up. I almost built a robot maid but,\" he shuddered. \"after last time I thought better of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're like, a total mad scientist.\" Damien said. He poked one of the devices. \"What does this one do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that one was supposed to reduce the need for shaving by eliminating hair at the roots,\" Johnny said. \"but it never made it past the testing phase for... reasons.\" Damien withdrew his hand hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stop touching things.\" He said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's the body swapping device?\" Arnold asked, his eyes scanning the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically it's a mind reading device, or at least, it was supposed to be.\" Johnny gestured down at his older brother's bulky body. \"Obviously it didn't work.\" He motioned them towards the device in the center of the room. <i>That's strange,</i> he thought, <i>it looks like it's been used.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it work?\" Arnold asked, leaning closer to examine the device. Damien followed in suit, and even fingered some of the wires before Arnie shot him a look and he dropped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I designed the device to tap into...\" Johnny began to explain the complicated mix of physics and biology he'd utilized in the construction of the device, but noticing the blank stares he was receiving from his companions, he cut his lecture short. \"The end result is that if two people are hooked up to the machine it'll swap their minds. I haven't had the chance to figure out exactly <i>why</i> yet, but it seems to work! I'll have to do more tests before I can draw any conclusions but the implications of the technology are, if you'll excuse the pun, mind boggling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome...\" Damien whispered, staring at Johnny in awe. \"Can we try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-\" Both Arnold and Johnny said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure that's a good idea.\" Johnny continued. \"Jack and I are already mixed up as it is, we don't need more swaps to complicate things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Johnny, don't hog all the fun!\" There was a gleam in Damien's eye that said that he had made his mind up. Damien was always down for a good time, and the coolest toy in the world had just been plopped in front of him. \"Come on Johnny, you said you wanted to test it, right? This is the perfect opportunity! Arnie, back me up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie looked down at his feet. \"I don't know Damien, maybe Johnny is right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But guys\u2013You can't just show a dude a body swapping machine and ask him not to use it! Besides\u2013\" He struck and exaggerated double bicep pose and made a comically \"suave\" expression. \"I'm not Jack, but the ladies have never had any complaints about my body. It'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie's eyes widened and he looked away. \"Seriously dude, you're making this weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Arnie, don't be such a buzzkill.\" Damien said, somehow managing to glare at his friend while still grinning. \"Loosen up a little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Damien fist pumped. \"You hear that Johnny? It's two votes against one, we use the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny relented. \"All right,\" he said. \"who wants to go first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on Arnie, you and me bro.\" Damien said, practically vaulting over a table to get to the machine. He turned to look at his friend, but Arnie shook his head at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting that thing touch me until I know that it works.\" Arnie crossed his arms and planted his feet, staring at Johnny expectantly. \"You've used this thing, what, once? I don't know it's safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll demonstrate with myself and Damien.\" Johnny offered. He wasn't thrilled to be giving up Jack's body so soon, but had his pride and wanted to prove that the machine worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I get to try out Jack's body?\" Damien asked. \"That's even better! I always wondered what it would be like to be that shredded.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two of them were hooked up to the machine, Johnny talked Arnold through how to activate the machine. After a moment, there was a flash, and the two boys looked stunned for a second. Neither of them moved, and Arnie stared at them nervously. Maybe the machine hadn't worked, and he'd just watched his two friends make a huge mistake? Suddenly, both of them jolted back into action. They stared down at their bodies and began patting them down, taking stock of their new inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damien?\" Arnold asked tentatively. Jack's body burst out into a huge smile, and Damien breathed a sigh of relief. That was Damien all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" He exclaimed, leaping up and charging over to the full length mirror to examine himself. He pulled the collar of his shirt down and grinned at the tight muscles he saw packed underneath. He waved his hands all around, staring as the Jack in the mirror followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Arnold asked, cautiously approaching his friend over by the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a sports car! Oh my god, this feels incredible.\" Damien said. He punched the air a few times, experimenting with the power coiled in his new arms. He flexed one of his biceps and ran a hand over it in amazement. \"Shit... look at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Johnny noticed when he stood up was his height. \"Wow, Damien you're really tall.\" Johnny stood on his toes and reached up, hopping a bit as he tried to touch the ceiling. He took a step and tripped over his own feet, barely managing to grab onto a chair for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be careful with that!\" Damien called. \"I want my body back in one piece!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to be careful, it's not my fault you're a giant!\" Johnny yelled. Damien's body was different from Jack's. Despite the height increase he felt much lighter; since Damien didn't seem to devote as much time as Jack did his body was far less bulky. He was still something of a jock though, and his body was still packed with lean, if a little soft, muscle. Surreptitiously, he scoped out Damien's junk. <i>I guess it's not true what they say about Asians</i> he thought to himself. Joining Jack's body over by the mirror, he examined Damien's face, marveling in the novelty of being a different race. He glanced over at his companion. \"Be careful with Jack's body too, if you flex any harder his muscles might pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, but I feel so strong right now!\" As if to demonstrate, Damien reached over and hoisted Arnie off the ground. The smaller boy squawked as Damien lifted him over his head, lifting him up and down a few times as if he were a weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down asshole!\" Arnold screamed, blushing beet red as Damien deposited him on the floor. \"You could probably already do that in your body Damien, I weight like one twenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it was like, way easier.\" Damien said. \"I could probably fireman lift you but Jack can like pick you up over his head. Man, I gotta get to the gym more. If I could lift that I'd never stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing you can't then.\" Arnold said, somewhat disdainfully. \"Ask next time before you decide to manhandle me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, it's just, I feel insane right now!\" Damien exclaimed. \"Look at my fucking ass!\" Damien stuck Jack's perky butt out and grabbed it, squeezing the meat with his hands. Arnold blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it!\" He said, perhaps a little too brusquely. Damien and Johnny glanced at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, buddy, why don't you take a turn as Jack?\" Damien suddenly offered. \"It's fun.\" To illustrate his point he popped Jack's pecs, giggling as his chest bounced up and down beneath his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, trust me, it is.\" Johnny agreed, already somewhat missing feeling the bulk of Jack's muscles on his frame. \"I can easily queue up another swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, it'd be cool to be in your body.\" Damien said to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Arnold asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wanna try being the little guy.\" Damien replied, smiling dopily through what may or may not have been an insult. Arnold stared at him for a moment, then clenched his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Sure. Sounds like a great idea.\" Storming over towards the machine, he plopped down in one of the chairs. \"Hook us up Scotty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, his name is Johnny.\" Damien said, joining his friend on the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's a Star Trek reference.\" Arnold sighed. \"Just do the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny wondered what he'd gotten himself in the middle of, but he was into deep now to stop. He wished that Jack was here to explain something about the strange dynamic between these two (how did they even meet?) but his brother still hadn't responded to his texts. Johnny hoped that Jack wasn't getting up to too much trouble in his body, but then he thought about what he was currently doing and who he was currently occupying and figured that maybe he should be more concerned about what Jack would do to him when they switched back. Shaking his head, he discarded these thoughts and focused on the matter at hand. He activated the device and listened to the increasingly familiar sounds of the machine at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny appreciated the novelty of being able to watch a switch from the outside for once (and from a different angle thanks to Damien's body's height). He watched as the two young men's bodies pulsed for a moment and then became still. The two opened their eyes after a moment, and Arnold's body immediately leapt up and began touching itself. Jack's body sat a bit more still, and gently placed its hands on its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everybody okay?\" Johnny asked. As if in response, Arnold's body leapt up and gave Johnny a cheerful thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never gonna get tired of that!\" Arnold's body exclaimed. Damien's cheerful attitude and mannerisms seemed strange coming out of the usually more reserved Arnold; it was as if Damien's personality was too big for his new form. He ran his hands over Arnold's body. \"I feel so skinny right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's body quietly got up and walked over to the mirror. Arnold leaned in and stared at Jack's face in the mirror, meeting his own eyes with a deep, penetrating gaze. He stared down at his hands in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...\" He mumbled, struggling to process the whole situation. \"How is this possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien was far less existential about the situation, and was instead playing with. Reaching back he removed the hair tie that held Arnold's long hair in place and began playfully tossing his new locks around. He giggled. Taking off his new glasses, he squinted. \"Oh wow, you're blind dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Arnold mumbled, turning slightly to acknowledge his friend but not removing his eyes from the mirror. He lifted the hem of his shirt and stared at Jack's exposed abs, running one hand over them reverently. He looked deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now everybody's all mixed up I guess.\" Johnny remarked. \"Maybe we ought to get name tags, like in that one episode of <i>Farscape</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, don't be too much of a nerd in my body bro.\" Damien said. Johnny laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, you've got a pretty nice body Damien,\" Johnny said, angling his body so he could get a peek at Damien's back. \"No homo though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" Damien said, who was currently poking his fingers into Arnold's cheeks for no reason. \"I try to keep it tight. It's nothing compared to Jack's body though. Hey Arnie, how do you feel man? Say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible.\" Arnie said. \"I feel... powerful. Unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are some words man.\" Damien said, nodding as if Arnold had just dropped some heavenly wisdom. The seriousness of his face was undercut by the fact that both of his hands were currently on his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny glanced at his phone. It was getting late. Where was Jack?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile in the house, Johnny's bedroom was a mess. It wasn't normally clean but this was a new level of unkempt: books were strewn about, a lamp was on the floor, clothes were scattered everywhere. Lying at the center of the chaos were Jack and Cerise, tangled in sheets looking sweaty, disheveled, but <i>very</i> pleased with themselves. After several hours of ferocious lovemaking and sexual exploration, the lust had died down and the two were lying side by side in bed, enjoying a quiet moment of reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's world (and body) had just been rocked. Having sex with his little brother's body while inside the body of the head cheerleader hadn't been where he'd expected the day to go, but once he'd closed his eyes the experience had been (ironically) eye opening. While he still defined himself as a heterosexual man, sex as a girl was a once in a lifetime opportunity he was glad that he'd taken because it was completely different and absolutely exhilarating. It had been thrilling to experiment with how far he could push Cerise's lithe body, and once back in his own body he was dying to find a girl who could do some of things he'd done in Cerise's body to see how they felt from the other end, because based off of how Cerise had reacted, they had been good. The only thing that would have made the experience better would have been if Cerise were in his real body so Jack could get a true taste of what the girls he had sex with felt like, but he still felt like he was leaving this experiment as a better man who understood more how to take care of a woman, something he was eager to test out. Womanhood had been nice, but he was eager to regain his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise's experience had been equally enlightening. After taking a spin behind the dick rather than beneath it she felt like she understood a lot better why guys were the way that they were. She wasn't lacking in sex drive, of course, but the penis was just wired differently and when the hormones started pumping it had felt like the only important things in the world were friction and a warm body. Cerise glanced down and stared at Johnny's cock, which lay spent between her thighs. She reached down and gave it an affectionate tweak; even if it wasn't impressive, it had served her well. Having a penis had been incredible, and she briefly considered asking to keep it (<i>well,</i> she thought as she looked at Johnny's belly, <i>maybe not this one, but a penis</i>) but then she looked over and saw her own body splayed out beside her, naked and exposed, and she knew she had to go back. As fun as this had been she loved her body, and she loved her life, and she didn't want to give it up to be Johnny Mack, of all people. <i>But,</i> she thought, <i>this might not be the last time the two of us see each other like this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should switch back now,\" Cerise said as she idly stroked her new penis. \"but we should definitely do this again some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Jack responded, rolling out of bed and finding Cerise's clothes on the floor. \"You've got great tits by the way, I almost don't want to cover them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cerise said as she pulled some pants on. \"Maybe I'll let you see them again some time.\" She strolled out the door, swinging Johnny's hips as she fumbled to put her t-shirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just hooked Johnny up with the head cheerleader,</i> Jack thought to himself. <i>Brother of the year.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Cerise were still riding high when they walked into the shack, but they were startled saw two strange men standing in there. Cerise shrank back and Jack placed his arms around her protectively, but he dropped them when he realized he recognized these two. He furrowed his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Damien? Arnold?\" He asked. The two looked up and stared at him as if they'd seen a ghost. \"What are you guys doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold and Damien looked at each other for a moment. Then, Damien (or whoever was in Damien's body) sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we have some explaining to do...\"</span></div></div>",

He smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, hi Damien. So Johnny accidentally invented a body switching machine and traded bodies with Jack and didn't tell anybody. Then Jack and I switched bodies and left the shack. While we were gone you came in here and showed Jack's friends the device. You guys switched bodies, and then...?\" She trailed off, waiting for them to finish the story. Johnny opened his mouth to speak but Damien jumped in before he could say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, it was super crazy man!\" Damien said, throwing his hands in the air as if to indicate the enormity of the craziness. \"We were all joking around and messing with the machine when Arnie just like... took off with Jack's body. Just hauled ass out the door, hopped in Jack's car, drove away.\" He shrugged and slouched back in his seat. \"It was totally random.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you just let him leave with my body without saying anything?\" Jack's tone was demanding, but it fell a little flat coming out in Cerise's distinctively more feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't like that!\" Johnny said defensively. He shuffled awkwardly in his chair, struggling to get comfortable with his new, overly long limbs. \"Neither of us had any clue what was happening until he was out the door, and even if we had known how were we supposed to stop him? He has your body, which is built like a tank. We'd be no match for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be so calm about it if someone ran off with <i>your</i> body.\" Jack grumbled. He tried to cross his arms angrily, but ended up grazing his female anatomy in the process. \"Fucking tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" Cerise interjected. \"Number one, stop touching my boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem to mind earlier.\" Jack muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise rolled her eyes. \"Get over yourself. Number two, why does this Arnold guy running off mean the rest of us can't switch back?\"</span></div></div>",

He sighed. \"God-frickin'-damnit Johnny, you've done it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Johnny's voice was quivering and sadness read loud and clear across the face he now wore, making him look rather pathetic. \"It's only temporary, and\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, don't even try to make excuses.\" Cerise said with a withering tone. \"I knew I shouldn't have come over here, it's always a disaster with the Mack family. You'd better find a way to fix this because I am NOT spending the rest of my life in this body.\" She looked down at herself with disgust in her eyes, and Johnny shrank even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<sup>\"I'm sorry,\"</sup> he muttered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Arnold man!\" Jack suddenly exclaimed. He vaulted out of his seat and began pacing around the room, full of prickly energy. \"I shoulda known he'd do something like this. He was a little freak who was always jealous of me, I bet he broke the machine on purpose because he wanted to steal my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arnie wouldn't do that.\" Damien said defensively. \"It was probably just an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him running out the door with my body was 'just an accident?' Grow up Damien and stop making excuses for that freak. He saw an opportunity to trade up and he took it. You have his body, look at it. He's all bones and bad skin, it's gross. When I get my body back I'm gonna beat that little shit into a pulp and then never talk to him again.\" As if to emphasize his point, Jack smacked a cup full of pencils to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack you don't have to be mean.\" Damien was full on frowning now as he glared at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damien, you're too nice dude. What Arnold did was fucked up.\" Jack paused and placed a hand on his crotch. \"Look at this shit. Thanks to him I have a vagina. Shit's\u2013\" He shuddered. \"Shit's like... gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk about my body like that.\" Cerise jumped in. \"It's misogynystic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's your biggest concern right now? Well if it'll make you feel better, I'm a woman now, I can't be misogynystic.\" Jack fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can still be an asshole.\" Cerise said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem to think I was such an asshole when you were eating my face on the floor.\" Jack sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, don't even. That was back when I thought\u2013\" She paused. \"Never mind. Just stop being such a dick in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, you'd know a thing or two about dicks in this body!\" Jack stopped pacing and threw himself onto a table, splaying his legs wide open. \"This pose look familiar to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise gasped and stormed over to him, forcing her legs shut. As an argument erupted between the two, Damien took a moment to look around the room. Johnny was curled up in his chair on the verge of tears, Jack and Cerise were fighting, everyone was trapped in different bodies, the machine was broken... normally this was the type of mess that Damien would rely on Arnie to figure out, but unfortunately Arnie wasn't here right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait,\"</i> Damien thought, and he looked down at his hands. <i>I guess it's up to me then.</i> Hoisting himself up, he stood on top of his chair and began to shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could everybody chill the eff out?\" Everyone stopped and stared at him. \"I thought that you were all supposed to be like, smart, but you're all acting like idiots. I get that you're all upset. I'm pissed off too. But just flipping out at each other isn't gonna help, okay? We're all in this together, we need to be a team. We need a game plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sheepishly resettled around the table. After a moment of silence, Johnny spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you guys, I really am.\" He said. \"My experiments do have a tendency to get out of hand and capture unfortunate victims in the crossfire, and I'm sorry that it was you guys.\" He finally looked up, this time with fire in his eyes. \"And I promise you all I will fix this, no matter what it takes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if everyone let out a collective sigh, and the tension in the room dissolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the machine thing, I'm not gonna lie, you screwed up on that.\" Jack said. \"Running off to the park with my friends, that was messed up too. Taking them back here and showing them the machine was also a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a 'but' coming any time soon?\" Cerise asked. Jack glared at her before returning his attention to Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's no way you could have known what Arnold would do. That part isn't your fault.\" Jack patted his brother on the shoulder. \"For once it was someone else who screwed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while I'm not exactly <i>thrilled</i> about the current situation with my body,\" Cerise said. \"If anyone can get us out of this situation, it's Johnny Mack. You're a genius when it comes to making messes but at least you always fix them in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hashtag team Johnny bro!\" Damien exclaimed, smiling once more. \"We're all counting on you. What's the plan?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All eyes in the room were on Johnny. Part of him wanted to shrink away, to retreat to his shack and hide like he always did, tinkering away at his inventions. Unfortunately that was what had gotten them into this mess to begin with! This was his chance to step up, to be the hero.  Everyone was counting on him. He clenched and unclenched his hands, feeling the power coiled up in Damien's body. He could do this Clenching his jaw, he drew himself up to his (now impressive) height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it looks like we have two problems.\" Johnny began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just two?\" Jack asked sarcastically. \"My new tits alone are one each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, if we want to pick into the semantics of it we can say that we have two major OBSTACLES.\" Johnny said, shooting his brother a withering glare. It was hard to be mad at Jack when he looked like Johnny's crush but boy was he doing his best. \"One is that the machine is broken, leaving us all trapped in each others' bodies. The other is that we don't currently know the whereabouts of Arnold in Jack's body, so even if we did have a functioning machine we'd have no way to adequately restore everyone to their true bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and what's the game plan?\" Damien asked, brushing Arnold's bangs away from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a two-pronged approach would probably be most prudent,\" Johnny said. \"Divide and conquer and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Damien furrowed his brow and stared at Johnny, trying to understand what he had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's thinks we should split up.\" Cerise offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, duh. Yeah that makes sense. Man, it's super weird to see myself talking like that.\" Damien said, tilting his head and squinting at Johnny. \"It's like an alien snatched my body and is speaking a different language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Johnny flushed for a moment, but then regained his composure. \"When I get into 'work mode' I guess I... jargon, a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Johnny,\" Cerise said. \"It made perfect sense. Someone's going to have to stay here and fix the machine while the rest of us go find Arnold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my role in this is obvious. It's my device and I'm the only one here with the technological know-how to repair it.\" Johnny stared at the device, which sat on the table looking strangely daunting. That pile of bolts and wires had caused him a lot of trouble, he wasn't going to underestimate it. \"It's hopefully a task I can achieve solo, however having an assistant would certainly expedite the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course, totally.\" Damien said, smiling. Everyone paused as they waited for him to continue, and after a few awkward moments, his face cracked. \"Yeah I have no clue what he meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny's gonna stay here and fix the machine and he wants someone to help.\" Cerise said, patting Damien on the back sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it probably shouldn't be Damien since you and Johnny seem to need a translator to understand each other.\" Jack said. \"No offense bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" Damien replied. \"I wanna go looking for Arnie anyways. He's my best bud, if anyone knows how to find him, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, then I'll go with you, and Cerise stays here with Johnny.\" Jack said. He clapped, wincing as the motion caused his chest to jiggle. He wasn't going to get used to that. \"It's a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no it's not.\" Cerise interjected. \"No way Jack is going off alone in my body without my supervision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why not?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many different reasons.\" Cerise said. She began to list them off.  \"What if you run into someone I know? What if you embarrass me? You don't know the first thing about being a black woman in America. And you might take advantage of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never do that.\" Jack was a bit thrown by this. He knew he came across as a bit of a player but he was offended that Cerise wouldn't trust him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you're a bit of a creep?\" Cerise said flatly. She instinctively moved to run her fingers through her hair (a nervous tic of hers) and was a little sad when she didn't find it there. \"You lied to me and let me have sex with you under false pretenses when I thought you were Johnny.\" She pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny practically fell to the floor when he heard this. \"You two- with my- she- he-what?\" Johnny's usually deep vocabulary failed him and it was all he could do to sputter in his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh... some stuff happened earlier while you were at the park. Sorry bro.\" Jack said. <i>Or maybe \"you're welcome.\"</i> He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's brain short circuited and he sat there, slack jawed, staring into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, did we break him?\" Cerise asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this.\" Damien said. Leaning across the table, he extended Arnold's spindly limbs and slapped Johnny clear across the face. Johnny blinked several times and shook his head. \"Snap out of it bro! We don't have time for this, get your head in the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hurt.\" Johnny whimpered, but he calmed down. Still, his mind was running wild at the revelation, and his mind was filled with images he didn't dare describe. He shifted uncomfortably as he felt Damien's cock start to take notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's my face.\" Damien said with a chuckle. \"Not the first time I've been smacked, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about it later,\" Cerise mumbled, gluing her eyes to the ceiling so she wouldn't have to make contact with anyone. She cursed Johnny's pale flesh, which flushed red so easily and bared her embarrassment to the world. \"The point is I don't trust Jack alone with my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't be alone, I'll be with him,\" Damien spoke up and slung one arm around Jack's shoulder. \"I can make sure he doesn't get into any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number one, stop touching my body.\" Cerise said. Damien withdrew his arm apologetically. \"Number two, I I barely know you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all friends now though,\" Damien said. \"I trust Johnny alone with my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you're both guys.\" She sighed. She hated being like this, being a stick in the mud, but life had taught her that people like her always had to be careful. Jack seemed cool, Damien seemed cool, Johnny was harmless, but she couldn't shake these reservations. \"I wish I could trust as easily as you but it's just not like that for girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien's face softened and he patted Cerise on the shoulder. \"Hey, don't worry, I get it. I'm totally woke, I understand consent and body automation\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Autonomy.\" Johnny interjected. \"It's body autonomy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks bro.\" Damien smiled, unperturbed by this interruption. He turned his attention back to Cerise. \"Life in America is tough for young black girls, I totally respect the struggle. But this whole thing is also super freaky and tough, and we're gonna have to the some chances if we wanna fix it. I swear, you can trust us. Jack can be a bit of an asshole\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Jack cried. Damien ignored him and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2013but I promise you that he's a good guy. We're in this with you, okay? And I promise you we're gonna keep you and your body safe.\" He stared at her, determination blazing out from behind his brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a complete and total gentleman.\" Jack jumped in. \"I haven't touched your boobs <i>once</i> this whole time we've been planning. You can trust me!\" A more somber expression crossed his face, and a note of desperation entered into his voice. \"Please guys, it's my body. I need to know what happened to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise opened her mouth as if to say something, but then closed it. She leaned back and crossed her arms, looking at Johnny for some kind of guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

Jack seemed like the most obvious choice as he was the only one who really knew Damien and after all, they were looking for his body. But it clearly made Cerise uncomfortable to let her body out of her sight. The obvious solution to that problem was to send Jack and Cerise off together, but Johnny wasn't sure that he trusted them alone with each other anymore. Who knows what they might get up to with is body  Plus that would leave Johnny alone with Damien, who didn't seem like he'd be the most helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Cerise and Jack could both stay in the lab with him and Damien could go search of Arnold alone? Or maybe they could all three leave and Johnny could work on the machine alone. What other options did they have that he hadn't considered? Damien and Cerise go off alone searching? He couldn't even come up with a potential vantage point with which to explain that one. Johnny paused for a moment, his head swimming with possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe vaguely recalled an old riddle about taking a chicken, fox, and some bags of grain across a river in a small boat, and he wished his problems were that simple.

Are we all comfortable with that?\" All eyes went to Cerise, pointedly. After a few tense moments, she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we don't have much of a choice.\" She sighed. She wasn't thrilled about letting Jack go off in her body, but she knew that sitting around arguing about it all day wouldn't get anyone anywhere. They had more pressing concerns than her discomfort, and it wasn't as if Jack hadn't already been... intimately acquainted with her body. <i>Besides,</i> she thought to herself, <i>neither one of those two idiots would be any help to Johnny in the lab.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoutout to Cerise for taking one for the team!\" Damien cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted this like he was at a sports game. It was incredibly stupid, but it cut through the tension in the room and allowed everyone to relax a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well,\" Cerise stomped over to Jack and stood directly in front of him, glaring into his eyes. She had to look up to do it (Johnny's body was shorter than her own) and she was afraid she looked ridiculous in Johnny's scrawny body, but she hoped she was still getting her point across. \"If you try anything, anything at all to embarrass me, take advantage of my body, or injure me, or anything like that, then when Johnny fixes the machine and we're all back in our own bodies I'm gonna have him turn you into a seventy year old woman. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glanced over at Johnny, who mouthed <i>\"go with it\"</i> at him. Jack looked back at Cerise and nodded. Satisfied, she stepped back and gave her body a once over. She smirked; her body looked good. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fix my shirt.\" She said, tugging it up slightly so it exposed less of her breasts. \"If I'd known someone else would be using my body today I would have dressed more conservatively.\" She began fussing with Jack's hair as well, grabbing the hair tie from his wrist and using it to pull her hair back into a loose ponytail. She examined her face as well. \"Maybe I should touch up my makeup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely no way.\" Jack shoved her away from him, watching with glee as she stumbled over her own feet in Johnny's uncoordinated body to land with an unceremonious <i>thump</i> on the sofa. There was no way in hell he was putting on makeup, no matter what his body looked like he was still a dude. He adjusted his bra strap uncomfortably, already missing being a guy who only had to throw a t-shirt on. \"Can we go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you do, do you have some sort of plan to find Arnold?\" Johnny asked. He helped Cerise sit up, smiling at how easy it was to do so with Damien's body. This body swapping adventure was going to give him some serious body image issues, it seems like everyone's body was better than his! She smiled at him thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've tried calling him on my phone but he hasn't picked up,\" Jack said. \"But if I know Arnold there's only a couple of places where he'd go to hang out. Our best bet is to find him there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could also swing by his apartment to see if he went there,\" Damien chimed in. \"He gave me a spare key a while back so I can get us in.\" He paused, then reached into his pockets and produced Arnold's keys. \"Or I guess we could just use these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had a sudden realization. \"Wait, shit, that reminds me, Arnold has my keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your car.\" Damien added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if taking my dick wasn't enough.\" Jack groaned. He'd saved up for that car, it was one of his prized possessions. It looks like he'd really lost <i>everything.</i> \"There better not be a scratch on my car when I get it back, I'm almost done with the payments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not taking my car.\" Cerise said. \"My parents will kill me if anything happens to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm you right now, they'll kill <i>me.</i>\" Jack responded. \"What do you suggest, we walk? Are you gonna complain about everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be condescending, I'm putting my foot down on this one.\" Cerise tossed her head back and crossed her arms, giving a little stomp as if for emphasis. \"It's already bad enough that you're taking my body, you're not taking my car too. Besides, what if we need to go get something? Johnny, back me up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-\" Johnny's eyes grew wide. One of his worst nightmares was being caught between his older brother and his crush. Mercifully before he could say anything (which would likely have been the wrong thing) Damien jumped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take my truck.\" Damien offered, not wanting another fight to break out. \"It's at my apartment if you don't mind giving us a ride over there Cerise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that sounds like a good plan.\" Cerise said, settling back onto her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Damien exclaimed. He was smiling again. \"Johnny, toss me my keys.\" Johnny was confused for a moment before he remembered that because he was in Damien's body, he had Damien's keys too. Fishing into the pockets of his shorts he hurled them across the room towards his body. They went wide (Johnny wasn't used to the strength of Damien's body) but Damien managed to grab them in a display of athleticism that seemed almost unnatural for Arnold's body. \"We'll work on that toss bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to it.\" Johnny replied, shuddering internally. Hopefully Damien was joking, he'd had enough of sports for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, now that I think about it,\" Cerise spoke up. \"We should all exchange phones and numbers too so we can stay in contact in case we need something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded their heads and began giving phones to their appropriate owners. Cerise had her phone, Johnny had his, and Damien had his, but unfortunately none of them could unlock Arnold's phone (which was an older model that didn't unlock with a thumbprint) meaning that Jack didn't have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it finally go time?</span></div></div>",

The heaviness of the situation hung over their heads and left a heavy, awkward silence in the car. Damien was in the front seat so he could give directions, and so he felt that it was his duty to try and liven up the mood. He was always a hit at parties thanks to his ability to make fast friends with people, but his mind was drawing a blank right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Gary?\" Damien offered weakly in an attempt to break the tension. That seemed to do the trick though and Cerise relaxed, glad to put her mind on something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing good, coming home from school to visit soon.\" She smiled at the thought of her brother. \"I can't wait to see him, it gets so boring in the house when he's not there. Although we better get this fixed by then because he'll never let me hear the end of it if he finds out I got turned into a white boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same,\" Damien held his hands up in front of his face and flexed his now pale white fingers. \"My family are Malaysian and they'll disown me if I come home looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what's wrong with being a white guy?\" Jack asked, a little bit offended. Damien and Cerise exchanged a knowing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean there's definitely benefits,\" Cerise began. \"<i>Privileges,</i> one might say. But let me tell you, there's nothing more basic than a white boy. And I don't mean to be offensive, a lot of my closest friends are white, I've slept with white dudes but like...\" Her voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the flavor bro?\" Damien offered. Cerise burst out laughing so hard that she nearly ran a red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes on the road!\" Jack exclaimed. \"Johnny doesn't have his license, if you get pulled over looking like him you could get arrested!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise swallowed her laughter and glanced at Jack in the rearview mirror. \"Sorry it's just... I wasn't expecting that. It's true though, it's just something you understand growing up as a POC. Besides, I'm not scared of cops, I'm a white boy now! It's a great place to visit but I wouldn't wanna live there. It's cute for you though.\" She smiled at Jack so she knew she was joking and he rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, you two are the white boys right now so if you're insulting anyone, you're insulting yourselves.\" Jack grumbled. He crossed his arms and looked out the window, grimacing as he caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass. Cerise was a beautiful girl but seeing her face when he was looking for himself just felt... wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure after a day as a black girl you'll be itching to get back your cushy white boy life,\" Cerise teased. Damien held his hand up for a high five and she obliged, and when the two of them saw Jack glower at them they both laughed. A silence settled in the car again, but it felt a bit less scary this time. The streets of Snoozeton whizzed by in the bright afternoon light and for a moment all of them were as calm as they had been when they'd woken up that morning in their own bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we were just teasing by the way.\" Cerise said finally. She looked back at Jack sympathetically, and his face softened. He relaxed into a more natural sitting position, though Cerise grimaced when she saw how he splayed her body's legs out like a dude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being Arnold isn't be so bad though.\" Damien said. He idly ran his fingers through Arnold's long hair, feeling disconnected from the movement almost as if he weren't doing it. Perhaps it was a subconscious motion, or something in his body's muscle memory, but the feeling soothed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...\" Cerise saw an opening to broach a question that had been on her mind. \"What's the deal with this Arnold guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Damien asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I've never met the guy. What's he like? What's up with the disappearing act he pulled with Jack's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Arnie's the coolest,\" Damien grinned and leaned back in his seat. \"He's this super smart dude, super funny, kind of a nerd but we've been friends since forever. Since like third grade, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That long? Damn...\" Jack breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I met him in third grade. I think we met you in middle school? Right? Yeah, we met you in middle school.\" Damien's brow furrowed as he tried to remember. \"Oh dude, it's all coming back to me. I accidentally kicked a ball into his head during recess and I felt so bad I hung out with him for the rest of the day and we ended up becoming bros. We used to color together. And then we started hanging out with Jack in middle school because we all sat at the back table because the other kids didn't like how Jack smelled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise eyed Jack curiously and he flushed a shade darker. \"I was a kid, okay? It was middle school, nobody's cool in middle school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course this was before Jack and I got all tall and ripped and shit,\" Damien winked at Cerise and flexed a bicep that wasn't currently there. \"Once we hit puberty we started going out to parties and dates and stuff. That wasn't really Arnie's scene but we still stayed super close even in college. The three of us used to get into so much trouble together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did, didn't we?\" Jack said, grinning as he thought of their past exploits. \"We were always sneaking out, going places we weren't supposed to, pulling pranks, it was legendary. I thought his head was going to explode every time we did something illegal but he always tagged along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you guys were close. So what changed?\" Cerise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's changed!\" Damien said cheerfully. \"I mean, Jack transferred out of community college to that fancier school and then got that new job so we don't get to see him as much but we're all still friends. That's the cool thing about Arnie, I can always talk to him and it's like we're still teenagers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too nice,\" Jack said. \"Especially when it comes to Arnold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien frowned. \"What's that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean Arnold's always been...\" Jack paused for a moment, mulling over his words as if trying to chose the most polite ones. \"kind of a weirdo. Not a total freak or anything but he's just awkward around people. He says things that make people uncomfortable and I don't know if he even knows that he's doing it. Like, I was sitting at the back table in middle school because I hadn't discovered deodorant yet. Arnold sat back there because that's where the weird kids sat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm normal and I was back there too.\" Damien exclaimed defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you were sitting with him.\" Jack said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, huh.\" Damien shrank a little bit, and Cerise patted him on the shoulder sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Jack continued. \"Me, Damien and him, we were always good friends when we were younger and but somewhere along the way... I dunno, shit got weird with him. Don't get me wrong, he's always been a good friend to us but like, I always kind of thought that he was maybe jealous of me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would he be jealous of you?\" Damien scoffed. \"He's way cooler then you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" Jack puffed up slightly, which would have been impressive in his old body but in Cerise's body it meant he pushed her breasts out a little bit. \"I don't wanna brag but I'm kind of a stud. When we hit high school and I started working out and bagging all the chicks I think that started to Arnold want what I had and it messed with our dynamic. I mean, you've got his body right now. Check it out and tell me that it's nicer than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His body is fine, bro.\" Damien snapped. To further prove his point he gave himself an awkward hug, feeling his hands settle strangely around Arnold's bony ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apparently he disagreed because he decided to take mine and hightail it out of here,\" Jack sighed and looked at Damien sympathetically. He knew how close Damien was to Arnold and he didn't want to offend his friend, but Damien really had a blind spot when it came to Arnold and even now he couldn't acknowledge what mess their friend had caused. \"But he's our friend and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe we'll laugh about this some day but we have to fix this first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has seemed a bit... moodier since we graduated.\" Damien conceded. He pouted and turned his head to stare out the window, and realized that they were pulling into the parking lot of his apartment complex. \"I couldn't figure out why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can ask him when you find him.\" Cerise said. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks for the ride Cerise. You're a pretty cool chick,\" He paused. \"Or dude I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Hey, find your friend so we can fix this, okay?\" She patted him on the shoulder and he nodded at her and stepped out of the car. Cerise gestured for Jack to stay. \"Head inside, I want to talk to Jack for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien complied and Jack sat in the backseat confused for a moment. Cerise unbuckled her seatbelt and craned her body awkwardly around the car seat so she could glare at Jack in the back. It would have been easy in her old body but she puffed unattractively as she felt Johnny's belly press into the seat. Still she managed to get into Jack's face and glower at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know what kind of spiderweb of personal issues I just walked into, but you need to fix it, okay?\" Jack was taken aback by the intensity in her voice, especially since he had never seen his little brother look this determined before. He nodded meekly. \"Good, because I've known that boy for like, an hour now and I already like him more than you so don't screw this up.\" She motioned with her head for him to get out of her car. \"And remember, respect my body or I'll make your life hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed as he watched Cerise drive off. He'd been pushed around more today than he had been in years. <i>\"Yet another reason for me to want my body back\"</i> he mused. He turned and walked towards Damien's apartment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Damien had been adamant about moving away from home after college, and was proud of himself for being on his own even if \"away from home\" had ended up being a three room apartment in a two story building just a few miles from his family's house. He loved his family but he'd insisted that a growing boy needed his space, and besides, since he worked for their landscaping company he couldn't move that far away anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApartment buildings weren't exactly a common sight in Snoozeton where real estate prices meant most people either lived in a house or one of the nearby cities, but the complex was located near the heart of town, well-maintained, and affordable enough that Damien didn't need a roommate. The building was set up similarly to a motel, with each room being connected by an outdoor walkway, and Damien's apartment was on the second floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pounded up the stairs somewhat awkwardly he found himself stumbling over the stairs several times. Cerise was shorter than his real body was but her proportions were different and it threw Jack off. She was a girl with gorgeously long limbs that Jack had absolutely no clue how to handle. Cerise's body looked somewhat strange while he was in control because he walked like he was still a jock rather than a cheerleader, stomping his feet flat on the ground and giving a wide gait to leave room for something that wasn't currently there between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were other factors to consider... Jack gave an exasperated sigh as he grabbed his breasts to keep them from bouncing everywhere as he ascended the steps. He definitely <i>liked</i> boobs but the fact that these were his and he had no choice about it was killing the fun. He'd certainly enjoyed them earlier when they were on the floor of the shack and he just had to play with them but in motion they felt like a bit much. He grimaced after another stumble caused him to grip one too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise had gotten dressed for fashion, not for function, and as his shorts rode up and his tits bounced Jack felt uncomfortably exposed. Jack would have to see if he could borrow a jacket from Damien or something because there was no way he was going to spend all day feeling half-naked. He was no stranger to showing some skin (in his old body he took great pleasure in showing off his finely toned muscles) but this felt different in a bad way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Damien's neighbors was sitting in a lawn chair on the walkway, smoking a cigarette and staring out over the scenic parking lot view. He was enjoying a moment of silence on a lovely summer afternoon when he heard someone clomping up the stairs, and turned his head to see a gorgeous black girl emerge from the stairwell clutching her chest. He stared at her as she walked down the hallway towards him, her strange manner doing nothing to dissuade his leering glances. He whistled at her, and she stopped, staring at him with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby,\" he called out to her, his voice dripping with sleaze. \"What's a beautiful girl like you doing here all alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Jack a second to realize what was happening. Was this guy... hitting on him? Jack took a second to survey the man. He was a hairy looking dude, one of those guys who's nearly thirty but insists on acting like he's still a frat boy, someone Jack would categorize him as \"harmless.\" A loser. Cerise was way out of his league anyways, so Jack just rolled his eyes and kept on walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I asked you a question!\" The man rose from his chair and placed one arm out to lean on the railing, effectively blocking the walkway and keeping Jack from continuing. Jack sighed. He'd met plenty of guys like this while he was in college, men who were past their prime and couldn't get girls anymore so they just came across as desperate and creepy. Jack crossed his arms and tried to look as tall as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to my friend's apartment.\" He said, hoping that the guy would take the hint. \"It's right over there.\" He stepped to the left to get around the man and the man stepped to remain in his way. Jack frowned. Didn't this guy see he wasn't interested?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be your friend.\" The guy was clearly trying to be charming but something about the way that the man said it made Jack's skin crawl. He was leaning into Jack's personal space, his breath warm and sticky, and in spite of himself Jack stepped back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, step off, I'm not interested.\" He pushed the guy's chest, which unfortunately accomplished nothing. It finally registered for Jack just how much bigger and heavier this man was than his current body, and he didn't like it one bit. He wasn't used to being the smaller, weaker one in the situation. The man reached out and stroked Cerise's hair, and Jack felt dirty where the man's fingers brushed his skin. He slapped the hand away. \"Don't touch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just being friendly.\" The guy said. His eyes flicked down to stare at Cerise's breasts and he licked his lips, making Jack feel even more exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said sit your ass back down in that chair before I kick your ass!\" He burst out. The man looked shocked for a second, then began laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I can take a hint. Damn, chicks like you can be so sensitive.\" The man sneered at him and finally sat back down in his seat, reaching down to take a swig of a beer that sat beside the chair. \"Call me when you aren't on your period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack bit his tongue and refused to ask what the guy meant by any of that. Drawing his head up high, he fixed his eyes on Damien's apartment and began walking towards it, but a second after he passed by the man he felt a hand smack his ass. Jack froze for a second, then he snapped. He whirled around to face the man and leaned down to grab the collar of his shirt, staring him dead in his eyes with what (he hoped) was a fearsome expression. \"I said don't fucking touch me!\" he snarled. The man looked confused, but some small note of fear managed to penetrate his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. Didn't wanna touch your ugly ass anyways.\" The man took another drag of his cigarette and blew it in Jack's face. The smoke stung Jack's eyes and he coughed, releasing the man's shirt. The man in the chair laughed at him. \"Crazy bitch...\" he muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt his heart rate rise but chose to keep walking. He had never been one to run from a fight and he wanted to clobber this man but if he tried it right now he'd probably just get Cerise's body beaten up, or worse. Jack shut down that line of thinking before it could go any further. If only he were in his real body, then he could teach this guy a lesson. He didn't realize just how much he relied on his bulk and size to navigate the world. When a guy challenged him he was sure he could win if it came down to a fight, and sure he got harassed by girls sometimes but even getting perved on by someone like Darlene was more of an annoyance than anything else. It never felt <i>dangerous</i> or humiliating like what he had just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien had left the door of his apartment hanging open for him and Jack didn't begin to calm down until it was firmly shut behind him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack surveyed the apartment as he stepped into it. It was a simple place, the front door opened right into the living room/kitchenette and to the left there was a hallway leading to a few other rooms. He\u2019d been over here a few times before for parties but without the throngs of people inside it he noticed how empty it was. Even though Damien had lived here for over a year now the apartment was still fairly bare and spartan, as if he hadn't quite settled in or figured out that this space was his to fill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a couch and coffee table placed in front of a television (with several game consoles hooked up to it, of course), a folding table with some chairs located vaguely near the kitchen area, and a third table covered in junk sitting against another wall, but that was it. The only thing that seemed maybe out of place was a novelty vase shaped like the Superman logo that sat on the counter of the messy kitchenette. It was full of flowers that, upon closer inspection, were all plastic. Jack glanced down the hallway that lead to the other rooms and saw that all of the doors were closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou in here?\u201d He called out, and a toilet flushed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah bro, just a sec.\u201d Damien called from the bathroom. He emerged from it a moment later and joined Jack in the living room, shaking some excess moisture from his hands. His face was damp as if he\u2019d just splashed water on it, and Arnold\u2019s shaggy bangs were matted onto his forehead. He smiled at Jack, evidently not noticing if anything was wrong with him. \u201cWhat\u2019d Cerise want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, nothing,\u201d Jack replied awkwardly. There was no real reason for him to lie about what had just happened (either Cerise\u2019s warning or the neighbor\u2019s harassment) but he was determined not to show weakness, or to seem like he couldn\u2019t handle this crazy situation. \u201cShe just wanted to be sure I wasn\u2019t gonna do anything creepy with her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien quirked an eyebrow at him. \u201cAre you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Jack exclaimed. He flushed a shade darker. \u201cWhy does everyone keep assuming that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I\u2019ve known you for years now and you\u2019re a total horndog,\u201d Damien walked over to the fridge as he said this, and began rifling through its contents. Jack glimpsed over his shoulder and saw more fruits and vegetables than he expected, and a surprising number of eggs. \u201cYou talk a good talk but I\u2019d bet you\u2019re feeling her tits every second someone\u2019s not looking at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, being a chick isn\u2019t all fun and games,\u201d Jack said, shuddering internally as he thought of what had happened just outside that door. Damien shrugged and fished two beers out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant one?\u201d He offered, holding out a bottle to Jack. Jack stared at the beverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be out looking?\u201d He asked expectantly. He didn't want to spend any more time in this body than he had to, at least without knowing his real one was secure and waiting for his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe world\u2019s not gonna end if we sit for ten minutes,\u201d Damien replied, already removing the cap from his bottle with a bottle opener attached to his keys. \u201cWe\u2019ll search better if we\u2019re rested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation, Jack took the bottle. He <i>was</i> feeling stressed out, and it would help to have something to take the edge off. Damien threw himself down onto the couch and sprawled out across it, a tangle of gangly limbs. Jack shoved his legs off the couch and sat down next to him in the vacant space. The two of them sighed and sat in silence for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow crazy is this whole thing, huh?\u201d Damien asked. \u201cBody switching? Your brother is a total mad scientist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a total screwup,\u201d Jack grumbled. \u201cOnce again, he messed up and everybody else deals with the consequences.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he\u2019s lucky he\u2019s got you for a brother then,\u201d Damien said without a hint of irony. \u201cso he knows he\u2019s got someone tough looking out for him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled that dumb, good natured smile of his and Jack could swear he felt his teeth rotting from how sweet it was. Damien could be dumb sometimes, but maybe he had a point and his words hit home a little bit. Even though he was practically an adult Johnny was still Jack\u2019s little kid brother, and it was his duty to protect him. Jack wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so instead he took a swig of his beer. Unexpectedly the liquid tasted foul as it entered his mouth and in surprise he almost choked on it. Damien stared at him sputtering with concern, and when he was done coughing Jack grimaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, I don\u2019t think this body likes beer.\u201d Jack said. He got up, rushed to the kitchen, and began washing his mouth out in the sink. When the sounds of the faucet died away he heard someone laughing and it took him a moment to realize that it was Damien; Arnold seldom laughed like that so the sound was completely foreign to Jack\u2019s ears. Jack took a moment to examine Damien from across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold was a skinny guy, all angles and bones, and while he wasn't ugly he had an air of suspicion about him that was a little alienating. He was always hunched over as if on the defensive, and people could always see the wheels turning behind his eyes as he overanalyzed every situation. But with Damien in control his body looked almost completely different. All of the tension was gone and he lay there relaxed and exposed, lean limbs spilling across the couch rather than hunched in to take up as little room as possible, a big guy trapped in a little body. Damien\u2019s inner light even seemed to give Arnold\u2019s pale skin a glow and Jack suspected that Damien was the type of guy who could wear anyone\u2019s body and make it work for him. But something about his wide smile still looked foreign on Arnold\u2019s narrow features, something about his bright eyes didn't seem to sit right behind Arnold's glasses. Damien caught Jack staring at him and his giggles died out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that dude?\u201d He asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just weird to see Arnold act like you. Like, smiling and shit,\u201d Jack said, plopping himself back onto the couch with a glass of water in hand. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s been replaced by an alien who\u2019s not a total stick in the mud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Damien shoved Jack playfully. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take that as you complimenting how awesome I am instead of you insulting my best bro. Arnie\u2019s plenty of fun, just like, a different kind of fun. Besides, if you think this is weird, imagine looking at the legendary stud of Snoozeton Jack Mack and seeing a girl. A girl who can\u2019t even drink! Now <i>that\u2019s</i> freaky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven as a girl I\u2019m still more of a man then you\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Jack teased, using his legs to shove at Damien\u2019s playfully. He was definitely more relaxed now, and feeling a bit more comfortable in Cerise\u2019s body. \u201cI bet I could still bag ten times as many chicks as you. And they\u2019d be lesbians too, so they\u2019d be into the freaky shit.\u201d Jack wiggled his eyebrows and made some suggestive hand motions that didn't seem to relate to any known sex acts, which Damien caused to snort and roll his eyes. He took a swig of his beer and then looked over at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously man, you play with them?\u201d Damien asked, nodding his head and flicking his eyes down to indicate Cerise\u2019s breasts. Jack sorely wished that she\u2019d picked a less revealing top to wear the day she decided to get switched into his body. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna judge, I know I\u2019d do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly man? Yeah, a few times.\u201d Jack glanced down at his breasts and gave one of them a poke. It always seemed to come back to these, didn\u2019t it? He\u2019d already gotten an up close and personal view of Cerise\u2019s body from the inside AND out earlier, and playing with certain parts of her was really fun, but touching her when she wasn\u2019t in the room and consenting to it felt a little bit icky. \u201cI feel a little weird about it but like\u2026 I\u2019m still a guy inside and they\u2019re always <i>there</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice\u2026\u201d Damien said, slouching down into the couch and spreading his legs out. He took another sip of his beer then looked over at Jack with a glint in his eye. \u201cWhat about the\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack asked exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe\u2013\u201c Damien leaned in close and whispered. <i>\u201c\u2013lady parts.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, what are you, twelve?\u201d Jack placed his hands on Damien\u2019s face and shoved him back. \u201cI\u2019m not answering that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, how can you not?\u201d Damien broke out into a shit-eating grin. \u201cIt\u2019s like, the holy grail and it\u2019s right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you gonna play around with Arnold\u2019s dick then?\u201d Jack fired back. Damien flinched and his pale skin blossomed beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross dude, he\u2019s my friend!\u201d He crossed his arms and looked across the room and sorely wished he\u2019d put up more decorations so he\u2019d have something to stare at. He'd been avoiding touching that particular topic, or, for that matter, that particular part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Now you get how weird this whole body switching thing is,\u201d Jack shook his head and patted his sulking friend on the shoulder then joined him in staring at nothing in particular. \u201cUnless we solve this we\u2019re gonna have to get intimate with these bodies eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien seemed to mull this thought over for a moment, then turned to Jack and said-</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s make a game plan.\u201d Damien reached under the table and pulled out a notepad that looked like it came from some long forgotten board game. Flipping past several drawings of dicks he finally found a blank page upon which he wrote the word \u201cGame Plan\u201d in sloppy letters at the top. He underlined these words a few times and drew a happy face next to it. Smiling with satisfaction, he leaned back into the couch and looked at Jack expectantly. \u201cWhere should we start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Jack began wracking his brain, but was drawing up blanks. It wasn\u2019t like they could search up \u201chow to find someone who stole your body\u201d on the internet or report it to the police, and as much as he didn\u2019t like to admit it he didn\u2019t know Arnold well enough to even begin to guess what he was doing out there with his body. \"I'll be honest, I'm drawing a blank here. Arnold and I don't really hang out that much solo and I haven't seen you guys in a while so I don't really know what he's in to these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that reminds me, we should totally hang out more when this is over,\" Damien said, and he looked at Jack with a bit of a mournful look in his eyes. \"I know we still see each other every now and then but I miss you man, and I think Arnie does too. We've got a lot of history man, I don't wanna lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack winced. He ran in slightly different social circles these days and he had to admit he'd fallen out of touch with a few of his old friends. \"Sorry about that. It's just, you know, I got so busy with school, and now with work...\" Shit, he hadn't even considered work. He wasn't needed at the office for a few days but if they didn't get this fixed soon he'd have to figure out what he was going to tell them. Would they let him keep doing his job with a different body? He blinked and realized he'd completely been ignoring Damien. \"You know how it is with growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't outgrow friends dude.\" Damien said, and he sounded completely genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah you do? That's like, rule number one of life.\" Jack scratched his head. \"Everybody talks about it constantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien gave Jack a knowing smile. \"Not if they're real friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like a fortune cookie, asshole.\" Jack rolled his eyes but found himself smiling back. \"Don't get distracted, we need to focus on finding Arnold! You know him way better than I do. If you were in his shoes\u2013\" he paused for a second and smirked. \"\u2013which I guess you technically are, where would you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Arnie usually just kind of hangs out at his apartment. He like, reads and plays games and stuff. So I guess we could check there.\u201c Damien scribbled \u201cArnie\u2019s place\u201d down onto the notepad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d run off with my body and then waste it just gaming,\u201c Jack said. \"Where does he go when he's <i>not</i> sitting on his ass at home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, most of the time I see him he\u2019s over here hanging out with me,\u201d Damien wrote \u201cmy place\u201d on the list and then craned his head to look around the apartment. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not here right now, so I guess we can cross it off the list.\u201d He scribbled the words he just wrote out and smiled at Jack. \u201cOne down already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed. \u201cOkay, now try thinking of places we aren\u2019t already at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hangs out at the hobby shop a lot,\" Damien offered. \"He's really into those weird magic card game tournaments and he does that thing where people dress up and have fake fantasy battles. I think he's gotta be pretty tight with the people there, he talks about it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrific images of his body wearing a robe and waving a staff around flashed before Jack's eyes. \"I really hope he's not doing that nerd shit with my body, if anyone finds out about it my reputation will be ruined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerd stuff went mainstream a while ago bro,\" Damien said sagely. \u201cI\u2019ve seen like, eight superhero movies this year and people don\u2019t think I\u2019m a nerd. Nobody really cares anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I care!\" Jack exclaimed. \"This is some advanced nerd shit. They wear like... tights and stuff, and funny hats. If someone takes a picture or a video of me dressed up dancing around like a fairy and it ends up on the Internet I'll never hear the end of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sure, we can check there first if it'll make you feel better.\" Damien chuckled at how sensitive Jack was, and wrote \u201cadvanced nerd shit\u201d onto the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel like you're taking this seriously dude.\" Jack said accusatorially. \u201cMy brother has your body and who knows what he\u2019s doing with it, you won\u2019t think this situation is so funny when he presses the wrong button on one of his machines and like, blows you\u2019re eyebrows off or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I trust him,\" Damien said firmly. \"Both Arnie and your brother. You just gotta have a little faith man, people are nicer than you give them credit for. And hey, if I don't have eyebrows I'll just draw them on with a sharpie. Same difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked up at the ceiling and sighed. Whenever he was around Damien sighing was just part of his normal breathing pattern. \u201cAnywhere else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, he likes to go to the library. Also the mall, even though he doesn\u2019t really buy stuff he just likes looking in the windows and seeing if there\u2019s anything new. Oh! And he likes walking in the park.\u201d Damien began adding different locations to the list. \u201cAnd he likes that diner down on Main Street, because they have really good combo options so he can order eggs and get those banana muffins he likes and\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless his plan was to ruin my abs by eating a bunch of carbs I <i>really</i> don\u2019t think he stole my body so he could eat muffins,\u201d Jack interrupted, though he really hoped that that wasn\u2019t the case because he was pretty fond of his abs and he wanted them back. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a good list of places to start looking. Where should we head first?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d do it if he ever invited me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNumber one, it's weird that you know what that's called. Number two, that\u2019s one of the many differences between me and you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI actually know how to be cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2019s cooler than being yourself bro,\u201d Damien said, offering Jack another nugget of wisdom. As usual, Jack just rolled his eyes at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell right now neither of us are ourselves and we\u2019re never gonna fix that if we don\u2019t get going,\u201d Jack rose to his feet and swallowed the last of his water, then moved to the kitchen to deposit the glass in the sink. \u201cAs much as I\u2019ve enjoyed this bro-bonding session we\u2019ve wasted enough time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, one sec,\u201d Damien chugged down the rest of his beer, then gave a little belch when he was done. He scrunched his face up as if he had brain freeze. \u201cDamn, Arnie needs to drink more. We\u2019ll have to take him out after this.\u201d Damien dropped the bottle into a recycling bin that was sitting by the side of the sink, then reached into a cabinet and pulled out a small bag of pretzels. He began crunching on one and then offered the bag to Jack, who took one as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, could I get a jacket or something?\u201d Jack asked through a mouthful of crumbs. \u201cI don\u2019t like feeling like I\u2019m dressed like a hoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll women are queens Jack,\u201d Damien replied, then he looked Jack up and down to appraise Cerise\u2019s outfit choice. Jack pulled his top up again self-consciously. \u201cBut yeah, sure. Not that I\u2019m complaining about the eye candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t objectify me Damien,\u201d Jack said, following Damien as they walked towards the bedroom. \u201cWe both know in my real body I\u2019m bigger than you and I\u2019ll take you down when I get it back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien was a very tall man so it was a bit of a struggle to find something that would fit, and when they exited the apartment Jack found himself swimming in a forest green hoodie bearing the name of some brewery that they'd had found hanging in the back of the closet. It hung down at an awkward length that ended somewhere between Cerise\u2019s crotch and knees (effectively covering her shorts so it appeared she was just wearing the jacket), but Jack was just hoping that they could pass it off as some kind of fashion statement. Oversized men\u2019s wear was in for girls these days, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, it made him feel far less exposed to the world, and he felt a bit more comfortable as he and Damien walked past the creepy neighbor, who was working his way through another cigarette. The man glanced at him with knowing eyes, but left him alone when he saw that he was with Damien. Once they were past him and in the stairwell, Jack nudged his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s the deal with that guy we passed?\u201d He nodded his head to indicate back down the hallway and kept his voice low and slightly hushed for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah that\u2019s Matthew,\u201d Damien said nonchalantly. \u201cHe lives on this floor, he\u2019s chill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack frowned. \u201cHe catcalled me on the way in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Damien\u2019s eyes widened and he glanced back over their shoulder (though Matthew was long out of sight by this point). \u201cThat\u2019s not cool of him. Just ignore him though, he\u2019s harmless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, but still felt uneasy. A few hours as a woman and he was already acting hysterical. He thought about that word, \u201chysterical,\u201d and wondered if that was a polite word to use here. Was he overreacting? Or was what happened to him really as bad as it had felt? Did Cerise had to put up with that all the time? All women? The wheels in his head began to turn as Jack stared up towards the second floor of the building from where he stood in the parking lot. He shook whatever thoughts were haunting him from his head and stepped inside the truck, slamming the door behind him. He just had to get his body back and then this wouldn\u2019t be his problem anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien\u2019s truck was easy to spot as it had the name of his family\u2019s landscaping company (\u201cTan Landscapers,\u201d an economical yet descriptive name) emblazoned on the side of it. It was sturdy and well-maintained, even if there were a few bumps and dents in the side of it leftover from a bit of reckless driving during some trips out to the countryside. Damien took a moment to adjust the seat and the mirrors to compensate for Arnold\u2019s different build (\u201cI haven\u2019t had to pull the seat this far forward since high school\u201d he remarked) and when he turned the keys, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now\u201d by Queen began playing from the speakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, this is my song!\u201d Damien shouted, and he cranked the volume up as he pulled out of the parking lot and hit the road.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cerise knew about Johnny Mack\u2019s antics. But Jack Mack, now that was a different story. Cerise had recently turned eighteen and she had realized how immature high school boys were, and so she was ready to start setting her sights on some older men. Not like, old, older men, but she figured a hot college boy would be a good time, and of her brother\u2019s friends she\u2019d always thought that Jack was the cutest. This was the perfect opportunity to get closer to him, even if it meant having to deal with poor Johnny Mack. She had a soft spot for the kid, honestly she did, but her position as head cheerleader meant that she could never be with someone as average looking and outwardly nerdy as him. But his brother was a fine slab of beef, and she was always down for a good meal. So when she walked in to the shack and saw Jack standing there amongst the weird science shit in all his glory, she felt as if she were stepping into the set of a cheap porno where the talent was far too good for the budget. She flipped her hair in that alluring way that pretty girls did, and turned on the charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Thank you soooo much for inviting me!\u201d Cerise chirped as she strode through the open door. Johnny leapt to his feet but stood bewildered, staring like a deer in the headlights. The nerd was practically undressing her with his eyes, and Cerise grimaced internally. She strolled right past him towards his brother. \u201cYou must be Jack right? I\u2019m Cerise, Gary\u2019s told me so much about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up Cerise? Cool to meet you too.\u201d Jack reached for Cerise\u2019s outstretched hand, only for her to pull him into a hug. Jack was a little taken aback, but spotting Johnny\u2019s eyes on them he returned the hug. He was much taller and bigger than Cerise so he dwarfed her, and Cerise smiled as she felt his strong arms around her. She couldn\u2019t resist it; she rubbed his back a little, feeling the muscles through his thin t-shirt. This was a man. After a moment they pulled away. Johnny snapped into attention, finally catching up with what was going on in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Cerise! Thanks so much for coming.\u201d He darted in front of her, injecting himself between her and Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, no problem Johnny. You know I\u2019m always down for a good time.\u201d She purred, her tone causing Johnny\u2019s heart to flutter. Cerise had taken some time before leaving to pick out her cutest outfit, a pink crop top that showed off her slim figure and\u2026 other, assets. She caught Johnny staring at her chest, and folded her arms to cover them. She\u2019s  \u201cDid you call me all the way over here just to stare at me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, sorry!\u201d Johnny turned away, blushing furiously. He hadn\u2019t meant to be a creep but Cerise just had this effect on him, he couldn\u2019t control himself around her sometimes. He was used so to innocent stares from a distance in the cafeteria and the hallway that it had taken him a moment to actually register that she was here, in the flesh, a few feet away from him. And it seemed like she was losing her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this device you need me to test?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mind reading device.\u201d Johnny said, and Cerise\u2019s ears perked up. A mind reading device was actually kind of fascinating, even if this thing with Jack didn\u2019t work out it would at least be a little cool to try this out. If it worked she could easily scan Jack\u2019s mind and get a hint of how he felt about her, or maybe get some tips on how to seduce him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe right?\u201d Cerise wasn\u2019t down to get fried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course! According to my calculations the odds of anything bad happening are infinitesimal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ll be right there next to you in case anything goes down. You never know with Johnny, that thing could come to life and try to eat us!\u201d Jack joked. Johnny cringed, remembering the incident with the flowers in Cerise\u2019s locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d Cerise said, looking at Jack from beneath hooded eyes. \u201cI love a brave guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I mention I invented this device?\u201d Johnny cried out. Why was Cerise more interested in Jack than him? He had invented a mind reading device! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it work?\u201d Cerise asked halfheartedly. Johnny\u2019s eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see-\u201c He began, and quickly launched into a rambling explanation of the mind and photons and protons and a whole list of other things that went into making this device functions. The glee with which he described his science was endearing, and as boring as it was Jack and Cerise found themselves listening politely to his whole schpiel. Johnny was so excited to have someone to talk to he didn\u2019t even notice that the two tuned out after a few minutes, with Jack dropping to the floor to do some push ups and Cerise taking out her phone to scroll through that for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and that\u2019s it!\u201d Johnny said when he eventually finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks great Johnny.\u201d Cerise muttered absentmindedly, not really paying attention to anything but Jack\u2019s exercises. Johnny frowned, noticing her wandering eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Jack! Get up off the floor, we need to start.\u201d Johnny shouted at his brother, who leapt to his feet and did a few exaggerated stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry lil bro,\u201d He said in the deepest voice he could muster. \u201cI just had to keep my body active, you know? If you wanna stay in shape you gotta make use of your free time.\u201d As if to prove his point, he pulled his shirt up and exposed his abs. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t just happen you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Cerise breathed, causing Johnny to grow even madder. Jack was trying to steal his crush! And as smart as Johnny was, he knew that he couldn\u2019t compete with Jack\u2019s good looks. He needed to bring the focus back to himself and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack, why don\u2019t you get the device and bring it over there to that table? It\u2019ll be a better place to get you guys set up. Cerise, come over here and I\u2019ll put the sensors on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned. Jack prided himself on his looks. Since he\u2019d been Johnny\u2019s age he\u2019d been beating women off with a stick, so he knew what Cerise was doing. The girl\u2019s attempts at flirting were cute, but even though she was cute she was a little too young for him. But a little bit of flirting couldn\u2019t hurt. Besides, he thought, it\u2019ll drive Johnny up the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I got it.\u201d Puffing his chest out, Jack strutted over to the device and hoisted it up over his shoulders, making sure to turn at the best angle to show off the full extent of his arms. The machine wasn\u2019t really that heavy but he put on a good show of lugging it over, and between Cerise\u2019s excited sigh and the pained squeak Johnny let out, he was satisfied with the reaction. The machine made some strange noises as it clunked on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, be careful with it!\u201d Johnny cried, rushing over to the machine. Flipping open a panel on it, he began checking to make sure that it was okay. The numbers and dials looked funny for some reason, had Jack damaged it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod Johnny, don\u2019t be such a square.\u201d Jack rolled his eyes. \u201cHe can be such a dick sometimes Cerise, I don\u2019t know how I put up with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack was just trying to help.\u201d Cerise chimed in. \u201cYou should be grateful you have such a considerate brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d Johnny shot a snickering Jack a death glare. \u201cThanks so much Jack.\u201d In truth Johnny was a little worried that Jack had done something that messed up the machine, but if he stopped now he\u2019d just look like even more of a loser in front of Cerise. He decided to take the risk and continue. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? He helped Cerise hook herself up to the machine, leaving Jack to fend for himself. He almost fainted as he caught a wiff of her perfume, he\u2019d never even dared to dream he\u2019d be this close to his crush! Reluctantly stepping back to the control panel, he looked over at Cerise and his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, now, I\u2019m going to start it up.\u201d He clicked some buttons and flipped some switches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh.\u201d Johnny cut Jack off. \u201cThis is a mind reading device. Don\u2019t say anything, just think. If I\u2019m right, this will let you exchange specifically targeted thoughts with each other. Jack, I want you to think of a number between one and one thousand. Cerise, are you getting anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Cerise said. \u201cI\u2019m getting irritated. Nothing is happening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, try thinking of a shape!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it works bro.\u201d Jack wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected to happen, but at least his brain wasn\u2019t frying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it does! I spent months on this!\u201d Johnny was panicking. Why wasn\u2019t it working? \u201cLet me just adjust the settings a little.\u201d He began fiddling with the controls again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, this was such a waste of time.\u201d Cerise said. Truth be told she was feeling something, but she wasn\u2019t going to let Johnny know that. It was time to get Jack alone. She looked him up and down once again, trying to picture what lay beneath those clothes. Oh the things she would do with his body\u2026 \u201cJack, do you want to get out of here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, guys, hold on! Something is happening!\u201d Johnny stared as the meters began spiking and all of the levels began going crazy. That wasn\u2019t good. The machine began sparking, and Cerise and Jack stared at it in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohnny you freak, what did you do?\u201d Cerise screamed as she felt her whole body begin to tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro you are so dead!\u201d Jack shouted. He tried to get up but collapsed to the floor, feeling like his muscles were jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny could only stand by in shock as he watched the two spasm on the floor for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Cerise began spasming as the machine sparked and made all sorts of strange whirring noises. Almost as quickly as the trouble began, it stopped, and the room became eerily quiet as Johnny stared at his brother and his crush on the floor.</span></div></div>",

He opened his eyes and he saw his brother Johnny shaking him, crying as he apologized profusely. Considering he'd just almost fried Jack's brain that was normal, but what wasn't normal was\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerise? Why the fuck are you calling me Cerise? You need to-\" Jack was about to roll his eyes and launch into a lecture when he noticed something. What was wrong with his voice? Why did he sound like that? His voice felt higher and come to think of it, his entire body felt... smaller? Was that hair hanging over his shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped in shock as he looked down and was greeted by the sight of a body that wasn't his own. Two large mounds of flesh stuck out of his chest, and as he shifted he could swear he saw them move. He yanked the neck of his (her?) top down a little, exposing them, confirming their existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got tits!\" He cried out in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's jaw dropped as he stared at his crush's exposed bra, unable to turn his eyes away. He shifted uncomfortably as he watched his crush begin seemingly fondling herself in front of him, hoping she wouldn't notice the reaction he was having to her little show. Had he fried her brains, he wondered? Turned her into some kind of exhibitionist? He wouldn't complain about that. Cerise had an amazing body, why was she acting like she hadn't seen it before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast to Johnny's glee at the sight of his crush exposed, Jack's horror was only growing as he searched more of his new form. His muscles were gone! He gripped the front of his pants and confirmed that they were empty. He was going to <i>kill</i> Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned me into a fucking chick!\" Jack shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Johnny asked, still mesmerized by Cerise's chest. Noticing his brother's lechery, Jack rolled his eyes. The boy was acting like he'd never seen a pair of breasts before! It's the 21st century, they're everywhere. Pulling his top back up to cover his breasts (he shuddered at the thought of himself having breasts, unfortunately causing the offending features to jiggle) he gave Johnny a good, hard smack across the face. That felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me you idiot. Jack!\" That got Johnny's attention. His eyes widened in horror as he realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My machine must have malfunctioned and put your consciousness into Cerise's body! This is incredible!\" Johnny exclaimed. His experiments went awry more often than he liked to admit, but this was the first time one of his mistakes had resulted in something productive. \"I have to take notes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what you have to do is fix me!\" Jack screamed at his brother. \"This is serious you little nerd, I'm- Wait, what the fuck happened to my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two realized that throughout this exchange Jack's body had been lying inert on the floor behind them. Johnny had been so concerned for the safety of who he thought was Cerise that he had completely neglected to pay it any attention.</span></div></div>",

She felt the way that she felt when she wore a too tight t-shirt in order to show off her chest, only this wasn't an unpleasant feeling. She felt solid. Heavy. As she opened her eyes the first thing she saw was Johnny Mack, his glasses drooping off his face as he stared down at her. She shut her eyes again, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" She asked, pausing as the words left her mouth. Her brow furrowed. Why did she sound like that? She reached her hand to feel her throat and felt something sharp and bony lodged in her neck. That wasn't right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's, um, there's been a bit of an accident and I... which is to say, if we\u2013\" As Johnny began babbling technical jargon a second figure appeared above her. For a moment Cerise thought someone was holding a mirror up because the face looked exactly like hers, but then it moved to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't freak out,\" The reflection said in her own voice. \"But we switched bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her clone said this, Cerise finally took note of what had shifted physically to her. She was huge! Her jaw dropped open as she stared down at her new body. She shoved herself up, taken aback by how different it felt to move through space. She grabbed at her arms, feeling her meaty biceps. The disconnect between the hard planes of muscle and her old body was strange, to say the least. There was an unfamiliar sensation in her groin that she didn't quite understand and it was growing by the second. She reached down to confront it and was rewarded with a handful of flesh that bulged in place that had been smooth that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a guy!\" She shrieked, her deep voice breaking in a way that sounded decidedly un-manly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically you're only a guy if you stick to outdated norms of sex and gender which\u2013\" Johnny chimed in where he really didn't need to and Cerise rolled her eyes and shoved him to the side to get to the mirror behind him. Unfortunately she wasn't used to her new strength and she sent him flying across the room, his fall only being broken by a small table, which ended up broken as well. Papers flew as he landed in a sprawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Cerise nor Jack moved to help him. Both were standing side by side, staring at their reflections in the mirror. There was a beat of silence as Cerise processed everything. She exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to sit down.\" She plopped herself down on a nearby stool, noting that it groaned under the weight of her new bulk. She shifted uncomfortably as she attempted to sit comfortably with her new manhood between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Jack asked. Cerise stared back at her own face. She searched her mind for the words and began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...\"</span></div></div>",

As the athletic captain of the cheer team (go Snoozeton Sleepers!) she kept herself in shape, but that was nothing compared to the strength she felt coursing through her veins right now. She felt invincible. She stared into the mirror and a handsome, twenty three year old jock stared back. Even just standing there she could see that Jack was the epitome of physical perfection, it was clear in the way that his clothing hugged him and his perfectly sculpted muscles. She lifted his shirt and counted to six. Who knew math could be so fun? And then there was the treasure hiding in her rapidly tightening pants at the moment. She would almost be horrified of the new appendage but it was sending so many lovely, ticklish sensations into her stomach that she was very much looking forward to getting familiar with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding beside her, Jack stared into the same mirror, less than thrilled. As he stared at his new reflection he found a lot to like. Cerise's face and dark skin were beautiful, her figure was trim and shapely, and he'd be lying if he said his eyes didn't keep drifting to her breasts. If he saw her on  the street he'd think she was an attractive girl, if not one who was a little too young for him. And yet, she was lovely, but she wasn't him. This body wasn't his, or at least, it shouldn't be. He was supposed to get girls, not be them! He felt small and vulnerable. He missed his height, he missed his muscles, he missed his dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Jack heard his own voice gasp, and he was shaken from his thoughts to find Cerise holding the front of his shorts forward, staring down at his body's penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" He snapped. \"That's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Cerise mumbled, even though she really wasn't. A glance had told her all she had needed to know. She didn't want to give this body up. Not yet, not until she'd had some fun. She'd come over here with the intention of getting to see Jack Mack's body and in a roundabout sort of way, this was her opportunity. Her mind raced as she thought of the fun she could get up to in this body. She needed a plan.</span></div></div>",

Thinking quickly she turned to Jack with a look of panic on her face, and tapped him on the shoulder. Jack noticed her face screwed up with fear, an expression he rarely saw himself make. It unsettled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" He asked. \"I mean, besides the obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you have my pants right now. Are my keys in my pocket?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I left my car unlocked! And my purse is in there. You have to go outside and lock it.\" It was... admittedly a pretty weak excuse, but she was gonna roll with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" He tossed the keys to her. She caught them effortlessly, and her face brightened for a second as she realized the reflexes her new body had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do it! I look like you right now. What if someone saw me and thought I was breaking in to the car?\" She did her best to start sniveling, knowing that boys couldn't stand it when girls cried. \"You have to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Jack exclaimed. It was bad enough seeing his body acting like a teenage girl, seeing it cry would be too much even for him. \"I'll take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the silver Jeep, thanks.\" She said, suddenly less interested in crying. Jack rolled his eyes. <i>I'll never understand women</i> he thought as he walked out the door of Johnny's shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was gone she set her sights on Johnny, who was attempting to extract himself from the wreckage of the table. She knew how to handle him, nerds like that would do anything for a pretty girl. She hauled Johnny to his feet, which was easy work with her new muscles. A little too easy, as she overpowered him again and he went sprawling into her chest. Johnny grunted, feeling like he'd collided with a brick wall. Corinne let him linger there for a moment. Physical contact was important in the art of seduction. Gently she pushed him away, but she kept one arm on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Johnny said. Noticing that Cerise's hand was still on his shoulder, he nervously nudged it off. Cerise chuckled, a deep, rich sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say Johnny, this new invention of yours is really cool.\" She went to toss her hair flirtatiously before realizing this body's hair was far too short to do that. \"You're going to be famous! A body swapping machine! It could change the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw gosh, thanks Cerise.\" Johnny blushed to receive a compliment from his crush, even though it was strange to hear it in the voice of his brother. Cerise's smile widened; the game was on. \"But it's not supposed to be a body swapping machine, it's supposed to be a mind reading machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For such a smart guy Johnny you really missed the point here. Sure it's not what you set out to do, but it's soooo much better. A body swapping machine is so much cooler than a mind reading machine. Why would you want to read someone's mind when you could just walk a mile in their shoes instead and understand them that way? It's a chance to see the world through new eyes. Don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I absolutely agree!\" Johnny replied enthusiastically. It was so cool to see someone so excited about his work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can't pass this opportunity up, can we?\" Cerise asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Close your eyes.\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why?\" Johnny stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna bite you silly! Just do it.\" He did. \"You know Johnny, it may not seem like it but it can get really lonely being the head cheerleader. I want you to think about my real body. Not just the me you see in the hallways, no, the private me. What I'm like when I'm alone, my private self. What do you think about when you see my face, my hair, my long, long legs...\" she paused for emphasis. \"My breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh-I-\" Johnny may be a super genius but his brain was short circuiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm a beautiful girl and a human being?\" Cerise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Johnny squeaked out, his mind still stuck on the image of Cerise's naked body. \"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that makes you one of the good guys Johnny. All the other guys, the ones like your brother, or the ones at school, they don't see it that way! They just think of me as an object. Not like you. Oh, I wish there were more boys in the world like you! You'd treat me right, wouldn't you Johnny?\" She was laying it on thick but it was the classic <i>you're not like the other guys.</i> Guys loved that. Especially virgins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Johnny squeaked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been so unlucky with boys.\" Technically this wasn't a lie, though it had more to do with Cerise not being satisfied by any of the boys at her school. \"I really wish I could find a nice guy just like you and settle down with them but first... first I think there's something I need to do, and I think you can help me with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's eyes shot open and for a moment he was startled to see his brother's face, but he just told himself that it was Cerise and he made eye contact. Staring into his brother's eyes, he liked to think he could see the girl he loved behind them. \"Anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to experience life as one of the guys, just for a little bit! Just for some closure. I want to know what it was like to be them, so I can understand why they've caused me so much pain!\" This was dumb and if it were anyone else they'd see right through it, but Johny was so in love with her he was eating it up. It was time to go in for the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed one arm on the wall and leaned in real close to Johnny, whispering \"I'd really appreciate it, and I'd be sure to show you how grateful I am...\" She put on what she hoped was a seductive face (she wasn't sure what it would look like with Jack's features) and puffed her chest out so Johnny could glance down her shirt. She ran one finger gently down his chest towards his crotch, a move she knew from experience drove the boys wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Johnny's perspective, he found himself pinned to the wall with his huge older brother grinning wolfishly down at him like he was going to eat him. Glancing down nervously, Johnny got an eyeful of Jack's pectorals in one of those tight shirts he was always wearing. Growing up with a wall of muscle for a brother this wasn't the first time he had been in this position but the intention had always been intimidation. This was something else, something almost sexual, and to see it from his brother was uncomfortable to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand... this was still Cerise. His ultimate crush. His #1 on the spank bank, and on some level his body must have understood that it was her driving Jack's masculine form because Johnny was currently sporting the most confusing boner of his life. Cerise's hand found it, and her fingers teased it. One hand feels just as much like any other when you're wearing jeans, and as Johnny shut his eyes and thought of his crush he felt like he was in heaven! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise rolled her eyes as she watched Johnny squirm and whimper in front of her. He had the dopiest expression on his face. It was almost cute in a way, but she wasn't here to waste her time with a dork like Johnny. \"Do we have a deal?\" she asked. \"You promise you'll buy me a little more time in this body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Johnny could do to nod.</span></div></div>",

Jack stomped in (ugh, he made her body walk so mannishly) and tossed her purse at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said, and she placed it on a table absentmindedly. Jack gave her a quick nod and turned his attention to Johnny, who was considerably sweatier and more red than he was before Jack had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, switch us back, now.\" Jack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Jack, this is kind of interesting.\" Cerise said. \"Don't you want to experience life as a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Jack said without blinking. \u201cHard no.\u201d The short walk to the car had been awkward and uncomfortable. He had stumbled in his heels, felt his chest bouncing everywhere, it was awful. He had conspicuously avoided looking at or touching any part of her body thus far (like a good gentleman) but in every movement he could feel the difference and he wanted it all to end. But most importantly, he was proud as hell of his body and he wasn't just going to give it away for any amount of time. \"I put way too much work into that body to just ditch it. Johnny, fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, don't you agree with me?\" Cerise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny glanced between his very angry brother in his crush's body and his very suggestive crush in his brother's body (talk about a rock and a hard place) and elected to look at the machine instead. He opened the panel at the side of it and began inspecting the innards. \"I'm not sure the machine can handle it.\" He said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Both Jack and Cerise exclaimed, both having been thrown for a loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's broken? Can you fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny surveyed the damage to the machine. \u201cWell, this one is down for the moment. And I\u2019ll have to run some tests to figure out what exactly went wrong first to ensure that it\u2019s safe to put you two back. Which will probably end with me building an entirely new device. One intended to swap bodies rather than just doing it accidentally.\u201d This wasn\u2019t technically a lie, but it wasn\u2019t quite the truth. Reassembling the device and making it functional would be simple enough and he would probably do so, and theoretically he could just recreate the conditions and potentially swap someone else. He just wouldn\u2019t tell Jack about this part until the new device was completed. Nervously he looked at Cerise, who winked at him over Jack\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWith the power surge that went through this thing you're lucky you two weren't fried!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, lucky us.\" Cerise said, smiling a strange little smile that made Jack's eyebrow raise. He didn\u2019t know much about Cerise other than that she was his friend Gary\u2019s sister, and he and Gary weren\u2019t even that close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo-so you two will be stuck in each other\u2019s bodies for a bit.\u201d Johnny announced. Jack groaned and threw his head back so he missed Cerise\u2019s grin. She winked at Johnny as she gave Jack a pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on her best concerned expression and patted him on the back, accidentally knocking him forward a little bit with her new strength. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Jack, my body isn\u2019t that bad!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not mine.\u201d Jack sighed. He rubbed his eyes, grimacing when he saw painted and manicured nails on his new hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, you\u2019ll love my family. They\u2019re super cool.\u201d Cerise said, causing Jack to snap his head up and look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d He asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell isn\u2019t it obvious? We\u2019re in each other\u2019s bodies, so we\u2019ll have to live each other\u2019s lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-uh.\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough freakazoid over there gave you my body, I\u2019m not letting you ruin my life too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of your life!\u201d <i>And your body,</i> Cerise thought to herself as she subtly groped one of her new biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not. We'll just have to tell everyone the truth: One of Johnny's experiments malfunctioned and switched our minds.\u201d Jack reasoned. \u201cHalf the town has had a run-in with one of Johnny's mistakes, they'll have to believe us. Then I guess we'll just try to keep living our normal lives while Johnny fixes the machine so we can switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? We can't tell people about this. My reputation will be ruined!\" Cerise shrieked. She wanted to have fun with Jack\u2019s body, and if her parents found out about this they would ground her and she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go anywhere. \"People can't know that I was here, do you know what they'll say about me if they found out I went over to science freak Johnny's house by myself? No, we need to keep this a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you suggest we keep this a secret? I have to go to work but I can't exactly turn up to work with tits without saying anything!\" Jack lifted his shirt up again, exposing the breasts in question. Johnny's eyes practically bulged out of his head. \"And aren't your friends going to wonder why you suddenly gained a hundred pounds of muscle and grew a dick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, we\u2019ll just pretend to be each other!\" Cerise beamed excitedly. \"We already look like each other, no one will question it. How hard could it be? I think this could be fun.\" She rubbed her hands over her newfound abs and grinned in a way that made the two brothers shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There's no way I'm trusting a high school girl with my body!\u201d Having to act like a high school girl was not his idea of a good time, and seeing his body acting like one was even worse! As much as he had doubts about whether he could pass as Cerise he had twice as many as to whether she could pass as him. \u201cAnd stop touching me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're stuck like this we're going to have to get used to touching each other's bodies! Besides, from what I've seen so far you've got nothing to be ashamed of.\" She moved her thighs slightly, feeling her new manhood shift between them. She wanted to be alone so she could check it out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit\u2019s gross, you\u2019re a kid.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m eighteen.\u201d Cerise fired back. \u201cI\u2019m an adult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still live with your parents, you still go to high school, that means you\u2019re a kid. Speaking of which, your parents deserve to know what happened to you.\u201d Jack\u2019s adult instincts kicked in. To pretend to be her and not let her family know that their daughter had been in horrific science accident just seemed wrong to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what? You\u2019re suggesting that I go to high school in your body? And you\u2019re gonna show up to work as a teenage girl? Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s weird too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell-\u201c Jack faltered. He hadn\u2019t thought of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You agree with me Johnny, right?\" Cerise purred as seductively as she could, which sounded very strange with Jack's deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny paused to consider the possibilities. Cerise clearly wanted this to remain a secret so she could be left alone in Jack\u2019s body, but she also didn\u2019t know what she was getting in to. As much as his brother annoyed him, he didn\u2019t want her wrecking his life. And he didn\u2019t want him messing up hers either. It would be smart to keep both of them close, and having the secret out in the open with all eyes on them would be the best way to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he did want to please Cerise so she\u2019d\u2026 reward him when she got back to her real body. And maybe he was still a little upset about what Jack said. And having a secret body swapping machine that no one else knew about presented options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he do?</span></div></div>",

He had a knee jerk reaction to seeing Cerise's face so downtrodden but... it wasn't Cerise. It was Jack, his older brother who had made fun of him and made him feel inadequate his whole life. Jack, the womanizer who had always been on top and didn't know what it was like to feel weak. Jack who needed to be taken down a peg. He almost felt bad because something about Jack's tone tugged at his heartstrings, but for once in his life the tables were turned and he was going to seize the opportunity. Revenge on his older brother and a chance at the hottest girl in the school... he'd be a fool to pass this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Cerise.\" Johnny finally said, blanching under her gaze. \"I think it would be smartest if we kept this quiet for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Cerise exclaimed, sauntering over to Johnny (which looked very strange in Jack's body) and throwing her arm around his shoulder affectionately. She cocked her head at Jack in an expression of mock pity. \"Sorry Jack, looks like you're outnumbered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, what the fuck!\" Jack shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want everyone to know that I messed up another experiment either. I'm starting to get a bit of reputation.\" Johnny said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're gonna get something alright...\" Jack murmured. \"Just wait until I get my body back. You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Cerise called out. \"That's no way to talk to your brother. He's the one who's gonna get us out of this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the one who got us into this mess too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potato, po-tah-to. Be a little more grateful.\" She surreptitiously reached down and gave Johnny's ass a little tweak, her big new hands practically covering the entire thing. Johnny gave a little squeak and Jack looked at him curiously. \"I know I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParting from Johnny, Cerise stalked across the room towards her purse. Her gait was still a little awkward because she was still getting used to having something in her pants, she'd have to get a little bit more acquainted with it later. Shuffling through her bag she pulled out her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" She said, thrusting it at Jack. He looked at it, confused. \"My body's fingerprints will unlock the phone. Open it and send me your number so we can talk, then and start taking notes. Here's what you'll need to know about being me...\"</span></div></div>",

She rolled down the window and felt the wind in her shorter hair, feeling a strength of freedom she hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. The last few months had been rough for her, though she doubted anyone had noticed. From the outside she had the picture perfect life as the gorgeous head cheerleader, but it felt like the walls were closing in on her lately. Her classes were gearing up for finals, she was submitting college applications, running the cheer team, trying to maintain a social life, and it didn\u2019t feel like she was getting any credit for just how <i>hard</i> it all was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t feel like she really had any allies anymore. Her parents didn\u2019t understand and her older brother had moved out, leaving her alone with them. Her friends at school were sweet enough but sometimes it felt like <i>sweet</i> was all they were, none of them understood the hunger that burned inside of her that she could never seem to satisfy. Speaking of unsatisfaction, her string of failed relationships weighed heavy on her as well. She hadn\u2019t entirely been lying to Johnny, every time she thought she found a guy who was worth her time he turned out to be a dud and she just ended up hurt courtesy of whatever emotions she had invested in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Johnny had given her an opportunity to escape all of that. She smiled a little bit as she thought of him, he was a sweet little guy but she knew that they would never work together. Still, the bumbling nerd had actually made something useful for once in his life, a machine that could spirit her away from all the stress of her own life and put her into one full of adventure and possibility. The chance to experience life as a man, and not just any man but a hot young jock, was exactly what Cerise needed (even if she\u2019d never dreamed of it before today). She felt stronger than she ever had in her life, and best of all nothing that she did in this body would be linked back to her. This was the most exciting thing that had happened to her in a long time, and she wasn\u2019t going to waste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing play on the CD in Jack\u2019s car, she frowned when some old rock song began to play. She flipped over to the radio and scrolled through stations until she found one that satisfied her. A familiar pop song came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, this is my song!\u201d She shrieked. She began singing along at the top of her lungs, straining to hit the notes with Jack\u2019s deep voice. When she stopped at the stoplight she let go of the wheel and threw her hands in the air, dancing along with the electronic beats. Some guys in the car stopped next to her stared, and she realized how ridiculous it must appear for someone who looks like Jack to be acting like this. She also realized that she didn\u2019t care. The light turned green and she winked at the boys, blew them a kiss, and sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was her destination?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cerise hadn\u2019t known what to expect when she pulled up to Jack\u2019s house, but she was pleasantly surprised. Jack\u2019s job paid a nice salary and rent in Snoozeton was cheap enough for him to rent a small one story house away from the rest of the Macks where he lived all by himself, meaning Cerise would have the freedom to do whatever she wished. As an added bonus it was closer to the nearby city of Wakey, where the office Jack worked at was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strolled into the house Cerise found it was a cleaner and cozier place than she had expected a 23 year old fresh out of college would have. Jack\u2019s taste wasn\u2019t exactly <i>trendy</i> and Cerise wasn\u2019t crazy about the baseball theme the memorabilia on the walls seemed to have (she was a cheerleader; she knew sports) but he had managed not to clutter up the place too badly. A nice kitchen, a spacious living room/dining room combo, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a small backyard\u2026 it wasn\u2019t exactly a palace but Cerise felt safe and comfortable spending her time here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a hunch Cerise checked the fridge and found several cans of beer inside. Not her drink of choice, but beggars can't be choosers and she wanted to toast to this new body as soon as possible. She took one out and cracked it, grinning when she remembered that she could now legally drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the drink on the coffee table, she flopped down on the (shockingly comfortable) sofa, spreading herself out to take up as much room as possible. She couldn\u2019t quite reach from one side of it to the other, even with how broad her new body was, but she smiled at the brazen display of entitlement that taking up this much space afforded. She was a big man now, she needed room! She spread her legs awkwardly to give her new testicles room to breathe, something she\u2019d have to get used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking her legs up onto the coffee table, she nestled back into the couch and unlocked Jack\u2019s phone. With one hand on her stomach she idly petted his abs as she she skimmed the notes that Jack had written down for her about how to manage his life. She rolled her eyes and placed the phone on the couch beside her. That was boring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was excited to tackle life as an adult male, but not because of the promise of steady employment in an architecture firm (or wherever he worked, she really hadn\u2019t been paying attention). There was so much fun to be had. Where would she start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Relaxing into the couch for a moment, she took a deep breath and centered herself, taking a moment to be calm after all the excitement of the day. This hadn\u2019t at all been where she had expected the day to go when she woke up that morning, but with Johnny Mack one could never be sure. She thought of all the ways that the experiment could have gone wrong. He could have turned her into a vegetable, or worse, he could have turned her into <i>him</i>. The idea of being trapped in his body was enough to give her nightmares, she\u2019d take Jack any day of the week. After all, when she\u2019d headed over to the shack she\u2019d had one goal in mind: end up alone in a room with Jack Mack and (she placed her hand on her stomach and felt the powerful abs lurking behind the shirt) in a way she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise became acutely aware that the unfamiliar situation in her pants was changing. Now, she\u2019d never had a dick before, but she was fairly certain that she was getting an erection. It was only natural, she had the mind of a red blooded woman and she felt a very attractive man beneath her hands, but it did strike her as a little bit odd that she could be so attracted to a body that was currently hers. It was reassuring to know that her sexuality had travelled with her and she was still attracted to men, but now she <i>was</i> the man she was attracted to and she was sitting on the couch. She spent a split second pondering the philosophical implications of switching bodies and where the self was located and other such nonsense, but quickly shook the thoughts out of her head in favor of taking her clothes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided Jack's bedroom would be the place to do it. It didn\u2019t surprise Cerise at all that Jack had a full length mirror in his room, given the care and attention that he put into his body it only seemed natural he\u2019d want to look at it. She placed herself in front of the mirror and stared at the image of Jack staring back at her. She smiled and waved, and watched him return the motion. His expression in the mirror shifted, his gaze growing touch and sensual, and he reached down to grab the hem of his shirt. Slowly and deliberately she made him peel himself out of it, a private show just for her. If someone filmed this and slapped some cheap music over it they could sell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Jack\u2019s body in the mirror took her breath away. She\u2019d been with guys before (she was head cheerleader of course) but scrawny high school boys had nothing on this full grown pinnacle of masculinity. He was handsome, maybe not the right kind for modeling but definitely the kind of guy who made you look twice on the street and wonder what was going on under his clothes. Well it turns out the answer was: a lot, and all of it good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had played baseball for the local minor league baseball team so he\u2019d developed thick, powerful thighs and a lean build, but after being cut he\u2019d taken his frustration out in the gym and had bulked up quite a bit. He was now the textbook definition of a hunk, with a physique that could put Greek statues to shame. He wasn\u2019t veiny (she hated guys that were veiny) and his skin was smooth and unblemished, glowing golden with a slight tan. He was exactly her type, and now, she supposed, she was her own type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis abs looked airbrushed on, but a touch confirmed that they were all real. Experimentally, she flexed them in and out. It was a little bit freaky, but a little bit of a turn on as well. She played the same game with his toned pecs that jutted out from body, pumping them up and down as if she were a bodybuilder. His body was so different than her own, she\u2019d have to get used to that. Curious, she brought her fingers to his nipples and moaned as she tweaked them. It was different than in her own body, but in a good way, and she continued to toy with them as she turned around so she could examine his chiseled back. She stretched her arms and watched the muscles ripple under his skin. <i>\u201cBacks are underrated,\u201d</i> she thought to herself. Perhaps if more people could see back like Jack\u2019s they\u2019d realize what a delight they could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning back around to face the mirror head on, she examined his form all over again. Her eyes drank in her reflection greedily, and the best part was when she looked down she was greeted with the real thing. She let her hands roam her body, finding muscles in places she didn\u2019t even know muscles could be. She twisted and flexed her body, grinning to find him more flexible than she would have expected someone of his build to be. That could be useful later. She flexed one of her arms and ran her fingers over the muscle, pressing her finger in to feel only the slightest of give. She wondered how long Jack spent in the gym to have a body like this, and added a trip to the gym to the list of things she had to do with Jack\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there was one thing higher up on that list that she had to attend to first, something that she felt raising higher and higher the more aroused she became. There was a strange dissonance between how amazing her new erection felt and how uncomfortable her shorts were growing, but she held off revealing his package for a moment. Turning around, she pulled the back of Jack\u2019s shorts down to reveal his ass, which stuck out so far she was able to tuck her waistband beneath it and have it stay, the poor piece of fabric now stretched across his thighs as it struggled to still contain his boner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerise glanced over her shoulder to see her backside in the mirror and whistled in appreciation at Jack\u2019s glutes. For a white boy he sure had a fat ass. She was slightly ashamed that it was even better than her own! She spanked it, giggling as she watched it jiggle a little bit; another toy for her to play with. She leaned over and shook it, watching the juicy globes bounce, but her eyes nearly rolled back into her head as this motion caused her waistband to rub over the head of her dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t wait any more, her hard-on was almost unbearable. She yanked her shorts all the way down and gasped as her dick sprung up and slapped against her body, sticking up like an arrow pointing to Jack\u2019s abs. She had been walking around this whole time with <i>that</i> in her shorts? Her jaw dropped. Jack was certainly blessed with a lovely dick. It was thick and long (and circumcised, she noted) and seated above a pair of huge balls. She didn\u2019t normally think of penises as <i>pretty</i> but Jack\u2019s dick made a solid case for the descriptor, filling the space it took up proudly and elegantly. It was red and throbbing, practically begging for attention that Cerise was all too eager to give it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d given a hand job or two in her time, but this was the first time she would be performing one on herself! Glancing around the room, and she smiled when her eyes fell on a bottle of lotion located on the bed stand. She stroked her chest and found his taut skin was surprisingly soft, so clearly Jack moisturized, but the bottle\u2019s placement next to the bed implied it was multipurpose. Slicking some into her palms, she reached down to greet her new toy. The moment she touched it it practically jumped in her hand, and she moaned. She paused for half a second to savor the sound of Jack\u2019s sexy voice before she began stroking her new manhood furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been standing, staring at herself in the mirror, but as soon as she began she knew she had to sit down because this was a big job (pun intended) that required all of her attention. Jack\u2019s huge hands felt surprisingly gentle as they worked his dick, and she squeezed just a bit tighter and worked it just a bit rougher. One hand was pumping his dick and the other was groping every muscle it could find as if to remind her of what had gotten her so turned on to begin with, what a gift this new body was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <i>grunting,</i> grunting like a man, heavy gasps and moans rumbling through her, issuing forth from some place deep within her male form. Something else stirred in this place before turning her whole body into fireworks, an explosion of pleasure radiating out from the epicenter of her dick. Her considerable muscles clenched and she <i>roared</i> as her hips bucked, thrusting over and over into the air as she emptied her balls for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his semen splatter onto the floor, the mirror, her body, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care at this moment. She leaned back, panting, feeling her massive chest rise and fall. It was over quicker than she would have liked, but hey, it was her first time. She was sure she\u2019d get LOTS of practice during her time in Jack\u2019s body. How did Jack get anything done knowing that he could be doing that all the time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes caught on her reflection in the mirror and she nearly came again just from the sight of this handsome young man panting on the floor, dick in hand, his abs dripping with his own semen. Why was Jack working in an office when he looked like <i>that?</i> It was almost too much to bear. Cerise closed her eyes and ran her hands over her muscles, feeling drunk and dreamy as she plotted her next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was all sorts of fun to be had as a twenty-something jock. What would she do?</span></div></div>",

Honestly, he may have believed himself, but Cheryl was having a difficult time accepting that this 17-year old boy invented the least likely of machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 I don't know what to say. I mean, it isn't possible. I think we need to get you to a hospital or a doctor,\" she said, shifting the car back into drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, listen to me. It's true. Just let me show you. What do you have to lose? If I'm wrong, if you're right, then there's no harm - no foul. But if I'm right\u2026 then you get the break you've been asking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered his words momentarily, as she tried to figure out if she was the crazy person for actually starting to believe him. \"But why me? Even if you had a machine that could do that, why would you want to switch places with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny admitted that was a good question. \"Honestly, I don't want to show this to any of my peers. I don't think they could handle the responsibility. I need to continue testing my software and hardware so I can fine tune it. I hadn't really considered you until something you said put the idea in my head. 'A vacation from your vacation'. Those were your words. I'm here to offer you that very thing. 72 hours. You get to relax, sleep in, eat whatever you want, and be as lazy, or active, as you please. All I ask is we keep a low profile and stay safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl's pensive look turned to confusion as her eyebrows scrunched together. \"You're serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContemplating Johnny's proposal, Cheryl was feeling quite baffled. Am I crazy for wanting to believe him? What if it actually worked? The thoughts were flooding her mind as she shifted the car into park, turned the key into the off position, and unbuckled her seatbelt. \"Let's give this a shot.\" She didn't know why she said it at the time. Perhaps it was the faith that it wouldn't work. Maybe it was the fact that she really wanted it to happen. She didn't know, but the thought of a few days being completely incognito was too good of an offer to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean you'll be walking around in my body,\" she asked Johnny as the pair walked into the back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'll have you know that I handled my mother's body, and life, with minimal problems,\" he said reassuringly. It didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026 but what about Paul? Will he know? What about all of my plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep a detailed list of events in your Woogle Calendar, right? And Paul? I don't think he'll be able to put the pieces together. Honestly, you might get the chance to hang out with him in a new manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you can get out of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up,\" she said as she furiously typed away on her cellphone. \"I love my girls, but I just thinned the plans for you\u2026 hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued back as Johnny opened the door to the Swap Shack. \"Here it is,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl was not impressed. In fact, a small wave of relief washed over her as she realized there was no way Johnny's machine was going to work. \"It's\u2026 nice,\" she said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you just have a seat here, I can have this set up and ready to go in no time,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we switch back whenever we want?\" Cheryl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. Look, if you get cold feet or you just need to have your body back, I'll respect that. The last thing I want is one of us doing something rash in the other's body. Try to relax. Look at this as a real vacation. You don't have those responsibilities. You don't have to do anything, be anywhere, or meet up with anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can just chill. Sleep in til noon. Eat junk food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea!\" Johnny said as he continued getting everything set up. He attached the headset to Cheryl and uploaded the updated software to the laptop. He double-checked everything to make sure it was squared away. Satisfied by his due diligence, Johnny sat down in the adjacent chair and hooked himself up. The thrill of body swapping was starting to fill Johnny as he looked over at Cheryl. Her wavy brown hair was tied behind her head, and she was sporting a cotton blouse and pair of jeans. Cheryl, like other women her age, was showing the effects of years of unhealthy eating habits and missed gym sessions. Now, she wasn't fat by any means, but she had some cellulite buildup on her legs, her breasts were swollen, her arms weren't toned, and she sported a small double-chin. In her earlier years, she was no doubt an attractive woman. Her tanned skin and wild mane of thick brown hair were still stunning, thought Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny caught Cheryl looking over his body, then back to herself. \"You're sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't my first rodeo. Besides, I re-wrote some of the code, so this should be much more predictable than the last time. That being said, are you sure? Can you handle letting go for a few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it,\" she said with a steely resolve.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny initiated the sequence, hearing the familiar whirr of the laptop. He felt the hair stand up on the back of his neck. He felt Cheryl reach over and grab Johnny's hand, needing some reassurance. There was a palpable electricity in the air as the probes on his head began to heat up. The sounds grew louder as the fans tried to keep the CPU cool enough to continue operation. The intensity of the heat increased and increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight tinge of pain shot through Cheryl's head. Ouch, thanks for the warning, Johnny she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe activity of the machine increased, with the cooling fans working overtime to keep the increasingly warming hardware from overheating. That's when it happened. Both Johnny and Cheryl's vision blurred, and they both temporarily lost consciousness. Then it went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\u2026 my head,\" Johnny heard a familiar voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind began to clear, Johnny knew his device had worked. He opened his eyes slowly and looked down at his hands. His tan skin ran down to his manicured nails. A far cry from the calloused hands of a teenage boy, for sure. Absent was wedding band on his left finger, as Cheryl's husband left her years ago during one of many indiscretions of marriage. A few light green a blue veins ran from his knuckles back over his wrist bone, and eventually faded underneath a layer of skin. His arms were smooth and hairless. His touched his forearms with the opposite hands, rubbing them slowly up and down, getting used to their feeling, embracing the new sensations from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is.. is that you,\" Johnny heard again. This snapped him out of his exploratory state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and was greeted by the sight of his own body. \"Cheryl, it's me Johnny,\" he said, hearing her voice from his mouth for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" she said, looking over her new temporary abode. She flexed her bicep, rubbing it with the other arm's hand. \"Woah. This is actually happening, isn't it? I'm really in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's as real as could be, Johnny. And get used to that name, it'll be what people will be calling you for the next few days. Think you can handle that,\" Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it, Ms. Wall,\" she replied in jest. Still checking herself out, \"so what's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we can call this experiment a success. Frankly, we can switch back whenever one of us is ready. So, first and foremost, thank you for your willingness to help me test the new and improved Swap Shack. Now, why don't you enjoy some time off. Do whatever it is you want. Is there anything I need to cover today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the ceiling, trying to remember if there was, Cheryl let Johnny know that there wasn't much going on today. \"Oh, Paul will be home between 9 and 10pm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess that's that, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it is,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we probably should get going. Don't want the neighbors thinking anything weird is going on with us back here,\" Johnny suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Good call,\" Cheryl said in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe switched-up pair made their way out of the shack, one with a new lease on vacation, the other with a new lease on experiencing life. It was difficult to determine what Johnny's motivation was, but for now, it had seemed he had perfected the Swap Shack technology, given Paul's mother the break she wanted, and ended up in the body of another mature woman. Sure, he might try something new in the future, but the glow he saw from his mother after her time in his body really made him feel like he was doing Cheryl a solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the back deck, Johnny turned to Cheryl. \"This is it. Head on in. Carla already knows, so she'll help you out with anything you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told her?!\" Cheryl said, very surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! She's the only other person that knows about the Shack. I thought she'd be able to make sure everything went smoothly for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be interesting. Living in my friend's house in the body of her son\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine,\" Johnny said, trying his best to reassure her. \"Remember, we can swap back whenever we need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank, John\u2026 err, Cheryl. Ms. Wall. Just\u2026 thanks,\" she said as she scurried off into the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny was now standing alone in the backyard of his former body's house, while in the body of Cheryl Wall. He felt very self-conscious, but as he looked up to the house, he saw his mother wave through the back window. He lifted his arm and waved with two fingers. Now Johnny really just wanted to get back to Cheryl's and lay low for awhile. This wasn't quite the same as his last out-of-body experience. There was a familiarity with his mother. There was common ground with his mother. There was a mutual sense of boundaries with his mother. This was completely uncharted territory. And honestly, Johnny was feeling uncertain of his hasty decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to doddle too long in his parents yard, Johnny made his way back to the car. Probably should've just walked here, he thought. At least he was a seasoned enough driver to safely make it back to his new abode without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Johnny. Here we go again,\" he said to himself as he looked at his new house for the foreseeable future. He stepped out of the car, almost tripping when his 2 inch pumps gave way underneath his feet. That was something he didn't have to deal with when he was in his mother's body. Doing his best to regain his composure, Johnny stood back up, smoothed out his blouse, and made his way into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed firmly behind him as he felt the blast of A/C his his skin, causing goosebumps to appear on his arms. It was a stark contrast to the summer heat, and felt wonderful. Need to write that down, same feeling regardless of body, he thought to himself. The house was quiet and dark, with all the shades pulled to keep the sun out during the day. Johnny noticed that the house didn't have that particular smell that it usually has when he comes over. Must be because my nose is acclimated to it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way through the house, Johnny ran his fingers along the countertops. The cool granite felt smooth under his fingertips. He clicked his nails against the surface a few times, as he continued looking around the house. He walked slowly down the hallway, poking his head into the various rooms and closets along the way. Paul's room was a mess of course. The bathroom was clean as a whistle. And the closet was full of winter clothing that wouldn't be needed for a few more months. Johnny sifted through a few of the items, noting Cheryl's taste in bright clothing. As he reached the end of the hallway, he opened the door to Cheryl's bedroom. It was tastefully adorned in quaint wooden furniture. The bed looked like it was made from reclaimed wood, and there was a matching dresser in the corner of the room. As Johnny walked over to the dresser, he realized he was about to catch the first glimpse of his new body through his eyes. Sure, he knew what Cheryl looked like, but this was going to be a very different perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly walked up to the mirror on the dresser. His heart rate jumped a tiny bit in the anticipation of seeing his new form. He was greeted by a woman in her late-40s. He now donned a mane of bushy brown hair that was loosely tied up in a bun. He had rich, dark brown eyes. His jaw was square, but still smoothly effeminate. Johnny reached up and felt his face, being overcome with a feeling of surreal. Silver hoop earrings hung from his lobes. His skin was tanned from hours in the sun while at the beach. Johnny looked down at himself, finally getting the perspective of being in someone else's body. He saw a small amount of cleavage poking out of Cheryl's blouse. He went ahead and unbuttoned the rest of the shirt and let it fall to the ground. There he stood, in a bra and pair of shorts. Johnny looked at the mirror, never having realized just how large Cheryl's bust was. Holy cow, Ms. Wall, how do you carry these things around, thought Johnny. His beige bra was filled to the brim. Johnny brought his hands up to his chest, and played coyly with his new assets. Lifting the pair caused a wave of relief over his shoulders and back. He gently toyed with his nipples through the fabric of the bra, which still felt wonderful. Nicely done, ma'am, he thought. Cheryl's belly swelled slightly over the waistband of her shorts. She was absent and stretch marks, but sported a small scar a few inches below her belly button. Johnny's hands ran from his chest down his sides as he felt his new curves. He now had quite the hourglass figure. His buttox pulled his shorts taught, but was still relatively pert, considering his age and weight. Standing there, Johnny noticed how his thighs were touching, until just above his knees. Johnny looked back up at the mirror, seeing himself topless with a bra. He smirked, thinking about how ridiculous this situation was, but still enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking eye contact with himself in the mirror, Johnny asked, \"So, what do we do now?\". Knowing good and well he had some time to himself, he went ahead with the full monty. Reaching behind himself, he unclasped the bra and slipped it off his shoulders. It fell silently to the ground, and Johnny felt the full weight of his breasts hanging from his chest. Sure, they sagged, but they were even larger than he had anticipated. She must go tanning, he thought when he noticed there weren't any tan lines. His brown areolas were slightly asymmetric, but still felt wonderful as Johnny ran his fingers across them. His hands started making their way down his belly to the top of his shorts. He played with the button between his new pointer finger and thumb. Just as it popped open, he put his hands down inside his cotton panties. It felt the smooth skin, and was about to do some further exploration of his new body when a knock came at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly jumping out of his skin, Johnny did his best to get dressed quickly. He threw the bra on as fast as he could, the clips in the back giving him some trouble along the way. He tightened down the shoulder straps as he tucked his breasts into the cups. He buttoned up his shorts as he grabbed his blouse off the ground while he made his way to the front of the house. He could feel his breasts bouncing from side-to-side as he put his arms through the sleeves in the shirt. Starting from the bottom, Johnny buttoned up the blouse, smoothed out his clothing and regained his composition while standing behind the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeked through the eyehole in the door, seeing that there was a woman, maybe early 50s, with puffy blonde hair standing in the miranda looking at her watch. Who on earth is that? Thought Johnny. He knew that Cheryl had cancelled her plans for the day, so no one should be expecting her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cheryl sat down, nervously shaking at the ramifications of swapping bodies with a younger guy for a short while. 'Will he really keep my life in check? I hope he doesn't screw anything up.' She worried, thinking of her home and family. \"Alright, it's all set up, let's get this going.\" Johnny declared, starting up the machine. Having run through much of the construction and programming, Johnny was nearly certain the two of them would swap bodies. Although, to be honest, seeing and hearing it all function was as much a boost to his pride than if it actually works. \"This won't hurt, right?\" Cheryl was concerned once more, and upon not hearing Johnny respond, she grew increasingly doubtful. Expecting it not to work from the get-go, she began fretting over if this mix of machinery built by Johnny would explode or catch fire instead. There's no way she'd want to risk her life to make sure some guy's aspirations are affirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I've changed my mind!\" Cheryl yelled, getting up from her seat. \"Wait, stop!\" Johnny called, grabbing onto her arm and pulling her back. \"No! Let me go!\" She declared, as the shack resounded louder with it's machinery. \"You can't just leave in the middle of the swapping process!\" Johnny told her, saying it moreso to see this through. Cheryl kept on pulling back, so Johnny also got up from his seat; she was backing out, so Johnny started to back out too, just to place his arm around her waist in an attempt to push her back in. Slowly, Cheryl managed to overpower him, backing both of them out of the shack just enough so that just their heads were outside. And then the process reached it's climax, then finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding herself completely uninjured, Cheryl got back in, looking down at herself. \"Oh my god, it worked!\" She shouted, seeing Johnny's clothes and younger skin, whilst speaking with his voice, too. \"Yeah, it actually did....\" Johnny replied, looking down at the curvy mature body below him. Cheryl turned to cheerily thank Johnny,\"This is great, now I can get that vaca-\" But cut her kind words as she see the mess now in play. \"What?\" Johnny asked, oblivious for he was looking away from Cheryl. \"Look at me!\" She yelled, frustrated. \"Oh my god.\" He whispered, seeing that the swap wasn't completely done. Above the neck of his original body, and with his male lips on her face, was the head of the angry Cheryl. Feeling up his own face with manicured hands, Johnny felt Cheryl's thicker lips on him, but the contours of his face and short hair were definitely his own. \"Oh dear. When you tried to escape, our entire bodies must not have been inside the shack. So as a result, what was left out, in this case most of our heads, wasn't included in the swap.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening! We can't even assume each others' lives!\" Cheryl started crying, so Johnny shushed her down with his mature female voice. \"It's alright, we can just get the swap process going again.\" He assured, followed by multiple loud clangs coming from in the shack. Multiple pieces of the machinery had become busted and fallen to the floor, indicating it was inoperable for now. \"Gee, thanks a lot; this is definitely going to help me relax now!\" Cheryl sarcastically said, poking Johnny in the chest. \"How are you going to fix this?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">It's a sleepy, summer afternoon in Snoozeton, a small town in the heart of the Bible belt. Most of the locals spend their time tending to their yards, going to their kids' soccer and baseball games, and enjoying time at neighborhood cookouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until today. Johnny Mack was a bit of a child prodigy, but also just an all-around tinkerer and creator of things. He was very excited, because today he was unveiling his latest creation... The Swap Shack. The Swap Shack is simple, two people enter, two people come out, but in each other's bodies.

He's always encouraged his children to explore the sciences. However, Johnny's string of failed experiments have Richard wondering if his son is destined for greatness in the science community.

He's a bit of a jock, and really like to pick on Johnny for being such a nerd. Jack loves nothing more than to mess around with Johnny's gizmos and bully him around. Johnny thinks that Jack's affliction for bullying stems from when Jack was cut from the local minor league baseball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy Lou Mack - Jack's older sister. She's 20 years old and just about to finish her degree at the local university. She's a budding mathematician, and someday wants to use math to save the world!

The Mack family lives in a quiet neighborhood, where dozens of families are available for testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo read, enjoy, and please leave your comments and reviews.
