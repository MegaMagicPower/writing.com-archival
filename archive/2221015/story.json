He'd been looking forward to this for months and now with his latest film done, it was time to work on his family some. Sure Little Robert was only a year old, but that's the most important time to bond with your kid, right?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia was off doing one of her own shows and wasn't supposed to be back for several more weeks, maybe even months. The perfect opportunity to practice his newly acquired cooking skill to surprise her with when she got back. In the meantime, he always got a little carried away on his practice dishes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not used to cooking for himself, he hadn't learned portion control yet and it was already starting to show. In only a couple months that Italia had been away, his abs had become smooth. Sure, he was still rather toned and had a slim waist, he wasn't about to take his shirt off in public until he started working with a trainer again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His cook wasn't helping much. Since he was usually practicing on his own, Malcolm, his cook, would still come in and make him meals despite him stating he had to much food as it was and the cook would only take home what he made and nothing else, leaving Robbie with more food than he could eat alone. A problem since he had been taught to never let food go to waste.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The one thing he did admit he'd miss when he did get a trainer again and cut back on cooking so much was how relaxed he felt with his full stomach. He never got to the point of stuffing himself, he tried that once when he first started cooking and it nearly made him sick. At least being relaxed made it easy to play with his son.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert was currently asleep in his crib at the moment giving Robbie time to just relax with a game or movie. With the leftovers from breakfast still in his fridge, Malcolm had cooked his a large plate of chicken Parmesan and bow tie pasta with a side of seasoned mixed veggies. As much as he hated that Malcolm wouldn't stop cooking, even though he'd been threatened to be fired if he didn't help Robbie learn better portion control, they both knew it was an empty threat. Italia and Robbie had hired him because of his end cooking skills, fit for a five star restaurant, and his not wanting a large pay. Now he wished that Malcolm would apply elsewhere just so he'd have an excuse to fire him despite his delectable food and without making him feel guilty.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One thing he did find suspicious about Malcolm was even though he was only cooking for Robbie at the moment, he was still cooking as if Italia was still here and was taking home less than half the extras. If he didn't know any better, he'd have thought Malcolm was trying to fatten him up. But that would be ridiculous. They'd hired him over a year ago and had never had a problem before with anything like this. Why would he start now?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie absentmindedly pondered Malcolm's strange habits as he rubbed his full gut, the TV going in the background. It wasn't until he heard Robert crying through the baby monitor that he came to his senses and noticed the smell of baking peaches. Malcolm must have made a pie for dessert tonight. Something else the cook had been doing as of late. Though only once a week and it was normally gone within a two or three days. Shrugging it off, he went into the nursery to check on his son. He'd been fed before his nap, so he shouldn't be hungry for another hour or so. It didn't take but a second for him to realize the problem as he picked up the boy and almost lost the diaper! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, boy!\" He gagged as the smell assaulted his nose. \"Time's like these, I wish we had gotten a nanny!\" Taking a deep breath, he set out on changing the diaper. It took him two near pass outs to successfully change it, but he managed it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert now cleaned and changed, the two headed downstairs where Malcolm could be heard removing the pie from the oven.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know you don't need to make dessert. Or so much at meals. I'm trying to cook myself.\" Robbie reminded him for the millionth time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. Just want to make sure you get your fill.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've been getting more than my fill. I should actually start cutting back some. My abs aren't visible unless I'm flexing them anymore.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're fine, Mr. Amell. If I had your body, even without the abs, I'd have no problem getting a girl.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can set you up if you'd like. There's lots of girls around the studios who would love a guy with your personality and skills.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And dump me for the first guy 50 pounds lighter than me that catches her eye. It's happened before. Sorry, sir, but I think I'll look on my own.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. If you want. But not all the girls are like that.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm didn't respond as he started chopping up carrots, potatoes and other veggies to go in a large pot pie for dinner.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie eyed the dish he was using suspiciously. \"Malcolm, we have smaller pans. That's going to be way to large for two people.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. But better safe than sorry. I was meaning to let you know that I won't be able to come in tomorrow. My mother called and is making a surprise visit. Her and dad got into another fight.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry to hear that. That makes what, the third time she's done this since you started working for us?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. But at least she gets to relax some.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you can bring her by to use the pool if she wants. I don't mind, as long as she wears a properly fitting swimsuit.\" He shuddered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry about that. She didn't realize how much weight she'd lost since the last time she'd worn it. But I'll let her know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anyway, can I help? I can always use more practice on dishes other than breakfast.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure. Go put Robert down and grab a rolling pin. You can work on the dough for the crust while I finish the veggies.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie did as instructed and was soon working on the crust.</span></div></div>",

I'll take the old one home if you don't want it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had to think it over for a moment. The extra food wasn't needed but the practice was. And as appetizing as the pie smelled, peach was not his favorite. Maybe if there was the stuff for a pumpkin pie...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's see what there is for other pies.\" Malcolm interrupted his thoughts. Searching around in some grocery bags and the fridge, cartons of strawberries, a bag of apples, cream cheese, eggs, some pecans, and various other ingredients. \"See any that catch your fancy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How about a blueberry pie?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure thing. You like blueberries?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Since I was a kid. I can easily go overboard with them and make myself sick if I'm not careful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No problem. You need directions?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah wouldn't hurt. You give the directions and I'll make the pie.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the next hour, Malcolm directed Robbie on making the pie, mixing the right amount of sugar with the blueberries, cutting the strips of dough for the top crust, putting it all together properly before it went into the oven with the pot pie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the food now baking, Robbie went out to play with Robert. The two played with some balls, rolling them back and forth, banged on a toy xylophone, placing blocks into proper holes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Want a snack?\" Malcolm asked. Without waiting for an answer, he placed a veggie tray on the coffee table with a large bowl of ranch dip in the middle already.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Malcolm, dinner's in like an hour. I could have waited.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dinner may be, but a little snack never hurts. I thought you could also use a little reward. Your pie turned out great and is out on the counter, cooling.\" He grabbed a broccoli floret and dipped it in the ranch before handing it to Robbie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Begrudgingly, he took the broccoli. At least it was slightly healthy, once you go past the ranch anyways. Going back to playing with Robert, he started  munching on the veggies without really thinking about it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pot pie's ready! I've already gotten your plate ready Mr. Amell. And I have some freshly made applesauce for Robert.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Malcolm. You can leave now. Feel free to take some of that pot pit. It's to large for me to eat by myself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I already got some.\" He held up a Tupperware container with a portion of the pie in it. It didn't look like much to Robbie, but at least he wouldn't have to eat it ALL himself. \"And I made a couple other baby foods for Robert for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. I hope everything goes okay with your mom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It will. Don't forget to practice your cooking while I'm gone for a couple days. I'll expect a complete list of everything you cooked when I get back, understood?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Since when did you become my cooking coach? That's what I'm taking classes for.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Since today. When I was coaching you in making the pies.\" Malcolm laughed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grinned at the man. \"Okay, okay. I'll keep you a list. But don't think I'm paying as my coach too.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fair enough. Well, I better be heading out. Mom will be in tonight at 9 tonight. See you in a couple days Mr. Amell.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Enjoy your time off.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With Malcolm gone, Robbie placed his son in the high chair. Although Robert had not yet learned to walk, he had managed to start feeding himself, albeit with lots of flying food when he was in a playful mood. He chuckled as he ate the chicken pot pie, watching Robert laugh as he alternated between eating and wearing his food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie scooped some of the pot pie onto a plate just as a spoonful of applesauce hit him in the shoulder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"None of that now!\" He scolded as Robert laughed. Not really paying attention, he ended up putting a second scoop of the pie onto his plate before putting it down to dodge another spoonful of applesauce. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, your dinner time is over!\" Robbie chuckled as he dodged a third spoonful. Removing the bowl, he grabbed Robert in one arm and his food in the other, heading out to the living room so he could watch Robert play while he ate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Normally, he wouldn't dream of eating in the living room. Italia was very particular about keeping the high thread count furniture and carpet clean. What she didn't know wouldn't hurt her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie absentmindedly ate the double helping of pot pie while Robert banged at his xylophone with the pyramid block. He didn't notice how much he'd eaten until he brought his fork up to his mouth and found it clean. Oddly, he didn't feel as full as he thought he would, but that sometimes happened with Malcolm's cooking. Not often enough to make him worry until Italia left for her latest film, but it was known to happen. Not full yet, he pulled over the veggie tray that was still on the table and started munching on that, leaving the celery which he had never been a big fan of.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert yawned as the clock chimed 8, snapping Robbie out of his stupor. \"Looks like it's bedtime,\" he muttered before groaning as he went to lean forward towards his son, meeting a little resistance from his front. Looking over at the veggie tray, almost everything was eaten and the ranch dip had been scraped from the bowl. Gingerly, he reached down to pick up the toddler. He could actually see a slight bulge through his shirt as he stood up, feeling like the weight of the food was pulling his stomach further down. It was uncomfortable, but like when you stretch, painful, but in the good way.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading upstairs, he placed Robert in the crib in his bedroom so he could also take a nap himself. As he drifted off, his hand soothingly moved around his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was early morning and Robbie was just waking up. Italia wasn't anywhere to be seen but he could smell breakfast cooking. The smells stimulated a primal urge in him, one he reveled in most of the time anymore. It took him several minutes anymore to sit up as his rather large ball gut covered most of his lap before he could even sit up straight. He had to combine that movement with swinging his legs over the edge of the bed in order to not end up pinned down again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Huffing for breath, sweat already starting to bead on his forehead, he finally managed to stand up. Not for the first time, he was glad Italia still forced him to go to the gym or else he'd already be bed ridden by now. As it was, he was still by far more flab than muscle. This had ended his acting career some time ago, but he was happier than ever, spending time with his son, and he wouldn't have it any other way. He just needed the construction company to hurry up and widen the doors or he'd be getting stuck in them pretty soon. His gut was already rubbing up against the frame when he went through.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Breakfast Robbie! Bring Robert with you please!\" Italia yelled from downstairs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every step he took caused the windows to rattle. All the pictures had been removed from the walls almost 200 pounds ago when they started falling off as he walked through the house. In order to pick up Robbie from the crib, he had to turn sideways because he couldn't reach around his gut from straight on. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert in his arms, he headed downstairs where Malcolm and Italia had spent the morning making him a mountain of food. The bacon and eggs alone would have fed four grown men, but he'd have that as starters before moving onto the quiche, cinnamon rolls, crepes, and other foods. He was just about to eat his first bite when Robert started crying. Looking over, Robert sat in his high chair, playing with his pancakes, crying for some strange reason. His crying got louder and louder but Italia and Malcolm didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie awoke with a start. Robert was crying his crib. Outside the windows, the sky had darkened. He didn't need the lights on to know why his son was crying though. Despite the foul smell, his stomach growled. He'd already eaten a lot tonight, but a little more couldn't hurt, could it? He could lose it later. His dream was on the edge of his conscious, enticing him. He shouldn't want that, but it felt so real, so good.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, as he changed Robert's diaper, he knew what he was going to do.</span></div></div>",

I've got this.\" Malcolm told him without his asking.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Malcolm.\" Robbie headed out to check on his son. Robert was on the floor, crying, with a small glass on the floor nearby. \"Ohhhh! Come here Little Guy!\" Picking him up, he gently bounced him, kissing the slight red spot that had appeared on his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything alright?\" Malcolm yelled from the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I left a cup out here and he knocked it over on himself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Poor guy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie soothed Robert until the infant fell asleep. Still holding him, he headed back into the kitchen where Malcolm had already placed the diced chicken and veggies into the pot pie and was just finishing up the gravy that was going in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh. I didn't hear you come in. Just adding the gravy and the crust then it's going in the oven. Hope you don't mind, but I used an old family recipe for the gravy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not a problem as long as it tastes good.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You think I got this by not having good recipes?\" Malcolm bounced his belly a little. \"But the gravy won't contribute to that any. You're going to have to pull it out of the oven. I need to get going or else my mom is going to be at the airport, panicking because I'm not there yet.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. Hope everything goes okay with your mom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Mr. Amell. Enjoy the pies. I hope Roberts okay.\" With that, he left, leaving Robbie and his son alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Settling down in the living room, he turned the TV on low volume so Robert wouldn't be disturbed. He wasn't paying much attention to the show that was on until the timer went off. As carefully as if he were getting on thin ice, Robbie laid his son on the blanket on the floor well away from the table or anything else that might fall on him and headed in to grab the pot pie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm had outdone himself as the pie smelled delicious. Scooping out a large slice, he went back out to the living room. Robert was just stirring again as he made himself comfy. Robert sat up, rubbing his eyes, as Robbie took his first bite, immediately wishing he had waited a couple minutes to let it cool down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grabbing his cup, he filled it with tea to cool his singed tongue off before taking another bite.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert glanced around, looking for something, before toddling over to a ball that he started rolling and chasing around.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie watched as he ate his helping of pot pie. The pie was delicious and he could feel it filling his stomach but it wasn't very filling. Despite his thoughts from earlier that he should try losing his budding gut, he found his plate loaded again.</span></div></div>",

He knew he should stop eating, but the pie was just to good, he wasn't full yet, and he wasn't sure he even cared. These past few weeks off had been glorious and it's not like he needed the money, even if Italia also quit, they'd still be set for life or at least decades.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While trying to decide, he scraped a third serving of the pot pie onto the plate. He could feel how full he was now and his stomach was protesting but only slightly. Not enough to convince him not to continue eating. Just looking down, he imagined each bite stretching his stomach just a little more.The thought intrigued him for some reason.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he fought to stop.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He knew Italia would never tolerate him getting fat. Divorce would likely be in his future if he kept this up. It would kill him if he couldn't have Robert in his life every day. Maybe he could convince her to let him eat more and gain some weight if he did continue at the gym. Go for a power lifter build. She may not have tolerated fat guys but she never seemed to mind guys with muscles, even if they were under a layer of flab. That was a possibility. Or maybe she didn't mind fat guys as much as he thought? Well, the best option would be to start working out again while not restricting his diet anymore while she was still gone so the change would be a surprise to her but would show his commitment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His fork scraped against his plate, shocking him out of his thoughts. He hadn't even noticed he had started eating again. It would probably be best if he saved the rest for later. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Groaning, he pushed himself out of the chair and grabbed the empty pot pit pan. Wait, empty?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That's why his stomach hurt so badly! Without meaning to, he'd eaten the entire thing! In three servings! When there was six servings total!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carefully, he waddled over to the dish washer to put the dirty dishes in but he couldn't bend over without risking throwing everything up and it wouldn't be as good the second time around. Instead, he placed the dishes on the counter and made his way out to the living room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before lowering himself down onto the couch, he checked on Robert who had fallen asleep himself on his blanket next to the recliner. Lowering himself down, he was out himself the moment his head hit the throw pillows.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't due back for another day which meant that he'd need a babysitter as tonight was next cooking class.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading into the building, he took up his usual place half way back on the left side next to Angelina. He'd tried talking to her, but as far as he could tell, the black haired woman was anti-social to the point of only talking when she needed something. Not that he minded that but it would have been nice to get to know his cooking partner at least a little.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the last person came in, the instructor, a tiny man who looked like Einstein greeted everyone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good evening everyone. Please take out your provided recipe cards. Tonight, we will be making fettuccine  Alfredo and cheesecake. We'll start with the cheesecake since it has to bake for a bit then move on to the Alfredo sauce.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The instructor guided everyone through an independent showing and then had them all do it themselves, occasionally showing someone where they were going wrong. It wasn't to unusual for Robbie not to need any help, he was rather surprised how adept he turned out to be at cooking, and tonight was no different. Only thing was that these classes always ended up with him having extra food to take home and tonight's was even richer than usual. The exact opposite of what he was wanting right now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an hour, everyone's dishes were done. The instructor came around and sampled everyone's dishes, releasing the people who had successfully made the required dishes and helping those that had failed to fix where they went wrong.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie was given the green light right away and packed up everything he had made. Getting home didn't take long as there wasn't much traffic that late at night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once the baby sitter was gone, he checked on Robert, asleep in his crib, he sat down at the table to eat his leftovers. He avoided rich foods like these normally due to needing to keep in shape for his career, but the first bite told him he should put the fork down immediately if he wanted to keep his figure. Instead, he savored each bite. Savoring it until every last noodle was slurped up and every last crumb of crust was licked off his fingers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moaning, he leaned back, rubbing his bloated stomach once again. He didn't want this to become habit but it felt so good to be so full and the belly rubs also helped so much too. He wasn't sure he wanted to cut back anymore. Especially if the foods he'd been missing out were this good!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>But Italia...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Screw it.

It's not like I can't lose it later. But for now, I  just want to enjoy myself and the food from last night was so good!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Enough said.\" Malcolm chuckled. \"So, what? Am I supposed to take over as cooking instructor now? And if so, does it come with a pay raise?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll see. Though if I'm cooking, that means you'll have to watch Robert a little, so let's see how good your instructions are over the next day and then we'll decide.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh, fair enough. Want to start tomorrow? Since I've already started on today's lunch?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds good. What supplies should I get?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A cookbook. You want me to teach you different recipes, you have to pick the recipes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie didn't have many books in his house to begin with, much less cook books since he'd always had a chef to prepare everything for him. If they were going to start tomorrow though, he didn't have time to get a baby sitter and didn't want to split Malcolm's attention so instead, he grabbed his laptop and joined Robert in the living room. Italian and desserts were the obvious spots to start after last night's meal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Might as well go simple. Spaghetti is always a safe Italian bet and the sauce was highly versatile so he could experiment and get used to the various herbs and how they affected the flavor, right? Sounded right to him. But what about desserts? What type dessert would go well with spaghetti? Maybe just a regular dessert? Scrolling through different desserts, he decide upon a fairly simple one, a genoese sponge cake. The picture alone looked delicious though the recipe didn't say what the topping on it was. He'd have to ask Malcolm about that bit. Might as well do that now and that way Malcolm could pick up the ingredients on his way over.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a jelly topping. I'll just pick up a jar tomorrow instead of making it fresh. Any idea how you want to do the sauce?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was thinking of just winging it. Adding as needed. Otherwise, just a basic meat marinara sauce.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Simple yet complicated. We can do that. We'll get started tomorrow. Have the next days recipes picked out and I'll pick up the ingredients before coming each day.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grinned until he walked out of the kitchen. Looking down, he could already see the slight start of his belly through his shirt and still wasn't sure he wanted to let it get larger but at the same time, he was kind of excited where thins might go.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, things are already set in motion.

I mean, you just enjoying yourself, right? I figured that can't be done with \"decent\" portion sizes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but I don't want to get fat!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? I've seen you lighten up on your restrictions since Mrs. Amell's been gone. You used to have a six pack but that's disappeared. It will take time to restore it, so why not just really let go for as long as possible?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie had to admit, he had a point. He had let himself go and was enjoying it. Screw it. He was going to take Malcolm's advice and just go for it! He'd never felt better than he had over the past couple weeks when he'd nearly knocked himself out from eating so much. Well, except those times when he was having \"quality time\" with Italia, but other than that...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. But I still think that will be WAY to much for me. I don't want to waste the food by making so much more than we could eat.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. I can agree with that. So let's get started!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm guided Robbie through the different steps for preparing the different dishes while he played with Robert. Every once in a while, he'd come over and give a some advice on how to balance the flavor of the herbs. Despite what Robbie had said, there was still an entire box of spaghetti cooked, two pounds of spaghetti sauce and the sponge cake ended up being twice as thick as most sheet cakes. He'd express concern over the sheer volume of food throughout his time in the kitchen but ease up when Malcolm assured him he'd help him eat it all.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sauce done after three hours of simmering, Robbie finally sat down at the table. Malcolm insisted on waiting on him. He brought out a plate of the spaghetti for him and every time he ran out, the plate was refilled within seconds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Three plates turned into four. Robbie leaned back, groaning, his gut rounded out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"To much.\" He moaned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, at least try a slice of the sponge cake. Oh, and I made you this too.\" He placed a large glass of what looked like chocolate milkshake on the table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Malcolm, but something a little thinner would definitely be preferred.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This will help you digest some. Just take a gulp and you'll see what I mean.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie groaned as he leaned forward to grab it. Bracing himself, he took a gulp. The shake was really thick but the cold semi-liquid helped sooth his aching stomach.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More than should have been.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Malcolm, what's in this shake?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Chocolate ice cream, some cream, a banana, and just a couple muscle relaxants. It's perfectly safe. I got it from the store at the same time I got the jelly for the sponge cake. Here's the bottle so you can check it out for yourself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He rolled the bottle across the table. Sure enough, Robbie recognized them from the store. They were well known as not being that powerful.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should have told me about that before giving it to me. I could have had a reaction to that or something.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're right. I'm sorry. But that's why I got the weak ones that weren't known for being that effective. But you're already feeling ready for that cake, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grumbled but nodded. Malcolm went into the kitchen and came back with a large slice of the sponge cake topped with a smooth layer of Raspberry jelly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the last of the cake disappeared from the plate and all the shake drained from the glass, Robbie struggled to stand. With Malcolm's help, he made his way into the living room and plopped onto the couch to sleep off his giant meal next to his son, napping in his crib. He faded out as Malcolm started banging around in the kitchen, cleaning up the mess that had been made.</span></div></div>",

Every morning Malcolm would show up with the ingredients for that days meals in larger portions than Robbie found reasonable but soon realized that those were important as his capacity slowly increased but not as fast as the portion sizes. That's why he reluctantly agreed to take the relaxants after meals. And his waist was taking the brunt of the damage. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm had been teaching him a week and a half when he saw his first sign, actually signs, of the damage done so far. Trying to get ready for his cooking class for the night, the babysitter arrived to hear him struggling upstairs. She didn't know what was going on, but had she gone upstairs, she would have found him in his room, squirming around on the bed, trying to get his jeans buttoned. Sweaty and out of breath but finally having them buttoned, he made his way to the bathroom to clean up a little. It was while he was washing his face that he noticed his shirt was also riding up just a sliver but it was enough to show off a red patch. Pulling it up a little showed an almost inch long and half inch wide red strip of flesh ending just below the edge of his jeans.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn! I'm going to have to talk to Malcolm! This is getting out of hand!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything alright Mr. Amell?\" Asked Mena, bouncing a giggling Robert on her knee as he came down. \"I heard a lot of banging up there.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Just a slight wardrobe malfunction. I'll be back at the usual time tonight. Feel free to help yourself to anything in the fridge.\" He left without giving her a chance to respond, slamming the door behind him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He hoped that the class tonight would have some light recipes, like a nice egg white omelet or something. No such luck. Tonight was frittata night. For the first time, everyone was to pick two recipe card and make their own recipe and his was a mushroom and zucchini and a potato and bacon frittata.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like normal, the class went about an hour and Robbie had and entire one and a half frittatas to take home. Once done, he rushed out as fast as he could. The entire class, his pants had been cutting into him. He'd need to get larger clothes tomorrow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The new developments of stretch marks and needing a larger wardrobe made Robbie wonder what he was doing but the smell of the frittatas in the seat next to him was to enticing, quickly pushing the thoughts out of his mind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He knew he should slow down, tell Malcolm not bring so many supplies, but his stomach's grumble now despite a huge meal and some grazing through the day did nothing to help him want to cut back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Mena was paid and Robert was down for the night, Robbie peeled off his pants and started on his late night \"snack\". Before going to bed that night, there was nothing left of the frittatas except a bloated mound on his waist. He fell asleep massaging the food into him for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Malcolm arrived the next morning, he still had the taste of frittatas in his mouth and he wanted some more so even though they were going to make a lasagna, he sent Malcolm out to get the ingredients for them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm didn't even try to hide his pleasure at Robbie's desire for more food and while he got the ingredients, had Robbie start on the lasagna.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the frittatas on the menu, Malcolm altered the lasagna recipe some to let it simmer longer and by the time he had coaxed the entirety of both larger frittatas into Robbie, the lasagna was ready and smelling divine. Even with his gut again bloated, something he was getting used to, he still took Malcolm up on a slice of the lasagna that was close to an eighth of the whole 10x13 inch wide, eight lair deep lasagna. He ate the whole slice and couldn't get up at that point. Even with the help of the muscle relaxants, he still had trouble breathing, he was so stuffed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm took Robbie's craving that morning as a sign and started bringing more supplies.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the end of the second week, Robbie swore he was going to cut back as another stretch mark had appeared but by the end of third week, his abs were gone even when he tried to flex them, not that he tried that much anymore and he wasn't sure he wanted to anymore.</span></div></div>",

Woke up hungry so thought I'd get a little snack while waiting for you to get here with the breakfast supplies.\" He sat up, brushing crumbs off his chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm couldn't help but admire the changes to Robbie's body over the past month and a half. His entire body was already showing signs of the gluttony he was embracing wholeheartedly. In the years he'd worked for him, Robbie had always had a trim runner's or swimmer's build. Now his chest had puffed up a bit. The basic tone his arms and legs had was gone. Slight love handles hugged his shorts with a dozen stretch marks around it. His abs bowed out an inch too, pushing the short down as well and as he stood up, Malcolm got a view of the padding of his rear now holding up the shorts from behind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ready to make those quesadillas?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Robert's at a play date all morning so we have time to spare.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading into the kitchen, Robbie and Malcolm got all the their separate ingredients sorted. A week ago, Robbie got tired of having one recipe a day so he would do one recipe while Malcolm did another and looked over his shoulder to make sure he was doing everything correctly and breakfast. Today's recipes were quesadillas and a sausage casserole.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For an hour, Malcolm prepped and baked the casserole while Robbie prepped the quesadillas, munching on extra bits of the ingredients and trail mix as he went. As everything went into the oven to bake, Malcolm made up Robbie's now daily morning milkshake. The base of which Malcolm always added the same: ice cream, heavy cream, mass gain powder, and multivitamins, and Robbie would then spice it up with different spices, fruits, toppings or other ingredients. This new ritual alone had nearly doubled the rate at which he had been putting on weight and he considered it the cause of an extra 5 pounds on top of the 20 that plain overeating had caused.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm always insisted that he drink the entire thing thing before he left. At first, Robbie tried to insist that he couldn't drink the whole thing and that Malcolm should have some too but Malcolm always denied it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're the growing boy, not me.\" He'd chuckle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With all the changes to his diet, Malcolm stopped leaving until Robbie had a visible bloat that made it difficult to move on his own and then would also leave that day's leftovers nearby so he could eat upon waking. He'd gotten so used to this, that when awake, he almost never went without food for very long.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And he was loving it.</span></div></div>",

Robbie jumped around his room, slamming into everything as he struggled to pull his shirt down over his head. After five minutes, he finally managed to yank it off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Panting, he held the shirt up in front of himself. The large shirt had fit just right for several years but looking at it in the mirror, he could see how close he was to overflowing the sides of it when it was flat. This was still his favorite shirt and there was no way he'd gained enough weight in two months to outgrow it! He'd get into it if it was the last thing he did!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scrunching up the shirt, he threw both arms through the sleeves, pinching them in the process, and pulled it down so his head was through the neck hole. Grinning, he lowered his arms to pull the shirt the rest of the way down. It got halfway down then stopped. He kept trying to pull it down more but his arms wouldn't bend anymore. The fabric was pulled taut around his shoulders. With one last heave, he yanked it down...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And yanked the seams out of the left shoulder!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn it!\" He screamed again as the shirt finally went down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The still intact parts of the shirt fit like a second skin. Even with the seams burst, he'd still have trouble getting it off. Especially with it cutting circulation off to his right arm. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading into the bathroom, he grabbed a pair of scissors meant for trimming his beard. They weren't meant to cut something as thick as fabric so it took some effort to free his arm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hand still tingling, he yanked the shirt off as fast as he could.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gym clothes it is.\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His gym shirt was much easier to get into since it was sleeveless but was just as form fitting, showing off every new curve he'd gained.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert's crying echoed down the halls spurring him to dress faster. Foregoing his pants that had been fitting like skinny jeans the past few days, he threw on the sweats from the one game of pick up basketball he'd played with some friends a couple days ago. They'd gotten no end of kicks making fun of his weight gain, most of which he just took in turn, knowing it was bound to happen sooner or later.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert was standing in his crib, bawling as if something had hurt him, with his teddy bear on the floor below.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bending over to pick it up, he could feel his sweats straining against his ass. He needed to go clothes shopping soon or he was going to outgrow all of his clothes by the end of the month!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Picking up Robert and the bear, he carried them down to the living room before joining Malcolm in the kitchen where breakfast was almost ready.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened to the regular clothes you wanted to wear today?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't ask.\" Robbie growled. Malcolm opted to respond by pulling the breakfast souffle out of the oven. The savory scent of cream cheese and berries filled the room, eliciting a growl from Robbie's stomach. While they finished cooling, he started working on the pot of chicken gnocchi soup. Malcolm had prepared the gnocchi the night before so it wouldn't take as long. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soup on the stove, Robbie helped himself to the finished souffles as Malcolm baked more. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finish his third of the souffles, he glanced at the fourth one sitting there waiting to be eaten, another 4 in the oven waiting to come out and join the others on his waistline. If he didn't slow down, he'd out grow every clothes store he went to by the end of the year.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robbie grumbled to himself and looked down at the souffle, feeling conflicted.  It felt so good to not have to worry about how much he ate and when, or sticking to a workout routine that he had monotonously done before a million times just to maintain a certain look that he didn't care about.  Was that true, did he really not care about the physique that he had put so much effort into and had given him so much?  Had he been fat, would he have been cast as Ronnie Raymond? Scooby Doo's Fred had never been tubby as far as he was aware.  Would he even have got to the audition of most of the roles he had if he turned up with a bulging belly rather than a six pack?  Any auditions that he did make would be for the goofy fat friend, or the comic relief, if he even made it past being an extra.  The big roles wanted attractive and athletic, there was no premium in being fat.  It made sense to cut back and lose weight, of course it did, but it just didn't <i>feel</i> right... what felt right, was being bloated full of food, his belly as tight as a drum and lounging back on the couch as his stomach went to work on digesting it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it wasn't like he was cutting back to make sure that his clothes still fit properly, he thought running a hand down his skin tight gym shirt.  That ship had definitely sailed.  He could just buy another copy of his favourite shirt in a bigger size, it wasn't like... catching himself mid-thought, Robbie shook his head gently as if to dislodge the idea from his mind.  Letting go a bit was one thing, but he didn't want to start buying bigger sizes.  Buying bigger clothes everytime he outgrew his old ones was the path to getting huge.  Robbie put down the spoon in his hand and drummed the table with his fingers as he began to feel conflicted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped the spoon up and dragged the souffle closer to him, as Malcolm delivered a fresh batch of four to the table.  \"Did they come out alright?  You're not eating as fast as you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they're great, I was just thinking.\"  Malcolm grinned as he pushed the fresh batch of souffles closer toward Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can think and eat, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, thanks.\"  Robbie said, grinning back.  \"They taste great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, well eat up.  The soup will be done soon.\" Malcolm said as he walked back into the kitchen.  Robbie plunged into the souffle and pushed an overly full spoonful into his mouth.  Today he would finish off all the food that Malcolm made as skipping it all wouldn't bring back his shirt, or make his other clothes magically fit and he didn't want to see it go to waste.  But tomorrow he would have to have a serious talk with Malcolm, or at the very least try and cut back.  No not try, he <i> would</i> cut back.  He coudn't support his family on a fat actors budget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie tore through the souffles much to Malcolm's obvious delight and it was only when he was nearly done that he remembered that he should probably be helping out.  \"Hey, aren't I meant to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take a day off.  Why not just relax and enjoy yourself.\"  <i> That was part of the problem</i>, Robbie thought to himself sourly.  He would enjoy the food and this 'experiment' today and make the changes tomorrow.  As he finished the souffles, Malcolm deposited a large bowl of chicken gnocchi soup in front of him and went back for one of his special chocolate shakes.  Robbie got into a rhythm of a few scoops of the soup followed by a a couple of big gulps of the drink and as Malcolm refilled the soup bowl as it became perilously low, Robbie realised that he was putting away a huge amount of it.  The shake made everything taste so creamy and rich, but there was no doubt that the soup had the most fattening ingredients that Malcolm could lay his hands on.  As Robbie began to breathe more deeply and spread his legs open as the sheer fullness of his stomach took its toll, he idly wondered if Malcolm had upped the amount or strength of the muscle relaxants that he used, or snuck some into the soup as well.  That would certainly be in character for him.  He considered asking Malcolm, but he never felt like talking when he started to get really full.  All he wanted to do was try and cram a bit more in and sit back and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job!\"  Malcolm said, sounding genunely impressed as the soup spoon clattered in the bowl.  \"Want some help to get to the couch?\"  Robbie was barely able to nod lethargically.  It took a while for him to get to his feet and after Malcolm snaked his arm around his waist and rested a steadying hand on the side of his gut, the two of them made the painfully slow journey to the couch.  Even though the soup was pretty thick, between it and the shake he could feel the liquid press up against and stretch out his stomach.  Both he and Malcolm had to stop several times on the way, Robbie to make sure that he didn't push himself too hard and bring back up all of Malcolm's hard work and Malcolm needed to get a better grip on Robbie as his rounded out belly probably wasn't the easiest get a grip on, especially if he didn't want to aggravate it.  Eventually, they made it to the couch and after making the slowest of turns, they began the task of lowering him down.  Things went well until the weight and pain of Robbie's stomach made his legs give way and he ended up collapsing the final few inches down, dragging Malcolm with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  Robbie managed to mumble, sinking into the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"  Malcolm said, standing back up and readjusting his clothes.  Malcolm took a moment to appreciate his handiwork with a grin, before giving Robbie's gut a couple of gentle slaps and returning to the kitchen.  Robbie felt exhausted.  <i>Was it bed time already?</i>  In a way he hoped it was, otherwise when he woke up again he would be met by another loaded plate of food, more likely than not.  The sooner tomorrow got here, the better, he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow.  Yes, tomorrow he would... he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In many regards, he looked like Malcolm, having the same curly red hair and freckles but unlike Malcolm's slight build with pot belly, Taylor looked to have a good hundred pounds and half a foot on his cousin. His entire body was thick with muscle layered over with fat. A large portion of his fat was located in big gut attached like a ball to his torso. As if his build weren't lumberjack enough, he even had the clothes to complete the image. His plaid button down shirt was stretched taut over his entire torso. The sleeves were rolled halfway up his forearms. Suspenders held up a pair of heavy duty pants that were pushed down slightly by his belly. Yellow rain boots threw off the look some in color but not in style. The main aspect that threw the entire look off the entire look was the bright orange Gators baseball cap.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're Taylor?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course.

He pulled a folder out of his briefcase. \"Why is everyone like this? Just because I don't wear the big name brands everyone thinks I have no fashion sense, well let me tell you something Mr. Big-Shot-Cousin-To-The-Biggest-TV-Superhero-I-Only-Wear-Name-Brand-Clothes, I'm a tailor, not a fashion designer. Big difference. I may be able to make clothes from scratch, but they are based on designs created by others, not my own work. And sewing doesn't require a sense of fashion anyways. Anyone can learn it, but if you want to only have the best of the best, I can take my skills elsewhere and you can pay three times what you would have paid if I were charging full price instead of the half price as a favor to my cousin.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine, fine. I'm sorry. You're right. Your portfolio looks good and you are going out of your way to do this. The least I can do is say thank you and give you a chance.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.\" He pulled a tape measure out of his sewing basket. \"Now strip to your underwear and get up on the ottoman so I can measure you to adjust your clothes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie did as he was told, having to resist shivering in his boxers because of the A/C cooled room. His speech turned out not to be an understatement as he expertly measured Robbie's arms, thighs, waist, and everything else one could think of needed for clothes adjustment or creation. Taylor didn't say much as he was snacking on bugles the entire time except when telling Robbie to change positions.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. All done with your measurements. Give me a few hours and I'll at least have at least a couple pairs of pants and some shirts done for you. Adjusting everything will take a few days though. I'll come back with Malcolm until done. Payment at end of the day please. I take MasterCard, Visa, and cash. Now, I think Malcolm's surprise is ready by now. He'll have something special every day I'm working on your clothes. Finish it by the time we leave and I'll reduce the price in half again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, okay. And just why would you want me to eat whatever it is Malcolm has for me? Wouldn't that just mean you'd have to take more measurements?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Part of the favor to Malcolm. And I'll add a little extra space for you to grow into. No extra charge. Same deal later if you need it. And from what Malcolm's said about your appetite, then I'll be back. Now, get down there and eat up. Real men indulge their appetites and I need to get to work.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor pushed Robbie out, shoving his clothes into his arms and slamming the door behind him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Throwing his clothes back on, he headed down to see what Malcolm had planned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Taylor already working his magic, I take it?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Now what's this about an extra deal with me finishing all of some surprise? I never agreed to that you know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but I thought you'd enjoy this. Homemade ice cream!\" He pulled out a gallon of pink ice cream. \"Finish this and these,\" he opened the oven where a tray of cannolis was within minutes of finishing, \"and he'll give you that discount. Daily deal, so if you don't finish it, you can still get it the next day. I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grabbed an ice cream scoop. \"Hope you don't mind if I at least give a little to Robert.\" Getting a couple scoops into a small bowl, he placed it on the high chair's tray in front of Robert with a plastic spoon. Banging his spoon and giggling, he used his fingers to scrape out little bits of the ice cream as it melted. Robbie alternated between watch his son make a mess and taking notes of how he handled the filling and icing on them between bites of the ice cream, chunks of strawberry and raspberry in it. He couldn't go to fast or else he'd get end up with a brain freeze but going slowly was allowing him to fill up too quickly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is there any way to lessen the ice cream part of the deal to half? There's no way I'd be able to eat even half of this without making myself sick from overeating or brain freeze or taking to long to let it melt.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm tapped his whisk against the mixing bowl. \"I'll talk with Taylor. He likes to not see food go to waste, but he also doesn't like seeing people get hurt. I'm sure we can come to some modified agreement. Just do the best you can and aim to finish all the cannolis.\" Malcolm poured the chocolate sauce over the tray. Once done, he placed it front of Robbie, pushing the ice cream to the side. \"Now, finish these and I'll go chat with Taylor. As for giving some to Robert, he's a sucker for kids so that he likely won't mind.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He headed upstairs as Robbie took his first bite of the still warm pastries. The dark chocolate sauce blended with the lightly sweetened vanilla whipped cream filling in a symphony of heaven and Earth colliding. He was licking the last of the chocolate sauce off his fingers when Malcolm came back down. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice. You at least finished those. 18 cannolis. Pretty good. As for the ice cream\"...</span></div></div>",

Scooping the ice cream into several tupper ware containers, he placed them on the stove top to heat up. With a quarter of the ice cream still in the bucket, he split it between a container to zap and leaving the rest in for him to eat while everything was melted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, one thing I'm not getting,\" Robbie said between cleaning the spoon and carton, \"is why you want me to eat all this on top of the stuff we're already doing each day?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about? The ice cream was Taylor's idea.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He said it was yours.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Figures. And I'm betting he gave you the whole \"don't judge me on my fashion because my job is to fix other's fashions\"? He never takes credit for his own ideas. He's actually really good at designing clothes, he just doesn't like to chow them off.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then why would he want me eating more? We've never even met before.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He told you \"real men indulge their appetites\" or something like that? He wasn't joking. He fully means that. If food is involved and you can walk away from the table after the meal, he gets to be a jerk. Only a big appetite impresses him. Either way, he's still offering a good deal that well seems worth it to me. One that you've already been working on anyways.\" Malcolm chuckled. He started pulling supplies out of the fridge for the Mexican lasagna.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I know I have been. Not that I don't enjoy this, but I really should start cutting back. I found a new stretch mark this morning.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That makes what, 15? If the first dozen didn't bother you that much, why would this one?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie raised his arm, pushing his sleeve up as much as he could. In his armpit was a bright red, inch long stretch mark.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah. First one not around the waist. Got it. I'll bring some cocoa butter tomorrow to soften your skin.\" He handed one of the now melted tupper wares to Robbie. \"Now drink up. I need the space for the lasagna and you have an additional discount to win!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm noticed Robbie's gut starting to bloat by the third container. This wasn't new but he still had half the ice cream to drink. \"You still taking those muscle relaxants?\" He asked as Robbie started to rub his gut through his shirt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No. I didn't want to get addicted. Besides, they weren't working that well. It just became harder to stay awake after eating but didn't help with the pain in my gut.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm blew out a hard breath. \"Um, I may know of something that could help you win the extra discount each day, but it's a little more extreme than the muscle relaxants.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie licked the strawberry cream from his lips. \"More extreme?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Um, appetite stimulants. With those, you'd be a lot hungrier, so if not careful, they can be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll say! I keep talking of cutting back and you suggest taking appetite stimulants? What else you got?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Belly rubs or calling the whole deal off. Taylor would still give the original 50% off but it might not apply if you need your clothes adjusted again. I can understand if you didn't want to partake in the extra discount. It isn't what we agreed to when you started indulging yourself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No kidding. But I think I'm getting close to the point of no return anyways.

His own gut stuffed to close to painful and wanting to lay down himself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go get comfy on the couch. I'll bring the ice cream out once I'm done with the lasagna.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie placed Robert in his play pin. The toddler was out before the blanket was even draped over him. Robbie laid down on the couch himself, rubbing his stomach to make room for the incoming ice cream. He zoned out as the TV buzzed in the background. He didn't even notice Malcolm come in with the remaining containers of ice cream.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We need to hurry. The lasagna will be done in an hour and a half and then Taylor and I have to go. This might get intense since you aren't quite used to this amount.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine. The pressures lessened some.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.\" He handed the first of the three containers to Robbie. Half the container was drained in five minutes bringing his bloat back to where it had been but he was already slowing. Malcolm took the opportunity to pull up Robbie's shirt and start rubbing it himself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie struggled through the next container too, his gut turning pink from the strain. Malcolm put the last container of ice cream to Robbie's lips. The liquid dripped into his mouth at an agonizing pace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on Robbie! Last bit!\" He glanced at the clock. \"Ten minutes until the lasagna needs to come out and twenty until Taylor will be done for today. If you don't finish by then, it's back to the half price for the modifications.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Full.\" Robbie groaned. \"No... more.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, come on now. Don't give up!\" He laid the container on the table and took to massaging Robbie's gut with both hands. Several burps were elicited from him. He did that for five minutes until the burps dies off. \"Good! That should have made some extra space. Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nearly choking on the ice cream, each gulp stretched his gut under Malcolm's watchful eye.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How's he doing?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm jumped, the ice cream flying from his hand and splashing the wall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Taylor! Don't do that! How do you do that? You're like 300 pounds! And in rubber boots! How do you slink around like that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quiet? Every board in this place squeaks like a rusty hinge. You were just distracted. Speaking of which, the timer's been going off for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Crap!\" Malcolm ran out of the room leaving Taylor and Robbie alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn boy! I didn't think you'd actually try for that extra discount! You really did a number on yourself!\" He glanced at the ice cream on the wall. \"I'm surprised you got through as much as you did. And sorry about the mess. You have any washcloths?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Third door... on the left. Just... past the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor bolted from the room, the house shaking under his heavy thuds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lasagna's out. The edges are a little overdone, but it should be fine. Where'd Taylor run...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor pushed past, shoving a couple washcloths into Malcolm's hand.  \"Let's get that stain cleaned before it dries.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm grumbled but didn't fight him as Taylor guided him to the stain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie zoned out, trying to ease the pain in his gut until Robert cried. He tried to get up but his gut didn't have any give. \"Um, I realize... this isn't in... the job description... but can... one of you check on... Robert? I... can't move.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor picked Robert up. \"Phew! Wow, does this kid know how to fill his diaper or what?\" Grabbing the diaper bag from the corner, he made his way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you he loves kids.\" Malcolm mumbled, scrubbing the last of the ice cream off the wall. The wall had discoloration where the ice cream had hit with slightly less from the scrubbing alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't take long for Taylor to come back soaking wet with a giggling Robert. \"This kid is a little troublemaker, you know that? I went to change his diaper and he peed on me so I had to spray myself down. I had to use all the towels in there to clean myself up. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No... problem. If you... want to babysit... just give me a call.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe sometimes. But that will cancel out the next day's extra discount regardless.\" He chuckled. \"Well, I'll leave little Robert here to play while you rest. We've got to head out since I have another client. We'll be back tomorrow. As for that deal, I was just wondering if you'd even attempt it, so for being a going along with it, I'll give that extra quarter off and if you can at least get as far as you did today, I'll give that day free of charge!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm rolled his eyes. \"And you thought I was sneaky when I first started pushing you. At least I didn't bribe you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you just drugged him.\" Taylor reminded him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With muscle relaxants! It's not like it I was dosing with him crack or marijuana!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatever. We need to go. We'll be back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor and Malcolm made their way out leaving Robbie dazed and on the edge of consciousness.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe we should get him a babysitter if this is going to happen?\" Malcolm asked as the door closed behind them.</span></div></div>",

He really wished he could just let himself go but then he'd never get any more work. Walking through downtown, he passed the normal clothes stores, restaurants, and tourist traps. Every once in a while, some girls would recognize him and he'd sign a couple autographs with a forced smile, he just wanted to relax. Heading towards the edge of downtown, everything got smaller, dimmer, and quieter. He shivered as the night chilled. Pulling his coat up around his shoulders a little more, a dim light caught his eye from a nearby alley.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Past a couple trash cans was a tiny store. The neon lights of the sign made up symbols he didn't recognize. The door was wide open but nothing could be seen from outside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come in my good sir. There is no point in standing out in the cold. Come in and have some tea.\" A croaky man's voice encouraged from inside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No way. Like I'm going to go into some unknown store in a back alley in a random part of town. No effin way!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sir need to lighten up. To relax. I can help with that. Whatever you need or want I can help provide, guaranteed to work or your money back. Just come in to look, that is all I ask. I'll leave the door open so you always know where the exit is.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why am I listening to this creepy old man? He'll probably knock me out or something the moment I walk in. I should just walk away.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are right and I will not stop you from leaving if you want. But what do you have to lose?\" The man walked out of the shadows of his shop. A knotted cane was braced by a withered hand. Hairy warts covered his nose and chin. His back was hunched to the point of protruding above the bun that was his remaining hair. He didn't even come up to Tyler's elbow. \"I could not hurt you even if I tried. Just come inside and I can fulfill your desires to finally be able to relax and let go.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know a great many things. Come.\" He waved Tyler to follow him and headed back into his shop. Hesitating, Tyler followed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside, the store was as tiny as the outside looked. Only two shelves and a small table occupied the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You may select any one artifact. They will all grant your wish in a different way. And there is tea here which will also help to relax you. My store is open for another hour so take your time deciding.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler looked at the shelves. If he didn't know any better, he'd think this guy was pulling his leg.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On one of the shelves was an ornate lamp and a rock. The plaque said the lamp contained a djinn of gluttony and the rock was enchanted to fortify your desires and make them impossible to deny or ignore. The other shelf had a vial of liquid that would make you gain a small amount daily, making you less inclined for physical activity the longer it was in effect, and small doll that looked like him which said that if modified, would gradually alter the owner's build to match.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was no way they were real but there was an aura around each one that told him not to take them lightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do not forget there is tea here for you too if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks.

It doesn't seem that harmful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The rock of desire. A good choice. The longer you use it, the stronger it grows, but if you find the changes undesirable, the rock will adjust to those desires to match.'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man hobbled over to a cash register. He wound a crank on the side to open it up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That will be $62 please.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously? It's just a rock. I could get one off the ground anywhere!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not just any rock can grant you your desires. There are people who would pay far more than this then I am offering it to you for.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then why are you offering it to me for such a \"low price\"?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You need it more than you do. This shop doesn't appear to just anyone. No. You have to truly be unhappy with your life for it appear.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bullshit. I may not have a perfect life, but why would I be unhappy about it?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A good life doesn't mean a desired life. You are finally ready for the life you truly desire but just don't know how to get to that life or even what it would look like, so my store appeared with the items you need. You have made a wise decision to make the change slowly so you can adjust and can stop it safely when you have your life as you've wanted, even if it was a subconscious desire. Now, if you don't mind, it is almost closing time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler glanced at the rock still in his hand. $62 for a rock was definitely an outrageous price but he couldn't deny that he wasn't happy now. \"I'm guessing you don't have a refund policy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If by some chance the product does not live up to your expectations, tap it against a mirror. Just tap it. You don't want 7 years of bad luck for breaking the mirror after all. I will take it back at that point and you can either return to your old life, with refund, and all memories of this will disappear since you will never have been here, or you can exchange it for a different item from here, keeping the old changes and gaining new ones from the exchanged object, but I will only allow this once. After that, you are stuck with that object, so choose wisely as you'll only get one do over. Does that work for you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tap on a mirror?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sonny, you need to believe some. I've given you the return and exchange policy, so either you want to change or not. Which will it be?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler grumbled as he pulled out his wallet. He didn't know why he believed this man, but something about the man's claims felt true. He handed his credit card over to him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My apologies but we don't take plastic here. I'm sorry but I'm not that technologically inclined and I'm afraid I'd just get confused trying to learn now. You should have the cash in your wallet anyways.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't carry cash on... What the?\" His hand brushed several dollar bills as he put the card back in. Where there hadn't been any cash before, there was now three $20 bills and two ones. The exact amount needed which he handed to the old man.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you for your patronage Young Man. Please give the object a couple days to take full effect and at least a week to show any changes before you consider changing it out or returning it. Now, it is closing time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He ushered Tyler out of the store, shutting the door as he pushed him through it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's no need to man...han...dle...\" He turned to find he was standing in a plain alley with no signs of any door or shop anywhere. If the rock weren't still in his hand, he'd have thought he had dreamed the whole thing. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The old man said to give it a couple days to start working, might as well head home for the night.\" He slipped the rock into his pocket and headed back to where he parked his car. He was out the moment his head hit his pillow, still dressed in his clothes with only his jacket with the rock in its pocket thrown to the side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning, everything felt like a dream, the shop and rock faded from his mind, but already he had a growing craving to just...</span></div></div>",

Mr. Evans is already here Miss Johansson called to apologize but she can't make it.\" The attendant greeted, heading back to where Chris could already be seen towards the bar. Not many people were in the restaurant that night. A few groups were scattered around but Evans was mostly interested in a couple of girls at the bar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Glad you found us.\" Evans grinned as Hemsworth pulled out one of the bar stools and ordering a Coors. \"These two lovely ladies were just telling me how much they enjoy our movies.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The girls giggled but their smiles seemed off, almost as if they were painted on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of the girls came over, taking a sip of Hemsworth's drink before handing it to him for the bartender. He glanced over at Evans who shrugged, continuing on his own drink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where's everyone else? I was told Scarlett couldn't make it when I got here.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, most of them texted me earlier that they couldn't make it either leaving just you and me.

He waved the bartender over, placing an order for the biggest steak they had. Evans ordered the same. Even before their orders arrived they could both tell something was wrong and the steaks wouldn't be enough. Fighting off the urge to get more, they both left, barely having spoken since their food arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning...</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hemsworth awoke with a groan as light streamed in through his bedroom window and his eyes fought to open. Moving his head slowly to the side he gave a petulant grunt as the light hit his face and he instinctively turned away from it, pushing himself up and raising an arm as if it were enough to disintegrate the sun. Swinging his legs over the side of the bed, he rubbed his eyes with his fingers and frowned into his palms. He never forgot to close the blinds in his bedroom, but then yesterday was hardly a typical day. It was the wrap up day on his last film, or films, and he had spent the best part of half a year filming and countless hours before and during working on his physique. He had done some of his best work on those films and some of the suggestions he had pushed for had been adapted into his character, which made him proud - but then why was his mind pulled back to the events of last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly rising to his feet, Hemsworth ran a hand down his chin in thought as his eyes began to adjust to the light and he started to see more clearly. He was with the other Chris after everyone else bailed, they both ordered one of the biggest steaks on the menu and then they went home. Hemsworth grunted again, shaking his head as if to clear it or dislodge a memory. There was no way that that was right.  He vaguely remembered ordering the steak but he didn't really remember the menu or choosing it. It almost felt as though someone else had suggested it to him, there wasn't anyone else that they really spoke to and Evans had never recommended any food to him before and they barely even spoke that night. That was weird too. Going out had never been about the food before, it was always about letting off some steam and relaxing. They may never have been all that loud, but they never sat in near silence eating before but that's what he remembered. He wasn't even sure if the two had said goodbye to each other, he certainly didn't remember it and what time did they leave? It felt like it must have been late as he still felt so tired, yet if all they had was a steak they couldn't have been there for more than an hour. Plus, who paid? The two must have gotten into a tug of war over paying, not that he remembered that either but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was a receipt then it would have itemized everything that they bought and it would probably have the time that it was printed off on there too! Hemsworth strode over to the end table where his jeans had been slung and began to rifle through the pockets. As he searched for his wallet, he noticed that it had fallen onto the floor but his hand had already hit his keys as well as a piece of paper, so he lazily grabbed them and yanked them gracelessly out. He leaned over and placed the keys on the table before turning his attention to what turned out to be a napkin, rather than a piece of paper. He vaguely remembered the two girls and after unfolding the napkin found the phone number that he recalled one of them writing down. What he didn't remember was the small piece of card that fell out onto the floor. He squinted at it, but it was a little difficult to make out, so as lazy as he was feeling he was forced to bend down to pick it up. Squatting down felt like an effort and he felt so sluggish and heavy that he almost toppled forward, but he steadied himself and turned his attention to the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a gaudy gold and red color and it seemed to have some kind of characters or symbols on it, but he couldn't quite make out exactly what it said, if it it said anything legible at all and it hurt his eyes to try. The pressure in his thighs began to grow, so he pushed himself back up, feeling the effort of straightening up again even more keenly than lowering himself down. There was even something about himself that felt off, or was it his house? It wasn't so much that he felt like there were missing pieces to the puzzle, it was more like there were several puzzles on the go and he didn't know which pieces went with which vista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what were his options? Hemsworth looked down at the napkin and card in his hands. He didn't remember those girls being around after they put that napkin in his pocket, but then he didn't really remember the rest of the night so it was possible that he saw them again or that they might have some kind of insight about what was going on. He had no idea what the card meant, if the girls snuck it into his pocket wrapped in the napkin or if someone else gave it to him, but he could probably find out more about it online if he wanted to. Perhaps an image search or he could get someone to look into it for him. It could be totally mundane, but he felt weird looking at it, as if it held some kind of deeper meaning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically speaking, he could drop by to the restaurant and ask the staff or perhaps the host what was going on that night in a subtle, roundabout kind of way of course. If anyone knew exactly what was going on it should be the person who was serving their table that night, who was... he couldn't even remember anything about them.  But someone would be able to and they would be the most likely to have all the answers to the most pressing questions. The only other person who might know would be Evans. As he didn't remember Evans speak, maybe that meant that he had spent that time listening and observing? At the very least Evans might be able to confirm that he remembers just as little as he does, not that he was sure that the concept of that was more or less comforting. The only other option was to stay at home and to explore other avenues. Not that things felt normal there either, but perhaps the answer was staring him in the face. Or maybe he was the problem, not his home or the previous night. He still felt a bit off, like when a last minute script change came down and he had to deviate from what he had learned; it felt as if someone how edited the script of his life and done a pretty sloppy job of it, but he would find out what happened last night.  The only immediate question that he had the power to answer was, how?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hemsworth decided that the most obvious choice was to return to the restaurant and see if anyone there could shed any light on what happened last night.  The napkin with the girls number and that gaudy card seemed a bit insubstantial and more of a plan B and he didn't want to have to call Evans and worry him if he was just overreacting.  When a crime is committed, the police talk to any eyewitnesses first for a good reason, so it made sense for him to see if anyone knew or saw anything weird last night.  Hemsworth frowned as he walked toward his wardrobe, pushing gently on the door and watching it glide effortlessly open.  He was a bit worried that his mind went straight to the idea of the police and crime, hopefully it wasn't his subconscious trying to tell him something, or warning him, about what happened.  Hemsworth picked out a fresh pair of jeans that were identical to the ones that he wore the previous evening and a baby blue t-shirt and lay them on the bed.  It was much more likely that last night was just an anomaly, that all of the stress from his six months of hard work came out in a weird way but he had come to learn to trust his instincts and he had a sinking feeling.  He would be happy to be proved wrong, but if something did happen and he ended up appearing on the front page of some cheap tabloid on the shelves of a supermarket, he wanted to know if the far-fetched headline had even an ounce of truth about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a shower, Hemsworth got changed and scooped up his keys, wallet and the items from his 'evidence locker' - the napkin and red and gold card and began to head down the stairs.  He felt a lot less sluggish and more together after the shower and more positive about deciding to go back to the restaurant.  He vaguely remembered The Ranch taking lunch time bookings and as it was approaching midday, he was pretty confident that he could get there and potentially get some answers pretty smoothly.  As he neared the bottom of the stairs and felt himself move in his clothes, Hemsworth remembered that the jeans were identical to the ones that he wore last night in all ways but one; the waist was bigger.  His mind must have been all over the place as he would never choose to wear these jeans and although they weren't as close fitting as he liked and hung a little low on him, they weren't about to fall down, so he decided to roll with it.  Besides, where he was going it might be a good idea to have on a bigger pair of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemsworth froze as he was fishing out the keys from his pocket.  That was weird, <i>where did that thought come from?</i>  Why would he feel like it was a good idea to have on jeans with a bigger waist size to go and talk to someone?  Hemsworth grunted in determination and unlocked the door purposefully.  He was done trying to think his way through this, he needed more answers and less theories.  He made the short journey from his front door to his cadillac escalade, jumped into it and began to make his way across the city.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride across town was pretty quiet, the streets were clear and his journey there was pretty smooth which put him in a slightly better frame of mind.  It felt a little ridiculous to take such a big vehicle when it was just him, maybe he should have taken the time to take one of his smaller cars.  Then again, as much as it pained him to admit it, sometimes it made him feel in control and powerful to show off something so impressively big.  Today must be one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parking lot was quiet and there only seemed to be a couple of people about when he got to The Ranch.  He managed to park the escalade with very little fuss, although as Evans would no doubt have pointed out that was probably because there were no other cars around for him to have to try and park around.  It had taken him a while to get used to maneuvering something so large, but now he was almost completely used to it and kind of enjoyed the challenge.  As he hopped out of the car, he noticed a member of staff that he recognised from The Ranch dragging a comically oversized sign out onto the forecourt and strode in quickly and confidently to help him out.  As he approached the kid looked up with a start, before a big smile spread out across his face.  He had the kind of genuine, open smile that meant that PR training or not, Hemsworth found it impossible not to grin back warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Mr Hemsworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" he replied with a nod.  Hemsworth leant down and grabbed the other side of the sign and looked back over to the kid.  \"How about you lead and I follow?\"  The kid nodded and the two of them maneuvered it toward the edge of the kerb, before placing it down gently.  No wonder the kid had trouble with it, the sheer size and the weight of it meant that he would probably find it a challenge to move it, but only because it was so wide that it would be hard to centre the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  The kid said, still beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, err...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken, it's Ken,\" he offered up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm pretty lousy with names.\"  Hemsworth said, shifting his weight on the spot with the languid confidence of a cat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it must be difficult to remember talking with people in your line of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember talking with you.  It must have been a couple of months back, you asked me for some workout tips.  I pointed you to a website and Ruffalo pulled out that magazine which had my Thor workout plan in and gave it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right!\" Ken said in surprise.  \"He got a pen and signed it right over your face on the cover...\"  Hemsworth nodded and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks he's pretty funny.  How are the workouts going?  Looks like you're filling out that shirt some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think so?\"  Ken said, his smile becoming a little more awkward, as he puffed out his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!  I took a look at that website you pointed me to, found a workout partner here at the restaurant and the guys in the kitchen started to make some high protein food for me.  I hoped that maybe my work was paying off, but I didn't think it was that noticable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're always our own hardest critics and slowest to notice our progress.  Keep putting in the work and I'm sure that you'll be bigger than me in no time.\"  As the words came out of his mouth, Hemsworth realised he didn't like the idea of anyone getting bigger than him.  Maybe rather than cutting back on the workouts and relaxing now that shooting was done, he'd have to put more effort into getting bigger.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it so hard to believe that you didn't notice your progress.  I mean, you look so...\" Ken trailed off the sentence and his eyes turned down as he began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Hemsworth said quickly to try and spare the kid any more embarrassment.  Because Ken seemed like such an open book and so earnest, he felt geuinely flattered.  Perhaps because he wanted to change the subject, Ken was the one to advance the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can help you with today, Mr Hemsworth?  To be honest, now isn't a great time to get food as we're usually dead when we first open and the kitchen has only just started prepping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't after anything to eat, actually I needed some information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh OK, I'll do what I can to help.\"  Hemsworth found himself grinning again warmly at the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came down here last night for a meal and I needed to know something about it.\"  Hemsworth said carefully, trying to be as vague as possible as he went fishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that you were here yesterday with Mr Evans.\"  Hemsworth had to fight the urge to ask him exactly what else he had heard about last night.  Ken seemed like one of the good ones, but he had no desire to put the idea of a scandal into his head.  \"What did you need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something weird happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it was nothing to do with the food.\"  Ken said.  \"Or the staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, well, I mean, it's a little bit delicate.\"  Hemsworth realised that he was dancing along the line of sounding guilty and that Ken knew nothing.  \"I don't suppose there is anyone working now that was here last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, would you like to come inside and I'll see if I can come up with a solution for you.\"  Ken already started to take quick, determined steps back into The Ranch, leaving Hemsworth to follow his lead once more with his long, effortless strides.  Ken lead him to the bar and turned back to face him.  \"If you'd like to wait here, I think I have a couple of ideas on how to get the information that you need.  I shouldn't be too long.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Ken began to scurry off but suddenly turned without missing a beat and started to walk backward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you a drink while you wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine.  Thanks.\"  Ken twisted around again and jogged slowly through the saloon doors to the back of house area, leaving Hemsworth alone with his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bright sunlight pouring in through the broad glass front and the deserted floor with many chairs still stacked off to the side, the place felt a lot different from what he remembered of the previous night but he still felt a sense of ill ease.  He really hoped that Ken or someone here could help to fill in the blanks.  He hadn't been drinking that much and he clearly hadn't had a blackout, but even if there was a medical reason for forgetting part of the night that wouldn't explain Evans' unusual behaviour. As time began to pass, his thoughts bounced around from the previous evening, to the last few scenes that he had been filming and the pressure and experiences of the last six months.  All the while it felt like something was moving around underneath, hard to see or hold onto but ready to break the surface at any moment and although he didn't know what that entailed, the thought scared Hemsworth.  He was suddenly jolted out of his thoughts by the sound of footsteps walking toward him from somewhere to the side and he turned to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hemsworth turned and saw a lithe man in a tailored suit slowly walk up to him.  He looked vaguely familiar and he was fairly sure that he had seen him before, but had they not been in The Ranch then he wouldn't have placed him there.  He had a poised, controlled way of walking and there seemed to be an air of stillness about him.  As he got closer, Hemsworth could feel his worries start to slowly slip away, or at least somehow become more muted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr Hemsworth.  Ken thought that I may be able to be of some assistance to you?\"  The man offered his hand and the moment that Hemsworth took it, he felt instantly much more at ease.  His handshake was warm and firm and he just <i>knew</i> that this was the man to talk to help clear things up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, although to be honest I feel a little foolish now.\"  The man slowly took his hand from Hemsworth's and it felt like strands of toffee being being pulled slowly and stickily apart.  It felt warm, sweet and inviting and he missed it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\"  The man said waving his hand as if to dismiss his concerns.  \"Ken said that you seemed worried about events last night and if there's anything I can do to help, it would be my pleasure.\"  Hemsworth couldn't help but notice how rich and dark his brown eyes were, the colour of a decadent chcolate mousse that he could just sink into.  He could feel his stomach gurgle and his hand instinctively went to his midirff to give it a light rub.  A moment passed before he realised that he should probably say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, yes.  Well to be honest, I'm having trouble remembering exactly what happened.  I have a large blank spot where a lot of the night should be.\"  The man cocked his head to the side and stared deeply into Hemsworth's eyes.  His instinct was to tear his gaze away, but he fought to maintain eye contact.  The man smiled thinly before dropping his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why that may be worrying, but you may be better served by seeing a medical professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you're probably right, but I want to know if anything potentially embarrassing happened.  If I did something that could damage my reputation and it got out...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I see your dilemma.\"  The man said nodding.  \"You may not have the luxury of time to piece together what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"  Hemsworth said, glad that he didn't have to go into too much detail and that he was right to place his trust in this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should continue this discussion in my office.\"  Hemsworth suddenly felt a knot in his gut.  Why did they have to leave a public space to discuss what happened?  <i>What had he done</i>?  He felt a hand clamp down on his shoulder and the man motioned for him to walk through the saloon doors and he found himself nodding and walking slowly forward.  There was a long corridor filled with clutter and the sounds that came from the side seemed to indicate that the kitchen was there, but the hand remained on his shoulder, guiding his every step forward.  When he got to the door at the end of the corridor he opened it to find an immaculately put together office.  Not everything had the look of being new, but it was methodically organised and sorted.  The man moved around him and took a seat at the desk, before leaning back and looking up at Hemsworth, bringing the fingers of his hands together to make a steeple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... something bad happen?\"  Hemsworth asked, rubbing his hands together nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not at all.  I didn't mean to give you that impression.\"  The man at the desk said, smiling gently.  \"I merely wished to respect your privacy, since we can't be too careful about who may be listening in.\"  Hemsworth felt instantly relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  The man leaned forward and rested his elbows on the desk, glancing straight up at Hemsworth and looking into his eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't spend the entire night talking with you and Mr Evans but at a certain point the restaurant quietend down and we had no new bookings so I spent a fair amount of time with the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"  Hemsworth interjected impatiently.  The man smiled thinly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very little of any consequence.  Much of the time I spent at your table involved just you talking to me, or more accurately talking <i>at</i> me,\" he said, causing Hemsworth to look away and blush.  \"You were very excited about finishing up your new movie, looking forward to the future and talking about possible projects that you were considering.  Come to think of it,\" the man continued, drumming his fingers on the desk, \"one of the few times that Mr Evans spoke was to point out that you were behaving a little erratically, I think he used the word 'manic'.  Perhaps that may have something to do with your memory loss?  Either way, he seemed very worried about you.\"  Hemsworth winced and began to slowly remember parts of the exchange.  He hadn't wanted to call Evans as he didn't want to worry him; turns out, he was probably the first person he should have called.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that it?  Was that all that happened?\"  The man leant back in the chair and nodded gently, relaxing into the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that happened of any note.  Mr Evans wanted you to get a cab home, but you seemed to dismiss the idea out of hand. I think he found it a bit difficult to handle you, so he eventually decided to step back and intervene only when it was necessary.  Then the two of you left and that was it.\"  Looks like he owed Evans a thank you and an apology.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you so much for filling in the blanks.\"  Hemsworth said, feeling the weight of his worry beginning to lift.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all.  I was glad to help.\"  The man said, smiling warmly.  Hemsworth turned to leave and reached toward the door knob to let himself out.  \"Congratulations on your new movie role by the way.\"  Hemsworth stopped in his tracks and turned back to face the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My new movie role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you receieved a call during dinner.  Well I say new movie role, really it's just a continuation of your last.\"  Seeing the confused look on Hemsworth's face, the man continued.  \"You don't remember?  I assumed that you would remember such a big event, or you would have had some kind of confirmation by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?  What was the role?\"  Hemsworth asked, with a mix of excitement and dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only know what I heard and what you told me, I don't know if I am the right person to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\"  Hemsworth begged.  \"I can't call the studio and ask what it was that I've already agreed to do.  Besides, I started to remember things after you told me about them.  I'm sure if you start telling me, I'll fill in the blanks.\"  The man took a moment, tapping his index finger against his lips.  For Hemsworth, it felt like an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"  He finally said.  \"The same studio that made your last film called and offered you another Thor film.\"  Hemsworth felt his heart sink at the news.  He wasn't all that keen to go back to the Marvel universe, at least not quite yet.  He needed a new challenge and a new character to get his teeth into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem all that interested at first last night either, but you managed to get some fairly major concessions from the studio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find out what they were?\"  The man nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were rather vocal on the phone and in explaining yourself afterward.  You managed to negotiate a large salary increase, mainly to reflect your exercise and nutrition needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...\"  That sounded a little strange, but more money was more money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One bone of contention was a prosthesis that you used in your last movie.  You didn't want to have to use it again in the new one but the studio seemed keen for you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I could do without Lebowski Thor this time around.  Did I talk them round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did indeed.\"  Hemsworth felt relieved again.  He didn't want to retread over old ground.  \"You convinced them that you would gain all the weight yourself.\"  Hemsworth's mouth fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did what?\"  The man put his hands up and raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Evans seemed surprised that they agreed as well.  You did sound very passionate and you certainly convinced me.\"  The man said with a smile.  \"You also said that the only way that you would agree to it is if you were to gain substantially more weight than your prosthesis suggested in the last movie.\"  Hemsworth's eyes widened even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that?\"  The man nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want to do the same thing over again.  You threw some numbers around that I didn't quite catch, but you did spend a particularly animated period indicating the size of the stomach you wanted.\"  The man pushed himself back from the desk and drew his hand up to just below his chest.    He drew it outward and curved it down so that his 'belly' rounded out just before his knees before sharply moving it back to just above his crotch.  Hemsworth was starting to remember, but he had no idea why he would push for that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you sold it as a case study on size and masculinity, the contrast of the big and the vulnerable.  It would also show that big men are multi-faceted and you would try and gain as much muscle to emphasise that too.\"  Yes of course, it was a big commitment but it was so right and just the sort of challenge he needed.  To truly understand what it meant to be fat he had to <i>become</i> fat.  \"You seemed to think the idea of a handsome, muscular, famous, lithe man becoming very large would be a revelation to the audience too.  I believe the word you used was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revolutionary...\"  Hemsworth finished absent-mindedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  The man said clicking his fingers.  Of course it was!  This wasn't about Chris Hemsworth or Thor getting hugely fat, it was about art!  This could change the way that people looked at the cinema!  \"The offer I made last night still stands today.  The Ranch's kitchen is always open to you to realise your full potential.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Markiplier lifted gomself up from the sofa and began to dig in his cabinet in the kitchen for anything to eat. He grabbed some potato chips and happily dug into them. Though he quickly ate all of them. Mark thought that there wasn't many chips to begin with so he then pulled out some snack pretzels. And this process would continue till finally Markpilier felt full and content. Mark rubbing his belly to signify he was full. \"Much better\" Mark said to himself. But then he looked around him and saw that he was surrounded by bags and jars of snack food, he was slightly embraced by how much he ate.
