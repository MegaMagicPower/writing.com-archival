He'd been looking forward to this for months and now with his latest film done, it was time to work on his family some. Sure Little Robert was only a year old, but that's the most important time to bond with your kid, right?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia was off doing one of her own shows and wasn't supposed to be back for several more weeks, maybe even months. The perfect opportunity to practice his newly acquired cooking skill to surprise her with when she got back. In the meantime, he always got a little carried away on his practice dishes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not used to cooking for himself, he hadn't learned portion control yet and it was already starting to show. In only a couple months that Italia had been away, his abs had become smooth. Sure, he was still rather toned and had a slim waist, he wasn't about to take his shirt off in public until he started working with a trainer again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His cook wasn't helping much. Since he was usually practicing on his own, Malcolm, his cook, would still come in and make him meals despite him stating he had to much food as it was and the cook would only take home what he made and nothing else, leaving Robbie with more food than he could eat alone. A problem since he had been taught to never let food go to waste.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The one thing he did admit he'd miss when he did get a trainer again and cut back on cooking so much was how relaxed he felt with his full stomach. He never got to the point of stuffing himself, he tried that once when he first started cooking and it nearly made him sick. At least being relaxed made it easy to play with his son.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert was currently asleep in his crib at the moment giving Robbie time to just relax with a game or movie. With the leftovers from breakfast still in his fridge, Malcolm had cooked his a large plate of chicken Parmesan and bow tie pasta with a side of seasoned mixed veggies. As much as he hated that Malcolm wouldn't stop cooking, even though he'd been threatened to be fired if he didn't help Robbie learn better portion control, they both knew it was an empty threat. Italia and Robbie had hired him because of his end cooking skills, fit for a five star restaurant, and his not wanting a large pay. Now he wished that Malcolm would apply elsewhere just so he'd have an excuse to fire him despite his delectable food and without making him feel guilty.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One thing he did find suspicious about Malcolm was even though he was only cooking for Robbie at the moment, he was still cooking as if Italia was still here and was taking home less than half the extras. If he didn't know any better, he'd have thought Malcolm was trying to fatten him up. But that would be ridiculous. They'd hired him over a year ago and had never had a problem before with anything like this. Why would he start now?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie absentmindedly pondered Malcolm's strange habits as he rubbed his full gut, the TV going in the background. It wasn't until he heard Robert crying through the baby monitor that he came to his senses and noticed the smell of baking peaches. Malcolm must have made a pie for dessert tonight. Something else the cook had been doing as of late. Though only once a week and it was normally gone within a two or three days. Shrugging it off, he went into the nursery to check on his son. He'd been fed before his nap, so he shouldn't be hungry for another hour or so. It didn't take but a second for him to realize the problem as he picked up the boy and almost lost the diaper! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, boy!\" He gagged as the smell assaulted his nose. \"Time's like these, I wish we had gotten a nanny!\" Taking a deep breath, he set out on changing the diaper. It took him two near pass outs to successfully change it, but he managed it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert now cleaned and changed, the two headed downstairs where Malcolm could be heard removing the pie from the oven.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know you don't need to make dessert. Or so much at meals. I'm trying to cook myself.\" Robbie reminded him for the millionth time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. Just want to make sure you get your fill.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've been getting more than my fill. I should actually start cutting back some. My abs aren't visible unless I'm flexing them anymore.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're fine, Mr. Amell. If I had your body, even without the abs, I'd have no problem getting a girl.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can set you up if you'd like. There's lots of girls around the studios who would love a guy with your personality and skills.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And dump me for the first guy 50 pounds lighter than me that catches her eye. It's happened before. Sorry, sir, but I think I'll look on my own.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. If you want. But not all the girls are like that.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm didn't respond as he started chopping up carrots, potatoes and other veggies to go in a large pot pie for dinner.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie eyed the dish he was using suspiciously. \"Malcolm, we have smaller pans. That's going to be way to large for two people.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. But better safe than sorry. I was meaning to let you know that I won't be able to come in tomorrow. My mother called and is making a surprise visit. Her and dad got into another fight.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry to hear that. That makes what, the third time she's done this since you started working for us?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. But at least she gets to relax some.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you can bring her by to use the pool if she wants. I don't mind, as long as she wears a properly fitting swimsuit.\" He shuddered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry about that. She didn't realize how much weight she'd lost since the last time she'd worn it. But I'll let her know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anyway, can I help? I can always use more practice on dishes other than breakfast.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure. Go put Robert down and grab a rolling pin. You can work on the dough for the crust while I finish the veggies.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie did as instructed and was soon working on the crust.</span></div></div>",

I'll take the old one home if you don't want it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had to think it over for a moment. The extra food wasn't needed but the practice was. And as appetizing as the pie smelled, peach was not his favorite. Maybe if there was the stuff for a pumpkin pie...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's see what there is for other pies.\" Malcolm interrupted his thoughts. Searching around in some grocery bags and the fridge, cartons of strawberries, a bag of apples, cream cheese, eggs, some pecans, and various other ingredients. \"See any that catch your fancy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How about a blueberry pie?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure thing. You like blueberries?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Since I was a kid. I can easily go overboard with them and make myself sick if I'm not careful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No problem. You need directions?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah wouldn't hurt. You give the directions and I'll make the pie.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the next hour, Malcolm directed Robbie on making the pie, mixing the right amount of sugar with the blueberries, cutting the strips of dough for the top crust, putting it all together properly before it went into the oven with the pot pie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the food now baking, Robbie went out to play with Robert. The two played with some balls, rolling them back and forth, banged on a toy xylophone, placing blocks into proper holes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Want a snack?\" Malcolm asked. Without waiting for an answer, he placed a veggie tray on the coffee table with a large bowl of ranch dip in the middle already.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Malcolm, dinner's in like an hour. I could have waited.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dinner may be, but a little snack never hurts. I thought you could also use a little reward. Your pie turned out great and is out on the counter, cooling.\" He grabbed a broccoli floret and dipped it in the ranch before handing it to Robbie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Begrudgingly, he took the broccoli. At least it was slightly healthy, once you go past the ranch anyways. Going back to playing with Robert, he started  munching on the veggies without really thinking about it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pot pie's ready! I've already gotten your plate ready Mr. Amell. And I have some freshly made applesauce for Robert.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Malcolm. You can leave now. Feel free to take some of that pot pit. It's to large for me to eat by myself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I already got some.\" He held up a Tupperware container with a portion of the pie in it. It didn't look like much to Robbie, but at least he wouldn't have to eat it ALL himself. \"And I made a couple other baby foods for Robert for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. I hope everything goes okay with your mom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It will. Don't forget to practice your cooking while I'm gone for a couple days. I'll expect a complete list of everything you cooked when I get back, understood?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Since when did you become my cooking coach? That's what I'm taking classes for.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Since today. When I was coaching you in making the pies.\" Malcolm laughed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grinned at the man. \"Okay, okay. I'll keep you a list. But don't think I'm paying as my coach too.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fair enough. Well, I better be heading out. Mom will be in tonight at 9 tonight. See you in a couple days Mr. Amell.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Enjoy your time off.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With Malcolm gone, Robbie placed his son in the high chair. Although Robert had not yet learned to walk, he had managed to start feeding himself, albeit with lots of flying food when he was in a playful mood. He chuckled as he ate the chicken pot pie, watching Robert laugh as he alternated between eating and wearing his food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie scooped some of the pot pie onto a plate just as a spoonful of applesauce hit him in the shoulder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"None of that now!\" He scolded as Robert laughed. Not really paying attention, he ended up putting a second scoop of the pie onto his plate before putting it down to dodge another spoonful of applesauce. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, your dinner time is over!\" Robbie chuckled as he dodged a third spoonful. Removing the bowl, he grabbed Robert in one arm and his food in the other, heading out to the living room so he could watch Robert play while he ate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Normally, he wouldn't dream of eating in the living room. Italia was very particular about keeping the high thread count furniture and carpet clean. What she didn't know wouldn't hurt her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie absentmindedly ate the double helping of pot pie while Robert banged at his xylophone with the pyramid block. He didn't notice how much he'd eaten until he brought his fork up to his mouth and found it clean. Oddly, he didn't feel as full as he thought he would, but that sometimes happened with Malcolm's cooking. Not often enough to make him worry until Italia left for her latest film, but it was known to happen. Not full yet, he pulled over the veggie tray that was still on the table and started munching on that, leaving the celery which he had never been a big fan of.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert yawned as the clock chimed 8, snapping Robbie out of his stupor. \"Looks like it's bedtime,\" he muttered before groaning as he went to lean forward towards his son, meeting a little resistance from his front. Looking over at the veggie tray, almost everything was eaten and the ranch dip had been scraped from the bowl. Gingerly, he reached down to pick up the toddler. He could actually see a slight bulge through his shirt as he stood up, feeling like the weight of the food was pulling his stomach further down. It was uncomfortable, but like when you stretch, painful, but in the good way.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading upstairs, he placed Robert in the crib in his bedroom so he could also take a nap himself. As he drifted off, his hand soothingly moved around his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was early morning and Robbie was just waking up. Italia wasn't anywhere to be seen but he could smell breakfast cooking. The smells stimulated a primal urge in him, one he reveled in most of the time anymore. It took him several minutes anymore to sit up as his rather large ball gut covered most of his lap before he could even sit up straight. He had to combine that movement with swinging his legs over the edge of the bed in order to not end up pinned down again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Huffing for breath, sweat already starting to bead on his forehead, he finally managed to stand up. Not for the first time, he was glad Italia still forced him to go to the gym or else he'd already be bed ridden by now. As it was, he was still by far more flab than muscle. This had ended his acting career some time ago, but he was happier than ever, spending time with his son, and he wouldn't have it any other way. He just needed the construction company to hurry up and widen the doors or he'd be getting stuck in them pretty soon. His gut was already rubbing up against the frame when he went through.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Breakfast Robbie! Bring Robert with you please!\" Italia yelled from downstairs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every step he took caused the windows to rattle. All the pictures had been removed from the walls almost 200 pounds ago when they started falling off as he walked through the house. In order to pick up Robbie from the crib, he had to turn sideways because he couldn't reach around his gut from straight on. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert in his arms, he headed downstairs where Malcolm and Italia had spent the morning making him a mountain of food. The bacon and eggs alone would have fed four grown men, but he'd have that as starters before moving onto the quiche, cinnamon rolls, crepes, and other foods. He was just about to eat his first bite when Robert started crying. Looking over, Robert sat in his high chair, playing with his pancakes, crying for some strange reason. His crying got louder and louder but Italia and Malcolm didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie awoke with a start. Robert was crying his crib. Outside the windows, the sky had darkened. He didn't need the lights on to know why his son was crying though. Despite the foul smell, his stomach growled. He'd already eaten a lot tonight, but a little more couldn't hurt, could it? He could lose it later. His dream was on the edge of his conscious, enticing him. He shouldn't want that, but it felt so real, so good.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, as he changed Robert's diaper, he knew what he was going to do.</span></div></div>",

I've got this.\" Malcolm told him without his asking.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Malcolm.\" Robbie headed out to check on his son. Robert was on the floor, crying, with a small glass on the floor nearby. \"Ohhhh! Come here Little Guy!\" Picking him up, he gently bounced him, kissing the slight red spot that had appeared on his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything alright?\" Malcolm yelled from the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I left a cup out here and he knocked it over on himself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Poor guy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie soothed Robert until the infant fell asleep. Still holding him, he headed back into the kitchen where Malcolm had already placed the diced chicken and veggies into the pot pie and was just finishing up the gravy that was going in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh. I didn't hear you come in. Just adding the gravy and the crust then it's going in the oven. Hope you don't mind, but I used an old family recipe for the gravy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not a problem as long as it tastes good.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You think I got this by not having good recipes?\" Malcolm bounced his belly a little. \"But the gravy won't contribute to that any. You're going to have to pull it out of the oven. I need to get going or else my mom is going to be at the airport, panicking because I'm not there yet.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. Hope everything goes okay with your mom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Mr. Amell. Enjoy the pies. I hope Roberts okay.\" With that, he left, leaving Robbie and his son alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Settling down in the living room, he turned the TV on low volume so Robert wouldn't be disturbed. He wasn't paying much attention to the show that was on until the timer went off. As carefully as if he were getting on thin ice, Robbie laid his son on the blanket on the floor well away from the table or anything else that might fall on him and headed in to grab the pot pie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm had outdone himself as the pie smelled delicious. Scooping out a large slice, he went back out to the living room. Robert was just stirring again as he made himself comfy. Robert sat up, rubbing his eyes, as Robbie took his first bite, immediately wishing he had waited a couple minutes to let it cool down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grabbing his cup, he filled it with tea to cool his singed tongue off before taking another bite.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert glanced around, looking for something, before toddling over to a ball that he started rolling and chasing around.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie watched as he ate his helping of pot pie. The pie was delicious and he could feel it filling his stomach but it wasn't very filling. Despite his thoughts from earlier that he should try losing his budding gut, he found his plate loaded again.</span></div></div>",

He knew he should stop eating, but the pie was just to good, he wasn't full yet, and he wasn't sure he even cared. These past few weeks off had been glorious and it's not like he needed the money, even if Italia also quit, they'd still be set for life or at least decades.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While trying to decide, he scraped a third serving of the pot pie onto the plate. He could feel how full he was now and his stomach was protesting but only slightly. Not enough to convince him not to continue eating. Just looking down, he imagined each bite stretching his stomach just a little more.The thought intrigued him for some reason.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he fought to stop.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He knew Italia would never tolerate him getting fat. Divorce would likely be in his future if he kept this up. It would kill him if he couldn't have Robert in his life every day. Maybe he could convince her to let him eat more and gain some weight if he did continue at the gym. Go for a power lifter build. She may not have tolerated fat guys but she never seemed to mind guys with muscles, even if they were under a layer of flab. That was a possibility. Or maybe she didn't mind fat guys as much as he thought? Well, the best option would be to start working out again while not restricting his diet anymore while she was still gone so the change would be a surprise to her but would show his commitment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His fork scraped against his plate, shocking him out of his thoughts. He hadn't even noticed he had started eating again. It would probably be best if he saved the rest for later. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Groaning, he pushed himself out of the chair and grabbed the empty pot pit pan. Wait, empty?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That's why his stomach hurt so badly! Without meaning to, he'd eaten the entire thing! In three servings! When there was six servings total!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carefully, he waddled over to the dish washer to put the dirty dishes in but he couldn't bend over without risking throwing everything up and it wouldn't be as good the second time around. Instead, he placed the dishes on the counter and made his way out to the living room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before lowering himself down onto the couch, he checked on Robert who had fallen asleep himself on his blanket next to the recliner. Lowering himself down, he was out himself the moment his head hit the throw pillows.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't due back for another day which meant that he'd need a babysitter as tonight was next cooking class.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading into the building, he took up his usual place half way back on the left side next to Angelina. He'd tried talking to her, but as far as he could tell, the black haired woman was anti-social to the point of only talking when she needed something. Not that he minded that but it would have been nice to get to know his cooking partner at least a little.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the last person came in, the instructor, a tiny man who looked like Einstein greeted everyone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good evening everyone. Please take out your provided recipe cards. Tonight, we will be making fettuccine  Alfredo and cheesecake. We'll start with the cheesecake since it has to bake for a bit then move on to the Alfredo sauce.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The instructor guided everyone through an independent showing and then had them all do it themselves, occasionally showing someone where they were going wrong. It wasn't to unusual for Robbie not to need any help, he was rather surprised how adept he turned out to be at cooking, and tonight was no different. Only thing was that these classes always ended up with him having extra food to take home and tonight's was even richer than usual. The exact opposite of what he was wanting right now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an hour, everyone's dishes were done. The instructor came around and sampled everyone's dishes, releasing the people who had successfully made the required dishes and helping those that had failed to fix where they went wrong.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie was given the green light right away and packed up everything he had made. Getting home didn't take long as there wasn't much traffic that late at night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once the baby sitter was gone, he checked on Robert, asleep in his crib, he sat down at the table to eat his leftovers. He avoided rich foods like these normally due to needing to keep in shape for his career, but the first bite told him he should put the fork down immediately if he wanted to keep his figure. Instead, he savored each bite. Savoring it until every last noodle was slurped up and every last crumb of crust was licked off his fingers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moaning, he leaned back, rubbing his bloated stomach once again. He didn't want this to become habit but it felt so good to be so full and the belly rubs also helped so much too. He wasn't sure he wanted to cut back anymore. Especially if the foods he'd been missing out were this good!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>But Italia...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Screw it.

It's not like I can't lose it later. But for now, I  just want to enjoy myself and the food from last night was so good!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Enough said.\" Malcolm chuckled. \"So, what? Am I supposed to take over as cooking instructor now? And if so, does it come with a pay raise?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll see. Though if I'm cooking, that means you'll have to watch Robert a little, so let's see how good your instructions are over the next day and then we'll decide.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh, fair enough. Want to start tomorrow? Since I've already started on today's lunch?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds good. What supplies should I get?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A cookbook. You want me to teach you different recipes, you have to pick the recipes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie didn't have many books in his house to begin with, much less cook books since he'd always had a chef to prepare everything for him. If they were going to start tomorrow though, he didn't have time to get a baby sitter and didn't want to split Malcolm's attention so instead, he grabbed his laptop and joined Robert in the living room. Italian and desserts were the obvious spots to start after last night's meal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Might as well go simple. Spaghetti is always a safe Italian bet and the sauce was highly versatile so he could experiment and get used to the various herbs and how they affected the flavor, right? Sounded right to him. But what about desserts? What type dessert would go well with spaghetti? Maybe just a regular dessert? Scrolling through different desserts, he decide upon a fairly simple one, a genoese sponge cake. The picture alone looked delicious though the recipe didn't say what the topping on it was. He'd have to ask Malcolm about that bit. Might as well do that now and that way Malcolm could pick up the ingredients on his way over.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a jelly topping. I'll just pick up a jar tomorrow instead of making it fresh. Any idea how you want to do the sauce?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was thinking of just winging it. Adding as needed. Otherwise, just a basic meat marinara sauce.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Simple yet complicated. We can do that. We'll get started tomorrow. Have the next days recipes picked out and I'll pick up the ingredients before coming each day.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grinned until he walked out of the kitchen. Looking down, he could already see the slight start of his belly through his shirt and still wasn't sure he wanted to let it get larger but at the same time, he was kind of excited where thins might go.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, things are already set in motion.

I mean, you just enjoying yourself, right? I figured that can't be done with \"decent\" portion sizes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but I don't want to get fat!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? I've seen you lighten up on your restrictions since Mrs. Amell's been gone. You used to have a six pack but that's disappeared. It will take time to restore it, so why not just really let go for as long as possible?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie had to admit, he had a point. He had let himself go and was enjoying it. Screw it. He was going to take Malcolm's advice and just go for it! He'd never felt better than he had over the past couple weeks when he'd nearly knocked himself out from eating so much. Well, except those times when he was having \"quality time\" with Italia, but other than that...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. But I still think that will be WAY to much for me. I don't want to waste the food by making so much more than we could eat.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. I can agree with that. So let's get started!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm guided Robbie through the different steps for preparing the different dishes while he played with Robert. Every once in a while, he'd come over and give a some advice on how to balance the flavor of the herbs. Despite what Robbie had said, there was still an entire box of spaghetti cooked, two pounds of spaghetti sauce and the sponge cake ended up being twice as thick as most sheet cakes. He'd express concern over the sheer volume of food throughout his time in the kitchen but ease up when Malcolm assured him he'd help him eat it all.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sauce done after three hours of simmering, Robbie finally sat down at the table. Malcolm insisted on waiting on him. He brought out a plate of the spaghetti for him and every time he ran out, the plate was refilled within seconds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Three plates turned into four. Robbie leaned back, groaning, his gut rounded out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"To much.\" He moaned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, at least try a slice of the sponge cake. Oh, and I made you this too.\" He placed a large glass of what looked like chocolate milkshake on the table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Malcolm, but something a little thinner would definitely be preferred.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This will help you digest some. Just take a gulp and you'll see what I mean.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie groaned as he leaned forward to grab it. Bracing himself, he took a gulp. The shake was really thick but the cold semi-liquid helped sooth his aching stomach.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More than should have been.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Malcolm, what's in this shake?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Chocolate ice cream, some cream, a banana, and just a couple muscle relaxants. It's perfectly safe. I got it from the store at the same time I got the jelly for the sponge cake. Here's the bottle so you can check it out for yourself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He rolled the bottle across the table. Sure enough, Robbie recognized them from the store. They were well known as not being that powerful.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should have told me about that before giving it to me. I could have had a reaction to that or something.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're right. I'm sorry. But that's why I got the weak ones that weren't known for being that effective. But you're already feeling ready for that cake, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grumbled but nodded. Malcolm went into the kitchen and came back with a large slice of the sponge cake topped with a smooth layer of Raspberry jelly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the last of the cake disappeared from the plate and all the shake drained from the glass, Robbie struggled to stand. With Malcolm's help, he made his way into the living room and plopped onto the couch to sleep off his giant meal next to his son, napping in his crib. He faded out as Malcolm started banging around in the kitchen, cleaning up the mess that had been made.</span></div></div>",

Every morning Malcolm would show up with the ingredients for that days meals in larger portions than Robbie found reasonable but soon realized that those were important as his capacity slowly increased but not as fast as the portion sizes. That's why he reluctantly agreed to take the relaxants after meals. And his waist was taking the brunt of the damage. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm had been teaching him a week and a half when he saw his first sign, actually signs, of the damage done so far. Trying to get ready for his cooking class for the night, the babysitter arrived to hear him struggling upstairs. She didn't know what was going on, but had she gone upstairs, she would have found him in his room, squirming around on the bed, trying to get his jeans buttoned. Sweaty and out of breath but finally having them buttoned, he made his way to the bathroom to clean up a little. It was while he was washing his face that he noticed his shirt was also riding up just a sliver but it was enough to show off a red patch. Pulling it up a little showed an almost inch long and half inch wide red strip of flesh ending just below the edge of his jeans.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn! I'm going to have to talk to Malcolm! This is getting out of hand!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything alright Mr. Amell?\" Asked Mena, bouncing a giggling Robert on her knee as he came down. \"I heard a lot of banging up there.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Just a slight wardrobe malfunction. I'll be back at the usual time tonight. Feel free to help yourself to anything in the fridge.\" He left without giving her a chance to respond, slamming the door behind him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He hoped that the class tonight would have some light recipes, like a nice egg white omelet or something. No such luck. Tonight was frittata night. For the first time, everyone was to pick two recipe card and make their own recipe and his was a mushroom and zucchini and a potato and bacon frittata.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like normal, the class went about an hour and Robbie had and entire one and a half frittatas to take home. Once done, he rushed out as fast as he could. The entire class, his pants had been cutting into him. He'd need to get larger clothes tomorrow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The new developments of stretch marks and needing a larger wardrobe made Robbie wonder what he was doing but the smell of the frittatas in the seat next to him was to enticing, quickly pushing the thoughts out of his mind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He knew he should slow down, tell Malcolm not bring so many supplies, but his stomach's grumble now despite a huge meal and some grazing through the day did nothing to help him want to cut back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Mena was paid and Robert was down for the night, Robbie peeled off his pants and started on his late night \"snack\". Before going to bed that night, there was nothing left of the frittatas except a bloated mound on his waist. He fell asleep massaging the food into him for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Malcolm arrived the next morning, he still had the taste of frittatas in his mouth and he wanted some more so even though they were going to make a lasagna, he sent Malcolm out to get the ingredients for them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm didn't even try to hide his pleasure at Robbie's desire for more food and while he got the ingredients, had Robbie start on the lasagna.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the frittatas on the menu, Malcolm altered the lasagna recipe some to let it simmer longer and by the time he had coaxed the entirety of both larger frittatas into Robbie, the lasagna was ready and smelling divine. Even with his gut again bloated, something he was getting used to, he still took Malcolm up on a slice of the lasagna that was close to an eighth of the whole 10x13 inch wide, eight lair deep lasagna. He ate the whole slice and couldn't get up at that point. Even with the help of the muscle relaxants, he still had trouble breathing, he was so stuffed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm took Robbie's craving that morning as a sign and started bringing more supplies.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the end of the second week, Robbie swore he was going to cut back as another stretch mark had appeared but by the end of third week, his abs were gone even when he tried to flex them, not that he tried that much anymore and he wasn't sure he wanted to anymore.</span></div></div>",

Woke up hungry so thought I'd get a little snack while waiting for you to get here with the breakfast supplies.\" He sat up, brushing crumbs off his chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm couldn't help but admire the changes to Robbie's body over the past month and a half. His entire body was already showing signs of the gluttony he was embracing wholeheartedly. In the years he'd worked for him, Robbie had always had a trim runner's or swimmer's build. Now his chest had puffed up a bit. The basic tone his arms and legs had was gone. Slight love handles hugged his shorts with a dozen stretch marks around it. His abs bowed out an inch too, pushing the short down as well and as he stood up, Malcolm got a view of the padding of his rear now holding up the shorts from behind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ready to make those quesadillas?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Robert's at a play date all morning so we have time to spare.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading into the kitchen, Robbie and Malcolm got all the their separate ingredients sorted. A week ago, Robbie got tired of having one recipe a day so he would do one recipe while Malcolm did another and looked over his shoulder to make sure he was doing everything correctly and breakfast. Today's recipes were quesadillas and a sausage casserole.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For an hour, Malcolm prepped and baked the casserole while Robbie prepped the quesadillas, munching on extra bits of the ingredients and trail mix as he went. As everything went into the oven to bake, Malcolm made up Robbie's now daily morning milkshake. The base of which Malcolm always added the same: ice cream, heavy cream, mass gain powder, and multivitamins, and Robbie would then spice it up with different spices, fruits, toppings or other ingredients. This new ritual alone had nearly doubled the rate at which he had been putting on weight and he considered it the cause of an extra 5 pounds on top of the 20 that plain overeating had caused.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm always insisted that he drink the entire thing thing before he left. At first, Robbie tried to insist that he couldn't drink the whole thing and that Malcolm should have some too but Malcolm always denied it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're the growing boy, not me.\" He'd chuckle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With all the changes to his diet, Malcolm stopped leaving until Robbie had a visible bloat that made it difficult to move on his own and then would also leave that day's leftovers nearby so he could eat upon waking. He'd gotten so used to this, that when awake, he almost never went without food for very long.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And he was loving it.</span></div></div>",

Robbie jumped around his room, slamming into everything as he struggled to pull his shirt down over his head. After five minutes, he finally managed to yank it off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Panting, he held the shirt up in front of himself. The large shirt had fit just right for several years but looking at it in the mirror, he could see how close he was to overflowing the sides of it when it was flat. This was still his favorite shirt and there was no way he'd gained enough weight in two months to outgrow it! He'd get into it if it was the last thing he did!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scrunching up the shirt, he threw both arms through the sleeves, pinching them in the process, and pulled it down so his head was through the neck hole. Grinning, he lowered his arms to pull the shirt the rest of the way down. It got halfway down then stopped. He kept trying to pull it down more but his arms wouldn't bend anymore. The fabric was pulled taut around his shoulders. With one last heave, he yanked it down...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And yanked the seams out of the left shoulder!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn it!\" He screamed again as the shirt finally went down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The still intact parts of the shirt fit like a second skin. Even with the seams burst, he'd still have trouble getting it off. Especially with it cutting circulation off to his right arm. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading into the bathroom, he grabbed a pair of scissors meant for trimming his beard. They weren't meant to cut something as thick as fabric so it took some effort to free his arm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hand still tingling, he yanked the shirt off as fast as he could.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gym clothes it is.\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His gym shirt was much easier to get into since it was sleeveless but was just as form fitting, showing off every new curve he'd gained.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert's crying echoed down the halls spurring him to dress faster. Foregoing his pants that had been fitting like skinny jeans the past few days, he threw on the sweats from the one game of pick up basketball he'd played with some friends a couple days ago. They'd gotten no end of kicks making fun of his weight gain, most of which he just took in turn, knowing it was bound to happen sooner or later.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert was standing in his crib, bawling as if something had hurt him, with his teddy bear on the floor below.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bending over to pick it up, he could feel his sweats straining against his ass. He needed to go clothes shopping soon or he was going to outgrow all of his clothes by the end of the month!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Picking up Robert and the bear, he carried them down to the living room before joining Malcolm in the kitchen where breakfast was almost ready.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened to the regular clothes you wanted to wear today?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't ask.\" Robbie growled. Malcolm opted to respond by pulling the breakfast souffle out of the oven. The savory scent of cream cheese and berries filled the room, eliciting a growl from Robbie's stomach. While they finished cooling, he started working on the pot of chicken gnocchi soup. Malcolm had prepared the gnocchi the night before so it wouldn't take as long. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soup on the stove, Robbie helped himself to the finished souffles as Malcolm baked more. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finish his third of the souffles, he glanced at the fourth one sitting there waiting to be eaten, another 4 in the oven waiting to come out and join the others on his waistline. If he didn't slow down, he'd out grow every clothes store he went to by the end of the year.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robbie grumbled to himself and looked down at the souffle, feeling conflicted.  It felt so good to not have to worry about how much he ate and when, or sticking to a workout routine that he had monotonously done before a million times just to maintain a certain look that he didn't care about.  Was that true, did he really not care about the physique that he had put so much effort into and had given him so much?  Had he been fat, would he have been cast as Ronnie Raymond? Scooby Doo's Fred had never been tubby as far as he was aware.  Would he even have got to the audition of most of the roles he had if he turned up with a bulging belly rather than a six pack?  Any auditions that he did make would be for the goofy fat friend, or the comic relief, if he even made it past being an extra.  The big roles wanted attractive and athletic, there was no premium in being fat.  It made sense to cut back and lose weight, of course it did, but it just didn't <i>feel</i> right... what felt right, was being bloated full of food, his belly as tight as a drum and lounging back on the couch as his stomach went to work on digesting it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it wasn't like he was cutting back to make sure that his clothes still fit properly, he thought running a hand down his skin tight gym shirt.  That ship had definitely sailed.  He could just buy another copy of his favourite shirt in a bigger size, it wasn't like... catching himself mid-thought, Robbie shook his head gently as if to dislodge the idea from his mind.  Letting go a bit was one thing, but he didn't want to start buying bigger sizes.  Buying bigger clothes everytime he outgrew his old ones was the path to getting huge.  Robbie put down the spoon in his hand and drummed the table with his fingers as he began to feel conflicted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped the spoon up and dragged the souffle closer to him, as Malcolm delivered a fresh batch of four to the table.  \"Did they come out alright?  You're not eating as fast as you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they're great, I was just thinking.\"  Malcolm grinned as he pushed the fresh batch of souffles closer toward Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can think and eat, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, thanks.\"  Robbie said, grinning back.  \"They taste great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, well eat up.  The soup will be done soon.\" Malcolm said as he walked back into the kitchen.  Robbie plunged into the souffle and pushed an overly full spoonful into his mouth.  Today he would finish off all the food that Malcolm made as skipping it all wouldn't bring back his shirt, or make his other clothes magically fit and he didn't want to see it go to waste.  But tomorrow he would have to have a serious talk with Malcolm, or at the very least try and cut back.  No not try, he <i> would</i> cut back.  He coudn't support his family on a fat actors budget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie tore through the souffles much to Malcolm's obvious delight and it was only when he was nearly done that he remembered that he should probably be helping out.  \"Hey, aren't I meant to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take a day off.  Why not just relax and enjoy yourself.\"  <i> That was part of the problem</i>, Robbie thought to himself sourly.  He would enjoy the food and this 'experiment' today and make the changes tomorrow.  As he finished the souffles, Malcolm deposited a large bowl of chicken gnocchi soup in front of him and went back for one of his special chocolate shakes.  Robbie got into a rhythm of a few scoops of the soup followed by a a couple of big gulps of the drink and as Malcolm refilled the soup bowl as it became perilously low, Robbie realised that he was putting away a huge amount of it.  The shake made everything taste so creamy and rich, but there was no doubt that the soup had the most fattening ingredients that Malcolm could lay his hands on.  As Robbie began to breathe more deeply and spread his legs open as the sheer fullness of his stomach took its toll, he idly wondered if Malcolm had upped the amount or strength of the muscle relaxants that he used, or snuck some into the soup as well.  That would certainly be in character for him.  He considered asking Malcolm, but he never felt like talking when he started to get really full.  All he wanted to do was try and cram a bit more in and sit back and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job!\"  Malcolm said, sounding genunely impressed as the soup spoon clattered in the bowl.  \"Want some help to get to the couch?\"  Robbie was barely able to nod lethargically.  It took a while for him to get to his feet and after Malcolm snaked his arm around his waist and rested a steadying hand on the side of his gut, the two of them made the painfully slow journey to the couch.  Even though the soup was pretty thick, between it and the shake he could feel the liquid press up against and stretch out his stomach.  Both he and Malcolm had to stop several times on the way, Robbie to make sure that he didn't push himself too hard and bring back up all of Malcolm's hard work and Malcolm needed to get a better grip on Robbie as his rounded out belly probably wasn't the easiest get a grip on, especially if he didn't want to aggravate it.  Eventually, they made it to the couch and after making the slowest of turns, they began the task of lowering him down.  Things went well until the weight and pain of Robbie's stomach made his legs give way and he ended up collapsing the final few inches down, dragging Malcolm with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  Robbie managed to mumble, sinking into the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"  Malcolm said, standing back up and readjusting his clothes.  Malcolm took a moment to appreciate his handiwork with a grin, before giving Robbie's gut a couple of gentle slaps and returning to the kitchen.  Robbie felt exhausted.  <i>Was it bed time already?</i>  In a way he hoped it was, otherwise when he woke up again he would be met by another loaded plate of food, more likely than not.  The sooner tomorrow got here, the better, he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow.  Yes, tomorrow he would... he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In many regards, he looked like Malcolm, having the same curly red hair and freckles but unlike Malcolm's slight build with pot belly, Taylor looked to have a good hundred pounds and half a foot on his cousin. His entire body was thick with muscle layered over with fat. A large portion of his fat was located in big gut attached like a ball to his torso. As if his build weren't lumberjack enough, he even had the clothes to complete the image. His plaid button down shirt was stretched taut over his entire torso. The sleeves were rolled halfway up his forearms. Suspenders held up a pair of heavy duty pants that were pushed down slightly by his belly. Yellow rain boots threw off the look some in color but not in style. The main aspect that threw the entire look off the entire look was the bright orange Gators baseball cap.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're Taylor?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course.

He pulled a folder out of his briefcase. \"Why is everyone like this? Just because I don't wear the big name brands everyone thinks I have no fashion sense, well let me tell you something Mr. Big-Shot-Cousin-To-The-Biggest-TV-Superhero-I-Only-Wear-Name-Brand-Clothes, I'm a tailor, not a fashion designer. Big difference. I may be able to make clothes from scratch, but they are based on designs created by others, not my own work. And sewing doesn't require a sense of fashion anyways. Anyone can learn it, but if you want to only have the best of the best, I can take my skills elsewhere and you can pay three times what you would have paid if I were charging full price instead of the half price as a favor to my cousin.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine, fine. I'm sorry. You're right. Your portfolio looks good and you are going out of your way to do this. The least I can do is say thank you and give you a chance.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.\" He pulled a tape measure out of his sewing basket. \"Now strip to your underwear and get up on the ottoman so I can measure you to adjust your clothes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie did as he was told, having to resist shivering in his boxers because of the A/C cooled room. His speech turned out not to be an understatement as he expertly measured Robbie's arms, thighs, waist, and everything else one could think of needed for clothes adjustment or creation. Taylor didn't say much as he was snacking on bugles the entire time except when telling Robbie to change positions.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay. All done with your measurements. Give me a few hours and I'll at least have at least a couple pairs of pants and some shirts done for you. Adjusting everything will take a few days though. I'll come back with Malcolm until done. Payment at end of the day please. I take MasterCard, Visa, and cash. Now, I think Malcolm's surprise is ready by now. He'll have something special every day I'm working on your clothes. Finish it by the time we leave and I'll reduce the price in half again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, okay. And just why would you want me to eat whatever it is Malcolm has for me? Wouldn't that just mean you'd have to take more measurements?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Part of the favor to Malcolm. And I'll add a little extra space for you to grow into. No extra charge. Same deal later if you need it. And from what Malcolm's said about your appetite, then I'll be back. Now, get down there and eat up. Real men indulge their appetites and I need to get to work.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor pushed Robbie out, shoving his clothes into his arms and slamming the door behind him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Throwing his clothes back on, he headed down to see what Malcolm had planned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Taylor already working his magic, I take it?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Now what's this about an extra deal with me finishing all of some surprise? I never agreed to that you know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but I thought you'd enjoy this. Homemade ice cream!\" He pulled out a gallon of pink ice cream. \"Finish this and these,\" he opened the oven where a tray of cannolis was within minutes of finishing, \"and he'll give you that discount. Daily deal, so if you don't finish it, you can still get it the next day. I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grabbed an ice cream scoop. \"Hope you don't mind if I at least give a little to Robert.\" Getting a couple scoops into a small bowl, he placed it on the high chair's tray in front of Robert with a plastic spoon. Banging his spoon and giggling, he used his fingers to scrape out little bits of the ice cream as it melted. Robbie alternated between watch his son make a mess and taking notes of how he handled the filling and icing on them between bites of the ice cream, chunks of strawberry and raspberry in it. He couldn't go to fast or else he'd get end up with a brain freeze but going slowly was allowing him to fill up too quickly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is there any way to lessen the ice cream part of the deal to half? There's no way I'd be able to eat even half of this without making myself sick from overeating or brain freeze or taking to long to let it melt.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm tapped his whisk against the mixing bowl. \"I'll talk with Taylor. He likes to not see food go to waste, but he also doesn't like seeing people get hurt. I'm sure we can come to some modified agreement. Just do the best you can and aim to finish all the cannolis.\" Malcolm poured the chocolate sauce over the tray. Once done, he placed it front of Robbie, pushing the ice cream to the side. \"Now, finish these and I'll go chat with Taylor. As for giving some to Robert, he's a sucker for kids so that he likely won't mind.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He headed upstairs as Robbie took his first bite of the still warm pastries. The dark chocolate sauce blended with the lightly sweetened vanilla whipped cream filling in a symphony of heaven and Earth colliding. He was licking the last of the chocolate sauce off his fingers when Malcolm came back down. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice. You at least finished those. 18 cannolis. Pretty good. As for the ice cream\"...</span></div></div>",

Scooping the ice cream into several tupper ware containers, he placed them on the stove top to heat up. With a quarter of the ice cream still in the bucket, he split it between a container to zap and leaving the rest in for him to eat while everything was melted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, one thing I'm not getting,\" Robbie said between cleaning the spoon and carton, \"is why you want me to eat all this on top of the stuff we're already doing each day?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about? The ice cream was Taylor's idea.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He said it was yours.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Figures. And I'm betting he gave you the whole \"don't judge me on my fashion because my job is to fix other's fashions\"? He never takes credit for his own ideas. He's actually really good at designing clothes, he just doesn't like to chow them off.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then why would he want me eating more? We've never even met before.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He told you \"real men indulge their appetites\" or something like that? He wasn't joking. He fully means that. If food is involved and you can walk away from the table after the meal, he gets to be a jerk. Only a big appetite impresses him. Either way, he's still offering a good deal that well seems worth it to me. One that you've already been working on anyways.\" Malcolm chuckled. He started pulling supplies out of the fridge for the Mexican lasagna.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I know I have been. Not that I don't enjoy this, but I really should start cutting back. I found a new stretch mark this morning.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That makes what, 15? If the first dozen didn't bother you that much, why would this one?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie raised his arm, pushing his sleeve up as much as he could. In his armpit was a bright red, inch long stretch mark.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah. First one not around the waist. Got it. I'll bring some cocoa butter tomorrow to soften your skin.\" He handed one of the now melted tupper wares to Robbie. \"Now drink up. I need the space for the lasagna and you have an additional discount to win!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm noticed Robbie's gut starting to bloat by the third container. This wasn't new but he still had half the ice cream to drink. \"You still taking those muscle relaxants?\" He asked as Robbie started to rub his gut through his shirt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No. I didn't want to get addicted. Besides, they weren't working that well. It just became harder to stay awake after eating but didn't help with the pain in my gut.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm blew out a hard breath. \"Um, I may know of something that could help you win the extra discount each day, but it's a little more extreme than the muscle relaxants.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie licked the strawberry cream from his lips. \"More extreme?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Um, appetite stimulants. With those, you'd be a lot hungrier, so if not careful, they can be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll say! I keep talking of cutting back and you suggest taking appetite stimulants? What else you got?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Belly rubs or calling the whole deal off. Taylor would still give the original 50% off but it might not apply if you need your clothes adjusted again. I can understand if you didn't want to partake in the extra discount. It isn't what we agreed to when you started indulging yourself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No kidding. But I think I'm getting close to the point of no return anyways.

His own gut stuffed to close to painful and wanting to lay down himself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go get comfy on the couch. I'll bring the ice cream out once I'm done with the lasagna.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie placed Robert in his play pin. The toddler was out before the blanket was even draped over him. Robbie laid down on the couch himself, rubbing his stomach to make room for the incoming ice cream. He zoned out as the TV buzzed in the background. He didn't even notice Malcolm come in with the remaining containers of ice cream.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We need to hurry. The lasagna will be done in an hour and a half and then Taylor and I have to go. This might get intense since you aren't quite used to this amount.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine. The pressures lessened some.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.\" He handed the first of the three containers to Robbie. Half the container was drained in five minutes bringing his bloat back to where it had been but he was already slowing. Malcolm took the opportunity to pull up Robbie's shirt and start rubbing it himself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie struggled through the next container too, his gut turning pink from the strain. Malcolm put the last container of ice cream to Robbie's lips. The liquid dripped into his mouth at an agonizing pace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on Robbie! Last bit!\" He glanced at the clock. \"Ten minutes until the lasagna needs to come out and twenty until Taylor will be done for today. If you don't finish by then, it's back to the half price for the modifications.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Full.\" Robbie groaned. \"No... more.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, come on now. Don't give up!\" He laid the container on the table and took to massaging Robbie's gut with both hands. Several burps were elicited from him. He did that for five minutes until the burps dies off. \"Good! That should have made some extra space. Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nearly choking on the ice cream, each gulp stretched his gut under Malcolm's watchful eye.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How's he doing?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm jumped, the ice cream flying from his hand and splashing the wall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Taylor! Don't do that! How do you do that? You're like 300 pounds! And in rubber boots! How do you slink around like that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quiet? Every board in this place squeaks like a rusty hinge. You were just distracted. Speaking of which, the timer's been going off for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Crap!\" Malcolm ran out of the room leaving Taylor and Robbie alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn boy! I didn't think you'd actually try for that extra discount! You really did a number on yourself!\" He glanced at the ice cream on the wall. \"I'm surprised you got through as much as you did. And sorry about the mess. You have any washcloths?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Third door... on the left. Just... past the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor bolted from the room, the house shaking under his heavy thuds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lasagna's out. The edges are a little overdone, but it should be fine. Where'd Taylor run...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor pushed past, shoving a couple washcloths into Malcolm's hand.  \"Let's get that stain cleaned before it dries.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm grumbled but didn't fight him as Taylor guided him to the stain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie zoned out, trying to ease the pain in his gut until Robert cried. He tried to get up but his gut didn't have any give. \"Um, I realize... this isn't in... the job description... but can... one of you check on... Robert? I... can't move.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor picked Robert up. \"Phew! Wow, does this kid know how to fill his diaper or what?\" Grabbing the diaper bag from the corner, he made his way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you he loves kids.\" Malcolm mumbled, scrubbing the last of the ice cream off the wall. The wall had discoloration where the ice cream had hit with slightly less from the scrubbing alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't take long for Taylor to come back soaking wet with a giggling Robert. \"This kid is a little troublemaker, you know that? I went to change his diaper and he peed on me so I had to spray myself down. I had to use all the towels in there to clean myself up. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No... problem. If you... want to babysit... just give me a call.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe sometimes. But that will cancel out the next day's extra discount regardless.\" He chuckled. \"Well, I'll leave little Robert here to play while you rest. We've got to head out since I have another client. We'll be back tomorrow. As for that deal, I was just wondering if you'd even attempt it, so for being a good sport and going along with it, I'll give that extra quarter off and if you can at least get as far as you did today, I'll give that day free of charge!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm rolled his eyes. \"And you thought I was sneaky when I first started pushing you. At least I didn't bribe you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you just drugged him.\" Taylor reminded him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With muscle relaxants! It's not like it I was dosing with him crack or marijuana!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatever. We need to go. We'll be back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor and Malcolm made their way out leaving Robbie dazed and on the edge of consciousness.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe we should get him a babysitter if this is going to happen?\" Malcolm asked as the door closed behind them.</span></div></div>",

By the time they\u2019d leave each day, Robbie was stuck on the couch, his gut bulging a little bit more each day. Two new stretch marks appeared, one on each side of his belly button.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They all agreed that he\u2019d go easy on days he had training sessions and would be ineligible for the free service, starting that Friday.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm and Taylor were busy when a knock sounded from the door. In a pair of newly loosened shorts and a sleeveless shirt, Robbie opened the door to his trainer. Standing there was a 5\u20196\u201d young man in a form-fitting white Under Armor shirt and Lycra shorts that showed of a lithe frame that made Robbie\u2019s former build still look fat. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood morni\u2026 Ugh. Mr. Amell?\u201d His perfect teeth disappeared with his smile as he took in Robbie\u2019s appearance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes.

They sent you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat is your point mister?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t shut your mouth and listen to me, your client, the one paying you for your services, and stop with the ridicule then you can just leave and I\u2019ll call the gym, cancel my membership, and state that you are the reason I\u2019m canceling. And as an independent contractor, that will lose you the commission and the gym will blame you for the loss of revenue as well.\u201d Robbie grabbed his cell from the lamp stand, finger poised to start dialing. \u201cSo what will it be?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kevin\u2019s face turned red as he glared at Robbie. \u201cFine. What are your goals?\u201d He stated through his teeth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you. The main things I\u2019m looking for are a workout routine and recommendations for a home gym. I have several different home gym machines pulled up to look through.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kevin looked over Robbie\u2019s shoulder as they scanned the web pages, giving suggestion asked but sticking to as few words as possible. When they were finally had one selected with the most exercises they could think of, both machine and \u201cfree\u201d weight exercises, Kevin moved the coffee table out of the middle of the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe need to test your range of motion and get your stats.\u201d Kevin guided Robbie through various stretches, measuring the distance between his fingers when he reached behind his back, checking if he could touch his toes, using calipers to measure his body fat (Kevin tried to hide his grimace as he pinched the fat of Robbie\u2019s love handle, pulling away an inch of fat before clamping the calipers down on his side).<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay. Height: 6\u20192\u201d. Weight: 212 pounds. Age: 32. That would make your BMI\u2026\u201d He typed some numbers into a calculator, \u201c27.2. And you said you want to focus on health and muscle but not lose weight?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah that\u2019s right.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo most cardio is out. I\u2019ll have a workout program set up for you when you come to the gym. How often are you planning on working out?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was thinking 4-5 times a week. But whatever you think is best.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood. Then come to the gym at 10 on Sunday and we can do the endurance and one rep max tests.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kevin wasted no time packing his things and rushing out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell? How\u2019s it going?\u201d Malcolm popped his head out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s a jerk. Hopefully, he\u2019s as good as his ego or that gym will have another thing coming.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd your weight?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c212 pounds. I\u2019ve gained 40 pounds in two months!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good gain! Better than I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m still not sure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you want? Do you want to relax and do what you want or do you want to go back to how things were?\u201d Taylor growled, coming down the stairs with Robert giggling in his arms.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI want to relax but I\u2019ve always liked being fit too. It\u2019s hard to make such a radical change so quickly.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Especially when so many don\u2019t think someone can look good with a few extra pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd there\u2019s the key: not everyone thinks like that and if you try to please everyone, you will never be happy. If you just focus on yourself, you\u2019ll be much happier, trust me. It may be difficult getting people to see my skills past my appearance, but there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather be doing. But if you have trouble deciding, we could up your meals and see if that helps you decide.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm, thanks but no thanks. I\u2019m eating enough already.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t bring that appetite stimulant in a few days?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll see, okay? Let\u2019s just get through working with that trainer for now.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t trust someone that skinny, but it\u2019s up to you. Either way, you\u2019re still looking skinny yourself so what say you that we go to a buffet?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey! But what my hash brown casserole?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, Robbie, what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know you worked hard on the casserole, I\u2019m just wanting something else.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to apologize to me.

He\u2019s always been jealous that I put on the size he can\u2019t and now his little pet project is choosing to go with me to eat instead of enjoying his painstakingly, agonizingly good homemade meals.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShut it Taylor! I\u2019ve never been jealous of you!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBull! I read your diaries as a kid! You\u2019ve always spied on me wishing you could have my size.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm\u2019s face matched his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026 You couldn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026 You\u2019re a bastard, you know that?!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He stormed towards the door. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to make sure your casserole doesn\u2019t burn?\u201d Taylor reminded him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arms crossed, he dropped into a kitchen chair, avoiding eye contact with either of the others.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, what type buffet you in the mood for? Western? Chinese? Noodles? Soup? A mix? I even know of a small ice cream buffet if you really wanted that.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done with ice cream for now. How about Mexican?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Nice! I know a good Mexican buffet.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo surprise there fatso.\u201d Malcolm mumbled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor ignored him. \u201cLet\u2019s just get Robert placed in his pin\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe can come. We\u2019ll take my car since it has the car seat.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou sure? He hasn\u2019t had a nap yet.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just an added safety measure so we don\u2019t stay to long.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, at least you have some good judgement.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop complaining Malcolm. I\u2019ll still eat your casserole, it just won\u2019t be right away.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re still going to regret this.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie rolled his eyes and took Robert from Taylor. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get going. This is the longest I\u2019ve gone without being stuffed in some time and my stomach is reminding me of that.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He headed out, grabbing his keys off the hook by the front door as he left. Taylor grinned at Malcolm, a dark glint sparkled in his eyes, as he followed behind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The drive to the buffet took 20 minutes. Robbie kept adjusting his seatbelt as it kept slipping down and under his new gut. Pulling into the empty parking lot, Taylor headed in as he got Robert out of the back. It took a little effort as the toddler screamed and giggled as he punched and kicked at his father.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Entering the buffet, Taylor waved at him from a table near the trays, a high chair to one side. Two plates loaded with tacos sat in front of the empty side of the table while Taylor sat munching on his nachos.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis place isn\u2019t the best quality, but it\u2019s great for gaining and they really don\u2019t have a plate limit so a bunch of bigger guys like to come here to eat.\u201d He waved to someone behind Robbie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A guy, at least 500 pounds, waddled up to them. \u201cHey! Taylor! Been a while! Who\u2019s the small fry?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAugust, this Robbie Amell and his son Robert. Malcolm\u2019s been working with him for a couple months. A week for me.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRobbie and Robert? I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s a junior then. Never been big on people naming their kids after themselves. Always seemed rather egotistical to me.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the 4th, not a junior.\u201d Robbie glared at the newcomer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, hey. Your choice to continue that tradition. I just said I\u2019m not a fan of it. But really Taylor, a week and you\u2019ve already snatched away his project? That\u2019s a record. Why does he keep recommending business for you when you keep stealing his projects?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAsk him. I do think he\u2019s getting fed up with it. You should have seen the temper tantrum he threw as we left.\u201d Taylor chuckled as August let out a belly shaking laugh.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I can imagine. He was always the odd one out at out parties. Speaking of which, when you going to come back to them? Football season\u2019s about to begin again and the contests aren\u2019t the same without you!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBusiness picked up a lot last year with people usually getting full wardrobe adjustments, like Robbie here, but it\u2019s slowed in the past couple months so I should be able to attend again soon.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGreat! Next one\u2019s August 31st. Bring the new guy. Then he can see how the big guys eat and how much fun they can have!\u201d He left the way he came, belly bouncing with each step.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, I really don\u2019t want to get that big! Did you see that guy\u2019s gut?! It was pure Jell-O! And Italia doesn\u2019t have breasts that big!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop worrying Robbie. You have a long way to go before you\u2019re even close to being August\u2019s size. You can stop anytime between now and then. And you should think about joining us at that party. You\u2019d be surprised just how much fun big guys like August and the others can be. For now though, just eat your tacos. I\u2019ll get you more when you\u2019re done.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie grimaced at the plate. The idea of continuing towards August\u2019s size was really unappealing but he was already getting used to being stuffed each day. He was waking up each morning feeling emptier and emptier and Malcolm\u2019s cooking, especially since he started doing beyond the low cal tenderloins and stuff that Italia liked, was getting really hard to resist and now he was faced with the reality of where this could actually lead.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His stomach growled, interrupting his thoughts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019d better eat up. You can ponder your worries later. No one here will be upset regardless of what you decide. Unless you decide not to finish your plate. Then Juan will be really upset with you. He HATES when food foes to waste instead of waist.\u201d He chuckled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A man about Taylor\u2019s build but a foot shorter than Robbie placed a plate on the table in front of Robert. \u201cYou got that right, mi amigo. Here\u2019s the quesadilla for the rugrat.\u201d He chuckled, pinching Robert\u2019s cheek lightly. Robert tried to bite his finger in response. \u201cOh ho! We got a nibbler here! I\u2019ll have to watch myself!\u201d He chuckled as he headed back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat was Hernandez. He\u2019s Juan\u2019s nephew and head chef.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd if he, August and you are any indication, then Juan is also\u2026 rather\u2026 hefty?\u201d Robbie circled his hand as he searched for the right words.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFat. The word you want is fat. And no. He\u2019s only a little bigger than you are right now. But he never misses a party either.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert tore apart his quesadilla chewing on the small bits of chicken and throwing the bits of tortilla onto the table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTell you what, let\u2019s take it easy. Malcolm and I won\u2019t push you if you don\u2019t want it until the party on the 31st. We\u2019ll go and if you\u2019re undecided after that, Malcolm will go back to his old recipes and as you lose weight, I\u2019ll return your clothes to their old states, free of charge. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie thought about it for a moment and nodded. Taylor held out his hand which Robbie shook.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood. Oh, and that means you won\u2019t get the free days either. That deal will be suspended until after the party. Now, let\u2019s fill you up here this one last time and we can head back to your place for the day.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Though that turned out to be rarer than Robbie expected.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm, to compensate for not being able to really push Robbie, started upping the calories, making high fat, heavy cream dishes for every meal, especially desserts. For his part, he tried to work out and stabilize his gains. They did slow down but by the time his new home gym arrived a week after their deal was formalized, he\u2019d gained another 3 pounds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to push you even harder tubby!\u201d Kevin growled as a truck backed up to Robbie\u2019s door.

Shut up Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Four men climbed out of the truck and into the bed where a tarp covered several boxes containing the various part.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie guided the men through a couple rooms and out onto his enclosed patio where he had a matt set up for the machine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They opted to bring everything inside before the rain completely destroyed the boxes but the last ones had still received a lot of water. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLook out!\u201d Robbie yelled as the last box, containing the workout bench, broke open. Time slowed as the bench fell, slamming into the base of the grandfather clock which toppled over. Everyone jumped back as it slammed into the wall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEveryone alright?\u201d Robbie called across the clock.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The workers nodded. \u201cLucas! I told you to make sure you had a firm hold under the box! We\u2019re sorry about your clock!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No one got hurt and that\u2019s the important part. Since the bench is already on the floor, why don\u2019t we move the clock out of the way?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie braced one side while a couple of the workers grabbed the other. On three, they lifted the clock and moved towards the living room. Backing up, Robbie bumped into the couch, jerking him backwards. Catching his balance, the pendulum door swung open, slamming into his knee. Reflexively, he reached down, releasing his grip on the clock. With the balance thrown off, it flipped out of the workers hands, crashing onto his foot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor and Malcolm came running in as the glass door shattered and the sound of splintering wood echoed through the house.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kevin pushed the debris off his leg and helped him onto the couch. Pulling off his shoe, his foot was already starting to swell. \u201cI\u2019m going to take him to the hospital. You two continue trying to ruin his life while overseeing them putting together the equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t go! We need to clear this up! It was our fault!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. Installation has already been paid for. Just finish and leave, I won\u2019t press charges since it was bad luck and weather that caused this.\u201d Robbie told the boss as he pushed himself off the couch. \u201cTaylor, Malcolm, just push the clock out of the way and watch them and Robert. Kevin, give me a hand out.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He jumped over to Kevin, ignoring the grimace as his love handle rubbed against Kevin\u2019s side. With everything arranged, they made their way out to Kevin\u2019s SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was 10 when they finally got back to the house. Robbie was on crutches with his foot in a cast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhoa. How bad is it?\u201d Malcolm asked from the kitchen doorway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBroken foot. Doctor said I should stay off it for at least five weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow. That sucks. At least you\u2019ll have me to help around here.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, I\u2019m not going anywhere. I still have half his wardrobe left. And with that cast, who knows if these mods will be enough. Besides, someone will need to look after Robert too.\u201d Taylor exclaimed, coming out of the living room with a bowl of chips in his arm. \u201cOh, he\u2019s already fed, changed and in his crib. I\u2019m charging an extra $7 an hour for babysitting, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTaylor!\u201d Malcolm hissed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, no. He\u2019s right. It\u2019s only fair. At least for today. I\u2019m going to be laid low, not incapacitated, so I won\u2019t need a babysitter. Got that?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, let\u2019s quickly check out your new home gym and then I need to get out of here. My girlfriend is furious I missed the party we were supposed to go to tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He powerwalked out onto the patio, its motion sensor lights activating. Robbie took his time getting out and by then, Kevin had already tested out the entire thing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThose klutzes weren\u2019t completely incompetent. They did a good job putting this together. I\u2019ll be back on Saturday to train you then.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? He has a broken foot and you\u2019re still going to make him work out?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s his foot that\u2019s broken. Not the rest of his body. We can still train core and upper body. Now get out of my way Wilbur.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor growled at Kevin as he stepped aside. \u201cHe\u2019s a jerk but he is right. About both the workouts and needing to get out of here. You need any help getting upstairs?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ve done this before.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019m out. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. Night.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSame here. There\u2019s a lasagna in the oven for you. Eat as much as you can so it doesn\u2019t over cook. Night Robbie.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNight Taylor, night Malcolm. See you tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two left and Robbie limped into the kitchen and pulled out the lasagna. He hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast and the drugs had given him quite an appetite. Before he knew it, the entire thing was gone and the kitchen was spinning as his bloated gut cut off his oxygen and put him to sleep right there in his kitchen chair.</span></div></div>",

Did you sleep in here?\u201d Malcolm asked, setting his bags of groceries on the table and putting the lasagna dish into the dishwasher.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. Your lasagna was so good and I was so hungry I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d eaten until the whole thing was gone.\u201d He groaned as he stretched his back, popping it twice in the process.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeowch. That had to hurt. I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t checked on Robert this morning then?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCrap. No. He\u2019s probably hungry.\u201d Robbie\u2019s stomach growled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one. I\u2019m making homemade pizzas. You go get Robert and I\u2019ll bring the food to you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, you get comfy on the couch. I\u2019ll take care of Robert and bring him down after he\u2019s changed and fed.\u201d Taylor stated, caring his gear upstairs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Comfortable on the couch, Malcolm rushed out with a punch bowl of trail mix.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou agreed not to push unless I said.\u201d Robbie scolded as the bowl was set on the floor in front of him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s just a snack for you to munch on while the real food is being prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd here. In case you get thirsty.\u201d Taylor brought in a gallon of some sort of yellowish-brown shake in one hand and Robert in the other arm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat is that?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA peanut butter banana smoothie. Already thinned down a little to make it easier to drink.\u201d He placed the gallon container on the floor next to the bowl of trail mix.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be cutting back until the party guys.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re also recovering from an injury. You need to keep your consumption up in order to recover properly.\u201d Taylor stated, pouring a cup of the shake for him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on guys. I\u2019m not going to be pampered.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy not? You deserve it. You just went through a traumatic experience.\u201d Malcolm pushed the trail mix closer to the couch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you have pizzas to be making?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be mending his clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuys! Stop it! I can still take care of myself. Now go do your jobs!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every day started out much the same way with them bickering over whose treats or drinks he should focus on. Robbie actually was finding some solace in Kevin\u2019s fitness nut tirades as his waist continued to expand, at the very least he wasn\u2019t trying to cater to Robbie\u2019s every vice like the other two, instead pushing him harder than ever.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although he couldn\u2019t check his weight, Robbie could tell it was going up, but only his arms showed any sign of firming up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor had been spending more time downstairs, playing with Robert and pushing the snacks towards Robbie while also helping himself to handfuls of the snacks, chatting it up and making sure Robbie always had something to mindlessly distract him as he munched. Malcolm always pointed out the tailoring that needed to be done upstairs as he\u2019d refill the snack bowls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A week before the party, Robbie had a follow up appointment to check his foot. The doctor chided him for not monitoring his calorie intake and putting on more weight but his foot was still healed enough that his cast could come off as long as he wore a brace and continued to stay off it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the way back home, Taylor grabbed them a round of burgers, three for himself and four for Robbie. Robbie rolled his eyes at Taylor\u2019s \u201csubtle\u201d push for him to eat more even though he still couldn\u2019t match the logging tailor\u2019s appetite. At least Malcolm only upped the calorie count of the ingredients he was using, not increasing the portion sizes of the meals.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well, only one more week and then that party. I wonder what that will be like?</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve been to these and have always been the odd one out. You never talk to anyone which is the opposite of why we\u2019re going. I want to introduce to people who can really open him up to gaining, and sorry Malcolm, but you would get in the way, even if you did introduce him to it.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm scowled at Taylor as he stalked back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYo! Robbie! Hurry up! I may like to be unfashionably late, but even I have my limits!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m coming! I\u2019m coming!\u201d Robbie appeared at the top of the stairs in a tank top and sweat pants. \u201cI still don\u2019t get why you wanted me to wear loose clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI already explained that. We\u2019re going to a party of really big people. There\u2019s going to be lots of food. You\u2019ll need them. They will push you to eat more. Now, come on!\u201d Taylor urged Robbie down the stairs, his boot slipping on each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Music could be heard through the door when Taylor hit the doorbell and let them in. Robbie stood staring at the sheer mass of the people present. He was towards the smaller end of the people there with around half of the people were a little larger then him, the rest were anywhere from Taylor\u2019s size to bigger than August. All the sitting room was packed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A woman came out of the kitchen carrying a deli tray that looked like it weighed 10 pounds. \u201cTaylor! You made it! Who\u2019s the newcomer? He looks familiar.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLong time no see Margie! This is Robbie Amell. He\u2019s an actor, though you\u2019ll probably know his cousin, Stephen, better. He\u2019s not sure about gaining so I wanted him to see how much fun bigger guys can have.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s good to have you here Robbie. The more, the merrier.\u201d She pulled Taylor down. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them not to hold the wing eating contest tonight. Don\u2019t want to scare him off with their slobby behavior this early.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood thinking Margie.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margie headed off to the living room, people grabbing handfuls of the crackers and toppings as she went by.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other guys and gals came over, shaking their hands and greeting them. Everyone was chatting. Many of the bigger guys were comparing different parts, whether that be their bellies or their biceps, one pair even having their beards measured.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s Amad and Stewart. They have an ongoing bet on whose beard is longer. No one else wants to join that contest.\u201d Taylor chuckled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHeyhey! Taylor! Long time no see mi amigo!\u201d The two turned to see Hernandez and an older, skinnier looking version of him that Robbie assumed was Juan.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood to see you too Juan! This is Robbie.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s just as Hernandez described. A good build on him. He could go far, if he wants.\u201d Juan winked at him and wandered off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several others came over, chatting with Taylor. All the bigger guys, and a couple women, had food in their hands when they arrived and eaten it all before they left. The skinnier people, Robbie described them like that loosely since only four women and one guy actually looked like they weighed less than him, all had food too, but when they left, most of their food stayed behind in Robbie\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor kept up most of the talking, reminding Robbie not to be rude by not at least eating something. Even just grazing on his \u201cgifts\u201d, he could understand now why Taylor had him wear loose fitting clothes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTaylor, Robbie! Glad you guys could make it!\u201d August hugged Robbie and tried to hug Taylor but the combo of their guts made it more an awkward embrace. \u201cHow are you enjoying the party?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s great. Though it would be nice if people stopped shoving food at me.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, sorry about that. Considering the crowd and all, it\u2019s just customary. I\u2019ll send out the word to go a little lighter on you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks. That would be great.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t met Gretchen yet. She won\u2019t take that request. In fact she\u2019ll likely up it.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve kept him away from her.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood thinking. You\u2019re not ready for her.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou guys do these parties every year?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll the way through the football season. We just start early in order to get life updates out of the way before the real eating contests and games start in a couple weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSounds like a good plan.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou just keep getting to know everyone for the next couple weeks. They\u2019ll introduce you to the games and customs over that happen over the season. Oh, and did you at least tell him about the big contest?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBig contest?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo. I was going to have Big Larry explain it.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou sure? Big Larry might be a little extreme.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, you may have a point. Plus I haven\u2019t been able to find him.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll be looking for a while. He couldn\u2019t make it. He probably won\u2019t be at many of the games this year either. Shelby was getting worried about his health and is making him lose some weight.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAh. Yeah. It was only a matter of time.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou want me to explain?\u201d Taylor gestured him on. \u201cOkay, so Robbie, there\u2019s really two separate contests that go on at the same time. The first is a weekly eating contest. We get one type dish, whether that\u2019s pizza, wings, tacos, etc\u2026 and whoever eats the most during the game, or finishes off their portion first, wins. The second is a little more intense. It\u2019s a season long gaining contest to see whose partner can gain the most. You can take part in both, neither, or only one if you want. We only ask that everyone who comes gives a little money to help cover expenses. These parties can get expensive.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay. I guess that\u2019s fair. Just how do these contests work? I mean, look at some of those guys! They gain 50 pounds and it wouldn\u2019t be as noticeable as 5 pounds on me. Or put on as easily.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTrue. Some guys have actually gone the other way and tried to lose more weight than others can gain. We\u2019re flexible here. Or some of us are.\u201d He chuckled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen what\u2019s up with this Larry guy?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the biggest guy that comes to these parties. He\u2019s been having trouble getting around so it\u2019s not to surprising.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut if it\u2019s a gaining or losing contest, why doesn\u2019t he do it here with everyone else?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLarry is a gainer. He WANTS to put on weight but needs to lose for health reasons and the parties are just to much temptation for him. It\u2019s a big concern so those who participate normally try to eat healthy, though large, when not at the parties.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd the winner gets a free year pass at my buffet!\u201d Juan interjected as he went past.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo what do you think Robbie? You interested in joining our \u201clittle\u201d group? You still have time. The main contests don\u2019t start for another couple weeks but we meet here every week regardless until the end of the football season.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks. I think I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Her eyes flickered over him, a sharp edge to them. \u201cYou\u2019ve only recently started gaining haven\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie\u2019s cheeks turned as red as his tank top. \u201cUm, yes. I\u2019m still not sure if I like it.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her expression softened. \u201cIt\u2019s okay dear. If anything, we might push you to eat a little more, but we can normally tell a newbie like you and will take it easy.\u201d She patted him on the shoulder and continued her rounds with the nearly empty deli tray.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t mind Margie. She\u2019s the groups \u201cmom\u201d.\u201d  A plump woman said, extending her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jolene.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m Robbie.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know. I watched The Babysitter.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUgh. Why did I do that movie?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d Jolene chuckled. \u201cI like campy horror films. Though I have to admit, as much as I liked you shirtless there, I think you\u2019re already looking better. Oh! Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m hitting on you!\u201d Jolene rushed. \u201cI\u2019m happily married to Mark! He\u2019s over at the buffet table.\u201d She pointed at a tall, muscular guy. \u201cHey Mark! Why don\u2019t you come say hi to Robbie?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mark came over. He was even bigger up close. Robbie tipped his head back to see Mark\u2019s face at least half a foot above his own. His gut was several inches bigger in every direction than Taylor\u2019s and somehow was even rounder, seemingly defying gravity. \u201cOh. This is that small fry you like. Hmmm. He\u2019s smaller than he looks on TV.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jolene slapped his arm with the back of her hand. \u201cOh! Don\u2019t listen to him! He says that about everyone who isn\u2019t 7 feet tall or more than 450 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t help it if everyone is small compared to me.\u201d He shrugged and waddled off, a wing disappearing from his plate into his mouth with every step.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSorry about him. We only just got here and he can get grumpy when he hasn\u2019t eaten yet. Why don\u2019t you go meet Lucas, Susan, Tristan and Yang. They\u2019re over by the couch. And much more laid back then Mark.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jolene walked off leaving Robbie to meet more people on his own. Looking around, he sees several groups of various sized people. A group of people ranging from normal weight to around Taylor\u2019s weight were gathered around the buffet table loading up plates. In front of the TV was the group that Jolene had told him about. The woman, who he guessed was Susan, and one of the guys was around his size but the other two had to be at least Mark\u2019s weight and were being fed by them. Out on the patio, several grills were going with a dozen people milling about, drinks in hand, including Mark. Turning around, Taylor is still chatting with August and Juan and Hernandez have joined them. Feeling like a fool standing there by himself, he works up his nerves and goes to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one\u2019s back there so he goes into one of the bedrooms to just sit and take in everything going on. He\u2019d been through a lot over the past few months. Far more than he\u2019d been through in staying in shape during his films.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flopping back on the bed, he waited for his gut to stop its wobble while he stared at the ceiling.<br>\r\nIn the past four months, he\u2019d put on 55 pounds. His gut was full-fledged at this point, sagging over his waistband and showing through even his loosest shirts. His arms had thickened, losing some, but thankfully not all, of the tone he\u2019d always been proud of. His legs had not really gotten much of the weight gain though his ass had made it harder getting on clothes as they snagged on it as he pulled them up. He\u2019d even noticed that his formerly sharp jawline had smoothed out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And now he was at a party of people who not just liked the new him far more than he thought others might, and far more than he was sure he liked, but would like him even more if he was even bigger. Italia hadn\u2019t seen him yet. She\u2019d called last night and the filming was starting to wrap up but would still be another couple months. There would be no telling how she\u2019d react to his current gains, much less more extreme gains.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\u2019d also noticed recently that he was getting much more tired doing simple things recently like taking Robert to the park. It was definitely nice to not have to worry about what or how much he was eating or watching his weight for a role but his body was taking a toll. Malcolm had been receptive to his worries and declared that he\u2019d go with healthier recipes from now on. Taylor had not been as receptive, threatening to make him pay full price for his alterations if he stopped.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRobbie dear. Why are you hiding back here?\u201d Margie stood in the doorway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, um, sorry. I just needed a break. Am I not supposed to be back here?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I could see you trying not to panic since you arrived. I know you\u2019re new to all this, so if you need someone to talk to, maybe a stranger can help?\u201d She sat down on the bed next to him as he propped himself up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just when I started gaining, I did so because I just wanted to relax and enjoy myself. I didn\u2019t mind Malcolm pushing me, though to be honest, I more went along with his pushing because I didn\u2019t understand what he wanted and he\u2019s a good guy so I figured he wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt me. Then Taylor came in and he just started pushing me as hard as he could in exchange for discounts on my clothes alterations he\u2019s doing. And when I broke my foot, they started fighting, trying to get me to eat more or at least eat higher calories even though they promised they\u2019d back off some till after this party. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t stop them either. When Kevin came in as my trainer, I immediately put him in his place when he started trying to shame me for getting fat. I like the friendship I have with Malcolm and Taylor, but I started this without talking to my wife and how fit we were was one of the things that connected us in the first place. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing anymore and everything\u2019s happening so. I\u2019ve gained 55 pounds in four months for crying out loud! Why would anyone WANT to do that to themselves?\u201d He dropped his head into his hands.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margie rubbed his back slowly. \u201cDifferent people have different interests and some think that being bigger means more power or confidence, so they don\u2019t really care how fast they get bigger, or by what means, as long as they get bigger. Others just do it because they like being fat. I know, I know, I don\u2019t get that one myself,\u201d she raised her hands as Robbie\u2019s head shot up in surprise, \u201cI personally just like helping people connect and fulfill their goals, whatever those may be. But they have to be their own goals, not someone else\u2019s. If you don\u2019t want this, you need to let Malcolm and Taylor know that, and if Taylor gives you a hard time, do like you did with your trainer and put him in his place. It\u2019s your body, not his. As for your wife, that one will be up to you to deal with. If she really loves you, then she won\u2019t have a problem with whatever you look like or want to do and if she does, you can give me a call anytime, day or night. Just know that whatever you decide to do, you\u2019re always welcome here.\u201d She pulled a small pocket notebook out of her back pocket and wrote down her name and number. \u201cNow, why don\u2019t you come out and meet some of the others? Susan, Lucas and Brent have been looking forward to meeting you since they found out a newcomer was here.\u201d She got up and left, leaving him alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was odd. He\u2019d always been admired for his body and his to a much lesser degree, his acting, but he\u2019d never really felt accepted. Not like he did here by most of the people. Maybe, just maybe, even if he returned to his former state, this wouldn\u2019t be such a bad experience. He\u2019d have to have a serious talk with Italia, but for the first time since he started this wild ride, he was certain he at least wanted to see where it went.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robbie was introduced to Tristan and Yang, Lucas and Susan as Tristan and Susan fed their respective spouses. Jolene, seeing him having a little trouble getting away from Susan\u2019s rather intimate explanation of the joys of feeding, rescued him and introduced him to Andy, Martha, Dorothy, Ashley, and Ben at the buffet table. Andy and Dorothy were married but were both feeders, not wanting to gain themselves so they came to these parties to help feed others, while Martha\u2019s husband Patrick was at work. Ben and Ashley had just entered a relationship as well but were still trying to figure out how it would work between them. Robbie was going to go out on the patio with Mark and the others but Jolene and Margie both blocked him. He wasn\u2019t ready to go out there with the big boys who were eating steaks, hot dogs, burgers and brats by the platter full, often without chewing as they raced each other to eat more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The party finally wound down that around ten that night. Robbie\u2019s nervousness, as well as his appetite, disappeared throughout the night with some minor encouragement from Tristan to join them watching American Ninja Warrior reruns. Although he didn\u2019t even get to stuffed, much less the usual bloated under Taylor and Malcolm\u2019s guidance, he still had more than his fill throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margie had given him a bit to think about so after that night, he gave Malcolm and Taylor the next few days off. With the time by himself with only Robert to keep him company, and Kevin\u2019s few sessions each week, it allowed him to fully appraise the changes he had made. Every time he passed a mirror, he stopped to jiggle his gut and feel his slight moobs. He made his own meals and despite trying to decrease the size of the meals, he still made more than he could eat by himself. Every day started with his stomach grumbling and his leftovers disappearing and ended with him dazed and stuffed even as he tried to resist. By the time the guys returned, Robbie had made up his mind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been eating healthily.\u201d Taylor grinned as he poked at Robbie\u2019s shirt that was slightly stretched over his gut where it hadn\u2019t been even a two weeks ago when Taylor had altered it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. I tried to cut back, but I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t seem that upset about it.\u201d Malcolm placed the groceries on the table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it and I\u2019m really not. I kind of enjoyed the feeling of my gut bouncing some. And I\u2019m going to talk to Italia before this becomes an ongoing thing, but regardless, there are going to few changes. One, I will not be gaining as fast as you guys have been pushing me to. Malcolm, you\u2019re going to make smaller, multiple meals so I\u2019m not just stuffing myself once until I can\u2019t move. Leaving snacks around is fine as long as they are somewhat healthy. Things like plain nuts or trail mix is fine but nothing like platters of cookies. Taylor, you can push me some but you must stop when I say or you\u2019ll be losing yourself a client. No more stuffing me until you have to put Robert to bed because I can\u2019t get up for several more hours. You can cancel my discount if you want, but that will not change my mind. I\u2019m not gaining anymore for either of you. I\u2019m gaining as much as I feel comfortable gaining for myself from now on and if you have a problem with that, then you can leave.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie heaved several breathes out as he waited for their reactions. Malcolm and Taylor glanced at each other before Taylor shrugged.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019d think we\u2019d have a problem with this. It\u2019s your body. It was you that wasn\u2019t stopping us.\u201d Taylor turned and headed up the stairs to continue altering Robbie\u2019s clothes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie gazed open mouthed after him. \u201cOkay. That went better than I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTaylor can be pushy, especially when helping others gain, but he\u2019s not a monster. You just have to set limits.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThose limits were set when Italia was here. You were the one that let them up. If they go back up, well, no skin off my back.\u201d He shrugged and slammed his knife down, separating the crown of the broccoli from the stalk.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay.

How\u2019s the movie going?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s done actually. At least for me. They filmed my last scenes a couple days ago. The others are wrapping up their scenes over the next few weeks but they didn\u2019t need me anymore so I caught an early flight. I\u2019m about to hail a cab now and it should be about an hour before I get home. Would you tell Malcolm to have something ready when I get there? I\u2019m starving!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo problem honey. But there are some things I should let you know about before you get here.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan it wait Robbie? I\u2019m rather tired.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm, no I think I should prepare for this first. You see, I\u2019ve sort of let myself go and have gained some weight since you\u2019ve been gone these months.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRobbie, can we please talk about this when I get home? If you\u2019ve put on some weight, fine, just get a trainer. I\u2019ll talk more when I get there.\u201d The line went dead.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I\u2019m dead.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh? Everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. And you might want to make a larger serving. That was Italia and she\u2019ll be home soon and is hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAh. Gotcha. I hope you don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m not here when she gets home then? I don\u2019t want to risk being collateral damage if things go wrong. And I\u2019ll warn Taylor too so he can get his stuff packed up.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll warn Taylor. You focus on getting that food ready so Italia won\u2019t have an extra reason to target you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSounds good, but just so you know, Taylor will likely want to stay. I think he views you as his personal project right now and he can get really territorial.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d Robbie headed upstairs, Robert still swinging his rattle around in his arms. \u201cHey, Taylor, you might want to call it a day.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? I just got unpacked and your clothes are still in need of being let out after weeks off!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI just got off the phone with Italia. She\u2019s on her way home and I don\u2019t want you getting caught in her crosshairs if anything goes wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor straightened up, his brow furrowing. All the light in the room seemed to fade into the corners. \u201cAnd just what would she do? You just put me in my place about it being your body, not mine. Are you going to let her control you? As for me, I\u2019m just altering your clothes. If she targets me for ANYTHING, she has another thing coming!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTaylor! No you will not! Because you won\u2019t be here! Pack up for the day! I\u2019ll give you a call when you can come back, AND YOU WILL COME BACK, but you\u2019re not to be here when she gets here or you WON\u2019T be coming back! Malcolm is trying to finish the meals for the day in the next hour so have all your stuff in his car before then! Do I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The light seemed to return to most of the room but Taylor\u2019s face remained dark as he started throwing his gear back into his cases.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie headed back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNeed any help?\u201d He asked as he placed Robert in his play pen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot really. Almost done as it is. Is Taylor leaving or did he back you into a corner?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe didn\u2019t get the chance. He either goes with you or he doesn\u2019t come back.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Malcolm\u2019s eyebrow rose above his glasses. \u201cWell, that will probably bite you in the ass, but then again, maybe not. It will depend on how it goes with Italia.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The timer dinged. Malcolm grabbed an oven mitt and pulled out an extra-large quiche.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay. Your food is ready. I put some hamburger patties in the fridge for you to cook later as well as a fruit salad. Thank God I didn\u2019t go for something like fettucine Alfredo. I might be unemployed if I\u2019d made that.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let her fire you. We\u2019re equal in this relationship. You\u2019ll still have a job here, even if she hates you. Though if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll put in a good word with some of the local restaurants to get you a good job.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks Robbie, I mean Mr. Amell. I\u2019m going to have to get used to that again. Miss Italia was always very strict about that.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll try to talk to her about that too, but probably not right now. Now, you better get going. She\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou ready Taylor?\u201d Malcolm shouted upstairs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m coming. I still think we should stay.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou ever watch those documentaries about injured or cornered animals?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taylor raised an eyebrow and snarled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLike that, yeah, except she\u2019s the cornered animal and she will fight to the death if she feels cornered. This is better handled by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue. She\u2019s your wife. You know her, I don\u2019t.\u201d He dragged his sewing kit out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019ll calm down. Give us a call when it\u2019s safe to return.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will. Sorry this had to happen right when you got back to work.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot your fault. See you later.\u201d Malcolm joined Taylor in the car and drove off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie joined Robert back in the kitchen. The sweet smell of the fruit filled the air even over the smell of the freshly baked quiche. While waiting for Italia to arrive, he went around cleaning up the messes that Malcolm hadn\u2019t been able to clean. He\u2019d barely gotten the center island cleaned when the front door opened.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRobbie! I\u2019m home!\u201d He heard Italia yell from the entryway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He drew in a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re in the kitchen!\u201d He called back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGreat! I hope Malcolm made something good! I\u2019m starving and right now I really don\u2019t care\u2026.\u201d Her jaw dropped as she entered the kitchen and saw Robbie\u2019s new build. \u201cRobbie, honey, I know you said you\u2019d gained some weight, but your fat!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know. I tried to tell you on the phone but you hung up on me.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou gained all that weight in the time I was gone?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia barely talked to Robbie for the next few weeks. Every time she looked at him, her eyes were hard. So Robbie took the opportunity to try to get her to enjoy his new build as much as he had before she got home. It didn\u2019t go smoothly in the bedroom as she rolled away every time he tried to snuggle. At meals, she would try to send Malcolm away whenever he tried to give Robbie a second helping only for Robbie to take it right there anyways. She even tried to take Robert to her mother\u2019s to force him to lose weight which she quickly lost the battle when Robert cried incessantly for two days for him. Kevin was also torn between follow Italia\u2019s orders to increase his workouts, which he agreed with wholeheartedly, and keeping the things the same as Robbie was demanding on threat of cancelling his gym membership and bad reviews for not helping the client on their goals so Robbie cut him a tiny bit of slack and agreed to increase resistance training by one session a week.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was that compromise that led to Italia lightening up. With the increased calories and workout, Robbie\u2019s gut firmed up a bit around the top and sides, an inch of flab still hanging on the bottom, but the rest of his muscles also increased. His former definition hadn\u2019t come back and Italia still wouldn\u2019t touch him, but with his shifting from flabby fat guy to the start of a power lifter build, conversation started back up. Mostly she still wanted him to lose, to go back to the way things were but he let her know that boat had sailed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After being home almost two months, Robbie\u2019s weight had stabilized at 250 pounds. After being at that weight for a week, Robbie could tell Italia thought she was winning the battle with his bulge. With the arguing that had gone one since she\u2019d gotten home, he hadn\u2019t had a chance to cook her anything with his new skills. Tired of looking at him again, she took Robert to the mall for the day to hang out with her girlfriends, gossip and complain about her new fat and lazy husband. He took the chance to cook up all her favorites, only having Malcolm help with the prep then leave. Their neighbor was even going to take Robert for the evening to have a play date with their kids so he could make it a real date.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Italia arrived home that night, Robbie had rose petals spread all over the floor creating a path through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">\u201cFollow the petals.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Candles lit the house and illuminated a black backless dress with a diamond sash around the waist and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">\u201cLeave Robert in the crib and feel free to spruce up however you feel. Follow the petals down to your special evening. Everything has been arranged tonight!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting dressed, she did as was told and left Robert in his crib. The rose petals leading to the back stairs changed from red to white to guide her down to a rose, lily, and lilac filled dining room. The only lights came from the dozens of candles scattered around. The dining room table had been removed in place of table for two with candelabras. A cart was parked next to the table loaded with all of Italia\u2019s favorite dishes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour seat Mademoiselle?\u201d Robbie pulled out a chair for her. Even through the distaste she had shown him the past few weeks, she had to take a second glance at the tux that was tailored to show off his new size. In the candle light, his gut may have looked slightly larger, but his arms and shoulders looked firmer than ever and his slicked back hair slimmed his face a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not sure what to say, Italia settled into the chair which he gently slid under her as she sat down. Evening when they were dating, he hadn\u2019t done anything like this. She had no clue how to react but for the first time since getting home, she didn\u2019t care about his looks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFor the first course, we have a refreshing summer strawberry salad.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMalcolm must have taken all day preparing all this.\u201d Italia stated as he placed a helping of the salad on the small top plates.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt did, but it wasn\u2019t Malcolm. He only helped prep. I did all the cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia gaped at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could cook.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was supposed to be a surprise for you when you got home but you took one look at me and never gave me a chance to really explain anything. To be honest, if it weren\u2019t for learning to cook, I wouldn\u2019t have gained any weight, but I wanted to do something special for you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia looked down at the strawberry she had started pushing around on her plate as he spoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI get it. We\u2019re both used to being around really fit people. We likely never would have even met had we not both had our looks, but frankly, this time off has made me enjoy raising Robert. I\u2019ve barely even cared about not working since we have plenty of money and even if I keep the weight, I\u2019d rather that to take better care of our son then go back to work, being miserable in the process, and missing our son growing up, or worse, both of us being to busy to raise him or see any of his big moments.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He waited for her to say something.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She finally said. \u201cOur son comes first. And we should be here for him. I don\u2019t like or agree with your weight gain but it is up to you and as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with raising him properly, I won\u2019t stop you from stopping acting or push you to lose, but I will insist you don\u2019t gain anymore. Work more with Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll continue working with Kevin, I decided that months ago, but I\u2019m not going to actively work to lose. If I lose, I lose. If I gain, I gain. And think of it this way, if I\u2019m not worried about my weight, I can cook meals like this whenever you want. You don\u2019t have indulge, just try to understand that I do. And give me a chance tonight. You might find I\u2019m all the better at snuggling!\u201d He winked at her, eliciting a blush in spite of her reluctance. \u201cSo will you do me that favor? Just give me a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia took another bite of her salad. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll give this a shot. For Robert!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robert grinned. \u201cAre you ready for the second course? There are five total. Don\u2019t worry. They\u2019re all your favorites made just the way you like, so other than the chocolate cannolis for dessert, they aren\u2019t heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned again as he scooped several scallops with sauce onto a small sauce plate, switching it out with her salad plate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid you really make all this?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. All of it. Malcolm only helped prep everything.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The appetizer and soup went by silently, only some soft instrumental music playing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go check on Robert?\u201d Italia asked as Robbie slid a wooden plank covered with rice pilaf and a salmon steak in front of her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s next door. I asked Nathan and Laura to watch him tonight. I had them come get him about half an hour after you got home. They\u2019ll bring him back in the morning. I wanted tonight to just be the two of us so we could really talk things over. Sorry. I should have told you that sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, you should have.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They chatted about different things from Taylor\u2019s alterations to the parties that Robbie still wanted to go to if for no other reason than his new friends to everything Italia did for the new movie. Dessert came about with only a couple of cannolis for Italia and ten for him. Italia didn\u2019t try to hide her disapproval but didn\u2019t say anything. With everything gone, Robbie loaded all the dishes onto the cart and pushed it back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, Madam, the night is not over.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He held out his hand to help her up. He led her down a path of pink rose petals to the back yard where a gazebo had been set up over the patio with an orchestra to the side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"May I have this dance?\" Robbie held out his hand.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heading into the middle, the orchestra played a waltz. Soft strobe lights shone onto a temporary chandelier. With the first dance done, a more upbeat tango started.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia hesitated. \"Are you up for this?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine.\" He pulled her close and moved into a tango far to graceful for someone his size. \"I may have gotten fat, but I haven't let myself go.\" He informed her as she went into a dip. The orchestra played as the couple danced the night away. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shortly before midnight, the orchestra packed up their strings but it wasn't for another hour that the dancers finally finished. Even with her former reluctance, the night ended with heavy breathing for both of the couple and a new admiration for Robbie's new heft.</span></div></div>",

She rolled over as he got up. It was the first night since she\u2019d got back that were actually together and not just sleeping in the same bed. He froze. She moaned in her sleep but didn\u2019t wake up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting dressed, he headed to the kitchen to whip up some buckwheat pancakes. He never cared for the taste, even less so since he stopped monitoring what he ate, but this wasn\u2019t for him. Pancakes made, fresh bananas sliced on them, a fruit and yogurt parfait layered in a tall cup to show off its layers, a couple slices of turkey bacon cooked just short of becoming crispy, orange juice poured, small decanter of syrup and vial of sunflowers on a tray, he carried it up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He waited until he heard her shut off her alarm, then knocked gently and pushed the door open.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBreakfast!\u201d he whispered loudly. Placing the tray on the stand beside the bed, he pulled open the curtains some to let in the early morning light.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s this? I thought the date was last night?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWho said it had to be over? Or that you can\u2019t have two back to back?\u201d He gave her a peck on the cheek and moved the tray across her lap.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have to admit, I\u2019m surprised how good you are at cooking. Everything last night was delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d He winked at her eliciting a blush.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2026\u201d she monitored her words carefully, \u201cwas surprising as well.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still the same me you knew and fell in love with several years ago, there\u2019s just more to love.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd I could tell that last night. You didn\u2019t have any trouble moving around. In fact, that was the best you\u2019ve ever done, and that\u2019s saying something!\u201d It was Robbie\u2019s turn to blush.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo is everything fine? You don\u2019t have to brag about my weight or anything, but can we at least agree this isn\u2019t something to tear ourselves apart over?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took a bite of the pancake. \u201cHmmm! It practically melts!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie took the fork from her and held a piece up for her. She hesitated then took the bite. \u201cI guess not. It\u2019ll take some getting used to, but if you promise not to overboard on the rich dishes, than I guess I can take it.\u201d She accepted another bite of pancakes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to monitor what I make so it\u2019s not any harder for you to keep your figure. I\u2019m going to make meals I enjoy too, but I\u2019ll keep those for when you\u2019re not home. That a good compromise?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay. Where\u2019d you learn to cook anyways? Did Malcolm teach you?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIn part. He helped supplement the cooking classes I started taking several months ago.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They continued chatting as he fed her the rest of her meal. On occasion Robbie would nuzzle Italia\u2019s neck, getting some giggles from her. They ended up in bed until noon when Robbie got up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to get dressed. I\u2019m supposed to pick up Robert at 1.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have any more surprises planned?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe. But you\u2019ll have to wait and see. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He left to get Robert while she got up. Although he didn\u2019t have anything planned for that night, he did his best to make an enjoyable dinner for the three of them. Italia got a kick out him wearing most of Robert\u2019s mac and cheese.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Watching a movie that night, Italia opted to sit next to him, allowing him to wrap his arm around her. It was like they were dating all over again. Maybe this was a new start to their relationship?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the families from the daycare they sometimes frequented were invited as well as Laura and Nathan, some other neighbors with kids, Stephen\u2019s family and Taylor. Italia wanted to object to Taylor\u2019s being there, not knowing him that well, but all her arguments fell flat as Robert loved him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Party packs were put together with streamers and blowers for the adults and toys for the kids. Robbie made a marble cake and a second smaller vanilla cake for those with food allergies, both which were decorated by Malcolm. Veggie platers, cheese and cracker trays, and cookie plates were lined on a table for everyone. A separate table was set up for Robert\u2019s presents to be put on. Streamers were draped around the entryway through to the backyard patio. Uninflated balloons and a helium tank sat near a pile of kid\u2019s games.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everything was set up an hour before the first guest was set to arrive. Except Italia who was pacing in their bedroom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie gently knocked. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She kept pacing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, honey, talk to me. Everything\u2019s all set. It\u2019s going to be fine and even if things don\u2019t, well it\u2019s only Robert\u2019s first birthday. It\u2019s not like he\u2019ll remember it.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia stopped, glaring at him. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m worried about the party? I couldn\u2019t care less about that! But this is the first time anyone\u2019s seen us together since this,\u201d she gestured at his gut, \u201cI\u2019ve told some friends but no one actually believed me! They are never going to let this go! I mean, has your cousin even seen you?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo. And frankly, I don\u2019t care what others say at this point and I\u2019m surprised you are either. We\u2019ve talked about this and this is my choice as long as I can still take care of Robert.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t care? These are our friends and family you\u2019re talking about! How can you not care?!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cItalia, if things start going rough, just let me know. Trust me, when Taylor first started fixing my clothes, he was really pushing me to actively gain and actually tried to strong arm me into gaining weight and Kevin also tried to shame me into becoming a fitness addict again, but frankly, I\u2019m actually rather happy with who I am now, and like with those two, if anyone tries to give either of us a hard time, I\u2019ll shut them down. It\u2019s none of their business anyways. I won\u2019t let them attack you over my choices. Okay?\u201d She tried to look away but he gently used a finger to direct her gaze back to him. \u201cOkay?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s get downstairs before\u2026\u201d The doorbell rang. \u201cExactly that happens.\u201d He chuckled, leading her out of the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, Cous. Sorry we\u2019re earllll\u2026.. What the hell happened to you?!\u201d Stephen gawked at Robbie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, this? I\u2019ve just taken a break and maybe indulged myself some.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA little? Dude! You\u2019re a butterball!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEh. I\u2019m also loving spending time with my son and not having to monitor every calorie I eat or slaving away in the gym.\u201d Robbie headed back inside leaving Stephen and his wife and daughter to follow behind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie saw Stephen start to whisper something to Italia. As quietly as he could, he snuck around behind the group. Italia spotted him as he got behind them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe presents go over there.\u201d She stated, ending the whispered conversation.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stephen took the present from his daughter and placed it on the empty table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More people arrived, trickling in a few here and there until most of the people had shown up. The younger toddlers were placed in a play pen while some of the older kids went out to the butterfly tent. Taylor was one of the last to arrive but he had brought a plus one, Margie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie\u2019s grin turned into a grimace. Italia and a couple neighbors had met Taylor but even Italia had only heard about the growth parties. No one else had met one. They were about to. At least it was Margie, the kindest person he knew.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia greeted them before Robbie could get over, accepting Margie\u2019s gift. He couldn\u2019t hear what was said, but he was relieved when she pointed to him and Italia glanced over a smile on her face, though being an actress, he didn\u2019t know if it was real.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe seems nice.\u201d Italia commented as she put the newest presents on the table. \u201cWhere\u2019d you meet her? I haven\u2019t seen her before.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s from those parties I told you about. But I had no idea she was coming. She\u2019s never even met Robert.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what she told me too. If you\u2019re having an affair, just tell me now because if not, you two have a stupid cover story.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not having an affair! She\u2019s just a friend!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia raised an eyebrow. She left to mingle with the guests.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie kept an eye on Italia as she conversed with her friends. A few times she sent a panicked look over his way but always sent him away before he could get there.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After half an hour, Malcolm called everyone together for the cake. Robert giggled as everyone sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d though it was Robbie who blew out the single candle to the crowd\u2019s cheers. Slices of cake were handed out and eaten as Italia unwrapped Robert\u2019s gifts. Most were actually for her and Robbie and the ones actually for Robert were opened and handed to him. He loved most the toys though a stegosaurus plushy had him screaming when Italia squeaked it when giving it to him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Presents unwrapped, cakes eaten, and balloons all blown up, the party gradually died down. Robbie was surprised to see Italia once again chatting with Margie, the two of them laughing at something.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, can we talk?\u201d Stephen asked through his teeth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf it\u2019s about my weight and everything, no. I know you won\u2019t understand, but I\u2019m actually happy. I still have a trainer  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019m working with, but I\u2019m not planning on restricting myself either. Look Stephen, I\u2019m not asking or looking for your approval, but I am asking that you back off for now. You see me having trouble walking ten feet or if I get diabetes and you see me continually shoving in candy bars or if Robert starts getting neglected, then you can butt in and stop me, but until then, butt out.\u201d Robbie left Stephen standing there.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell?\u201d Robbie asked when everyone finally left with the exceptions of Malcolm, Taylor and Margie who started straightening up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell what?\u201d Italia asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid anyone give you a hard time over my weight?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonestly, a lot of people are really upset and worried about you. I didn\u2019t really know how to handle it, but I\u2019ll likely hear more later, otherwise, most people dropped it when the subject was changed. Or when that friend of yours butted in. She was really nice and often was really good at redirecting the conversations. I know you want to spend more time raising Robert, but I asked if she\u2019d look after him if you ever wanted a break. I mean, you seem to know and trust her.\u201d She raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI do trust her. It was her that helped me actually get comfy with who I am now. I wouldn\u2019t mind her watching Robert on occasion. Who knows, maybe that means more alone time for us?\u201d Wrapping his arms around her waist.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHave your alone time when alone!\u201d Taylor chuckled as he loaded wrapping paper into a trash bag.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Italia chuckled. \u201cI think we may need to take her up on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pulled on his shirt again but all it did was cause the buttons to strain a little more over his gut. In the couple months since Robert\u2019s birthday, he\u2019d put on another 15 pounds and an inch to his waist and it showed in the tightness of his clothes. Unfortunately, Malcolm and Taylor had to go out of town for Taylor\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding for a month so Robbie\u2019s clothes had not grown with him like usual.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d Italia slowly modeled her way down the stairs, her black, ankle length dress flowing around her legs as she descended.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI used to have that figure.\u201d Margie fluffed her own curly hair.

We\u2019re going!\u201d Robbie guided Italia to their BMW, arm around her waist.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cooking studio was packed that night as everyone in the class had brought a friend or their family in order to try their specialty dishes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you for joining us in this final class!\u201d The instructor called from his table in front of everyone. \u201cTonight is a special night as the chefs here will not be assigned a dish and have instead chosen a dish of their own to make. This dish will consist of a main course and two sides. Two hours will be provided to make everyone who was invited a meal. They selected their meals last week and the ingredients have been provided for the proper number of people. There will only be one chance to get this right, people, so don\u2019t mess up! Time begins now!\u201d A clock on the wall started counting down. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several kids pulled out games, a few adults pulled out books. One lady with an infant stepped out. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the chefs started preparing their dishes. Robbie filled several pots of water and placed them on high heat, threw some wild rice with some chicken bouillon and herbs in to cook, grabbed some potatoes and peeled them. With the sides now cooking, he prepared the lobster, getting it ready to boil.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once the potatoes were ready to mash, he placed the lobsters in the final pot to boil. As the main dish was prepping, he mashed the potatoes, adding plenty of butter, salt, cheese, herbs and scallions. He sampled the rice, adding more herbs to season it. The potatoes ready, he placed them under heating lamp on the spare station behind him and Angelina. The rice and lobsters finished at the same time. Slicing open the lobsters, he squeezed fresh lemons on it and melted some butter over some herbs to dip the meat in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Plating everything, he signaled for the instructor to come check.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d He took a sample of everything, just enough to taste but not enough to mess with the display. \u201cThe rice and potatoes are perfectly balanced and seasoned though the lobster is on the verge of being overcooked. You pulled it out just in time but the meat is just a tiny bit rubbery already. A minute longer and I would not have passed this. Your wife is the final judge, not me, so your passing is up to her. Enjoy.\u201d He waved Robbie off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie pulled both plates onto a tray which he single handedly carried over to the table where Italia was waiting.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt looks delicious.\u201d She stated as he set one of the plates in front of her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd although it\u2019s not the most romantic date,\u201d Robbie reached under the warming table to pull out a small vase with a single purple and white orchid in it. The vase was placed in the center of the table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two ate in relative silence so Italia could focus on appraising the food.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she finished her meal, Italia took out a check list the instructor had provide for each friend or family member could use to judge the food. There were several sections she filled out before calling the instructor over. Most of the people in the class were already finished so he finished with the current student and came over.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d He read over her sheet. \u201cLobster was adequate. Seasoning was made up for the slight chewiness. A few grains of rice were undercooked but only a small number. The potatoes were to rich but were otherwise good. Overall rating, 8 out of 10.\u201d He placed the sheet on the table. \u201cLobster is a difficult dish to properly cook as is wild rice, so it not being perfect is no surprise but overall, you have done very well and I hereby award you with this certificate of completion and an invitation to attend a more advanced cooking class if you\u2019d like, which I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll actually need, but there is a spot if you\u2019d like it.\u201d He placed a sheet on the table with a second small slip attached and walked off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was afraid it was possibly overcooked. Did you enjoy it?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was great.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJust great? You don\u2019t sound very enthusiastic.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, no. It was delicious. It\u2019s just a little bit much. And the potatoes were\u2026\u201d She hissed through her teeth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know. I thought that would be a bit much, but once in while won\u2019t hurt. I\u2019m not planning on making a habit of dinners like that. This is a special occasion, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll right. Now we should get home. I have to get up tomorrow. Michael has an audition lined up for tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like carbs before big filming or auditions. I\u2019m sorry. But other than that, did you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded. \"You passes, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robbie collected his awards and headed out behind, sighing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robbie got to the party a little late. He\u2019d had a sheet cake in the oven that he had to wait to cool to put the frosting on. Knocking, he let himself in, the cake barely balanced on one arm.<br>\r\n\u201cYou made it! I was beginning to wonder!\u201d Margie clapped as he brought the cake to an open area on the dessert table.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Cake came out of the oven later than I wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you made it. That\u2019s what matters. I\u2019ll go grab a knife for that cake.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Margie.\u201d He glanced around at the party goers. Lucas and Tristan were in their usual spots on the couch. With the weather growing colder, Mark and his gang had taken over the kitchen a couple weeks back but even with the massive muscles and boulder guts, not a single man there stood in Margie\u2019s way, with or without a knife in her hand. Taylor and the buffet group, as Robbie had dubbed them, were in the back room, probably playing poker. Several people were gathered around the buffet table but one in particular caught his eye.<br>\r\nAt the end of the table, Andy was pointing out various people to a short guy that was almost as wide as he was tall. He wasn\u2019t fat wide like Lucas or Tristan, no, he had muscles that rivaled Mark\u2019s but without the gut on him. The guy\u2019s hair was slightly spiked to match his chiseled facial features. The chilled temps outside didn\u2019t seem to faze this guy if his shorts and tank top were any indication. His green eyes carefully observed everyone that Andy pointed out to him.<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the new guy?\u201d Robbie asked as Margie returned and started cutting the cake.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, him? A friend of Andy\u2019s I guess. I haven\u2019t had a chance to meet him yet but they arrived together. Here you go.\u201d She handed Robbie the first slice of the cake.<br>\r\nMargie plated a second piece for him to take over. He hadn\u2019t really gotten to know Andy that well over the weeks, he didn\u2019t seem to be a very talkative guy, but he knew that he always enjoyed watching others eat though he himself only ate small portions, liking to keep his runner\u2019s build.<br>\r\n\u201cYou want a slice?\u201d Robbie held out a slice of the cake to the bodybuilder.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Looks good. I haven\u2019t eaten real food in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just did a competition. Had to cut. Now that that\u2019s over, I\u2019m back. Wow. This is some great cake. You make this yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Thanks. I\u2019m Robbie.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you from Martha. You\u2019re smaller than she described.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, um\u2026\u201d Robbie glanced down at his newly fitted long sleeve shirt. It was the first of his winter shirts Taylor had prepped for him. It had been lengthened several inches so his gut was warm and covered once again.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry about it. Everyone here is different. I\u2019m Osmond.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou want another slice?\u201d Robbie gestured at Osmond\u2019s empty plate.<br>\r\n\u201cNah. I don\u2019t like to dirty bulk. Why don\u2019t I get you another slice instead?\u201d He grabbed Robbie\u2019s plate and topped it with a slice that filled most of the plate before Robbie could stop him. \u201cHere you go.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks. I wasn\u2019t planning on having another slice right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I get overeager at these parties sometimes, trying to eat vicariously. Hope I don\u2019t upset you if I sometimes push food on you. It just means I really want some more myself.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThat, and it means I think you have a good starter build.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLeave him alone Osmond. He\u2019s not a serious gainer.\u201d Andy scowled.<br>\r\n\u201cI know that Andy. Sheesh. Why are you such a party pooper?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you aren\u2019t in the kitchen with the other big guys.\u201d Robbie started on his second slice of cake.<br>\r\n\u201cThose meatheads? Don\u2019t make me laugh. They just flex and gut bump. I like to talk to people and those gorillas aren\u2019t good for conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFunny to hear you of all people call others \u201cmeathead\u201d. How big are you anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, just because I like being big doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all I\u2019m about. As for size,\u201d he started flexing as he rattled off his measurements. Robbie\u2019s eyes widened as he flexed his bowling ball biceps, bounced his pecs that rivaled Robbie\u2019s own moobs, and shook thighs that were only different in their firmness from his own.<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! You weigh as much as I do!\u201d Robbie whistled.<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? We weigh the same? You\u2019re right, DAMN! You look like you should outweigh me by a lot! Need to work on that! Mind if I get you another plate?\u201d He waited for Robbie to respond this time.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the offer, but like Andy said, I\u2019m not a serious gainer. I\u2019m just trying to enjoy what I eat, that\u2019s all, and if I continue putting on weight, fine, if I don\u2019t, also fine, but I really don\u2019t want to be pushed. I\u2019ve gone over this with Taylor, Malcolm, my wife and my personal trainer and I will send Margie over if you push me.\u201d<br>\r\nOsmond held up his hands. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ve seen Margie get upset, it\u2019s not pretty and I would not want her as an enemy. But honestly, you seem like a nice guy and I wouldn\u2019t mind getting a bite to eat with you sometimes. Nothing funny and no pressure!\u201d He added quickly as Robbie raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe. How long you been bodybuilder?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 12 years.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve definitely made progress! How\u2019d you do at your contest?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFourth. Would have been third but my abs are asymmetrical.\u201d He lifted up his shirt to reveal a six pack that would have put Robbie\u2019s own old abs to shame had the right side not been a half an ab higher than the left.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m 275 now and people were bigger than you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBigger? No. I was the biggest. They were just better conditioned. And it didn\u2019t help that I got stuck attempting some splits while on stage.\u201d<br>\r\nRobbie winced. \u201cWhat is it you do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an architect. What about you? I\u2019d heard you\u2019re taking some time off from acting?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTo raise my son. You have a family?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNah. Not yet. I have a girlfriend, but I doubt it\u2019s going to last much longer between us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat stinks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I met her at my nephew\u2019s baseball game, so not entirely surprised.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would that be a sign it wouldn\u2019t work out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe was the opposing team\u2019s assistant coach.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat grade is your nephew in?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFreshman in high school.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep. She understood the fitness aspect of bodybuilding, which is where we started talking, but when it came to the competition and just getting as big as possible, that\u2019s where she\u2019s been ragging on me non-stop for the past couple weeks. The contest\u2019s over but she wants me to cut back a little and that is not happening.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cItalia still wants me to cut back too. She didn\u2019t like that I was around 225 when she got home from her latest movie. She seemed to have been getting used to my new weight even though I\u2019ve gotten bigger since then, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBeing bigger isn\u2019t for everyone. I\u2019ve tried to pick up women at clubs, the library, even gyms, who said I was gross because of how big I am.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting looks like that when I go out recently too. It makes me self-conscious.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t. That build really suits you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your self-consciousness. From what Taylor said, you\u2019ve gained, what, a hundred pounds this year? I have stretch marks that people point out sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have stretch marks?\u201d<br>\r\nOsmond pulled the armhole of his tank top down to reveal several stretch marks going from his chest up to the top of his shoulders and turned his arm to show a couple more going part way down his arm. \u201cAll growth has its costs. I\u2019m still trying to get a pro card, but it\u2019s tough. Some of the pros are much bigger giving them an advantage but some of the smaller guys are better conditioned. I\u2019m still trying to find that magic middle ground. To a degree, I envy guys like you that don\u2019t have that pressure of working to get size and prestige.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Robbie scraped his fork over his plate.<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I wasn\u2019t implying you\u2019re working to grow, just that you don\u2019t have the pressure to grow like I do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the pressure, then why don\u2019t you just quit the competitions? Body build for fun or just gain. You\u2019re already here where everyone accepts you no matter your size or build, so why put yourself through the undo pressure?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cProbably same reason you did that as an actor. To get more attention. It\u2019s nice to relax and be around people you know accept you, but to garner the support of those who don\u2019t even know you, it just gives a rush you can\u2019t get elsewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess. Not exactly the same thing though. I don\u2019t get to engage with my viewers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Still similar. You know the feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTo a degree. I\u2019ve made lots of money from my career, so I guess I must have gotten some people\u2019s approval that I didn\u2019t know somewhere along the lines.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t all that or else I wouldn\u2019t be taking a break to raise my son instead of working hard to keep my physique and build my career more.\u201d<br>\r\nOsmond shrugged his shoulders slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s true too. If I had a family, I might do the same.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever dated anyone that did like your size or wanted you bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot even at your contests?\u201d<br>\r\nOsmond let out a deep breath. \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have any contests left?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot this year.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you do just need a change of venue then. You been to Hernando\u2019s buffet? Maybe you could meet someone there?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not big on buffets. Can\u2019t find enough healthy food.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs many have recently pushed me, maybe you just need to let yourself go some. And maybe I should MOSTLY take their advice myself.\u201d He grabbed their plates and placed another slice on them. \u201cSo how about it?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He really wished he could just let himself go but then he'd never get any more work. Walking through downtown, he passed the normal clothes stores, restaurants, and tourist traps. Every once in a while, some girls would recognize him and he'd sign a couple autographs with a forced smile, he just wanted to relax. Heading towards the edge of downtown, everything got smaller, dimmer, and quieter. He shivered as the night chilled. Pulling his coat up around his shoulders a little more, a dim light caught his eye from a nearby alley.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Past a couple trash cans was a tiny store. The neon lights of the sign made up symbols he didn't recognize. The door was wide open but nothing could be seen from outside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come in my good sir. There is no point in standing out in the cold. Come in and have some tea.\" A croaky man's voice encouraged from inside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No way. Like I'm going to go into some unknown store in a back alley in a random part of town. No effin way!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sir need to lighten up. To relax. I can help with that. Whatever you need or want I can help provide, guaranteed to work or your money back. Just come in to look, that is all I ask. I'll leave the door open so you always know where the exit is.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why am I listening to this creepy old man? He'll probably knock me out or something the moment I walk in. I should just walk away.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are right and I will not stop you from leaving if you want. But what do you have to lose?\" The man walked out of the shadows of his shop. A knotted cane was braced by a withered hand. Hairy warts covered his nose and chin. His back was hunched to the point of protruding above the bun that was his remaining hair. He didn't even come up to Tyler's elbow. \"I could not hurt you even if I tried. Just come inside and I can fulfill your desires to finally be able to relax and let go.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know a great many things. Come.\" He waved Tyler to follow him and headed back into his shop. Hesitating, Tyler followed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside, the store was as tiny as the outside looked. Only two shelves and a small table occupied the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You may select any one artifact. They will all grant your wish in a different way. And there is tea here which will also help to relax you. My store is open for another hour so take your time deciding.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler looked at the shelves. If he didn't know any better, he'd think this guy was pulling his leg.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On one of the shelves was an ornate lamp and a rock. The plaque said the lamp contained a djinn of gluttony and the rock was enchanted to fortify your desires and make them impossible to deny or ignore. The other shelf had a vial of liquid that would make you gain a small amount daily, making you less inclined for physical activity the longer it was in effect, and small doll that looked like him which said that if modified, would gradually alter the owner's build to match.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was no way they were real but there was an aura around each one that told him not to take them lightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do not forget there is tea here for you too if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks.

It doesn't seem that harmful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The rock of desire. A good choice. The longer you use it, the stronger it grows, but if you find the changes undesirable, the rock will adjust to those desires to match.'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man hobbled over to a cash register. He wound a crank on the side to open it up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That will be $62 please.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously? It's just a rock. I could get one off the ground anywhere!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not just any rock can grant you your desires. There are people who would pay far more than this then I am offering it to you for.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then why are you offering it to me for such a \"low price\"?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You need it more than you do. This shop doesn't appear to just anyone. No. You have to truly be unhappy with your life for it appear.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bullshit. I may not have a perfect life, but why would I be unhappy about it?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A good life doesn't mean a desired life. You are finally ready for the life you truly desire but just don't know how to get to that life or even what it would look like, so my store appeared with the items you need. You have made a wise decision to make the change slowly so you can adjust and can stop it safely when you have your life as you've wanted, even if it was a subconscious desire. Now, if you don't mind, it is almost closing time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler glanced at the rock still in his hand. $62 for a rock was definitely an outrageous price but he couldn't deny that he wasn't happy now. \"I'm guessing you don't have a refund policy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If by some chance the product does not live up to your expectations, tap it against a mirror. Just tap it. You don't want 7 years of bad luck for breaking the mirror after all. I will take it back at that point and you can either return to your old life, with refund, and all memories of this will disappear since you will never have been here, or you can exchange it for a different item from here, keeping the old changes and gaining new ones from the exchanged object, but I will only allow this once. After that, you are stuck with that object, so choose wisely as you'll only get one do over. Does that work for you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tap on a mirror?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sonny, you need to believe some. I've given you the return and exchange policy, so either you want to change or not. Which will it be?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler grumbled as he pulled out his wallet. He didn't know why he believed this man, but something about the man's claims felt true. He handed his credit card over to him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My apologies but we don't take plastic here. I'm sorry but I'm not that technologically inclined and I'm afraid I'd just get confused trying to learn now. You should have the cash in your wallet anyways.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't carry cash on... What the?\" His hand brushed several dollar bills as he put the card back in. Where there hadn't been any cash before, there was now three $20 bills and two ones. The exact amount needed which he handed to the old man.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you for your patronage Young Man. Please give the object a couple days to take full effect and at least a week to show any changes before you consider changing it out or returning it. Now, it is closing time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He ushered Tyler out of the store, shutting the door as he pushed him through it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's no need to man...han...dle...\" He turned to find he was standing in a plain alley with no signs of any door or shop anywhere. If the rock weren't still in his hand, he'd have thought he had dreamed the whole thing. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The old man said to give it a couple days to start working, might as well head home for the night.\" He slipped the rock into his pocket and headed back to where he parked his car. He was out the moment his head hit his pillow, still dressed in his clothes with only his jacket with the rock in its pocket thrown to the side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning, everything felt like a dream, the shop and rock faded from his mind, but already he had a growing craving to just...</span></div></div>",

Mr. Evans is already here Miss Johansson called to apologize but she can't make it.\" The attendant greeted, heading back to where Chris could already be seen towards the bar. Not many people were in the restaurant that night. A few groups were scattered around but Evans was mostly interested in a couple of girls at the bar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Glad you found us.\" Evans grinned as Hemsworth pulled out one of the bar stools and ordering a Coors. \"These two lovely ladies were just telling me how much they enjoy our movies.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The girls giggled but their smiles seemed off, almost as if they were painted on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of the girls came over, taking a sip of Hemsworth's drink before handing it to him for the bartender. He glanced over at Evans who shrugged, continuing on his own drink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where's everyone else? I was told Scarlett couldn't make it when I got here.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, most of them texted me earlier that they couldn't make it either leaving just you and me.

He waved the bartender over, placing an order for the biggest steak they had. Evans ordered the same. Even before their orders arrived they could both tell something was wrong and the steaks wouldn't be enough. Fighting off the urge to get more, they both left, barely having spoken since their food arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning...</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hemsworth awoke with a groan as light streamed in through his bedroom window and his eyes fought to open. Moving his head slowly to the side he gave a petulant grunt as the light hit his face and he instinctively turned away from it, pushing himself up and raising an arm as if it were enough to disintegrate the sun. Swinging his legs over the side of the bed, he rubbed his eyes with his fingers and frowned into his palms. He never forgot to close the blinds in his bedroom, but then yesterday was hardly a typical day. It was the wrap up day on his last film, or films, and he had spent the best part of half a year filming and countless hours before and during working on his physique. He had done some of his best work on those films and some of the suggestions he had pushed for had been adapted into his character, which made him proud - but then why was his mind pulled back to the events of last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly rising to his feet, Hemsworth ran a hand down his chin in thought as his eyes began to adjust to the light and he started to see more clearly. He was with the other Chris after everyone else bailed, they both ordered one of the biggest steaks on the menu and then they went home. Hemsworth grunted again, shaking his head as if to clear it or dislodge a memory. There was no way that that was right.  He vaguely remembered ordering the steak but he didn't really remember the menu or choosing it. It almost felt as though someone else had suggested it to him, there wasn't anyone else that they really spoke to and Evans had never recommended any food to him before and they barely even spoke that night. That was weird too. Going out had never been about the food before, it was always about letting off some steam and relaxing. They may never have been all that loud, but they never sat in near silence eating before but that's what he remembered. He wasn't even sure if the two had said goodbye to each other, he certainly didn't remember it and what time did they leave? It felt like it must have been late as he still felt so tired, yet if all they had was a steak they couldn't have been there for more than an hour. Plus, who paid? The two must have gotten into a tug of war over paying, not that he remembered that either but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was a receipt then it would have itemized everything that they bought and it would probably have the time that it was printed off on there too! Hemsworth strode over to the end table where his jeans had been slung and began to rifle through the pockets. As he searched for his wallet, he noticed that it had fallen onto the floor but his hand had already hit his keys as well as a piece of paper, so he lazily grabbed them and yanked them gracelessly out. He leaned over and placed the keys on the table before turning his attention to what turned out to be a napkin, rather than a piece of paper. He vaguely remembered the two girls and after unfolding the napkin found the phone number that he recalled one of them writing down. What he didn't remember was the small piece of card that fell out onto the floor. He squinted at it, but it was a little difficult to make out, so as lazy as he was feeling he was forced to bend down to pick it up. Squatting down felt like an effort and he felt so sluggish and heavy that he almost toppled forward, but he steadied himself and turned his attention to the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a gaudy gold and red color and it seemed to have some kind of characters or symbols on it, but he couldn't quite make out exactly what it said, if it it said anything legible at all and it hurt his eyes to try. The pressure in his thighs began to grow, so he pushed himself back up, feeling the effort of straightening up again even more keenly than lowering himself down. There was even something about himself that felt off, or was it his house? It wasn't so much that he felt like there were missing pieces to the puzzle, it was more like there were several puzzles on the go and he didn't know which pieces went with which vista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what were his options? Hemsworth looked down at the napkin and card in his hands. He didn't remember those girls being around after they put that napkin in his pocket, but then he didn't really remember the rest of the night so it was possible that he saw them again or that they might have some kind of insight about what was going on. He had no idea what the card meant, if the girls snuck it into his pocket wrapped in the napkin or if someone else gave it to him, but he could probably find out more about it online if he wanted to. Perhaps an image search or he could get someone to look into it for him. It could be totally mundane, but he felt weird looking at it, as if it held some kind of deeper meaning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically speaking, he could drop by to the restaurant and ask the staff or perhaps the host what was going on that night in a subtle, roundabout kind of way of course. If anyone knew exactly what was going on it should be the person who was serving their table that night, who was... he couldn't even remember anything about them.  But someone would be able to and they would be the most likely to have all the answers to the most pressing questions. The only other person who might know would be Evans. As he didn't remember Evans speak, maybe that meant that he had spent that time listening and observing? At the very least Evans might be able to confirm that he remembers just as little as he does, not that he was sure that the concept of that was more or less comforting. The only other option was to stay at home and to explore other avenues. Not that things felt normal there either, but perhaps the answer was staring him in the face. Or maybe he was the problem, not his home or the previous night. He still felt a bit off, like when a last minute script change came down and he had to deviate from what he had learned; it felt as if someone how edited the script of his life and done a pretty sloppy job of it, but he would find out what happened last night.  The only immediate question that he had the power to answer was, how?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hemsworth decided that the most obvious choice was to return to the restaurant and see if anyone there could shed any light on what happened last night.  The napkin with the girls number and that gaudy card seemed a bit insubstantial and more of a plan B and he didn't want to have to call Evans and worry him if he was just overreacting.  When a crime is committed, the police talk to any eyewitnesses first for a good reason, so it made sense for him to see if anyone knew or saw anything weird last night.  Hemsworth frowned as he walked toward his wardrobe, pushing gently on the door and watching it glide effortlessly open.  He was a bit worried that his mind went straight to the idea of the police and crime, hopefully it wasn't his subconscious trying to tell him something, or warning him, about what happened.  Hemsworth picked out a fresh pair of jeans that were identical to the ones that he wore the previous evening and a baby blue t-shirt and lay them on the bed.  It was much more likely that last night was just an anomaly, that all of the stress from his six months of hard work came out in a weird way but he had come to learn to trust his instincts and he had a sinking feeling.  He would be happy to be proved wrong, but if something did happen and he ended up appearing on the front page of some cheap tabloid on the shelves of a supermarket, he wanted to know if the far-fetched headline had even an ounce of truth about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a shower, Hemsworth got changed and scooped up his keys, wallet and the items from his 'evidence locker' - the napkin and red and gold card and began to head down the stairs.  He felt a lot less sluggish and more together after the shower and more positive about deciding to go back to the restaurant.  He vaguely remembered The Ranch taking lunch time bookings and as it was approaching midday, he was pretty confident that he could get there and potentially get some answers pretty smoothly.  As he neared the bottom of the stairs and felt himself move in his clothes, Hemsworth remembered that the jeans were identical to the ones that he wore last night in all ways but one; the waist was bigger.  His mind must have been all over the place as he would never choose to wear these jeans and although they weren't as close fitting as he liked and hung a little low on him, they weren't about to fall down, so he decided to roll with it.  Besides, where he was going it might be a good idea to have on a bigger pair of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemsworth froze as he was fishing out the keys from his pocket.  That was weird, <i>where did that thought come from?</i>  Why would he feel like it was a good idea to have on jeans with a bigger waist size to go and talk to someone?  Hemsworth grunted in determination and unlocked the door purposefully.  He was done trying to think his way through this, he needed more answers and less theories.  He made the short journey from his front door to his cadillac escalade, jumped into it and began to make his way across the city.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride across town was pretty quiet, the streets were clear and his journey there was pretty smooth which put him in a slightly better frame of mind.  It felt a little ridiculous to take such a big vehicle when it was just him, maybe he should have taken the time to take one of his smaller cars.  Then again, as much as it pained him to admit it, sometimes it made him feel in control and powerful to show off something so impressively big.  Today must be one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parking lot was quiet and there only seemed to be a couple of people about when he got to The Ranch.  He managed to park the escalade with very little fuss, although as Evans would no doubt have pointed out that was probably because there were no other cars around for him to have to try and park around.  It had taken him a while to get used to maneuvering something so large, but now he was almost completely used to it and kind of enjoyed the challenge.  As he hopped out of the car, he noticed a member of staff that he recognised from The Ranch dragging a comically oversized sign out onto the forecourt and strode in quickly and confidently to help him out.  As he approached the kid looked up with a start, before a big smile spread out across his face.  He had the kind of genuine, open smile that meant that PR training or not, Hemsworth found it impossible not to grin back warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Mr Hemsworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" he replied with a nod.  Hemsworth leant down and grabbed the other side of the sign and looked back over to the kid.  \"How about you lead and I follow?\"  The kid nodded and the two of them maneuvered it toward the edge of the kerb, before placing it down gently.  No wonder the kid had trouble with it, the sheer size and the weight of it meant that he would probably find it a challenge to move it, but only because it was so wide that it would be hard to centre the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  The kid said, still beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, err...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken, it's Ken,\" he offered up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm pretty lousy with names.\"  Hemsworth said, shifting his weight on the spot with the languid confidence of a cat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it must be difficult to remember talking with people in your line of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember talking with you.  It must have been a couple of months back, you asked me for some workout tips.  I pointed you to a website and Ruffalo pulled out that magazine which had my Thor workout plan in and gave it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right!\" Ken said in surprise.  \"He got a pen and signed it right over your face on the cover...\"  Hemsworth nodded and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks he's pretty funny.  How are the workouts going?  Looks like you're filling out that shirt some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think so?\"  Ken said, his smile becoming a little more awkward, as he puffed out his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!  I took a look at that website you pointed me to, found a workout partner here at the restaurant and the guys in the kitchen started to make some high protein food for me.  I hoped that maybe my work was paying off, but I didn't think it was that noticable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're always our own hardest critics and slowest to notice our progress.  Keep putting in the work and I'm sure that you'll be bigger than me in no time.\"  As the words came out of his mouth, Hemsworth realised he didn't like the idea of anyone getting bigger than him.  Maybe rather than cutting back on the workouts and relaxing now that shooting was done, he'd have to put more effort into getting bigger.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it so hard to believe that you didn't notice your progress.  I mean, you look so...\" Ken trailed off the sentence and his eyes turned down as he began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Hemsworth said quickly to try and spare the kid any more embarrassment.  Because Ken seemed like such an open book and so earnest, he felt geuinely flattered.  Perhaps because he wanted to change the subject, Ken was the one to advance the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can help you with today, Mr Hemsworth?  To be honest, now isn't a great time to get food as we're usually dead when we first open and the kitchen has only just started prepping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't after anything to eat, actually I needed some information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh OK, I'll do what I can to help.\"  Hemsworth found himself grinning again warmly at the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came down here last night for a meal and I needed to know something about it.\"  Hemsworth said carefully, trying to be as vague as possible as he went fishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that you were here yesterday with Mr Evans.\"  Hemsworth had to fight the urge to ask him exactly what else he had heard about last night.  Ken seemed like one of the good ones, but he had no desire to put the idea of a scandal into his head.  \"What did you need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something weird happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it was nothing to do with the food.\"  Ken said.  \"Or the staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, well, I mean, it's a little bit delicate.\"  Hemsworth realised that he was dancing along the line of sounding guilty and that Ken knew nothing.  \"I don't suppose there is anyone working now that was here last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, would you like to come inside and I'll see if I can come up with a solution for you.\"  Ken already started to take quick, determined steps back into The Ranch, leaving Hemsworth to follow his lead once more with his long, effortless strides.  Ken lead him to the bar and turned back to face him.  \"If you'd like to wait here, I think I have a couple of ideas on how to get the information that you need.  I shouldn't be too long.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Ken began to scurry off but suddenly turned without missing a beat and started to walk backward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you a drink while you wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine.  Thanks.\"  Ken twisted around again and jogged slowly through the saloon doors to the back of house area, leaving Hemsworth alone with his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bright sunlight pouring in through the broad glass front and the deserted floor with many chairs still stacked off to the side, the place felt a lot different from what he remembered of the previous night but he still felt a sense of ill ease.  He really hoped that Ken or someone here could help to fill in the blanks.  He hadn't been drinking that much and he clearly hadn't had a blackout, but even if there was a medical reason for forgetting part of the night that wouldn't explain Evans' unusual behaviour. As time began to pass, his thoughts bounced around from the previous evening, to the last few scenes that he had been filming and the pressure and experiences of the last six months.  All the while it felt like something was moving around underneath, hard to see or hold onto but ready to break the surface at any moment and although he didn't know what that entailed, the thought scared Hemsworth.  He was suddenly jolted out of his thoughts by the sound of footsteps walking toward him from somewhere to the side and he turned to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hemsworth turned and saw a lithe man in a tailored suit slowly walk up to him.  He looked vaguely familiar and he was fairly sure that he had seen him before, but had they not been in The Ranch then he wouldn't have placed him there.  He had a poised, controlled way of walking and there seemed to be an air of stillness about him.  As he got closer, Hemsworth could feel his worries start to slowly slip away, or at least somehow become more muted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr Hemsworth.  Ken thought that I may be able to be of some assistance to you?\"  The man offered his hand and the moment that Hemsworth took it, he felt instantly much more at ease.  His handshake was warm and firm and he just <i>knew</i> that this was the man to talk to help clear things up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, although to be honest I feel a little foolish now.\"  The man slowly took his hand from Hemsworth's and it felt like strands of toffee being being pulled slowly and stickily apart.  It felt warm, sweet and inviting and he missed it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\"  The man said waving his hand as if to dismiss his concerns.  \"Ken said that you seemed worried about events last night and if there's anything I can do to help, it would be my pleasure.\"  Hemsworth couldn't help but notice how rich and dark his brown eyes were, the colour of a decadent chcolate mousse that he could just sink into.  He could feel his stomach gurgle and his hand instinctively went to his midirff to give it a light rub.  A moment passed before he realised that he should probably say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, yes.  Well to be honest, I'm having trouble remembering exactly what happened.  I have a large blank spot where a lot of the night should be.\"  The man cocked his head to the side and stared deeply into Hemsworth's eyes.  His instinct was to tear his gaze away, but he fought to maintain eye contact.  The man smiled thinly before dropping his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why that may be worrying, but you may be better served by seeing a medical professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you're probably right, but I want to know if anything potentially embarrassing happened.  If I did something that could damage my reputation and it got out...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I see your dilemma.\"  The man said nodding.  \"You may not have the luxury of time to piece together what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"  Hemsworth said, glad that he didn't have to go into too much detail and that he was right to place his trust in this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should continue this discussion in my office.\"  Hemsworth suddenly felt a knot in his gut.  Why did they have to leave a public space to discuss what happened?  <i>What had he done</i>?  He felt a hand clamp down on his shoulder and the man motioned for him to walk through the saloon doors and he found himself nodding and walking slowly forward.  There was a long corridor filled with clutter and the sounds that came from the side seemed to indicate that the kitchen was there, but the hand remained on his shoulder, guiding his every step forward.  When he got to the door at the end of the corridor he opened it to find an immaculately put together office.  Not everything had the look of being new, but it was methodically organised and sorted.  The man moved around him and took a seat at the desk, before leaning back and looking up at Hemsworth, bringing the fingers of his hands together to make a steeple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... something bad happen?\"  Hemsworth asked, rubbing his hands together nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not at all.  I didn't mean to give you that impression.\"  The man at the desk said, smiling gently.  \"I merely wished to respect your privacy, since we can't be too careful about who may be listening in.\"  Hemsworth felt instantly relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  The man leaned forward and rested his elbows on the desk, glancing straight up at Hemsworth and looking into his eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't spend the entire night talking with you and Mr Evans but at a certain point the restaurant quietend down and we had no new bookings so I spent a fair amount of time with the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"  Hemsworth interjected impatiently.  The man smiled thinly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very little of any consequence.  Much of the time I spent at your table involved just you talking to me, or more accurately talking <i>at</i> me,\" he said, causing Hemsworth to look away and blush.  \"You were very excited about finishing up your new movie, looking forward to the future and talking about possible projects that you were considering.  Come to think of it,\" the man continued, drumming his fingers on the desk, \"one of the few times that Mr Evans spoke was to point out that you were behaving a little erratically, I think he used the word 'manic'.  Perhaps that may have something to do with your memory loss?  Either way, he seemed very worried about you.\"  Hemsworth winced and began to slowly remember parts of the exchange.  He hadn't wanted to call Evans as he didn't want to worry him; turns out, he was probably the first person he should have called.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that it?  Was that all that happened?\"  The man leant back in the chair and nodded gently, relaxing into the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that happened of any note.  Mr Evans wanted you to get a cab home, but you seemed to dismiss the idea out of hand. I think he found it a bit difficult to handle you, so he eventually decided to step back and intervene only when it was necessary.  Then the two of you left and that was it.\"  Looks like he owed Evans a thank you and an apology.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you so much for filling in the blanks.\"  Hemsworth said, feeling the weight of his worry beginning to lift.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all.  I was glad to help.\"  The man said, smiling warmly.  Hemsworth turned to leave and reached toward the door knob to let himself out.  \"Congratulations on your new movie role by the way.\"  Hemsworth stopped in his tracks and turned back to face the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My new movie role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you receieved a call during dinner.  Well I say new movie role, really it's just a continuation of your last.\"  Seeing the confused look on Hemsworth's face, the man continued.  \"You don't remember?  I assumed that you would remember such a big event, or you would have had some kind of confirmation by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?  What was the role?\"  Hemsworth asked, with a mix of excitement and dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only know what I heard and what you told me, I don't know if I am the right person to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\"  Hemsworth begged.  \"I can't call the studio and ask what it was that I've already agreed to do.  Besides, I started to remember things after you told me about them.  I'm sure if you start telling me, I'll fill in the blanks.\"  The man took a moment, tapping his index finger against his lips.  For Hemsworth, it felt like an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"  He finally said.  \"The same studio that made your last film called and offered you another Thor film.\"  Hemsworth felt his heart sink at the news.  He wasn't all that keen to go back to the Marvel universe, at least not quite yet.  He needed a new challenge and a new character to get his teeth into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem all that interested at first last night either, but you managed to get some fairly major concessions from the studio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find out what they were?\"  The man nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were rather vocal on the phone and in explaining yourself afterward.  You managed to negotiate a large salary increase, mainly to reflect your exercise and nutrition needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...\"  That sounded a little strange, but more money was more money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One bone of contention was a prosthesis that you used in your last movie.  You didn't want to have to use it again in the new one but the studio seemed keen for you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I could do without Lebowski Thor this time around.  Did I talk them round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did indeed.\"  Hemsworth felt relieved again.  He didn't want to retread over old ground.  \"You convinced them that you would gain all the weight yourself.\"  Hemsworth's mouth fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did what?\"  The man put his hands up and raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Evans seemed surprised that they agreed as well.  You did sound very passionate and you certainly convinced me.\"  The man said with a smile.  \"You also said that the only way that you would agree to it is if you were to gain substantially more weight than your prosthesis suggested in the last movie.\"  Hemsworth's eyes widened even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that?\"  The man nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want to do the same thing over again.  You threw some numbers around that I didn't quite catch, but you did spend a particularly animated period indicating the size of the stomach you wanted.\"  The man pushed himself back from the desk and drew his hand up to just below his chest.    He drew it outward and curved it down so that his 'belly' rounded out just before his knees before sharply moving it back to just above his crotch.  Hemsworth was starting to remember, but he had no idea why he would push for that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you sold it as a case study on size and masculinity, the contrast of the big and the vulnerable.  It would also show that big men are multi-faceted and you would try and gain as much muscle to emphasise that too.\"  Yes of course, it was a big commitment but it was so right and just the sort of challenge he needed.  To truly understand what it meant to be fat he had to <i>become</i> fat.  \"You seemed to think the idea of a handsome, muscular, famous, lithe man becoming very large would be a revelation to the audience too.  I believe the word you used was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revolutionary...\"  Hemsworth finished absent-mindedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  The man said clicking his fingers.  Of course it was!  This wasn't about Chris Hemsworth or Thor getting hugely fat, it was about art!  This could change the way that people looked at the cinema!  \"The offer I made last night still stands today.  The Ranch's kitchen is always open to you to realise your full potential.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though he quickly ate all of them. Mark thought that there wasn't many chips to begin with so he then pulled out some snack pretzels. And this process would continue till finally Markpilier felt full and content. Mark rubbing his belly to signify he was full. \"Much better\" Mark said to himself. But then he looked around him and saw that he was surrounded by bags and jars of snack food, he was slightly embraced by how much he ate.

Though he had been noticing that some of his clothes seemed together than what he remembered and he had already found the suspect. A small bump of fat accumulating on his belly, it didn't surprise him, given how he had been just lounging around his home eating anything he wanted. He could feel all these negative thoughts swell around his head till he thought he was going to explode. Then he heard his phone ring. Kit was fast to grab his phone hoping to escape the trap of his mind.
