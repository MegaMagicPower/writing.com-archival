How will they gain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Some mutual gaining is allowed but make the actor the main focus.<br>\r\n-Magic is allowed but keep it to a minimum. No \"he gained 200 pounds instantly\" stuff.<br>\r\n-No vore, or toilet stuff.<br>\r\n-No graphic sex scenes. Slight sex is okay but don't go into to much detail.<br>\r\n-They can get smaller too but not beyond average size of adults (so no making Chris Hemsworth 4'3\" or Tom Cruise is 82 pounds. Those aren't average sizes of people)<br>\r\n-Posts should be at least a paragraph unless just starting a storyline.</td>",
