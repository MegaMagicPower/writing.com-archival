You always fancied yourself a writer, so this is perfect for practicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start typing, then realize you forgot to put paper in the machine. Surprisingly, paper is coming out of the machine anyway, with the few words you typed already on it. You tear the paper out, and crumple it up. Once the paper is crumpled up, it disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that something strange is going on, but you decide to type out something simple. \"Today was cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the temperature in the room drops 40 degrees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a knock at the door, and your sister, Melissa, walks in, wearing a sweater and sweatpants, and hands you some hot chocolate. \"Weird how it's so cold during summer, huh?\" she says, off-hand. She looks down at your typewriter and laughs. \"Hey, you forgot the paper!\" she says, looking down into the machine. That's strange, the peice of paper was sticking out with the words you just wrote on it. You point to it and say \"What about that piece right there?\" She laughs and says \"Ah yes, invisible paper, of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant, of course, that she couldn't see the paper. You take the paper off and crumple it up, and immediately the heat returns, and the cocoa becomes a glass of lemonade, and your sister is wearing shorts and a shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now understand the basics of the typewriter, but want to try two more things. You type \"Suddenly, my sister hugs me!\" and you quickly feel her hugging you. \"What's that for?\" you ask. She responds, \"No reason, just felt like doing it.\" The paper disappears by itself, presumably because the event happened and is over with now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou next type \"In a minute, I'll get a dollar from the sky.\" You suspect that this won't work, but you sit back, waiting. Suddenly, you feel something on your head, which your sister snatches off. \"Whoa! How did this dollar stay on the ceiling?\" Melissa asks, showing it to you. It's a dollar bill, which was apparently stuck to the ceiling. The paper disappears, its work done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize the kind of things you could do with this, so you start typing...</span></div></div>",

Finally, you reach the door, the trip taking longer than usual, you open the door, and once you see your new girlfriend, new memories flood in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Ashley, long black flowing hair, brown eyes, a simple t-shirt, shorts and flats.

Ashley of course kept growing, eventually reaching your height and then surpassing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had reached about 5' tall, she has grown accustom to hugging you, even picking you up too. As time passed and she grew taller and taller, having to look further and further down at you as she got taller, you two grew closer, eventually becoming a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that lead to where you are now, a 4'5\" man dating a 6'4\" women who loved you dearly.

She kneels down, until you have to look down at her. \"I used to be smaller.\" She says, looking up at you. \"But then... I grew.\" She starts standing up, her head rising slowly. \"And grew...\" she says, her head passing yours. You stand up, so that she still looks shorter. \"And GREW...\" she stands up faster, her head quickly moving past yours, until she's standing up straight at her normal height. \"AND GREW!\" She finishes, her head somehow rising higher and higher until her head hits the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you, and makes up a story as she grows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you see, dear brother...\" she says, \"I didn't stop there.\" She reaches up and pushes against the ceiling. \"I just kept growing!\" She says, a sudden spurt causing her to shoot through the roof. \"I wasn't satisfied with just outgrowing the house, though...\" you hear her say. You can see her legs swelling larger as she continues to grow. She steps out of the house, a loud booming sound following her footsteps. You wait, wondering what she is doing, when the roof and ceiling are completely torn off by her huge fingers. She reaches in and picks you up, her hand about your height. You see the ground fall beneath you as she picks you up, and you find yourself face to face with her, though she is incredibly huge by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have stopped growing, but I liked my tiny tiny brother too much,\" she says, putting you back on the ground, next to her feet. She lifts a foot up and pokes you with her big toe. \"You see, he liked having a gigantic sister.\" You blush, not having before known that she knew. \"So, I thought, why... not... just... get... BIGGER?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, like the calm before the storm, and then your sister started growing. Within moments she had doubled, then tripled in size. Her feet get closer, and her toes are already taller than you. You suddenly notice the typewriter sitting next to you. If you want to do something, now would be the time...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a massive and still enlarging hand reached down and with very tender care picked you up and lifted you hundreds of feet into the air as Melissa held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After everyone understood, I decided to REALLY start growing!\" as Melissa said this, her size really went skyrocketing, 2,000 feet, a half-mile, 3,000 feet, and so on. \"But even so, I knew my little bro just loved his growing sister, so of course I aim to please!\" She shot past 4,000 feet, and soon finally beat a whole mile tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed the typewriter suddenly appear next to you, which was rather surprising.

You look back at your sister, who is smiling sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She asks. You simply shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just thinking.\" You say, glancing down, seeing her sandal clad feet. Melissa was short, at about 5'2\", significantly shorter than yourself. Of course, because of this, she had proportionately small feet, size 7 to be exact. You realized that this would be the perfect opportunity to test out if what you typed came try. Turning back to the typewriter, you quickly type that you had a pair of size 13 sandals for you're sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finish, the paper once again vanishes, and a shoe box of the shoes in question appear next to the typewriter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Mel,\" you say, getting your sisters attention, \"I almost forgot that I had bought these for you. Here you go.\" You say innocently, handing her the shoe box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thanks bro! You didn't have too.\" She says as she opens the box, only to scrunch her face in confusion as she sees that the sandals are too big for her. At least for now. \"Uh, these seem a little big.\"  She pulls them out of the box. You of course knew this, but you tried to play it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? They seem the right size to me.\" You say  nonchalantly, hoping that she tries them on anyway. Melissa is of course not convinced, but in seemingly an effort to prove you wrong, she humors you and slips off her old shoes to put the new ones on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" She asks, but the affects are immediate, she starts inching up in height, he feet slowly filling up the extra space in her new sandals. \"I told you they were too...\" She cuts herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" You asked as she quickly surpasses your height, suddenly, her demeanor is back to her cheerful self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, I was just saying thank you for the new shoes, to be honest I was kind of needing some new ones.\" Melissa responds as she finished growing to 6'3\", her now size 13 feet easily able to fit the new sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're giddy, you could do so much more with the typewriter.
