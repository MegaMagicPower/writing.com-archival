They knew they were in real trouble because the team had already finished stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry coach,\" John said as he ran to the sidelines. \"It was Bessie.  She had her Calf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your butt out there, Wilson!\"  The coach said, signaling Gary, the second string quarterback, to come back to the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team ran a play after play.  First-string offense/second-string defense, then first-string defense/second-string offense.  Back and forth, the coach directed his players through passing drills, rushing, option, quarterback sneak, 2 minute drills.  All the time, he was disturbed by what he saw.  His players were small, scrawny even compared to the average football player.  An worst of all, they were on the opposite side of the scale from their regional rivals, The Bovine, who topped out the average player weight at 300, their heaviest, the Center Roy \"The Wall\" Tildon at almost 500 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach looked at his heaviest player, Ben Landers, who weighed a flimsy 250 lbs.  The coach remembered a few years ago when these boys older brothers and predecessors were playing.  Back then, the line averaged around 315.  That was the day.  But now, with this yearlong drought that had hit the local farmers hard, the Coach's boys had been forced to work out in the fields almost continually and had slimmed down to their current shapes.  Now how was he supposed to win against the Bovine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the coach gave the signal to bring it in.  \"Take a knee!\" he yelled as the boys crowded around him.  \"Well boys, your running great running, passing, hell, your doing great.  Good Practice, Boys.  Hit the showers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team jumped to their feet and jogged off the field.  The coach walked slowly behind them.  How was he going to fix this problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***IN THE LOCKER ROOM***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stripped off his white, sticky jersey.  He looked at himself in the mirror.  He flexed his arms and his chest.  He was so proud of the progress he had made with his body.  All the work he had done in the fields had helped him lose almost 60 lbs.  He used to be the fat guy at school, which had never really bothered him until some asshole started teasing him.  That was the only reason he had wanted to lose the weight in the first place.  He really had liked his big belly and his soft arms and legs, but now he had a girl, a position on the football team, and place in the popular crowd.  So he was happy, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the locker room was stripping down and getting ready for the showers.  But, before they could, </span></div></div>",

It looked old, and worn. It had no title on it's cover, or spine. He pulled it out while trying to figure out where it had came from. He shrugged and stuck it in his back pack. He finished getting dressed, and heads to his car. In the car, he pulls out the book, curious to what kind it is. He opens it up and see's that it's some kind of spell book, but the wierd thing is, that most of the spells are for making someone fatter! He looks around, suddenly worried that somebody may see him with this. Scott was a bit different then most of the other guys. He fantasized about becoming fatter, and making the football team fatter too. This might be his chance to try. He looked at a possible spell. \"Immediate weight gain: causes subject of spell to gain X amount of weight\" it said.

Taking a deep breath, he says his name aloud. \"Benjamin Gavin\" He then reads from the book some very latin sounding words, and hopes he said them right. But as the last words leave his lips, t suddenly seems quiet, no noises outside, and Ben is sitting, watching himself in the mirror, waiting. A whole minute passes, and he realizes he never set a weight for him to gain, \"oh, umm.. 60 pounds.\" he says, feeling kinda stupid. <br>\r\nWho could blame him for his doubts, he's sitting in a car trying to preform some 'magic' he had to be crazy. And what would happen if people found out that he was 'trying' to become fatter, it'd be horrible! All these doubts kept filling his head until, he felt like his pants were pinching in on him. He looked down to see that he was actually growing a belly!!! He sat jaw slacked unbelieving of what he was seeing. His stomach had bloated up rounder and softer looking, and was still going, his button up shirt was steadily untucking themselves. The buttons were being pulled apart, you could see his new gut behind the football shaped gaps his buttons made, that is, until they started popping off, his gut was now in full view, and so was his now flabby chest. His pecs had softened up, becoming more meaty, and sagged a little bit. His jeans were finally getting the full blow of the weight gain, the seams were groaning, and it hurt, but more than anything, it was exciting. Underneath his skin tight jeans, Ben was rock hard. He was on the verge of exploding! Just then, his jean button popped off, whizzing somewhere in the back seat, releasing his belly from it's denim prison. It flopped out on his lap, and now all that was left were some very uncomfortable tighty whitey's that had ripped in the back showing off his new plump rear to the seat of his car.<br>\r\nAll of this was too much for Bens manhood to bear, it was pulsing, and now that it was free, it stood high in the air, and burst open it's flood of cum. Ben let out a loud gasp, and moaned as he emptied himself. And when he recovered from his orgasm, he sat with his mind racing, the book actually worked, he had gotten fatter, and he could make others fatter! He had to do more of this! He was about to turn on the car and start driving home, when he heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily, the panting and sweating produced by the weight gain and subsequent orgasm had fogged up all the windows, so whoever it was didn't know what had happened yet. Scott quickly tucks his dick into his underwear (although his pants are far to small to cover up the lower regions of his body). He grabs some tissues and wipes the cum off the steering wheel and dashboard and pulls down the tattered remains of his shirt to cover up the jizz left on his soft, flabby stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Scott knows that he won't be able to cover up his sudden weight gain, so he decides to just bite the bullet and begins to roll down the manual windows on his car to reveal none other than Mike, the pathetically skinny 190-pound center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man, I just saw that your windows were fo---- holy shit!!! what happened to you?! You're bigger than me!\" Mike screams in surprise as he Scott's new bulk comes into full realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right - Scott's 60 pound gain had brought him up to about 225 pounds, which made him the second biggest guy on the team, next to Ben, who was 250 pounds but considerably taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... ummmm....\" Scott begins...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looks like Mike is one of the last ones out of the locker room so you feel safe trying it on him without running too much risk of being seen by others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reads through the instructions for the spell and begins to carry them out. He begins with the object of the spell, \"Mike Hughes,\" he says aloud. He then recites the incantation crudely, hoping that he didn't butcher the foreign words too badly, and ends by saying \"50 pounds.\" He wanted to be sure that it worked, and even with the 50 pounds, 240 for a center is still pretty pitiful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Scott noticed Mike's stomach getting bigger as he crossed the parking lot to get to his car. His clothes began to look tighter and tighter as his gut surged forward, pushing his shirt up on his belly. Mike began to look increasingly uncomfortable, and reached down to adjust his pants, when his hand brushed up against something soft and warm. As he looked down, the combination of his added weight and his pure astonishment cause him to lose his balance. He tripped and fell to the ground, barely removed enough from the shock to catch himself on the pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurriedly heaved himself up, and began to run to his car, but not before his pants button gave way and shot off directly at Scott's car. Luckily, it only hit the driver's side door, but Scott was forced to duck down to avoid being seen by Mike. As he slowly peeked out about his steering wheel, Scott saw Mike running in a quite frantic and awkward manner, as he was clad in too-tight pants and was carrying nearly 40 extra pounds at this point, towards his car. By the time he got there, the back seam in his pants had split and his shirt was showing signs of tearing along both sides. Mike practically dove in to his car, started it up, and quickly drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sat in his car, dumbfounded. \"I can't believe it actually works,\" he says aloud.

See, if we all gulp a guy every one or two days we'll be bigger in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach laughs, startling everyone who pretty much forgot he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your enthusiasm, Tony, but remember what we discussed earlier.

After a few words of encouragement amongst themselves, they begin to disband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, everyone go out and eat a good meal, keep working hard, and we'll bulk up in no time!\" Tony was surprisingly motivational to his teammates, who all respond with positive determination as they leave in groups. John, still full from his freshman meal, is about to waddle off so he can digest somewhere, but Tony stops him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, newbie...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John,\" John responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John,\" Tony repeats with a soft grin. \"Just wanted to give you a little advice.

There's a reason Coach installed those big high-density toilets recently, heh heh.

They created a top secret lab for me to do chemical research, while maintaining my \"normal\" life as an average citizen. I do mainly metabolical research, but sometimes I like to have a little fun and create things for my own enjoyment. I have far greater technology at my fingertips than most people could ever imagine. Some people could argue that some of the potions I've created could only exist in fairytales and storybooks, but believe it or not, they exist here, in the real world. I would advise that you keep your mouth shut about this place, or the FBI might do somethiing to you that would be beyond my control. And I wouldn't want something to happen to one of my favorite students...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops as you stand in front of him, speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have a look around if you would like, just don't touch anything... for your own safety...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and proceed to meander aimlessly about the gigantic laboratory, still awestruck at the magnificent structure around you.

We haven't won a game all season! We came pretty close when I showed up bigger, so I thought to myself 'What would happen if the entire team was bigger?' We'd be unstoppable! If you could possibly get me some more of the weight gain potion, I could slip it into our water at a game or practice. And if it's not too much trouble, a little bit of the weight distributor couldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ponders the situation, you try to look sweet and angelic, hoping he'll grant you your wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of thinking, Hogarth finally replies, \"Well, as long as you can keep it quiet, I guess I can help you. The potion is twice as effective if it's taken by mouth, by the way. How much of it do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think aloud for a minute... \"Well there's 50 people on the team, and it'll make them gain two pounds per hour... About 20 weeks worth total should be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is about a gallon of liquid when mixed together,\" Hogarth informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! No one will even notice it in the water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's tasteless too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When can you have it ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Hogarth explains, \"since you knocked down the only bit I had of it, I've spent the past week creating a surplus of all of my potions, and I have just enough to help you. I have to put in the muscle and weight distributor, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will that take?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mere minutes, my child. Come, you can watch me make it right now,\" he beckons to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow him into another room, which is obviously where he's putting all of his extra potions, and he grabs the weight gain and weight distributor formulas. You watch as he mixes them together, slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later, he exclaims, \"Finished!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically jump for joy. He hands you the container of liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never thank you enough, Dr. Hogarth! But I'd best be going, the team will be finishing practice soon.

Not only are you still being hailed as the new star of the team, but you know that within a matter of days, the rest of your team will be joining you in the big leagues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did all the math concerning the weight gain - With 50 people on the team and 20 weeks worth of potion, every team member will grow for about 3 days and at 2 pounds an hour, the gain will be almost 140 pounds for each person. Of course, this is providing that all of the water is divided up equally, which is virtually impossible, so you leave about 40 or 50 pounds either way for unequal distribution. Either way, you know that your teammates are going to be gaining A LOT this weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show up to the high school about a half hour earlier than everyone else and find the huge containers that store the water for your team. Coach always fills them up before he leave school at the end of the day so that he doesn't have to come early at night. This makes it very easy for you to sneak the potion into the orange container (the team always uses that one first for some reason.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour game is at another farm-town school about an hour away. Their team seems to have suffered in similar ways to yours with the drought and all, but their team was still much beefier than yours. However, between your impassable bulk and a renewed team spirit, the game was a close one, and a quick post-halftime touchdown by your team tied the game at 17 a piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach gives you a few minutes of rest and you take a glass of water (hey, you can't let everyone else on the team surpass your mass!) and sit down on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mike - the guy who was the Center of the team before you bulked up - grabs a glass of water.

You think to yourself that you haven't really had a whole lot of pure fun with your new power yet, so you decide that now would be the perfect time to start.

When your done, you look down to see what you created. <br>\r\nYour stomach is larger and more spherical. Your shirt has ridden over your bellybutton, and your pants have gotten considerably tighter. Your jean button is straining, and you can see you now have small moobs. You also notice that your getting love handels.

After practice on Saturday, I went home and got these HUGE hunger pangs... so I started to eat... and I ate and ate and ate! That was almost all I did all night and all day Sunday! I thought I was going to burst! But I woke up this morning, and... look at me!

Your button up shirt is tighter, and you can see a bit of your stomach at the bottem. You poke your gut, and find that you like the feeling of somthing soft under you.

You pull off your shirt. No one blinks an eye, but Mr. Dummgarrd turns to you and says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better Scott, keep up your hard work.\" You smile. All right! You could do anything without getting in trouble. You walk over to a full lenght mirror that Mr. Dummgarrd keeps by his desk. You never noticed, but it seems like your fat has made your nipples bigger too. You have growing boy boobs and an apperant doulble chin. You notice that your pants a tight too. You look down at yourslef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shoot!!\" you say. Your butt is huge! It's soft and padded, your gut sticks out over your buttoned jeans giving you a lot of pressure. You unbutten it and your gut flops out. It seems bigger. You want to check so you say, \"There's a weight scale right next to Dummgarrds desk.\" suddenly, one appears. You step on it and the numbers fly. Before this truth thing happend, you weighed 180lbs, plus that 25lb gain, that put you at 205. The scale finally stops at 230lbs of fat! You must have gained some weight from your first statement. Your gut is round and soft, and droops over your belt line, even though you unbuttoned it. It forced your zipper down. You look at the clock and see that the bell is going to ring soon. You struggle to put your shirt back on, but you find that now its too small. Not wanting to walk around shirtless in school you say, \"Everyone will see me fully clothed.\" With that you walk back to your seat with your shirt hanging from your rounder shoulders expossing your gut.

Fat!

You look up at Mr. Summer's but and imagine it bigger, then you begin to think about all the other guys in the classroom with big 200+ pound guts.

His gigantic belly is still the most dominant feature (albeit now covered by substantially less clothing). Of course this is not to say that the rest of him hasn't growing much, because it certainly has. In fact, he's probably wearing the tightest pair of pants you have ever seen. The rest of your class is doing a very good job at pretending that nothing is out of the ordinary. They are diligently working, most likely trying to convince themselves that they aren't hallucinating. In the meantime, you can't stop thinking about how it is possible that his pants haven't ripped yet. But sure enough, as Mr. Summers went to sit down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RRRRRIIIIIIIIPPPPPPP!!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't be positive, as he is sitting behind a desk, but you have to imagine that every single seam on his pants just split at once. <i>That should do it,</i> you think to yourself. <i>He had to have noticed that!</i> But Mr. Summers merely continued with business at his desk as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't imagine how this could be true... so you think back to what you said when you made him start gaining weight - \"Mr. Summers will get fatter and no one except me will notice until he pops a button.\" You quickly think through it in your head over and over again. <i>Maybe I wasn't specific enough,</i> you think to yourself. <i>I said that no one would notice until he popped his button, but I didn't say everyone would notice when he did so...

He will be extremely concerned about his gain until his doctor informs him that he's even healthier than he was at his old weight, after which, he and his family will think positively on his new weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SCOTT!\"<br>\r\nYou're jolted from your daze by John, the team's quarterback standing right in front of you. John used to weigh about 180 pounds of solid muscle, but now his physique is carrying around 40 extra pounds on it.<br>\r\n\"Dude, you alright? I've been trying to get your attention for like three minutes,\" John says to you.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry,\" you reply, \"I was just, uh... trying to sort through all the homework I have to do tonight.\"<br>\r\nJohn gives you a skeptical look, but continues, \"Did you want to grab some lun--- WHAT the--?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip your head around to see a red-faced and absolutely gigantic Mr. Summers heading as fast as his newly-enlarged body will allow him towards the nearest exit of the school. With every heavy step, his thighs ripple all the way up to his massive rump, and his low-hanging love handles bounce heftily up and down.<br>\r\n\"Was that Mr. Summers?!\" John asks after the enormous figure has turned the corner.<br>\r\n\"I... I... think so.\" Your awe is easily mistaken for surprise by John.<br>\r\n\"How did he get so huge?!\"<br>\r\n\"I...\" you begin to say 'I don't know', but think better of it in light of your situation. \"Weird stuff has been happening around here, man. I think some of the team has decided to start gaining weight too.\"<br>\r\n\"So it seems,\" John says, poking your new stomach growth. \"I just don't get it, though. Who actually wants to be fat?\" John flexes his biceps, which ironically are now covered under a small layer of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how do you respond?</span></div></div>",

He grows man breasts, his nipples growing wider and harder, like large pepperonis. His butt widens, stretching the taught fabric. Scott feels gas building up in his gut, pushing it forward even more. He rubs his hairy gut, feeling the forest-like hair. His belly begins to droop, losing it's once ball-like shape. His butt droops as well, splitting the seam of his pants slowly. Gaps start to tear on the sides of his once loose jeans. A loud \"ping\" breaks the silence as his growing belly finally causes the button to explode off of his pants. His belly drops, jiggling wildly. Scott picks up as much of his gut as he can, dropping it just to watch it jiggle wildly. His belly button becomes a deep cave as he continues to expand outwards. His pants finally rip at every seam, exploding off of his body. His lower half juggles in freedom, his sagging belly covering his unmentionables. His butt, though saggy, looks like to round balloons that continue to swell. His man breasts would put any girl to shame, looking like f-cups. He gropes each one, enjoying the fleshy feel of them in his hands. His fingers have become thick sausages, hair covering his hands. His hair continues to thicken on his growing body. It excites him greatly. When he reaches John's weight, he lets loose a thunderous fart that rattles the building, almost knocking him off balance. It rages on for a solid thirty seconds, almost shattering the nearest window. His body continues to expand, his body already pushing up against the walls. His belly hangs in front of him several feet, a large, hairy globe that keeps a sagging ball shape, his butt jutting out a good foot, two perfectly round globes. Scott smiles, feeling healthier than ever. His body is warm from the thick hair covering him. He lets loose another fart, this one louder and stronger than the last. It shatters the window next to him. He laughs aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" Scott thinks aloud. However, he sees one dilemma. \"The school has the proper items to support all of my needs, including enough food to feed an appetite that is twice as large as John's.\" As soon as these words leave Scott's mouth, his stomach rumbles loudly, like thunder rolling through the hall. He smiles widely, waddling through the hall to reach the cafeteria, burping and farting the entire way there. He quickly \"clothes\" himself in a simply pair of shorts and a tee shirt the displays his entire belly before entering the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Scott enters the cafeteria, he sees...</span></div></div>",

Rushing to the door, you throw it open to see a state-of-the-art mini fridge, struggling to stay closed with cakes, pies, donuts, and ice creams pushing at the door.

The button of your jeans groans dangerously under the heft you now sport. Your pants are so tight, the only hope of getting out of them is for the button to burst off. Looking to your right, you see a lone brownie, the last one, enticing you with it's glorious smell. Your mouth starts to water once more, despite the dull ache in your belly. You contemplate whether or not you should even bother trying, but you know you have to eat it if you ever hope of feeling relief from your pants. Groaning, you snatch the brownie up in your hand and shove it in your mouth, moaning as the tare of it dances along your tongue. You cab feel as slight tingle rush through your body as another pound is added to your softer frame. Your waist feels even more constricted until a slight *pop*, followed by a surge of relief signals that the button has finally flown off, leaving you with a gently heaving belly free from your confines. Feeling sleepy, you close your eyes and enter into blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Saturday morning)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour alarm starts blaring, waking you up from a blissful slumber.

Eyes wide open, you look down to see a smooth belly covering your lap, twice the size it was yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I said everyone would gain twenty to forty pounds, it must have affected me too! \" you exclaim.

They all began scrambling for their wallets, pulling out as much money as they had. They gave it all to the cashier and asked for Big Macs, apple pies, McChickens, and a dozen other fatty foods. You and Jeff watch them begin scarfing down the food and they begin moaning as their intense desire to be full is assuaged.

You walk up next to the arm of the couch and look over at the two of them at the same time they look to check your reaction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And all three jaws drop simultaneously. Mike looks like he gained the 80 pounds as you did and he is HUGE! His big belly is spilling out far onto his lap, his t-shirt has ridden up over most of his gut and is straining to hold together just across the upper half of his torso as his hairy belly lies exposed, His shorts look extremely tight, and you imagine his button and zipper must have burst open (and maybe even the back seam of the shorts) but they are hidden under the vast expanse of his massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looks like he's gained a fair amount of weight too, maybe 50 pounds or so. His normally tight t-shirt has split up the sides and a beginners paunch he hanging out the front. His legs and arms look a whole lot thicker than before too. Both of them simply look meatier all over - you realize they must have gained some muscle in the process as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 30 second silence in which the three of you were taking the enlarged images of the others in, you decide to finally speak up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess I'm not the only one this happened to,\" you say with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n\"Guess not,\" a still-awestruck Joey replies.<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable, dude! How much do you weigh now?\" Mike asks.<br>\r\n\"About 260,\" you say in an almost arrogant tone. \"How bout you guys?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm almost 220,\" Joey snaps back to a gleeful reality.<br>\r\n\"And I'm about 325,\" Mike says, standing up and showing off his new poundage.<br>\r\n\"Holy cow! 325?!? You're huge!!!\" you reply, only halfway as stunned as you sound.<br>\r\n\"I know! Think of what I'll be able to do for the team now!\" Mike says, excitedly. \"And you guys too! This added bulk is gonna do wonders for our defense!\" Mike pauses and ponders for a second, \"Do you think maybe this happened to the rest of the team too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all look at each other, exchanging glances of wonderment and joy as you think of the effects of the rest of the team blimping up like you guys did. Well... actually your look is more one of slight anxiety since you already know the answer to this pressing question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately want to tell Mike and Joey. About everything. They're your best friends! You know they wouldn't tell a soul about your power and you could definitely have a lot of fun with the two them if you were able to use your power openly. But at the same time, with great power comes great responsibility. Blabbing could prove to be disastrous if they tell anyone else. It's such a big secret, but at the same time, that makes it an awfully big secret to keep all by yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... how do you respond?</span></div></div>",

The room was dimly lit for the windows where covered with huge tapestries, and the only line emanated from the table's candles. Although he was fearful his surrounding were unfamiliar, he quickly sat at head the table. Before he could began to analyze his situation, swarms of servant-suited men began to flood the room, each carrying a tray covered with various foods and confections. The mounds of food obscured the candelabras, and the velvet vanished beneath the sea of delights. Not waiting for signal or utensil, Ben began to eat everything in sight. He felt the momentous urge to eat and devour, carrying nothing of etiquette or propriety, only wanting to eat more and more. Despite the great masses of food, Ben never slowed, clearing each tray with the same gusto he approaches the ten before.

Like Ben, the driver slipped briefly to sleep and woke just as the bus hit a passing car. All the boys were shocked but safe. As they waited for the police to arrive and take statements of the drivers, the boys filled off the bus and then discovered they were across from a large castle-like building that was flying a banner that said Fooditorium. Ben see the sign and becomes excited, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, guys. Let's go see what it up with this place. I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shaken from the accident, the rest of the time decides to follow Ben. Once they reach the castle, the group is greeted by a Lurch-esque man in a butler uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been expecting you,\" the man states in a slow, booming voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys look at each other in confusion. Who is \"we\"?  How could they be waiting for us if we got here by accident? Despite their concern and confusion, Ben charged into the castle and the rest of the team followed suit. Following the butler, the group led to a room that seemed exactly like that of Ben's dream - wonderful velvet tablecloth, hundreds of old brass candelabra, ancient tapestries with ornate family crests. After looking around at the room, everyone began to remark about the excitement on Ben's face (if only they knew what was on his mind). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to follow Ben, the boys sat down at the table and the magic began. Platter after platter of food was served to the boys in massive portions. Racks of lamb, glazed hams,  mountains of mashed potatoes, monstrous pizzas and other delicious foods quickly disappeared in the insatiable mouths of the team. Despite the copious amounts of food, the boys seemed to become more ravenous with each course and began to lose all grasp of anything other than eating.

Mass to the MAX!\u201d shouts the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are freaks!\u201d shouts Mike.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a fat guy.  No girl wants a fat guy!  Look at all the blubber hanging off you - you\u2019ve got tits!  Coach, let\u2019s go home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot up on football trends, are you?\u201d asks the bellhop leader.  \u201cGuys, I think he needs a taste of the POWER of fat.\u201d  He signals to the other two as he steps over in front of Mike.  \u201cSo, you think I\u2019m some fat pig, do you?  Well, you\u2019re right!  I am fat!  Fat is where it\u2019s AT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the three of them closed in on Mike.  From his teammates point of view, Mike seemed to vanish within a circle of solid bellhop flesh, just as they heard his voice saying, \u201cBring it on, fat boys!\u201d  Then, there was silence, except for the heavy tread of the three massive bellhops grinding forward - and forward - and forward.  As their bellies met, and must have contacted Mike, they just kept stepping forward.  They swung their massive arms upward, fleshy tricep quaking, and rested them on each other\u2019s shoulders, and still they kept grinding forward, pressing in on Mike.  Suddenly, laboured breathing could be heard from within, then a thin voice cried \u201cNo.....\u201d and slowly faded out.  The three bellhops keeping grinding inwards, their feet digging into the lawn, their big arms keeping them balanced, and they start to chant.  The team can\u2019t quite make out their chant - it\u2019s low and solid - but part of it sounds like \u201cfat guy\u201d repeated over and over again.  Just at the point that Coach Teague is starting to get worried about Mike, the three bellhops stop grinding their feet, relaxed their arms, and slowly backed up a little, turning so that they surrounded Mike.  Mike looked drained, and his former cockiness was entirely gone.  He grinned at his teammates.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, with empty plates, and distended bellies, they returned to the buffet for a second round.

Their trays bare again, the sat back, feeling their massive bloated bellies.  Mike, the center, was the most bloated of the team.  His plaid shirt hugged the firm curve of his growing gut.

Mike noticed his pants were tight so he unbuttoned them and he notice all 6 guys a little belly that wasn't there this morning. Chuck looked bigger probably because he was bloated from finishing a 20-piece cake right there. \"Geeese Chuck didn't know you had an appetite.\"  John said.<br>\r\nChuck replied \" I didn't know either... let's go in that room.\" all the guys agreed. Mike was first in the line so he knocked and no one answered. The door was unlocked and they went in. The room looked like a regular coach's office except the bookcase was looked like it was open. Chuck looked behind the bookcase. \"Hey guys look at this\" Chuck said. Chuck then pushed aside the bookcase to reveled another room that looked like a bakery on one side and a sub shop on the other side. There were a lot of empty containers on the floor. Chuck was the first one to stuff his face at the bakery. The others followed while Mike closed the door and then turned on to the food. He had never felt to hungry. Hours passed and then one of the guy\u2019s watch alarm rang it was 4:00 am. All the guys stopped and ran out the door too panicked to notice how bloated and big their guts were. They all made it back to their rooms and down to the gym just in time and they were all wearing gym clothes that were one size or two sizes in Chuck \u2018s case too small. All of the team was weighed including the guys that stayed up all night eating with their gut sticking out of their shirts. Mike was starting to feel pain. He knew that they were expected to eat big meals so he didn\u2019t know how he was going to fit more food in his already swollen gut. When he arrived here he was 165 and today he was 183. After a long hard workout it was time for breakfast. They had a half hour to kill so mike and a few other guys walked around trying to make room for a big meal.

The three guys that were in there looked like triplets and what even made them look more identical was the big round bellies that stuck out 1 and half feet. Mike and Joey got in and Mike 's elbow bumped into one of the guy's belly. He noticed that the guy had a hard ball belly. \"Sorry\" said Mike. \"No problem\" said he then he rubbed he big belly. \"By the way names Keith and as you have noticed were triplets, the one on the left of your friend is Kalvin and the one on the right is Kevin.\" said Keith. Mike saw the Joey was drawfed by Kevin and Kalvin with them each being 350 and 6 foot 4. They both had their bellies pushing into Joey and they seemed to puff out their bellies to make them bigger and squash Joey some more. \" How long have you guys been here\" asked Mike. Keith said \" About three months and were leving next week, today is our team meal so thats why we have our jerseys on even though they stopped fitting last month, sorry about the exposed belly this place is starting to make us fat we have gained 100 pounds in the last 3 months but it also made our team better.\"<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped and they got out. \"See ya around\" said Kalvin. They went down another hall. Mike and Joey was at the door of the cafateria with their bellies growling at the smell of food when Mike saw a sign saying that their team was to meet in room 18.

The walls were painted a dark cranberry. There is a long, dark oak table at the room's center, and soft white lighting was emanating from a modern, Ikea-like chandelier. To the surprise of the boys, the table was covered with overwhelming mounds of delicious food: fried chicken, honey ham, pork chops, juicy steaks, apple pies, cheesecakes, and other appetizing delights.

The food was even more delicious than it looked and everyone began to tear away ravenously at the spread, slowly reaching a swift, hypnotic rhythm.

After about a half-hour into the meal, Paul returned to check up on the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, it seems that you are making progress and enjoying yourself. Don't worry about anything. The cook is preparing more food and an exclusive wait staff has been assigned to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Only a few of the boys even took noticed of Paul's presence or his proclamation.

There was just something about the pancakes and the syrup that didn't fill you up but kept you wanting more.

He was really packing on the pounds, I don't know what coach was thinking but quarterbacks are supposed to stay skinny. By now he had no definition in his arms,<br>\r\nIt was pure fat that would have ripped the sleeve of t-shirt if he wasn't wearing a wife beater. Man his gut was pushing out of the wife beater, it was huge and fat it was jiggling along with his arms every time he picked up a pancake. You looked under the table to see two huge thighs that were penetrating the nylon gym shorts he was wearing. They were pushing together and making his shorts ride up past the knee. You looked a bit lower to see two huge calfs the part where the muscle should be was jiggling away with the rest of his body. Just then you noticed something really weird. There was a lot more hair then usual on his legs it looked dark and was getting really long. It trailed up to his knee and covers his thighs in thick dark curly hair. Now with his wife beater ripped of you noticed the hair on his chest and stomach. He had a trail going from his navel to the middle of his saggy man boobs. His stomach had thick dark hair on it that spread to the chest that had a little bit longer curlier hair to it. Now even further up he had a new beard the accompanied his double chin it wrapped around his lip and up to his side burns and was pretty long but not too long. Then you saw him pick up a pancake with a jiggling forearm with curly dark hair covering it up and onto his huge jiggling biceps. Now coach goes over to him and brought him to the scale next to you, \"326 pounds good job go and change in the locker room, he examined his body hair before he let him go. Oh my gosh you realized what coach was doing. Not only did he want you to be fat he wanted you to look hairy and manly to look the part.

Mike bowed to the King, thanking him.  The rest of the tem followed suit, the coach extremely begrudgingly.  The boys followed the servants to a great hall with a walk-in fire place, and almost twice as many beds as there were boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the hell is going on!\" yelled the coach, his echo resounding of the walls.  \"If I had to guess, I'd say we were in medieval England, in the palace of the legendary King Arthur, no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horse manure!\" exclaimed the coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were awesome out there, Mikey!\" said one of the guys, ignoring the coach, \"How did you know how to address them and all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read a lot\" said Mike, \"Now let's get dressed!

But now, with this abundance of immense boys that appeared on the outskirts of the castle, the dragon would be more than satisfied.

Arthur watched as each boy in turn was stripped of his undergarments, leaving him totally naked, and lathered with oil by a team of strapping young men. As each boy is prepared in this way, he is wheeled out through a door at the end of the room. After seeing one particularly soft boy go through this routine, he had a startling, yet... intensely appealing vision of the boy in front of him, bound like a Christmas ham, and roasted to golden perfection on his table. The king was taken aback by this, but could hardly get the sight out of his head. With half of the boys already moving on deeper into the castle, Arthur quickly called all of his cooks together and held back the other 6 boys from the far door, sending the coach through as an afterthought. He directed the cooks to take the last six boys to the cellars beneath the kitchens, where Arthur would decide their fate on his own terms. Arthur could hardly stop his stomach from growling as he looked at the massive boys before him, seeing only pounds upon pounds of perfect meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the choice is yours: would you like to follow the six boys being sent to the kitchen with Arthur, or the others being taken to the dragon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

John knew that release was futile at the point; though he knew that his weight was not keeping him immobile, some magic in the table made sure he couldn't move a muscle to escape whatever fate was in store for him. He could hear the heavy breathing of his teammates in front and behind him, but the was the only indication he had that he was not alone. The cook pushing his cart moved silently, and John could hardly see the top of the man's head over the curve of his belly. Another interminable length of time passed, until John suddenly felt his cart turn to the right and enter a warmer room. The door closed behind him, and for the first time, John realized he couldn't hear his teammates' breathing anymore. The table began to tilt forward, affording John a better view of the room. It appeared to be a richly appointed bedroom, with the far wall being made entirely of opaque glass. No sooner had the table stopped moving, then the man John recognized as King Arthur swept into the room and gazed appreciatively on the overly fattened boy on display before him. The king murmured to himself as he ran a gloved hand along John's soft curves and plump underbelly; making appreciative noises as he felt the heft and give of the boy's indulgence. \"I'm sure you've realized by now that you aren't being taken to the dragon after all. Instead, I've decided to make a few of your friends a personal project of mine. And you in particular, you quite caught my eye. There's something special about you, and I'm sure you know it too. After all, you weren't afraid when I first told you about the dragon, were you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn blushed with shame, but the king's words rang true. All of the rushed jerk-off sessions, the dark websites hidden in his internet history, and even the one desperate roleplay in the barn; it all centered on one thing - food. Being food. John had fantasized about it for as long as he could remember; staring in the kitchen as his family prepared dinner, jerking off to manipulated pictures of fat boys trussed up like turkeys in an oven. John had felt a rush of cautious joy the first time the king had mentioned the dragon's dinner. Arthur smiled wider. \"Let me show you the rest of your team, then we can talk more.\" The opaque wall in front of John cleared, allowing him to view a massive kitchen, full of busy activity. At the center of it all were two massive shapes that John quickly realized were his teammates, Will and Benny. Arthur informed John that the other three boys brought with them were waiting in the wings, being stuffed to the gills until their time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does John direct his attention first?</span></div></div>",

Even more amazing was that he didn't notice that most of his 'bloated' gut, was fat. He had to keep eating, the need to eat was just to strong for him to even consider resisting. <br>\r\nMark, the cheerleader, noticed how enthusiastic Brian was being about eating, so he decided to go see how he was doing. Mark walked up behind him, and smiled softly.<br>\r\n\"Hows you feeling porky?\" he said with a smirk. <br>\r\nBrian just grunted and kept eating.<br>\r\n\"Your going to be so amazed at what you find after this breakfast is over.\" He said. \"You'll be sorry you crossed me.\"<br>\r\nBrian wasn't sure what was going on, he heard Mark talking to him, but the words just didn't seem to click right now. All that really mattered was the food. He had to have more.<br>\r\n\"You know, I think you need some help.\" Mark said. \"Try some of this.\" He pulled out a bottle of syrup from his backpack and dumped it onto the remainder of Brians pancakes. <br>\r\nBrian just kept eating, but as soon as he had some of the new syrup, he felt something strange, some wierd feeling growing out from his gut.

Suddenly, everything in Brians head made sense, and he realized what he was feeling. The food, the syrup, his suddenly growing gut - he felt good, he felt big, he felt strong, he felt powerful again, he felt FAT!  He continued to scoop the mound of pancakes into his mother, suddenly warmly content with his new, extra weight.  He felt BIG!  When the last pancake was history, he stood up from his chair, feeling his t-shirt roll up above his new gut, and his far-too tight blue jeans slide down below his new gut.  Their skin-tight seams straining and creaking under the load (as Brian's butt and thighs had grown too), Brian walked over to Mark to say thanks - but when he got there, a sudden feeling swept over Brian, and he swept out his arms and gathered the skinny Mark into a tremendous bear hug.  Mark struggled to get free, but encased in Brian's farm-strengthened, newly-fattened arms he was helpless to get away.  Brian squeezed Mark tighter as he struggled, then planted a deep, hard kiss onto Mark's face before Mark could turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mark,\" said Brian smiling, \"without your encouragement I could never have found my fat self again!\"  He gave Mark another rib-cracking squeeze then let go, and Mark drop to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry bud, did that hurt?\" Brian asked, holding out a hand.  Mark, mindful of his dignity and not quite sure what had just happened, crawled just out of reach then got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm OK,\" he said, nursing a bruised rib.  \"You big guys don't know your own strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of strength...\" said Brian, looking away to where the other guys were still at the table, \"I wonder how much the other guys have grown?\"  He ambles off, his tight jeans creaking, towards...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
