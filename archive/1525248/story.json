I put on my brown boots and tan pants as well as a white shirt with silver trim. I slung my dark blue cloak over my shoulders and pinned it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready already?\" Din asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Din, I`m on my way out!\" I said, grabbing my brown gloves and my twin bracelets I bought from a market a while back. They were supposed to enhance magical power but all they really did was look cool and more magical. The old lady I bought them from said they were meant for me, but I didn`t believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, I were trying to meditate, but the nightmares I`d been having lately kept me from focusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could remember was a large black dragon, Din being blown away, and four lights speaking to me about a coming time or something, followed by a green triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered what it meant just as Din ran back from her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone help! There`s a man collapsed in the nearby clearing!\" Din yelled, snapping me out of my trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, we gotta help him!\" I said, standing up and running to the clearing Din led me to. We found a young man with pointed ears and wearing a green hat and tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Green clothes and hat...\" I said to myself before Din snapped me back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C`mon, don`t just stand there, help!\" Din said, pushing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright already!' I said, picking him up as others came to help us.</span></div></div>",

Mostly cause she doesn`t let me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...\" I heard him say as I turned, seeing him come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you`re up,\" I said. \"I`m Zicael, a magician in this troupe of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I`m Link,\" the blonde-haired guy said as he looked at me. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You`re in Holodrum,\" I replied. \"Din found you outside our campsite near a clearing. You were out cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who`s Din?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She`s a dancer and my best friend,\" I replied. \"C`mon, I`ll show you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Link said, standing up and following me as I led him around, introducing him to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink`s face went wide as I brought him to Impa, the cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is Impa, our cook. She joined rather recently since we needed a cook,\" I said as Impa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Impa whispered something to each other, and that made me suspicious. We continued on and finally made our way to where Din was dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who`s that?\" Link asked, obviously blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be Din,\" I replied. \"Hey Din, the guy you found is awake!\" I yelled to her, gaining her attention and causing her to jump off the stump she was dancing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You`re up!\" Din said to Link smiling. \"Welcome to Holodrum! I`m Din, the dancer! Would you like to dance with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Link said hesitantly as Din grabbed his hand. I only laughed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don`t worry, she does that to everyone she meets!\" I yelled back, smiling as Link tried to dance with Din, doing a pretty bad job at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed as the music played until I saw a sudden storm cloud roll in. \"THUNDERSTORM!\" I yelled just before a wind kicked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I`ve found you Din!\" a voice boomed over the crashing thunder. \"You can`t deceive me by disguising yourself as a dancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I yelled to the voice from nowhere. \"Who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large image of a man in gold armor with a strange black symbol on his chest appeared in the sky, but only as an image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDin looked shocked and Impa looked rather angered as she got in front of Din. The rest of the troupe members surrounded Din and drew swords, which surprised me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did those weapons come from?!\" I asked, looking at the rest of the troupe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Onox, General of Darkness!\" the image roared. \"Now reveal yourself, Oracle of Seasons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large whirlwind began descending from the sky, and my nightmare made sense, the dragon, the tornado, and the green triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO DIN!\" I yelled, jumping for her as the whirlwind descended upon her, blowing Impa and the other troupe members away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link! Zicael! Help me!\" Din yelled as she was sucked into the whirlwind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink jumped for Din and I struggled to run towards her, but we were both blown away and knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll across Holodrum, there was a strange occurrence. With Din imprisoned by Onox, the seasons in Holodrum fell in chaos. It began cycling from one season to the next at a random and rapid pace. Crops died, water froze, and the land slowly began to die. If this continued, life in Holodrum would cease to exist.</span></div></div>",

I quickly looked around and saw snow covering the land, which was really odd, and Link and Impa beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zicael, you`re up,\" Impa said, looking at me and kneeling down. \"Careful, you were injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don`t care, where`s Din?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was taken by General Onox,\" Impa replied. \"I failed Princess Zelda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Princess Zelda? Does this have to do with all the other troupe members having swords?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does,\" Impa replied. \"The truth is, I was assigned to bring Din to Hyrule for her safety. The other troupe members were all Hylian Knights to help guard us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And was I the only one who didn`t know about this?!\" I yelled, now furious that I was lied to. \"Why the hell didn`t you tell me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Din asked us not to,\" Impa said, causing me to calm down. \"She didn`t want to worry you about her being the Oracle of Seasons and the responsibility she bore as such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... my aching head...\" Link said, coming to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, are you alright?\" Impa asked, attending to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a little banged up,\" Link replied. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That which Zelda foresaw has come to pass,\" Impa replied. \"Holodrum has come to an hour of tribulation! Link, I know we ask much of you, but please, there is no one else we can turn to! Rescue Din and return peace to Holodrum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what am I? Chopped Moblin?\" I asked, gaining Impa and Link`s attention. \"Din is my best friend and we`ve known each other since we were kids! Oracle or not, I`m going with you to rescue her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I`ve seen you fight and your skill compared to Link`s is pitiful...\" Impa said, her words jabbing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I also have traveled all over Holodrum with Din and I know the land better than anyone, especially Link!\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He`s got a point Impa,\" Link replied. \"I don`t know my way around Holodrum, and a guide would be helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It`s true,\" Impa said. \"And I would help, but I was injured during the storm and I need to rest. And time is of the essence, so Zicael, please help Link rescue Din.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you had to ask,\" I said, cracking my knuckles. \"So where do we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell what has happened to the Maku Tree in Horon Villlage,\" Impa replied. \"He is the guardian of all Holodrum. Surely he can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" Link said. \"Zicael, lead the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" I replied. \"Horon Village is just south of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, our journey began.</span></div></div>",

It seemed colorless and made of pewter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what kind of ring is it?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me appraise it and find out!\" Vasu said, smiling as he pulled out a gold-edged dustcloth. He quickly began scrubbing the ring and looked at it closely. His own rings seemed to shine as the ring he was appraising began to change color and glow a bit. \"It`s a friendship ring! It signifies the beginning of a friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Link said. \"So if I find any other rings, I should bring them back here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Vasu said. \"And for a small fee of 20 Rupees, I shall appraise them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that`s the catch,\" Link said, looking a bit glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he always appraises the first one for free,\" I said, smiling. \"But now that you have a ring box, we can continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks again Vasu,\" Link said as we walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, rings do nothing unless worn!\" Vasu said as Link and I left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful day in the Kokiri forest. Link was in his house when Saria came up. \"Hey Link, what are you doing? If it's not important, would you want to go for a walk with me?\" \"Uh, yeah it's not important. Where are we walking?\" Link asked. Link had always had a crush on Saria (and Zelda) and he thought this might be his chance to ask her on a date. \"Let's walk trough the woods. I'll race you!\" and Saria darted off toward the woods. Link quickly caught up and passed due to all the running he did across Hyrule field when he was saving it from Ganondorf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Saria arrived at the entrance to the woods and slowed to a walk. They began talking of their past and old memories when suddenly, they heard a noise in the bushes. Link hid Saria behind him and drew his sword. He checked every bush then a Wolfos appeared from behind him, but there was something different about this Wolfos. Not only was it much bigger than any other one Link had seen, but it had a second head and was standing on two feet. \"I may need a better sword.\" Link said and he was right. His Kokiri Sword was like a very small knife compared to this beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink fought the monster as well as her could, but he could not beat it. Link was exhausted and was on the ground when another boy jumped out from the bushes and slashed at the Wolfos. His sword was much larger than the Kokiri sword but was still small and light enough to be held in one hand. Link and Saria got a good look at him at this moment with the wolf running off, badly injured. He was maybe a year or two older than Link but had the same hair and was also left - handed. He was about average height for his age with brown pants and a green, short sleeved shirt. He was muscular and handsome and Saria was in shock at his strength and courage. She was instantly in love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy did not see because Link had hidden her behind a bush. He walked up to Link and helped him up. \"Thanks,\" Link said still in some pain for the attacks the Wolfos had landed on him. \"Hey, I've never seen you before, especially in these woods, and believe me, I know these woods well.\" \"I'm Kiron. I'm from Hyrule Castle. I'm Zelda's brother. You must be Link. Zelda told me a lot about you, but to be honest, I expected you to be better with a sword.\" Kiron replied with a bow. \"Wait a second, Zelda doesn't have a brother. And even if she did, I would have seen you when I was in the castle before.\" Link countered in disbelief. \"Well that depends on what parts you've been in.\" \"Well I was in Zelda's room, the throne room and the entire east wing.\" \"Well then that's why. My room's in the west wing. and most of the time I'm in the fields or Lake Hylia practicing with my sword.\" \"Right. Well then, prove it. Take us to the castle and if you get in without any trouble from the guards and Zelda backs up the fact that you're her brother, then I'll believe it\" Link said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria, still hiding in the bush, heard this and bursted out. \"Yeah, lets go to the castle!\" Saria exclaimed  \"Wait, who are you?\" Kiron asked \" And how long have you been there?\" \"This is Saria. She's my friend, and apparently, wants to go to the castle.\" Link said a little startled since during the fight, he forgot he hid her in a bush. \"Yes, please.\" Saria said, still staring at Kiron lovingly. \"OK. Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

You have no proof that he's lying.\" Saria countered. They arrived at the front gate and when the guard caught sight of Kiron, his eyes widened. \"Prince Kiron,\" Link's jaw dropped when the guard said this, \"What are you doing outside of the castle? You know your father doesn't like you sneaking out.\" the guard seemed angry but kept the necessary amount of respect in his voice to prevent him from loosing his job. \"I know, but it can be so boring sometimes being on castle grounds all day.\" \"Tell me about it.\" The guard muttered under his breath. Kiron either didn't hear it or ignored it. \"I've brought some friends with me. May I bring them in?\" Kiron asked though he really didn't have to. \"Of course, but your friend in the hat has to remove his weapons.\" \"Actually, he's going to fence with me and teach me some sword techniques.\" Kiron said, though it sounded like it was intended to be a command. \"Very well, but I'll be watching him.\" the guard said, this time the anger in his voice more obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   They walked past the rest of the guards with little or no conversation. They arrived in the center of the castle and Kiron asked \"Where do you want to go?\" Link was the first to respond, \"Well first I want to let Zelda know I'm here and secondly, I want to apologize for not believing you.\" \"Apology accepted. You know where Zelda's room is right?\" \"Yeah, I know. Just let me know where you will be so I can find you later.\" Link knew that he probably wouldn't because he hadn't talked to Zelda in a while and he had a lot to talk about. \"We'll be in my room, west wing, third door on the right.\" \"OK, bye. Oh, Saria, don't forget we have to leave at sundown or we will miss the Deku Tree Sprout's birthday.\" Link said \"Don't worry, I won't forget.\" Saria said. They split up and each went opposite ways through the many halls of <br>\r\nHyrule Castle.</span></div></div>",

Zelda somehow remembered the whole thing that happened, the capture, Ganondorf, escaping the castle and the final battle against Ganon. Link wanted to talk to her just because he felt that talking to someone made it easier to think things through. He wanted to talk to her about another dream he was having about Hyrule being covered in darkness and Hyrule Castle shrouded by dark clouds. Also there was a figure that looked familiar to him but he couldn't tell who, or what, it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   When he arrived at Zelda's room, he knocked on the door and waited for a response. \"Who is it?\" Zelda's voice came from the other side of the door. \"It's Link.\" Link replied \"I need to talk to you about something.\" Zelda opened the door. \"Come in,\" she said in a sweet tone. Link came in and sat on the bed. Zelda sat next to him and, by the look on Link's face, immediately knew something was wrong. \"What's the matter, Link?\" Zelda asked. Link sighed, \"Well, it's a dream, or to put it more accurately, a nightmare, that I've been having. In it, Hyrule is covered in darkness and Hyrule Castle is covered in dark clouds. Also there is a figure that looks familiar to me but I couldn't tell who it was. I fear that it may come true.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I have had a dream similar to that. In mine, Hyrule is in ruins and where this castle now stands, there is a dark, scary-looking palace. I also saw a figure in my dream but it took the form of a monstrous Wolfos with two heads and walked on two legs instead of four.\" \"I've seen a Wolfos like that before. It was in the Lost Woods. The Wolfos was the exact same kind as the one in your dream.\" Link said, \"Really? This is bad. This is like when we both had nightmares about Ganondorf. Now our dreams our coming true and I fear Hyrule is, once again in grave danger.\" Zelda sadly admitted. \"Link, it's up to you and me to protect this kingdom.\" \"What about your brother, Kiron? Can't he help us?\" Link asked. \"Well, I guess but my father wouldn't like it. He still wants to train him.\" \"Alright so what should we do first?\" Zelda responds,</span></div></div>",

They are to strong for you to fight alone and my father would never allow Kiron out of the castle to fight these things. We don't even know where these things came from or how to find them.\" Zelda countered, mostly out of concern for Link's safety. \"Let me worry about where to find them and on the subject of beating them, the main reason I couldn't defeat it before was because I only had my sword and shield. If I had all my equipment I could have beaten it\" \"Sure you could.\" Zelda joked. They both laughed for a few seconds, then after regain their composure, they decided to take a walk to meet up with Saria and Kiron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Saria may have taken a liking to your brother. She wasn't very subtle about that.\" Link joked. \"Oh really, Well then let's have a little fun with them.\" Zelda said deviantly. \"Zelda! I didn't know you had a deviant side.\" \"Well, if you had a brother played tricks on you, you'd be willing to do the same to them. Now, what should we do. I was thinking we should shoot some arrows at them.\" \"Zelda, are you serious?!?\" Link exclaimed \"Not real arrows, silly. We have arrows with special tips that don't hurt when they hit some one. Kiron and I use them all the time. It's fun.\" \"Well... alright. I guess you want me to shoot.\" Link said, knowing he'd regret it. \"You know I can't.\" So Link and Zelda set off to Kiron and Saria's location.</span></div></div>",

The dense leaves only let the light through intermittantly. Julie sat up slowly, she was still young,  this was evident in her face, She still had the young face of a child, but with traces of acne that puberty brings. Juie's dark messy hair went down to her shoulders, just barely touching the dark purple T-shirt that she was wearing. Her shirt matched her dark sweat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Julie heard someone cry out. She looked just in time to see a small blue light collide into her. pushing her head back slightly as it bounced off and flew off into what appeared to be a house built into a tree. It was only now that the young girl noticed that she was atop a Wooden bridge, that seemed to only be supported by a couple tall tree stumps. That didn't reassure Julie very much. Julie stood on the shaky bridge, silently wishing it had some sort of railing. Slowly Julie made her way across the bridge and eventually to the small spiral path at the edge of the tree stump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girl  got down she saw a boy in a green cap standing on the balcony  of the tree house the blue glow had entered talking to a green haired girl at the base of the tree. as Julie approached she saw the boy climbing down  a ladder. it was at this point htat Julie noticed that both of them had one of the glowing lights hovering close by. \"Wow a fairy!\" The green haired girl spoke.

He's gotten pretty strong from carring the sword for 5 years, but even now he's only 5'9. \"Hmm I should proubly head back home, wait whats that.\" He looks at some the source of the noise to see a strange scene, a horse, a skull kid in a mask, a boy in in some green clothing, and two fairies. \"Huh looks like a mugging, but here in the woods, maybe I should get on the scene.\"</span></div></div>",

I'll you turn back to normal to!\" The fairy begged knowing it could'nt do its self. \"And you know what I'll help you both out too.\" Marcus said pointing to himself.

She's quite the monk; one with nature. Prefers trees to people. She lives in the woods, aged 16. Her strengths are magic, intelligence and hardiness, but her weaknesses are speed, physical power, threatening the well-being of others, and emotions. She'd take a beating herself, but she feels guilt easily. Anyone being hurt would upset her greatly, not to mention she's poor at handling others. She's socially awkward. Not a bad manipulator, though. She knows the hearts of people and can see through lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine 'Max' Fairune: A girl seeking love, Max is sweet and simple. A kind teen, aged 18. Although not the brightest, she is one for healing and caring for others. Quite the Mother Hen. Not much of a fighter, but she will take the battlefield if only for a minute or two to back someone up. Her strengths are healing people and providing emotional support. Her weaknesses are strength, anything offensive, and willpower. To put it simply, she can't really do much in battle; she'd take a beating for a loved one, though. She's got the heart of a country girl: Fair and square. She won't tolerate anything bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes Kang: Mercedes may seem shy, but don't underestimate her. With a bow-and-arrow, she's a monster. Great aim, but she won't fight unless provoked. She'll get her hands dirty, though, resulting to theft or blackmail when needed. Sure, she's friendly; but she's a sassy one. One wrong move, and you'll have an arrow in your chest before you can even think twice. Raised in a dog-eat-dog family in a dog-eat-dog town, Mercedes learned that, sometimes, you need to get down and dirty. Although she's a wiz at her bow and arrow, she can only carry so many. Not to mention, if she's upset, she won't keep her mouth shut. Be careful if you deal with someone sensitive on your journey.</span></div></div>",

It's exports are needed throughout the country and as such it is busy year round. One cannot find better crops or livestock in all of Hyrule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the village stood a two story abode of an almost regal nature in comparison to the rest of the town. Standing nearly as high as the largest treetop. Though upon closer inspection one could mistake it as a small archery range with multiple targets set up around the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link! Hey Link, come on get up already. Fado has been calling you for about 15 minutes now, I think he is getting impatient.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him wait Tumolt, He always wants to get there a half hour early. It only takes about 2 minutes to get those things in the pen anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was a fairly tall young man with blond hair and bright blue eyes. He wore simple farming attire with a ragged tunic and a single earring on his left ear. Tumolt had a larger build than Link with a darker hue of hair and eyes of the same color, though they both were about the same height, Link coming off about an inch taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you out then. I gotta head off into the forest for some more lumber. Pergie and Jaggle are looking to get an addition onto their home pretty soon so we need a few extra loads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink worked as the villages herder. No one could herd quite as well as he could and not only that, the best horse in the Village, Epona, would only allow Link to ride. Tumolt worked as a lumberjack, supplying the town with firewood on a daily basis and lumber whenever the rare addition to the town was built. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget we have practice with Rusl after the days work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, always looking forward to hacking away with that axe of yours. Your the only person I know who turned their profession into their hobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I resent that. Chopping and fighting are two different things. Besides, it's not like you enjoy it any less. You have me forty-five matches to your ninety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well if you would use a shield like I do you might be able to block a few of those shots I get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. Rusl said once he finishes the gift to the royal family he will make us both some custom weopons. Including a larger blade for my axe so I wont need a shield that you seem to covet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever suits you I guess. Wont help much though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah mister high and mighty sword master. You beat Rusl once and you never shut up about it. Ha ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were found at the mayor, Bo's, doorstep when they were just infants. Twins, he guessed, for they came with no note. The only evidence that they did not float down were the footsteps in the mud already being washed away on the rainy day. The entire village took their part in taking care of the new arrivals from that point on and have welcomed them as part of each of their family's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning you two, how are you this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um... hi Ilia, Were uh... doing great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye the Goddesses, When are you going to stop the stuttering Tumolt, we've known her forever. Fine by the way Ilia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, alright then I'll let you two go off to work. See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia, the mayor's daughter, was very close with the two orphans. Her mother died when she was three and the two orphans helped get both her and her father through the loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd such was the days of Ordon village. Very routine living with little change. Change, however, is a necessary fact of life and the remnents of a thousand year old calling will begin anew. </span></div></div>",

Were leaving for Hyrule castle now we'll be back soon, okay?\" Link yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Illia could say anything, the sky darkened, as a beast charged into the lake. Knocking Link and you into the lake, as you both lost consiousness you saw the creature riding on the beast take Illia and blow a horn.<br>\r\n.....Waking up minutes later, you both get up and head groggily back towards Ordon. But all that was there was a giant back wall. Now as you were looking at the mysterious wall, a hand suddenly erupted from the wall and grabbed you both. On the other side of the wall, you both fell to the ground unconcious yet agian.... and woke up in a dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggnnn.....What hit us?...\" You ask. <br>\r\n\"Grrrrrr..... I don't know, but I want out!\" He said charging the bars of the cell.<br>\r\nYou wipe your eyes and stare at a wolf in front of you. You jumped up to get ready to fight only to fall back down.<br>\r\n\"Damnit!!! Let me out!\"<br>\r\n\"Woah!.....Link, your a wolf! Cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah and your a.....ha,...haha!\" He started laughing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over yourself to find your form that of a.......MOUSE!!!!!!<br>\r\n\"Oh....Man! Not cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Escuse me, but if you listen to what I say, you can get out of here.\" A voice called out.<br>\r\nYou both look out of the cell to see a girl floating out there. She was CUTE, in the creapy, ecil, sort of way.<br>\r\nShe poofed in to the cell, coming scarily close to steping you.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch it lady!\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up you little pest.\" She snapped viciously, kicking you into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off my friend!\" Link growled as he tried to snap at the girl.<br>\r\n\"Easy! I didn't mean any harm, but you need my help, as much as I need you.\"<br>\r\nLink stopped growling and asked if you were ok, you answered, and the discussion started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, If you follow my every order, I'll help you out of this place. What do you say?\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************<br>\r\nOh, I'm planning on going slightly out of the game, you know to match your entry into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's our only chance.\" Link said grimmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!, but you'll have to get out of the cell on your own.\" She said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some help.\"You say snyly.<br>\r\nYou look at the door, while Link runs around to find an exit. You notice the rust on the door's hinges.<br>\r\n\"Hey Link, when I say, tackle the door with everything you've got.\"<br>\r\nHe nodded, and you climbed up the door. Finding the hing bolt, you loosen it, and hold it up. Giving him the signal, he charged the door and it fell without a problem.<br>\r\n\"Wow! You'r a resourceful little mouse arn't you?\" She said, with another grin. \" by the way, my name is Midna, don't forget it...\"</span></div></div>",

I glanced up to check Link. He seemed like he was still asleep, but that looked like it was going to end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Link! Hey Tolray! Are you two up yet?!\" shouted some voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and dressed in my clothes. My clothes were mostly tan animal hide. I used my hand to put my brown hair down just the way I like it. I got up, and I saw that Link was up. He got dressed in similar rags but his were actual fabric. We each sleepily went down the ladders down to the lower level. His hair was blonde and he had blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who tried to wake us up?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Talo again\" replied Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that kid is drawn to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, he bothers you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kid wants to learn how to wield a sword and how to use a now. He switches likes and dislikes almost everyday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe shared a laugh as we exited. I grabbed my bow as Link grabbed his wooden sword. Although it was made of wood, Link was almost able to use it as a regular sword. The sun was out with no sign of clouds as a gentle breeze flew through the air. Talo was outside; along with Malo, his younger brother, and Beth. Talo was holding a toy sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Link!\" he said. \"Can you teach me more of those moves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talo, just yesterday I gave you my slingshot so you could practice aiming\" I said. \"Then you gave it back after an hour saying it was too hard! I even set up targets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but their impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed my slingshot and turned towards our house. Our home was built within a large tree. I shot a seed at the edge of the wood, it ricocheted off, and smashed the target in the top branch. I was always good with slingshots and bows. My arrows were just strong enough to kill a small animals. I turned to see Everyones surprised faces, but Link had a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showing off are you?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you don't show off with your sword\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked towards the main town. Link was supposed to deliver a package to Hyrule Castle, which is a great honor for anyone in Ordon. </span></div></div>",

We had no parents, but everyone here treated us like their kids. Rusk was practicing some sword swings, and Colin, his son, was watching with interest. Mayor Bo approached us. Mayor Bo was a large man that was bald, and had a white mustache and beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link and Tolray...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am ready\" said Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now Tolray, I know that only Link is allowed to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Link, Epona is already set up. Illia just took her to the lake to clean her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded nervously. I hide a laugh because Link loved Illia. He just hid it. Illia was Mayor Bo's daughter. We walked to the lake together. I wanted to saw goodbye to Link before he left. At the lake, was Illia just like Mayor Bo said. Illia was about Links age. I was about two years older. Epona was his horse and she was brown with a white mane. Epona whinnied and Illia turned. A smile stretched across her face, \"Oh hi Link!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too\" I spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Tolray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine. It's not like every day a Ordanian gets to go to Hyrule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish I could bring you two\" said Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine here\" said Illua. \"But just promise to come back home safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink managed a smile. Suddenly, the gates were forced open. A large creature was riding a large boar. It ran straight towards us. It made Epona run away and us to separate. Illia was knocked in the head by the large one, and we were knocked out as well. I woke up to see Illia being dragged off. That was my advantage. I always woke up first. I turned to Link and woke him up. He quickly got to his feet and we ran to the bridge. But there instead was a black wall. It seemed to glow. We slowly came upon it, and then a black hand came out and grabbed us both. I was knocked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dont know how long I was out, but everything was dimly lit. I woke up in a cell.</span></div></div>",

I tried to get up and move but I fell of the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why can't I move right? Am I still dizzy or...oh my god!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and around at my body. I wasn't human that's for sure. But, I didn't know what I was. For one, I was all black. I felt six legs or arms beside me and I couldn't tell what they really were. I also felt a tail. I had some light blue markings on my right \"arm.\" I heard some growling behind me and managed to turn around. There was a head of a wolf behind me. It opened it's eyes but thankfully they were glazed over. I scuttled over behind a piece of broken wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe this! I'm a small tiny creature and now there's a wolf here? What's going to happen next?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stood up and looked around. It quickly tried to move but it's left pan was chained. It's eyes were a similar blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where an I?\" it asked. The voice sounded do familiar. I moved out, and the wolf saw me. It began to growl, but it's nose sniffed. It's eyes went wide and it's ears went up, \"Tolray?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link?!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scuttled over, falling over a few times. I made it to Link, where I pulled on the chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man your tiny\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah just help would ya?!\" I shouted. Link bent over and began to bite it. His ears perked up again, and he began to growl. I turned and saw a Imp-like creature. It had orange hair and eyes, it's body was a mix of black and white with blue markings. She cracked a smile and flew over the bars. She almost landed on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found you!\" she said to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey watch it!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down and swatted me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filfthy thing\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" shouted Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see Link's mouth full of teeth near her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh aren't you scary\" she said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, can't understand a word you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a little and Link looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Imp looked at me, \"I'm glad to see someone is good to their new form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you did this?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no power to do as such.

I really couldn't see Link all that well in the limited light. Besides that, he sure looked fierce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so how do we escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the bars.

Link shook to get the dirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-he! Looks like you two aren't so dumb after all!\" said Midna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe looked around but Midna wasn't anywhere.

Link growled, but Midna kicked his side like a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess we had no choice. We followed her commands and went forward. The cell beside us had a grated exit, but only I could escape through. I saw a chain ended with a hoop, and tried to jump. Sadly, my legs wouldn't let me. Link was able to jump and bit the hoop. The chain was pulled down, and the grate rose. We went down it, only to find another passage. A small light blue flame was hovering in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you two no anything?!\" Midna butted in. \"Hey, your a wolf right? Use your senses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked confused but closed his eyes. His eyes relieved with a faint blue glow. I tried myself, but nothing happened. Although, I heard s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are these things?!\" said a voice. \"I have never seen anything like them in my entire shift before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shift? Sounds like a knight or something...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a spirit\" said Midna. \"Humans that cross into the Twilight become these. They have no attention to the natural creatures that reign Twilight. So that means he cannot see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sad\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder...Illia...\" muttered Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to him, and saw a tear come to his eye. Midna saw this, and she looked worried. Her look instantly changed and she bumped him on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep moving!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored her recent comment and continued. I was a lot slower than Link, so I had to hurry. Link saw this, \"Need a lift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ride would be nice\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing is not riding with me!\" said Midna in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This <i>thing</i> has a name! I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly fell forward, and hit water. The water was ice cold and slightly murky. I tried to swim to the top, but my legs wouldn't let me. I couldn't breathe either, so I flailed even more. Suddenly, I could breathe again. I looked at myself, and saw that my body has changed. My shape now looked like a fish. Roughly, but a fish. I swam to the top, to see a surprised Link and Midna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I miss?\" l asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you...?\" started Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are lucky\" said Midna. \"Not only did you transform into a Shadow Creature, but you also transformed into one that can change it's shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped out and rechanged back.

Suddenly, flying creatures that resembled bats flew down and swarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nasty little pests!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flicked my tail, and a thorn came out. It struck the creature and it disappeared. I looked at my tail and noticed that the tip was gone. It quickly grew back. I didn't know if I exactly had a mouth, but I was smiling if I did.

Link stopped and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him!\" shouted Midna. \"He will only slow us down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about those bats, and slowly felt myself transform. I spreader my wings and flew up. They had another surprised look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow you down?\" I said. My voice changed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna ignored my comments like how I ignore hers. As soon as we exited that stone prison, it was brighter. We were on a tower of a massive stone castle. I glazed at Link who I was finally able to see. He was a black wolf with white fur streaks and symbols. On his left paw, was a odd marking. It looked like three triangles together at the corners. He saw my reaction and glanced up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so much cooler than me\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna smiled and pointed to the largest tower. \"Theres someone I want you two to meet over there\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Link began jumping across the rooftops, as I simply flew over. We met up, and I transformed into my \"scorpion form.\" I figured I call it that since I looked like a scorpion. We entered the tower's upper door...</span></div></div>",

To my surprise, Midna picked me up and placed me beside her. Link smirked but I looked up confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to keep hearing you complain anymore\" replied Midna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left it at that and Link carried us all the way to the top. We went through two grand doors and into a bedroom. Everything looked like it hasn't been clean in months. There was a single window and a cloaked figure stood there. Link growled and I leaped off and prepared my stinger. The figure turned around and let out a gasp that sounded feminine. We both stopped our actions and went closer. I saw Midna roll her eyes as we came closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee...you remember my name. What an honor for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman kneeled down slightly to look at us. \"So these are the two you were seeking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there not exactly what I had in mind, but I guess they'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman kneeled down even more. I wish I was slightly bigger so she didn't have to kneel so low. She looked at Link's leg, \"You were imprisioned? I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These poor things have no idea where they are or what this is. You should at least tell them what's happening since you've been here for so long. You at least owe them that. Twilight Princess hee-hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment of silence passed until the woman spoke again. \"Listen very carefully\" she said. \"This was once the kingdom of Hyrule. This kingdom and the land was once blessed by the power and protection of the gods. But that all changed once the lord of darkness came and attacked. He came with a army of creatures that quickly defeated our numbers. He gave us a choice, \"surrender or die.\" I thought it would have been for the greatest of our people, but I soon realized what has happened. They Twilight came over like a curtain. The people of the Hyrule passed into their spirit forms. They roam the Twilight unaware that they have changed into spirits. The Twilight will soon spread over the entire world, banishing all light from these lands. Although the kingdom is covered in Twilight, I remain it's princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman reached for her hood. Both me and Link took a few steps back. The woman completely removed the hood, revealing a young and beautiful face. She had long brown hair and deep blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Zelda\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Z-Zelda..?! Link was supposed to bring the package there and diver it to her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to look so sad\" said Midna. She started to float off of Link and into the air. \"Some of us find it quite livable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midna, now is not the time to be like that. The Shadow Creatures and guards have been looking everywhere for you. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, you tell me. Hee-hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two should be going\" Zelda told us. \"The guard will be making his rounds soon. It would be horrible if he caught you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna floated down back onto Link's back and we ran out of the room.</span></div></div>",

Midna suddenly pulled on Link's ear and forced him to stop. He let out a small growl but looked forward. I stopped a few stairs further but tried to climb back up after I saw a light and heard a door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that way\" said Midna. \"The guard's coming, boy he's prompt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around and then pointed out the way we came in before. I had to fly through while Link simply jumped. Midna went on ahead and we stayed back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is Hyrule Castle...\" said Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny how we were supposed to bring that present here\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remained in my bat form and followed Link to where Midna stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you two understand where we are?\" she asked. \"I guess a promise is a promise, so I'll send you two back to where you first tumbled into the Twilight. But, are you sure you want to be going back? Are you sure your not forgetting anything...important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna quickly spun around and she became Illia. She had a look of terror on her face. This made Link step back, and made Midna laugh. She still looked like Illia though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to save her?\" she asked. \"Then u guess little Midna can help you get there. But, in return you two will become my servants. Servants that will do any of my commands.\" she spun around and changed back into her regular form. \"Since I'm a nice person, I'll give you two time to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink suddenly began to disintegrate into tiny black squares and rose into the sky. I felt my body going next, then everything went black. When everything came through, we were at the Ordon lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh by the way\" said Midna. We turned to Link's back but she wasn't there. We looked around trying to find her. I was flying high and still couldn't see her. \"You two are in the world of light but you cannot change back! Now why is that? Eee hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, something is troubling me\" I replied. \"I don't hear anything going on at the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink ran and I flew lower to him. Link's shadow moved and Midna popped up. She was entirely black except for her hair and her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eee hee! Did you two really think I would leave?!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now before you get into anything, you need to get some things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we listen to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for one thing, your <i>my</i> servant! Second, to get back into the Twilight, you need a being <i>from</i> Twilight. And that would be me! So you really have no other choice what to do now. But, I'll help you when we get back. But I need two things: a shield and a sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna went back into Link's shadow and we looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to find a shield and a sword?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to at least try\" I replied. \"Let's head towards the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink ran and I flew towards the village. Our house was the closest to the woods, so the village is next. I headed towards the house, but Link stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave my wooden sword to Talo remember?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and flew towards the village. It was empty and quiet. Several torches were lit all throughout the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should split up\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to get?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

Anyway, the house has a open window, we can use that. This village is full of idiots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't say a word and flew into the window. There, hanging on the wall, was the shield. It looked made of wood and had a picture of a Ordon Ram. I flew over and gently removed it. It was heavier than I expected and it made me fall to the ground. I changed into my scorpion form and placed it on my back. I scuttled over to a opening in the door and pushed it open. I stopped at the edge of the village that heads to our house and then the forest. I was waiting for Link.</span></div></div>",

I'll try that!\" I said. I foccused really hard and then, BANG! I was a wolf like Link! \"Wow! it worked!\" Link said! All of a sudden, I felt Midna hop on my back. \"Now, let's head to Faron Woods!\" She told us.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  As you and link head toward the spring you stop and say. \"Son of a bitch, why didn't I do this sooner.\" Link and Midna turn around toward you to see that you had turned into a wolf. \"About time you idiot.\" said Midna. You looked at her and snarled. Then out of no where a voice said. \"Hero's please stop your bickering and listen to my plead.\"  Before any one can say any thing else several large black and red pillars fall from the sky. All three of you look up to see that a portal had opened. \"What the hell is going on?\" you shout out. Midna then says \"Its a shadow beast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You and link get ready to attack and start to growl. The voice you heard before comes back and says \"Don't fear. Just be courageous and powerful and destroy the darkness.\" With that said the best falls from the sky and lets out a howl. You and Link try to defeat it but every time you attack it once, it grabs onto one of you and attacks back twice. \"Idiots you two are wolves use your claws to latch on and then attack!\" Midna Shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Link said \"Okay, Tolray you get the back and I'll get the front.\" You respond by jumping onto the shadow beast's back and bite him in the right side of his neck. Link then jumps on the creatures chest and bites the left side of his neck. After three conjoined bites to the neck from both Link and Tolray the beast is dead. The body of the best turn into shards of darkness and vanish. All the pillars disappear as well. \"That was fun, lets do it agin.\" You said. \"Yeah it was fun, but that thing tasted terrible. I hope the next one took a bath or at least is covered in sauce.\" Link says. \"Ha ha ha ha haa ha hah haaa.\" you two laugh together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The voice you heard before has returned agin, but this time as a long howl. A ball of light apeered and it turn into a goat like the ones at the ranch only more godly. \"Oh mighty heroes hear my plead. My name is Ordona. Guarding of this region.\" You weren't paying much attention because you never liked listening to lectures. Instead you spent the rest of your time thinking about how cute Midna is. But then it started to gross you out because Midna is more humanoid then you are. Then you started thinking about how will you and link are going to turn back.... or if we were ever going to turn back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You suddenly stopped day dreaming and said. \"Hey Ordona, are Link and I ever to return to our old forms?\" Ordona responded by saying \"All other question will be answered when you reach my brethren at Faron and save him. My time has grown short I must rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You and Link look at each other and nod your heads. you both run towards Faron woods. When you reach the Twilight Curtain, Midna says, \"Are you two ready.\" \"We're both here aren't we. Because if we weren't we wouldn't be ready\" you say with a hint of impatience in your voice. She then morphs into the Curtain as if it were water, then a giant hand comes out and grabs you both where it then pules you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Both of you awaken to find your self in the Twilight. You then let out a bit of a giggle, as you see Midna with the sword in both hands and the shield on her face. \"So these are the weapons of a human. These things wouldn't do much against a shadow beast. But since the two of you went through so much trouble of getting them. I Guess I should hold onto them for you.\" Midna said as she snapped her fingers to put the weapons into a different dimension. Another thought comes into your head \"If we get turned back I'm going to be useless to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As you head down the path to the spring you are stopped by another encounter, several pillars fall from the sky, but this time three shadow beasts appear before you. \"Ha, this will be three times the fun, right Link.\" you said. \"Yeah, I just hope this doesn't leave a bad taste in my mouth.\" responded Link. The two of you used the same tactic used to kill the one you fought at the spring and you take down the first two. \"AAAAAAAWWWWWWWGHHHHHGHGGRRRR!!!!\" the last shadow beat screamed out so loud that it stunned the two of you. Then you notice that the first two you killed have come back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's pointless to try and kill them like that. You have to kill them all in one shot at a fast speed so they don't have time to howl like that. So I guess this is where I come in.\" Midna said raising her arm to send magic spiraling around the two. \"Now all you have to do is charge up a spin attack and gather all enemies into the magic circle then release.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You did as she said, and you found your selves dashing across the area and slashing through the shadow beast. The enemies are defeated, you don't hesitate to head to the spring and as you get there you have to hear another speech and you start to day dream agin. Only a few thing get into your head, something about tears of light, a vessel, and insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You then see Link head out to the the forest, you attempt to follow but as you do Faron's spirt appears and tells you \"Only one can go on this task, next time you can go instead.\" \"Ohh well... might as well just relax a bit.\" you say. You fall asleep until Link comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When you awaken you find that Link has returned back to his original form, but he's whereing a green tunic, and a long green hat. He has brown leather boots, and leather bracers. He also has on some tan pants, and the sword and shield area on his back. As you attempt to sit up and say \"What the hall did I just miss.\" you then look down to see you have changed back as well. You are whereing a dark grey hoodie  with semi short sleeves, a large brown and grey sash around your waist made from animal fur. Black pants with a large hunting dagger on the right leg, and dark brown leather boots. For some unknown reason you have your bow and quiver on your back, also your hair has changed size and color. Your hair is now brown and reaches your neck. There is also a feather braided into the right side of your hair with three different beads over top of it also in your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You stand up and walk next to Link and listen to what Faron has to say \"Oh, Heroes chosen by light as you change forms, or true selves are shown.\" But to every thing else you don't listen and start to day dream. This is when you notice Midna has been looking at you endlessly. You look back, smile and wave you hand. Midna smiles back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then you and Link head to the woods, but the gate is shut and you need a key. \"Hey Link check out the hippie.\" you say. \"Yeah I meet him before, but I forget his name.\" Link responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You head over to him and he notices on how Link's outfit has changed. He then says something about It being dark in the cave and gives us each a lantern and a bottle.<br>\r\n\"Hey is that soup?\" you and link say drooling because you probably hadn't eat'n in a while. \"Yea, its my special recipe. you can have some if you want.\" the hippie says. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  You and Link quickly grab out some bottles you got earlier from one of the villagers, and fill them up with soup. \"To us and the many trials and mysterious adventures ahead.\" you say as you hold out you bottle towards Link. \"To the many discoveries and many friends we shall make.\" Link says as he connects his bottle to yours. The two of you then chug down the black soup, but as you finish you both find your selves in the bushes vomiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey! What the hell is up with that soup!?\" you and Link shout out in unison. \"Well I did say it was my special recipe, but I never said it was any good.\" the hippie said. \"Yeah. It's your special recipe for liquid death.\" you say. \"Tolray's got a point. Any one who drinks this is sure to get sick, and if they keep drinking it they'll probably die. You aren't actually drinking this hippie?\" Link said. \"First of all the name isn't hippie, it's Coro. Secondly I put the wrong ingredients in and I think I left it on the fire for to long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After a brief back and forth argument you all settle your differences and you and Link head on out. \"Where do you two meat-heads think your going!?\" an angry and impatient looking Midna shouts. \"We're going to the village so to tell every one we're alright.\" Link says. \"Yeah. We don't want every one to be stressed out while Link and myself are on a great adventure.\" you add to Link's answer. \"Oh no you don't. You two still got a deal with me to complete. So I say you can go back to your little village after we go to the Forest Temple.\" Midna barks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You and Link sigh and agree to go to the Forest Temple first. As you walk to the gate to unlock it, Link notices you don't have any arrows and your bow doesn't have a cord. \"Um... Tolray.\" said Link. \"Aye\" you answered. \"You don't have any arrows in it and your bow doesn't have a cord.\" Link said. You and link are now inside the cave with your lanterns lit. \"Yeah, another reason why we should have gone to the village.\" you say with a twitching face. \"Oh quit bitching, your got that large hunting knife. Don't you? Or are you so much of a pussy you can't fight close hand combat.\" Midna says popping out of the shadows. You don't even comment on what she said and all she did after scolding you is laugh and return to the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You then think in your head Whats wrong with her? back at the spring I caught her eyeing me, looking at me endless. Eyes wide, or should I say eye wide open and bitting her lip. Also could have sworn she was blushing. And when I smiled and waved at her, she jumped and smiled back before hiding in the shadows. And now she's... Before you could finish your thought you and Link find your selves out side of the cave and you notice that theres a purple mist blocking the path. \"Well might as well get going then.\" you say. \"Tolray stop, it's poison mist!\" Link shouts out. Link then tells you about when he was collecting the tears and how the only way he got through was jumping from tree to tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hmmm... I see, but it's not that simple any more. Due to the fact we're not in our wolf forms any more and the only way we can get into those forms is when we're in the Twilight Realm.\" you say as you get closer to the mist to inspect your predicament. Your then walk back to Link when you are both jumped on by a monkey who steals your lanterns and ties them to a stick. \"What the hell... Hey! I remember that monkey!\" you and Link say in unison once more. \"Ugh! What are you dumb asses doing? Don't let that monkey get away with our lanterns.\" Midna shouts out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You and Link then get up and look at the monkeys body movement, since the two of you are trained hunters you already know that the monkey wants you to follow it. Drawing your weapons both of you proceed to follow the monkey through the mist and kill any creatures that lye hidden in it. Link wielding his sword in his left hand and his shield in his right. As for you, you take your hunting dagger and hold it back hand in your right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As the monkey enters the mist before you do, it begins to wave around the stick with the lanterns and makes the mist fade away. \"Alright looks like this is gonna be easy.\" you say. \"How unfortunate for those hidden creatures.\" Link says with a sarcastic concern. \"Haa Ha ha ha ha ha Ha Haa.\" you both laugh in unison once agin. Encountering the usual deku babas, goblins, and kreese, you and Link make it to the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well I don't know how to speak monkey but... Link starts to say but notices the monkey has left \"Thanks.\" \"Aye, at least we got our lanterns back.... but al that damn spinning made the oil run out.\" you say with a twitching face. \"Not to worry though.\" you say. \"Whys that?\" Link askes. \"He he he. (laughing while rubbing the bottom of your nose with your finger.) remember the bottles we got from the hippie.\" you say with a mischievous grin on your face. \"his name was Coro, but yes I do. Why?\" Link answered \"Well he didn't just give them to us. I bought them when you weren't looking.\" you said. \"How much?\" Link said as if he were proud of you. \"100 rupees each.\" you answered. \"Where did you get the other 100?\" Link asked obviously already knowing the answer. \"Your wallet.\" you answered. Link didn't even try to argue with you, because he knew if you couldn't afford some thing, you would use your highly tuned silent hunting skills to pick at his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Killing a couple more goblins your find your way to the very front of the Forest Temple. In the distance you see an odd looking golden figure. \"I-I-Is that a... wolf?\" you say in shock of seeing not a wolf but a golden wolf that has a bright yellow aura. \"I think so, but it doesn't look like it will harm us.\" Link answers. \"Or it would have done it already.\" you finish Link's statement. \"Exactly.\" Link states. You and link approach with caution, but when you get close enough the wolf gets battle ready. You both instinctively draw your weapons a get ready your selves, when the wolf attacks it didn't even touch you and every thing went white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Awakening to find your in a different realm you see the wolf sitting before you. It lets out a howl and trans forms into a dead warrior with a she lid and sword while wearing smudged up golden amor. \"Link he's getting battle ready and coming tours us. D-Do we attack or...\" you say before both of you instinctively attack, with no effort what so ever the warrior knocks you both down. \"You have strong courage, you must use it to seek your true power.\" the warrior says looking directly at link. \"And you. You have great and mighty power you must go through long and many trials, and use your power to find your true strength.\" he says now looking towards you. \"So tell me children do you wish to earn the honor of being called heroes?\" he says. You both just stare blankly then nod your heads. \"Then let the ancient teachings of the heroes begin.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After little trial and error from the both of you, you were bought the hidden skill Ending Blow. After you learned your new move you started to day dream agin because the warrior was making another speech. As usual only several things got through, something about evil, stones, howling, and come and find me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Killing a few goblins and giant spiders as soon as you enter there Forest Temple and freeing your monkey tour guide. You are lead to a bridge which the monkey wants you to cross. After the monkey gets not even half why across, a bigger white baboon with a bug on it's head and holding a boomerang that has a dark purple eery aura shows up and scares the crap out of the monkey tour guide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What the hell?\" you and Link say in unison. The baboon then throughs the boomerang and cuts the ropes supporting the bridge, the bridge then falls down. The baboon the starts to taunt you and Link by dancing around and banging on it's behind live a set of bongos before heading back to it's den. \"Man that damn monkey pissed me of. How the hell are we gonna cross now?\" you say with anger while opening your mouth as far as it can (kind of like Irruka Sensei did from that one episode of Naruto.) \"Well there currently two sides to this situation we got here. The bad news is the bridge is out. The good news is our tour guide has the look of someone saying 'I know another way'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After what felt like an eternity killing deku babas, goblins, giant spiders, kreese, and other creatures. While trying to find keys, a map, a compass, and caged monkeys that need rescuing. You and your friend in green finally have enough support from the monkeys to cross the bridge. After swinging from monkey to monkey your at the other side. \"Finally we can give Sir Red Butt's big red ass a kick.\" you say punching your fists together. \"That baboon or Sir Red Butt as you called him is still under control by that bug.\" Link says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mean while in Midna's hiding place.)<br>\r\n  \"Whats wrong with me? I-I-I can't have..... those things for Tolray... can I?\" Midna ponders to her self. \"No no no no no no.... He is just a tool for my goals and nothing else. Once my mission is done I'll never have to look at his face agin.....? thats it, thats what i feel when I look or get any where near Tolray, I feel disgusted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(back to the duo of Ordon.)<br>\r\n  \"Stop jumping around so i can hit ya!\" you shout out. \"This monkey is starting to piss me of too.\" Link says. \"We only got to knock him down one more time so we can finish this.\" After the Double Ending Blow was struck the monkeys evil aura died out and he woke up then fled. Then bug that was ounce on his head disappeared in a puff of black smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theres only one thing left. Who's gonna get to keep the boomerang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  \"Okay. Tolray the Gale-a-Rang is all yours. But I get the next weapon.\" Link says \"Agreed. So we patronize the weapon collection.\" you say. Now that you have the Gale-a-Rang, you back track to parts of the temple you haven't been able to get to before. Killing monsters and saving other caged monkeys along the way. You were just about to go to the room where you saw a large chest sealed behind a gate that only opens with wind power, when you heard a strange sound coming from one of the pots in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Link. Did you hear that?\" you asked \"Yeah, sounds like it's coming from that pot over there.\" Link said \"Go break it.\" you say in unison. After you break it a strange looking creature is looking right at you. \"What the hell is that?\" you say in a calm but confused voice. \"It looks like some one cut off the head of a baby and reattached it to a cucu.\" Link answered \"Oh thank you brave travelers. I thought I would be left to perish. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ooccoo.\" said Ooccoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After day dreaming because of another speech, fortunately this was a minor one, unfortunately only one thing got through, teleport. After you agree to take the Ooccoo with you, you head to the big chest to receive the big key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Finally after a long travel through the Forest Temple, saving monkeys, killing monsters, not trying to get eaten, befriending an Ooccoo who's name is Ooccoo, and preforming one last monkey swing. \"This is it Link. What ever is behind that door will probably be the last thing we ever need to see of this place.\" You say. \"Just remember Toray there are many more dungeons after this one. Plus all the other regions in Hyrule that are shrouded in the Twilight.\" Link said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The door opens to reveal not much of any thing. Theres some ting resembling a tree in the back of the room over top a large pool of purple water. Then you notice there is a few of those spider bombs you use to blow up some walls before. \"This was a lot of work for nothing.\" you said. Then the ground started to shake a bit then two large deku babas appeared out of the poison water and immediately attack. \"Man those things are big. Looks like we won't be able to kill these by a simple cut.\" you say \"When they attack, their mouths remain open until they reach a certain range.\" Link states \"Huh... Thats it, the spider bombs.\" yet another unison remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After pulling off multiple wait-n-dodges the two large deku babas submerge back into their toxic H2O. \"Is that it? Did we kill them?\" Link asked \"No, that wasn't even the true boss.\" you say with a very serious look on your face still in battle ready stance. \"What?\" Link said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Just then a larger creature with an eye for a tongue and the two large babas as arms, splashed out of the toxic lake. \"What the fuck is that?\" unionized remark \"It's the Twilit Parasite: Diababa.\" Midna said \"Well it's about time you said something. I kinda started to like when you keep talking shit about me.\" you said \"Now's not the time!\" unionized remark by Link and Midna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You can't use the same tactic used before on it's arms because when it came out of the water it splashed poison into the spider bomb holes killing all of them. \"Oooooooooookkk!\" you looked up and saw the baboon who's ass you kicked so you can save his ass, holding a rope in one hand and a spider bomb in the other. \"Sir Red Butt.\" you called out automatically making Link look towards the monkey. The monkey began to swing back and forth and Link was distracting the boss creature. You used the confusion to wait for when the Diababa opened it's mouth. When it did you chucked the Gale-a-Rang at the spider bomb Red Butt was carrying also aiming for the creatures mouth. When it hit, the Diababa fell to the floor and thats when you and Link began slashing away at it's eye. This was repeated three times until the Double Ending Blow was struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When it was finally defeated it began to wither and turn black, where it then puffed into darkness. Its eye fell out and puffed into darkness as well, but revealing two heart shaped objects. \"Everything's getting cleaner agin.\" you said \"Look.\" Link shouted. Black squares began to form from the dark mist then they fused together. They formed a solid black stone that shimmered a black glow. \"Finally, a Fused Shadow.\" Midna said as she appeared from your shadow this time and not Link's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Day dreaming and not paying attention once more, only a few words get through, Fused Shadows, two more, heart container, and you two shall get no praise from me.<br>\r\n\"Huh.. What...\" you mange to blurt out as you snap out of your day dream \"Tolray go pick up that heart container and lets go already.\" to your surprise Link had already left so Midna was the only one who could have said that. Normally have crouched down to get it, but seeing as your in a rush you decided to bend down and scope it up and keep on walking. As you did, you had no idea Midna was eyeing you the whole time her hand on her heart and a look of excitement on her face. It's as if she wanted you to bend down instead of crouching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Once agin you are found day dreaming because theres yet another speech from that bastard your bitch spirt from the spring. Since absolutely nothing got through to your head you decided to just follow link. \"I guess its my turn to do the thing with the bugs agin, huh?\" you say as you think your not going to enjoy this vary well. \"Yes it is.\" Link answers. By now you have already made it to the infamous Hyrule field, found two golden bugs, and each of you has a piece of heart. \"So we're almost at Kakariko Village, huh?\" you say \"HEEEEEEEEEEY!\" shouted a man with a red hat, white shorts and t-shirt, and a red flag on his back. He then ran right up to us and said he is the one and only post man of Hyrule. He then told us that there was a black wall blocking the village. Afterwards he ran off very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As soon as you get to the wall. \"Are you two ready to go in to the curtain?\" Midna asked. Link just stood there with his arms crossed and you are punching your fists together. Without another word she used the same trick to bring us in to the last one. \"Since it's your turn to look for the Tears of Light, I'll becoming with you.\" Midna said as she jumped on your back. \"I'd rather go at it alone thank you.\" you say even though you deep down inside, you actually want some alone time with her. Just so you can get to know each other. \"You need me to go with you, other wise you wouldn't be able to do much of any thing. Thats why I went with Link.\" Midna said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The three of you remained silent as you crossed through Kakariko Gorge. When you got to a large fissure in the ground you encountered more shadow beasts, nothing new so they were quickly defeated. \"Looks like the bridge that was here was transported some where else.\" Midna sighed and told you she can teleport you so you can find it, but it might take a while. \"I know where it is\" you say \"How do you know?\" Midna asks with a bit of mockery in her voice \"Part of being a hunter is observing ones surroundings.\" you say. \"Well then since you know where it is then theres no point in bringing both of you. So with that said, Link will stay here while Tolray and myself go find it.\" And with that said you and Midna teleported to Faron Woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's thoughts.)<br>\r\n  \"S-Should I ask him now..... No it's to soon I-I-I... I can't talk to him about it yet. Well at least I can be closer to him from know on.\" she thinks as she blushes and starts to hold onto you more \"I wonder what he feels like when he's not in wolf form. For some reason I feel safe when I'm with him, I can't even imagine the feeling I'll get if he was holding me in his arms.\" \"Ooohhh Tolray.\" she wishers to her self then falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back at the Gorge.)<br>\r\n  *Sniff**sniff Sniff* \"Huh.. that smell is so familiar. Smells like the children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Returning to the main character, and no it's not Link)<br>\r\n  \"Aye Midna we're here.\" you say only loud enough to make her wake up. When she wakes up she is still blushing and has a bit of smile on her face, but when she realizes you found out she fell asleep on you she quickly snaps out of her spring fever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"About damn time.\" she said as she shaped her fingers and quickly teleported both you and the bridge to the gorge. After you get to the gorge you quickly make your way across the bridge and into the village. Where you fight yet another trio of shadow beasts. Begin day dreaming from yet another speech. \"Are you ready to go Tolray?\" Midna whispers into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You respond only by jet out of the spring quickly. After a while your back begins to feel warm and wet.</span></div></div>",

She was right, I needed to find these bugs and fast. Link was waiting at the spring. I ran as fast as I possibly could. I kind of liked being a wolf like Link. Although, I kinda missed being a smaller creature. I charged through the town with great speed. But, I suddenly stopped. Midna almost flied off but managed to hold on. \"What was that all about?!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored her. There was a scent in the air that seemed too familiar. I looked around the building for the source of the scent. It seemed to be coming from inside the building. There were a few posts sticking out from the walls that lead to the roof. I tried to jump but I didn't jump high enough. Midna pulled on one of my ears, \"You idiot! You'll never get up there alone! You need my help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna was annoying but she made a point. I believe this is what she was telling me before. I probably should pay attention to some speeches. They may be long and annoying but some might actually be useful. She directed me to one point of the building and lept off my back. She appeared on the first post out from the building. I jumped and surprisingly I made it. She appeared on the next, and I repeated the process. The roof was boarded up but I needed to find a way in. \"Why are we even up here?\" she asked. \"You'll never find the bugs like this.\" Before I could even reply, the boarding collapsed under us. I landed with a thud but Midna slowly drifted down. \"Now I need to learn to change forms every once in a while\" I muttered before struggling to stand. Midna jumped on my back, but my legs were still too weak and I fell to the floor once again. \"Get up you lazy slave!\" she shouted. I growled back at her but struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's thoughts)<br>\r\n<i>I'm doing great...he suspects nothing. But, I think I'm treating him a little to harshly. I mean, he's struggling to stand up now. No, I don't care about him remember. I need to keep treating him this way, no matter how much it hurts him or me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to Tolray)<br>\r\nI looked around at the room. Several spirits collected around what looked like an old couch and the one hovered by the window. I needed to use my senses, but I had no idea how to. \"Well, might as well try...\" I said to myself. I closed my eyes and tried my best to focus. I didn' open my eyes, but I began to hear something. It sounded like crying. I opened my eyes, being able to see clearly now. All of the village children were there; Malo, Talo, Beth, even Colin. But, Illia was not even there. Link is going to be depressed when he sees this. They all gathered around this one man and another girl. I turned towards the window and saw a man. He looked old and was wearing a blacksmithing mask. But by the looks of him, he didn't seem like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it, I can't see any of those dang black creatures anywhere\" he said. \"It's only a matter of time before they finally get in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis talking seemed to upset Beth. The man turned to her, \"Don't worry child, we will be safe in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wonder how long you'll be saying that until those monsters break in\" continued the man. \"Don't you remember that women across town? She had her house barricaded, and she was taken along with the others! It's only a matter of time before they break into here. And once they get in here, they will stop at nothing until they all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BARNES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, most likely Barnes, became instantly quiet. Beth broke down into heavy sobs in the man's lap. The man sighed and looked towards Barnes. Barnes chuckled and lowered his mask. He was lucky I couldn't hurt him now, otherwise I would bite his sorry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Beth\" said a voice. I turned to see Colin trying to talk to her. Colin was always a sweet kid. Short with blonde hair, but he always took everyone's insults and remarks. \"Everything will be alright Beth. Link and Tolray will be here!\" The room became quiet as everyone looked at Colin. \"I don't know why, but I feel like they're right here. I can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww....they still have faith in you\" said Midna sarcastically. I growled at her but stopped when I saw Barnes on the ground. \"Listen Renado, you know as well as I do that we're out in the open here. Isn't there another room or something to hide in?\" Renado glanced over at Barnes and went back to Beth, \"There is a cellar....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnes jumped up from his lying down position and scuttled over to him, \"You had a cellar all this time and never said ANYTHING?! WHERE'S THE ENTRANCE MAN?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entrance can only be opened when all of the torches in the room are lit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnes grabbed a stick and lit it with the fire around. He began to walk towards the first torch. \"I wouldn't do that\" said the girl. \"When my father told me to close the cellar, he said that there were these bugs like the creatures outside.\" Barnes threw down the stick and stomped his foot on the flame. I smiled and turned off my senses. I walked over towards the stick. But before I grabbed it, I looked up at Midna, \"Now was it a bad thing that we came out here?\" Midna pouted and then I grabbed the stick with my mouth. I lit one side of it and ran up the stairs. With a few simple jumps, all of the flames were lit. The center statue that looked like an owl began to move. A small door appeared beneath it. I ran over and jumped down the opening. The landing wasn't as rough, but it hurt. The extra weight on my back wasn't helping either. I heard a soft singing noise. I changed my senses and saw both bugs. With a simple bite, I collected two tears. With Midna's helps I managed to get back out. But I had to burst through a wooden door though. With a few shakes, all of the splints were off. I searched through the lower buildings, but only managed to find a few more tears. All of them were hiding somewhere. I noticed a cliff and a small shack. I quickly ran up the cliff. But, it was taller than expected and there was no path up there. I glanced back at Midna, \"You wouldn't happen to be able to teleport us to that cliff?\" Midna yawned and pretended to be asleep. I rolled my eyes but advanced. \"Alright, but just listen, if you fall off, I'm not catching you.\"<br>\r\nI jumped from building to building and lept higher and higher. I would make it up there in no time. I even felt lighter. Wait...lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shifted into my bat form and grabbed Midna's arm. I haven't stayed as a bat for a while, so some things were slightly new. Midna looked up at me in shock. \"I know I said I wouldn't catch you\" I said before she could say anything, \"But I'm not like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's thoughts)<br>\r\n<i>He....he saved me. After all the crap I put him through, he saved me. Wait...what am I so surprised about....I could have managed myself. After all I can float. But still, this human is very....interesting...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to Tolray)<br>\r\nOnce we were on the ledge I collapsed onto the ground. I never really took the time to notice that Minda was much larger than me in my bat form. After a minute rest, I shufted back into a wolf and she jumped on me. I dug my into the shack and listened carefully. I heard two more, but they were in the fireplace. There was no way I could get them out of there, but I then saw a stick with a flame. I threw the stick into the pile of wood and it lit the fireplace. The bugs flew out, but they were on fire. They slammed against the walls, and the walls caught on fire. A few small explosions occured and I cowared from them. \"Sorry Tolray, but I'm out of here!\" She flew off my back and down the hole I dug up. I shitfted into my snake form and slithered out. Unfortunately, a large piece of rubble fell and slammed against my body. I tried to move, but I couldn't. \"Midna help!\" I shouted. I saw nothing but flames surround me. The hole was possibly too dangerous to go back. Midna was obviously going to find Link to finish her job. I closed my eyes and prepared for my death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt something wrap around me and drag me out. My eyes were still closed from the amount of smoke, but I heard a massive explosion. I managed to open my eyes and look up. Midna had me in her hand...er...hair. She saw me look at her and dropped me. I slithered up to her, but she pushed me away. \"I don't want to talk about it. Just change back into a wolf and lets get going.\" I ignored her and circled around her. \"Midna...you...you saved me\" I said. \"Why would you save me...?\"</span></div></div>",

Don't even attempt to think that! I...I hate...no...I...I don't know anymore...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to Tolray)<br>\r\n\"I only need you to collect the remaining Fused Shadows\" she said. I slithered around her to check her face. Her expression was straight, she wasn't lying. That kinda hurt. She saved me just to do her bidding. \"But...Link can do it too...\" I mentioned. Midna waved her hand, \"Link would never do it if I let you die. You being alive just means I still have his trust now.\" I was saddened even further but I guess she was right. Those Fused Shadows do cause a problem. I shifted back into a wolf and collected the two Tears of Light. I walked back over to Midna, and she jumped on my back harshly. The pain hurt, but it didn't hurt as much in my heart. I didn't know why I was feeling like this either. Midna kicked her leg beside me just like a horse, \"Come on! Get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI growled slightly but ran back down to the ground. I couldn't feel no bugs in the town, so I should check the other areas. I walked to the deepest part of the village to where the path split off. The one path was blocked off but the other path wasn't. It lead up towards a towering mountain that looked menacing. I looked at the sign between the paths. I swallowed and sense of courage I had when I read the name, \"Death Mountain.\" I was hesitant, but Midna kicked my sides once more. I ran up the path, jumped up the side stones and landed on the top of the cliff. There was a spirit at the top, so I turned my senses. What I saw caused me to step back. There was this massive creature standing there. It was human-like, but it had this large gray....armor on its back that went up to its head. \"Uh.....why do I have to stand guard...?\" he moaned. \"It's like there won't be any humans coming up here. They basically stopped coming once those weird things came through. Its like none of them could get up here anyway. Their strength is no match for ours.\" He sighed again and stood his post. I acyually felt sorry for the guy. Whatever her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran down the path, dodging several blasts of steam that were coming out of the walls and floor. As we moved on, I heard a singing-like noise. At first I thought it was a bug, but it was coming from a stone. It had a hole straight throught the center and made a certain pitch. I started to hum the tone, and the sound grew louder. <i>I am so going to regret this...</i> I howled the tone loudly into the air. I kept \"singing\" the tone, but then I heard another wolf howl along with me. Eventually, we both stopped and I finally opened my eyes. The area around us changed. It looked completely different, like an enclosed area of everything in Hyrule. I was on a cliff, and the other wolf, the golden wolf from before, stood on the other. \"If teachings of old you want to learn, come with sword in hand and find me.\" He jumped off the cliff and the vision ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was intesne\" I said. \"Link might want to do this. He's more of a wolf than me.\" I continued to run down the path and soon entered a more open area. I now had a greater view of Death Mountain. And boy, I hope to the Goddesses that the Fused Shadow was NOT in there. Lots more steam vents blocked my path, but with Midna's help, we were able to dodge them all. The last two were at the bottom of another cliff. Before I could even think about jumping, the ground beneath me rumbled. I fell over the edge, but fell into water. The water was nice and cool. I saw the two Bugs through my senses, but something else triggered my senses. A falling flaming rock fell where I used to stand. I quickly destroyed the two bugs and gathered the tears. I was instantly teleported, just before a large flaming boulder fell on me. I knew for sure Midna wouldn't help me out of that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly stood beside Link and the lake began to glow again. A small orb formed out from the lake, and another creature formed from the light. It resembled the owl, actually it resembled the statue I saw earlier. I noticed that both of us were human once again. And sadly, I noticed that I had a bow with no string or a quiver with no arrows. For everything, I would at least think the Goddesess would give me a few simple items. I spaced out throught the beginning of the lecture, but I remembered that I had to at least try to pay attention. Unfortunantly, I listened in at the wrong time. \"The item you seek lies deep with Death Mountain\" she said. \"Please young heroes, be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light died down and I faced Link. I had a lot of explaining to do. But, a voice cut me off, \"Link? Tolray?\" We turned to see Colin at the door. He smiled and ran out. But he was trambled by the other kids. Colin got up but ran after us again. Link and I were happily greeted by our friends. Renado, Barnes, and the girl walked right out. \"So you are the two that these children have been talking so much about\" he said. \"I am Renado, shamin of this village. And this....\" Barnes waved his hand happily, \"Is my daughter Luda.\" Barnes dropped his mask and walked off. Luda bowed slightly in response to her father. After everything, I filled Link in with everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the Fused Shadow is somewhere in the mountain?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, but there are these creatures that block the path\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shrugged and began to climb the railing. Midna popped up beside me, \"Do you think he's going to make it?\" Link fell down face first into the ground with a thud. \"That answers that question\" I replied. We looked up at the creature, \"Don't come back human! You cannot match out strength!\" The creature walked off and out of sight. Me and Midna smiled towards each other as Link got up. \"That was entertaining\" she said. Link's glare slienced her and she disappeared into my shadow. <i>That's weird, if she hated me why travel into my shadow?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked down, Renado approached us. He seemed surprised. \"Oh good, you two are still alive\" he said. \"No one has ever faced the Gorons and lived. Well, without major injuries.\" Link straightened his back a little and I could have sworn I heard Midna giggled. \"The Gorons were once our friends, but something happened to them. Now they only shun us from even getting close to the mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way we can get up there?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Goron tribe only recognizes strength. To humans, their strength is ten fold. However, there was one person that was able to win over their trust. He goes by the name Bo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Link and I ran off, thanking him in the process. \"How are we supposed to get back to Ordon?\" asked Link. \"Midna can't teleport us and it would take days to walk.\" A loud horse whine sounded behind us and we both turned. Epona, Link's horse, was galloping through the town with this creature on his back. It was the same creature that attacked us at the spring. He flew off and Epona went wild. We needed to calm him down.</span></div></div>",

After a few attempts of catching up, Link finally got onto his horse. \"Aye, Link just tug on the rope.\" you say \"Yeah, I now that already.... Omph!\" Link says as the horse bucks him of and he lands face first on the ground. At this point Midna pops out of your shadow and starts laughing her ass off. \"Oh look, Link the almighty horse tamer. You idiot, try tugging the rope in the opposite direction. God, it's like neither one of you two have a brain in those thick heads of yours.\" another smart assed remark by Midna. \"Shut Up!!!\" unison remark by you and Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After much trial and error, Link finally calmed his horse, and he and his horse made a victory stance. \"Well congratulations Link, but now I have no way to get to the village, unless I walk.\" you say \"You could always ride with Link.\" Midna suggests \"Well she's got a point I don't really see any other way.\" Link says scratching his head \"But what if some one sees us, what would they think?\" you say sweat dropping \"We'll be in the middle of Hyrule Field, I don't think any one will see us.\" Link says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You then slowly make your way to the horse and hop on. \"Hold on, I'll try and make this as quick as possible.\" Link said obviously not enjoying this. As soon as you do you find that the horse has jetted out of the village and is know about half way through the gorge. \"HEEEEEEEYYYYY\" you and Link hear someone shout out. \"Oh shit, it's the post man.\" Link says. You try and act like your injured and he believes it. He then gives Link a letter and runs off. \"Link, what about the letter?' you ask \"No time.\" he says and jets off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  In a few minutes our heroes arrive back at their village, saying hi to the hippie as you dash by. \"I think now is a good time to get off the horse.\" you say. By now you two are at your house. \"Oh and Link, fallow me to the spring right quick.\" you say \"Wait we got something important to do.\" Link responds \"This can't wait. That golden wolf is at the spring.\" you say calmly \"Huh.... Then lets go then.\" as Link says this you both go into full sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's Thoughts)<br>\r\n  \"Why dose my heart feel like this... I-I.. I never felt like...... this before. Do I like him? No no no, he's human and I'm of the Twili it would never work..... would it? Ugh... what am I thinking, of course it would never work..... but still this human...... interests me. Hmmm... Tolray, that name kinda sounds odd for a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(5 minutes latter back to our heroes)<br>\r\n  \"What a loud of bull shit, all that work just for something you could have learned on your own. Hmph... Shield Bash, my ass.\" You say pissed off at all the little stuff as usual. \"Your just pissed off that it wasn't something you could learn as well.\" Link says \"Ha ha ha ha ha. True, but any way we should probably take the time to tell every one in the village the situation about their kids.\" you respond. Link responds by nodding and saying \"We should split then. To make it quicker.\" \"Right, but we should go see Russel together.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You decide to tell the woman in the shop. As you suspected, she is playing with her cat looking depressed. As soon as she saw you she literately hopped over the counter and put you a bear hug that could crush the Hulk. \"Ooooohhh *sob* Tolray, your alright, Wheres Link, what happened to you *sob*, are you hurt, where are the kids, did you see the kids, please tell me their okay *sob*.\" As she was hitting me with a barrage of questions you managed to speak, but all that came out was a faint, \"Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh.\" She then looked a your face and saw you were turning purple. She then put you down and said sorry. That's when you told her about the children, her sad face then perks right up and she starts to cry again. You quickly jump back, afraid of the spine crushing hug. She then says thanks and offers you some potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll just head on over to Russel's house then.\" When you get there, Link already there. The two of you enter together and see Uli sitting in a chair, catering to her husband. \"Hey Uli, it's been while.\" You and Link say in unison \"*gasp* L-Link a-and T-Tolray, Oh thank the goddesses you two are okay.\" she sad not as surprised as every one else because she already knew of you journey to save the kids. You then explain what has happened so far, of course cutting out all of the extreme stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So the kids are at Kakariko Village, well that's good, Renado is a good friend of Bo. But it's unfortunate that the Gorons are they way you say they are, if' what you say is true, then I'm sure mayor Bo can help.\" Uli says with the little amount of joy in her voice. After a bit of chit chatting is done you say good bye and head to Bo's house. You Knock on the door and out comes Bo. Knowing what comes next, you immediately began spacing out, because unlike Link, you already know about Bo's secret room and past. Your skills as a hunter make you the perfect spy. So as soon as he opens the room and the three of you enter, you go and find the most comfortable spot in the room and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey Tolray, don't you want to know about this, I've never showed any one this room before.\" Bo asks \"No thanks, I already know about your secret past.\" You say with a grunt \"But..... uh.... how?\" asked a shocked Bo \"I like to spy on people, what else is the to do for me in this village.\" you reply. To the both Bo and Link sigh, as you fall back asleep. As you sleep all you see is darkness, then some weird symbols start flying towards you and as they get close to you they start vanishing. You then wake and whisper to your self \"What the hell?\" for two reasons, one about the dream, and the other about the first thing you saw when you woke up was Link with no shirt or shoes on and as for Bo he appeared to have nothing on, the only thing he was wearing was a thin peace of cloth around his pelvic area. \"Hmmm... what were those weird symbols? They kinda look like the ones on Midna's body and the ones on those twilight curtains we saw. Eh... oh well, back to sleep.\" you whisper to your self, not knowing that someone heard you from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's Thoughts)<br>\r\n  What did he mean by symbols? Why did he mention my body? Was he... having a dream about me.... no he also said something about the curtains of twilight. He also said that those so called \"symbols\" of his \"reminded\" him of mine. Hmmmmmm.... this one still continues to interest me. Wait way is my face warm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to sleeping beauty)<br>\r\n  You wake up to a thud, since your vision is a bit blurry you decide to ask \"It seems the match was decided, who won?\" as you say this you rub your eyes a bit, then you here a voice saying \"Take a look at who's still in the ring.\" You open your eyes and see Link in the ring rubbing the under side of his nose with his finger. \"Looks like I'll be taking those Iron Boots now, huh Bo.' says Link \"Aye, then I get the next weapon, huh Link.\" you respond with a hint of you saying 'ha ha, those things suck.' \"What!? uh um.... huh?\" Link responds by trying to come up with a way for you to not take the next weapon. \"Ha ha ha ha ahha h ah ah ah ha haah haha ha ha.\" a unionized laugh made by You and Bo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After a bit of chit chat with Bo, you and Link left for Kakariko Village. Upon getting there you remember that the place your about to traverse has a vast amount of fire. \"Hey Link, I think it would be better for you to have a shield made of metal.\" Before any one an say any thing else, the ground starts to shake. \"What the hell is going on?\" unionized question by the two heroes.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link lead Epona throught the final pass before getting to the village. Renado was beside the path beside Beth. Link stopped short of the two. \"What happened?!\" he asked. Beth seemed to be in tears, but she looked up at us, \"Those monsters took Colin!\" Renado nodded in agreement. \"They just ran up the path\" he explained. \"If you run know you might be able to catch them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink took no time in commanding Epona and rushing to the scene. As we passed the buildings, I saw Barnes with his mask down, standing still like a statue. He probably saw the fat pig but got scared. I laughed at this, but this moment wasn't a laughing matter. Colin was in danger. It was kinda hard not to fall off of Epona, I never rode a horse before. But, I was able to hang on by hanging onto Link. He looked back, \"Remind me to get a saddle for you next time we ride\" he said. I ignored his slightly humorous comment and tried my best to hang on. Soo enough, we reached the open field. Standing there on the hill, was the obese Bulbin himself, King Bulbin. He was riding this large boar with a head piece to it. King Bulbin also had a large staff with a flag flowing behind him. The next thing I saw made me mad, and I almost guarentee Link was too. Colin was tied to this pole like some trophy he won. I could actually feel Link's anger rise. King Bulbin chuckled at us but then reached for an object attached to his belt. It was a horn, a long white horn. He blew into it, creating a loud echoing sound that channeled through the open field. As called, several Bulbins came rushing in on pigs of their own. King Bulbin reared back on his boar and rode off. Link took no pause as he chased after him. There was no way that boar of his was faster than a horse, let alone Epona. We would rescue Colin and show that oversized freakshow what we're made of. But, there had to be a challenge. A arrow flew just inches above my head. I turned to see that all of his lackies at least had one archer. Great, another perfect opportunity to use my completely useless bow. Another arrow was shot but it missed us barely. It struck just where Epona's leg used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Link, we have a situation back here!\" I shouted. I got his attention, but he didn't bother to turn around. \"We have to get to Colin Tolray\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think I know that?! All I'm saying is that we are running around like moving targets!\" An arrow flew by us, but this one managed to catch a pieve of my clothing. Flames began to spread across my clothing and my skin began to burn. \"Oh, and did I forget to mention that the arrows are on FIRE?!\" I managed to put the fire out, but more and more Bulbins came after us. I had nothing to defend us with. Or so I thought. As I brushed the burned pieces of cloth, I brushed against my belt and pockets. I felt two things; the Gale Boomarang and my slingshot. A smile stretched across my face. I grabbed the Gale Boomarang, aimed carefully, and threw it. Three Bulbins went down along with their hogs. But there were still many left. All of them had an archer, and all of them had an arrow ready. They all shot at once, but all of them missed. Man, how lousy of a shot were these things? One was quicker on the reload and already cocked an arrow. Now, I was going to have a little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled out my slingshot and aimed right between the Bulbin's eyes. I let go just as I saw him get ready to let go. The seed hit it dead on, and the Bulbin archer collapsed. Just before he fell off, his arrow was released and hit the Bulbin beside him. I continued this for a while, but then we reached King Bulbin. Link drew his sword with his right hand as he held Epona's reigns in his left. Link managed a couple of slashes, but the he decided to go offensize as well. He grabbed what looked like a mixture of a lance and sword and raised it far above his head. Acting quickly, I grabbed Link's shield and got in front of the sword. It hit, but I was ready. He tried it several times, but I blocked it several times. Eventually he ran ahead of us and blew his horn again. I felt like I was getting more of a workout from this than Link was. We reached King Bulbin once again, but at the last second his last lacky shot and arrow. I had Link's shield in hand so on instinct I raised it. The arrow hit, but I soon learned the cost of my mistake. The shield burned up in my hands and now Link was defenseless. King Bulbin was laughing at us now and he prepared an attack. I looked ahead of us and saw that we were coming up on a bridge. King Bulbin swung down his attack, Link scared stiff. <i>Oh this is going to hurt...</i> I jumped in front of Link and was slammed by King Bulbin's attack. I was instantly knocked out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3rd person)<br>\r\nTolray was knocked aside from the blow by King Bulbin's massive weapon. Tolray's limp body landed harshly on the ground just as Link galloped past. Link was devestated but King Bulbin was laughing. His laughter caused Link to grasp his sword and deliever more blows to the king. They rode onto the bridge which soon was blocked by fire on both ends. Unknwon to Link, Midna was in Tolray's shadow. She popped up beside him and looked down at his motionless body. Although her entire body appeared to be a shadow, sadness and concern was in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's thoughts)<br>\r\nOh no! Tolray! Is he...is he....dead...? No! No, don't think about him! Its his fault he burned the shield and it was his fault he was hurt. I don't....I.....I-I-I don....I do! I do care about him! He was willing to risk himself to save me, now he risked his life to save Link! Please, please be okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Tolray's mind)<br>\r\nI saw nothing but darkness. I was surrounded by complete darkness. I wasn't scared, I was actually glad to be here. It had a....homey feeling... Several symbols flew by me again and again. Some looked foreign, but others looked familiar. One was getting small enough and seemed to want to wrap around my right arm. I pushed it away. Besides that, everything seemed right. However, something in the air seemed troubling. I could hear cries of some kind. It sounded like an older woman, it sounded familiar. Distant, but familiar. But then, everything became silent. The silence was broken by a loud and shrill scream that rung my eardrums. I had no idea what was causing it, but it stopped as soon as it started. \"What is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome light filled the darkness and cast a beam of it straight onto the floor. What was in the light caught my attention. It appeared to be Midna, her back facing me. She seemed to be passed out and in pain. I quickly ran over to her and gently picked her up. \"Midna...are you...?\" I was cut off as her head turned, revealing her face. It wasn't a face, it was a full on scary helmet. Suddenly a black force launched me away and evil laughter filled the room. Midna's body slowly shifted into that of a robed man, by the sound of the laughter. <i>\"You pathetic human\"</i> it said, <i>\"You trust this being but she will use you as a common sword. Once it gets dull and rusted, she'll throw it away for a new one.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\" I replied. \"She saved me before I died. If she was like that she would have left me to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh....she saved you?\"</i> The strange man laughed slightly at first, but then he broke out into a full fledged insane laughter. <i>\"The dear Midna saved a lowly human of the light world, but fails to help her people. Watch yourself....she will treat you like trash...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had enough of this guy. I charged towards him but heard a voice....\"Tolray, please tell me your alright.\" It sounded...like Midna. Light entered my eyes and I found myself facing the sky. I sat up, expecting Midna. But I saw Malo and Beth. \"What...what happened?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I sat up and looked around. I was inside the one house that I first saw them in. I noticed that only Beth and Malo were inside. \"Thank goodness you're awake\" said Beth. \"We thought you would never wake up. After Link saved Colin, we found you collapsed on the ground. We feared the worse, but Renado took care of you.\" I got up and grabbed my stuff. The kids seemed to know what we were planning on doing next, so they left for their own thing. I watched as Link walked back with a relieved smile. He joined us and we headed towards Death Mountain. I noticed on his back was a metal shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you took my advice and got a new shield\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did\" he replied. \"But this time, you paid for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole out of my wallet for those lanterns, so I grabbed some of your Rupees out from your wallet. Oh, and by the way, Midna was worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI usually would be mad, but hearing that kind of cooled me down. The thing that the creep in my dream mentioned about her. What about her people? What....exactly is Midna? Is she of some importance. My thought were stopped when I walked into the cliff. Link started to climb up the grate once again, rechallenging the Goron. Midna popped up beside me. I noticed that she seemed to try and ignore me. Was it something I tried against the Bulbins? She looked up, \"I don't think Link will win this time.\" As on cue, Link fell off the cliff once again. I chuckled, \"That's Goron: 2, Link: 0\" Link got up and brushed himself off. He looked around but glared at Midna. She pointed down, where his Iron Boots were. Link put them on and started to climb up the grate. I never thought Link could climb while wearing those heavy boots. But, he made it to the top. I heard rumbling at the top, and the Goron fell over the edge instead. He kept on rolling down the path to Kakariko Village. I climbed my way up, and saw another Goron fall over. As soon as I reached the top, two more Gorons fell over the edge. Link grabbed my hand and pulled me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I visited here when it was covered in Twilight, I lead the way. We passed through the steam vents with ease since I knew the path. We passed that howling stone again, but this time I couldn't here anything coming from it. Either it was only my shadow beast form or there was no longer anything inside it. The ground rumbled some more, but it was nothing major. Soon enough, we reached the clearing. This time, we could see the amount of Gorons guarding the Mountain. I caught a pair at the top with my eyes, one was on the other's back and he was launched up the edge. The Goron then rolled into the cave up top. \"Hey Link\" I said while walking forward, \"I think i know how to...\" The ground shook greatly, causing Link to stumble a little. A large shadow loomed over me, and I looked up. Before I noticed it, I slipped and a giant rock fell where I used to be. I could still feel the heat coming off of it. Man, good thing I slipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's thought's)<br>\r\nD-Did....did he notice...? No....good....he didn't know it was me. Why am I so worried over him? And why did I confess over him when no one was around? Is he...is he really that....special...to me...? No, he can't be. Although I can't be so sure anymore....I keep saying no but I always end up helping him....what's wrong with me...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to Tolray)<br>\r\nAfter a exhausting climb up, we made it to the mine entrance. Along the way we noticed that there was this spring near the bottom. All of the Gorons at the bottom were friendly, unlike the ones we've met up the mountain. Trust me, you don't know how many times I was punched by those oversized boulders. There was even a shop down there. They sold arrows, but nothing to fix my bow. I guess I had to stick with my hunting knife and Gale Boomerang. We walked through the entrance, but we both regretted it. Six Gorons were beginning to charge at us. They began to roll, and we cowarded. \"STOP!\" shouted a voice. We looked behind two Gorons, and noticed a smaller one. This one looked like he had hair growing out of the sides of his head, but was still bald. \"Must we gang up on these humans all at once little brothers?\" he asked. Link stepped up as well as I. \"I'm impressed humans, I never would have guessed you made it this far\" he said. \"My name is Cor Goron. I am the...current leader of the Gorons. Ever since out Patriarch was transformed and sealed him away, I took charge. But soon afterward the mountain has began to erupt violently. Seeing you here means you want to go into the mines. Of course humans are not allowed to enter.\" Link approached him even closer, and Cor Goron smiled. \"Very well, let us see what strength you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sumo match was inevitable, Link won. This time he remembered the Iron Boots. The elder was easily beaten, but they never seemed to notice the boots. No wonder Bo won their friendship, they were too dumb to realize that those boots were the real source. Of course, we were allowed access. But, they would only truly accept our friendship if we help their Patriarch. I didn't need Midna, I knew that the Fused Shadow was obviously to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll tell you what, they don't call it Death Mountain for nothing. It was unbearably hot inside! Lava was flowing like rivers inside this oven! Link seemed content, but I couldn't stand it. I never was good with heat. But, if he can go through with it, so could I. Some of the equipment around the mine required Goron weight. Link took care of that with those Iron Boots. Thankfully Midna's abilities allowed us to quickly change them off and on so we wouldn't be held back with putting them on. Another thing to add, I am useless in this place! Sure I could defeat a few of those Fire Slugs hanging from the ceiling, but those giant lizard things were tough! They could only be injured by hitting their tail. And since I had no real way of injuring them, guess who had to distract them. No other explanation needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weirder part about the mine was that there was this area that you could see the sky. And it looked like Gorons couldn't go throught there, so how did they get here? As we walked through, a flaming arrow flew by my head and hit the rock beside me. The only things with flaming arrows were the Bulbins. Link and I ducked behind a large crate big enough for both of us. \"Still think their angry about injuring their leader?\" asked Link. I turned the corner but was greeted by a barrage of flaming arrows. \"Does that answer your question?\" I threw the Gale Boomerang to distract them as we ran past them. We entered the other room and stopped. I really wished I had a bow in working order. Link continued on and I followed. Eventually, we entered this large room. There was this large rock in the center and it was attached to the ceiling. Link stepped on and the rock suddenly fell. I ran towards the edge but stopped short. The giant rock was now floating in lava. A jump from here could end up making me fall into the lava. But Link had more trouble; he wasn't the only one on the rock. There was the big Goron covered in armor across from him. And when I say big, I mean he is MASSIVE! Link drew his sword at the ready, but his footing began to slip. The Goron guard begn walking closer to him. The rock itself was tilting down where the Goron was. The rock had this shiny surface which was underneath them both. The guard walked closer and closer, causing the rock to tilt further and further. If this kept up Link would eventually fall into the lava. Weird, the Goron didn't have any problems with falling. That's it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link your Iron Boots!\" I shouted. Link understood and put them on. Now, he was able to stand up. The Goron switched tactics and rolled towards him. I smiled, and I knew Link was smiling. He grabbed the Goron and threw him over the edge. The Goron screamed in pain but landed back on the rock. The battle got boring when it continued the same way. But finally, the Goron guard stood down. The lave rose and I was able to step across without falling or sliping off. The Goron guard said something to us, but I didn't really pay attention. He said something about three elders and pieces of a key. Then, he said something about the hero's lost weapon. Link thanked him and we left to the back room. Inside was a pillar of rocks with rock steps. At the top of the pillar was a chest. Together, Link and I opened it. Inside, was a bow! I grabbed it and pulled back on the string. Tightly wound and in perfect condition. But, there was something else inside the chest. It was a bow string. I handed the Hero's Bow to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their is a bow string in the chest. You can have this one and I can just use the string to fix mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink accepted it and I began to fix my bow. Just because I had a bow with a string already attached doesn't mean I can't fix a bow of my own. With one final tweak, I now have a actual bow. Link might need a little training but I could teach him. \"Let's go save the Patriarch\" said Link. \"And get the Fused Shadow\" I said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(to note, I may actually speed this chapter up a bit.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get back to the main mines, we needed to go back. And to go back, we would need to cross the Bulbins again. But, this time I was ready. I had a quiver full of arrows and a newly strung bow. Link would deflect the arrows and I would shoot mine. The Bulbins were powerful in numbers, that was for sure. But alone, they were as much of a threat as Midna. They are only annoying, not violent. However, the Bulbins were the easiest of the threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of these rooms were these strange ancient machines that revolved their \u201cheads.\u201d They were called Beamos, and they shot out a laser from their \u201ceye\u201d whenever you approached them too close. And distracting it and trying to destroy it with a sword didn\u2019t work. You can ask Link to see how that turned out. No, the only weakness to those things is by shooting an arrow into the red eye. Once it hit, it deactivates permanently. Those things were so annoying. But those Beamos were not as annoying as some of the rooms in the mine. There was these few areas with magnetic stone and only Link could cross it since he had the Iron Boots. Me, I just had to sit and wait. I\u2019m sure Midna was with me, but I guess she didn\u2019t really want to talk. I still couldn\u2019t get her out of my mind. That strange\u2026man said some pretty disturbing things. Minda\u2026she was hiding something. I wouldn\u2019t let that get between the trust I have for her, but still she was hiding something. But, I had to admit, everyone has secrets. So I might as well respect hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the three pieces of the keys was relatively easy. The Gororn elders were not exactly what I realized. I thought that we would have to challenge them or something, but the three were very small and seemed kind of weak. I didn\u2019t even know how they could possibly get that far into the mines. But, nevertheless, we got all three pieces. They fit perfectly into a single rounded key. The final room had a very large door with the keyhole in the exact shape of the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot everything we need?\u201d asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy quiver is full of arrows, got the Gale Boomerang ready in case we need it, I\u2019m ready\u201d I replied. \u201cStill have your shield?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink raised it up, making it presentable. \u201cYou know, they never told us how the Patriarch was changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, based on the facts that Death Mountain keeps erupting, and the increased lava flow, my guess is that the Patriarch must have mutated to where he is now living heat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTolray, you\u2019re my friend, but sometimes you can be such a nerd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed sarcastically and inserted the key inside the hole. The lock let loose a might creak as the tumbler unlocked. The lock fell to the ground with a thump, and the door opened. Link and I faced each other, nodded, and ran inside. We entered the room, and immediately I strung by bow. It was very dark in this room, not a single source of light to be found. However, I heard two things. One was a deep and loud breathing. The next thing I heard was the door behind us shutting and locking quickly. The breathing became stuttered, meaning whatever was in here was beginning to wake up. Link gasped, obviously in slight fear. I turned ahead and saw what he saw. Whatever it was, it was big, muscular, black, and sure as hell scary. Its arms and legs were chained to the ground. The only distinct feature I could see was this weird helmet. A gemstone in the center of the helmet began to glow a bright yellow. As the gem was glowing, two eyes began to appear as well. He growled at first, but then he roared at us, trying to get closer. But the chains were restraining him. He seemed to notice this, pulling at the chains slightly. I laughed at this, meaning he would never be able to hit us. Suddenly, his black body burst into flames. Link put his shield up and I ducked behind it with him. One by one, the four sets of chains that held him down were now broke. He roared at us, his breath and heat clearly a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidna\u2026mind telling us what this guy is?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is the Twilit Igniter, Fyrus\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFyrus began to charge at us, but we separated. However he charged after me. Luckily I cocked my bow when I had the chance. I shot an arrow and tried to aim it at his body. But the flames burned the arrow quickly. This guy wasn\u2019t going to be easy to hit. I noticed that his head was always at an angle towards me when he was charging. The gemstone on his helmet had a black slit in it\u2026almost like an eye\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea struck me, whether it was dumb or not. I cocked another arrow and shot it at the gemstone. Energy blasted out from the gem and Fyrus roared. He began to run around the small room while holding his \u201ceye.\u201d The chains drug behind him, some scrapped up the dirt of the floor. I noticed that the floor was blue and shiny, like those rocks. Link thought of the same thing as I saw him put on the Iron Boots and grab a chain. With a large yank, Fyrus crashed into one of the pillars and collapsed. The flames surrounding his body were gone. I ran up near his head and saw that he was weak at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLink! Hit the gemstone on his forehead! That\u2019s his weak spot!\u201d I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had trouble getting his boots off. I knew why, Midna wasn\u2019t helping him. \u201cMidna help him!\u201d I shouted. Her shadow popped up beside mine, \u201cYou two need to learn to not constantly use me. After all, you\u2019re my slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well your not royalty, but you sure are acting like a royal b-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suddenly grabbed by Fyrus. I could tell it was him, nothing else in the room was that big. I tried to fight his grip, but his flames reignited again. The pain was unbearable! My entire chest was burning like it was being dipped in lava! He threw me into a wall hard. My back nearly shattered on impact. \u201cUh\u2026the pain\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna\u2019s thoughts)<br>\r\nOh no! Tolray! What have I done?! If I would have listened to him, he wouldn\u2019t be hurt! Oh no! Fyrus is going to kill him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to Tolray)<br>\r\nThe pain was too great, but I could see what was coming. Fyrus was nearly inches from my face. He opened his mouth and let loose a very loud roar. I could feel the heat, and smell his breath. But this was no time to make jokes. I tried to reach for my bow, but my arm was in too much pain. Suddenly, something shot from behind me and stuck the gemstone. Fyrus was too surprised and in pain that he fell backwards. Link was back there with his sword at the ready. I couldn\u2019t see what was happening, everything was blurry. But, I could hear Link using the final blow and Fyrus roaring in pain. The roaring stopped, and then the room began to light up. An explosion of a black mass occurred and then everything seemed to be calm. A blob of green approached me next. \u201cHey man, you don\u2019t look so good.\u201d That was all I heard before I passed out.</span></div></div>",

He should be fine in about two or three hours.\" said the same blob. \"Thank you.\" Said a green blob, obviously Link. Tolrays vision went black as he fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In Tolrays mind.)<br>\r\n  \"What the hell happened? Where am I? How did I get this burn..... Oh right, Fyrus.\" Appears in a dark void, then visions of an odd looking woman go by. \"Who is this?\" Visions of the woman continue to go by. She is now seen with a man with a cloak, a short sword, and a bit of a beard. \"Who are these people?\" The visions of the people stop playing and Tolray finds him self in an odd looking room. A voice speaks to him. \"\"These images you saw will be seen again. Only when the secret is to be reveled.\"\" \"Who are you what secret?\" \"\"In time..... In time you will know it all.\" Tolrays visions then stop and all he sees is an endless black void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to the real world) <br>\r\n  Little did Tolray know, but he was being watched over by Midna. \"This is my fault.

Now that I was aware, I looked at my surroundings. I was in the Goron Hot Springs. I was capable of looking down, seeing that my clothes were now burned and a large burn the shape of a hand was on my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will take a while to heal\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it looks cool\u201d said Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you don\u2019t have all of this pain. Did we at least get the Fused Shadow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded as he held his hand up. The Fused Shadow looked like a piece of ancient armor. A hand formed out of Link\u2019s shadow and grabbed it. The Fused Shadow disappeared along with the hand. Midna popped up and glared at me. \u201cWay to go Tolray, without you Link had to fight Fyrus all by himself. You should really try to focus on what I ask of you instead of other\u2019s well being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Minda\u2019s thoughts)<br>\r\nOuch\u2026that hurt. But I can\u2019t let him get even the slightest hint that I care for him. No matter how much it hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Real world)<br>\r\nMidna seemed like she did not want to say that. Who am I kidding? Of course she meant that, she cares for no one but herself and what she wants. The pain was going away faster than I anticipated. I was now capable of sitting up. Link kneeled beside me, \u201cThere is also someone here that wants to apologize.\u201d He turned as a large shadow began to loom over me. In front of me stood the biggest Goron I have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to thank you for freeing me\u201d he said in the deepest voice I have ever heard. \u201cMy name is Darbus, I am the Patriarch of the Gorons. I would espically like to apologize to you young human, for your efforts helped your friend to defeat me without causing any fatalities. But you suffer from the major burn that I delivered while I was a monster. I hope you could forgive my foolishness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised that a large and muscular Goron like him was actually asking for forgiveness. \u201cIt is fine Brother Darbus\u201d I said, trying to sound like a Goron, \u201cYou were unable to control your actions.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Goron Springs work wonders. The pain in my chest vanished completely, but it took a couple of hours. I honestly did not mind. Some of the Goron kids took interest in what I've done. I'm usually not the bragging type, but it felt good to talk about the battle. If I ever had a kid, I would tell them the story of this adventure. I could tell it was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were mobile, Link and I entered the village. Of course, I had a repeat of what happened at the springs. While I was telling the story, Renado treated my burn. He said it shouldn't become a problem for me, but it could be permanent. I actually did not mind at all. Before we left, we restocked on supplies. We even got something new. Barnes, the guy that always wears that metal mask, makes bombs. He's actually useful for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were prepared, we climbed onto Epona and rode off. The vast field seemed more peaceful without those Bulbins. I'm surprised that the bridge stayed in one peace too. However I ate my own words when we finished crossing. A red portal formed above the bridge. With a blast of black energy, a large chunk of the bridge was destroyed. Not only that, but three Shadow Beasts now loomed around. I wonder why Midna couldn't stay in daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we turn back?\" Link asked while he tugged on the reigns. Epona seemed spooked, not likely able to move back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the bomb bag filled with our new bombs and began to tinker them with my arrows. Link looked over my shoulder, but he was a little late. I aimed the bow to where the creatures were. With a quick release, my arrow soared into the sky with a following trail of smoke. The arrow landed in the middle of the monsters with a large explosion. A blue portal formed from the bits of the creatures. Link looked both shocked and impressed, \"What did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I combined my arrows with the bombs to make, what I call bomb arrows. Tis a good new weapon... and the best part is that I can switch these out with regular arrows, and you will still be able to throw the bombs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled and signaled Epona to move forward. But she wouldn't move closer. Link and I both looked up, the curtain of Twilight was upon us. \"Do you think Epona will change with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shook his head sadly. We both climbed off of Epona. I managed to approach the curtain, but Link did not. He stayed with Epona for a while, petting her mane gently. The scene was sweet, but there was someone who always ruins it. Midna popped up beside me, \"Hurry up! We need to keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. She could taunt me until I was in deep pain, maybe even about my feelings, but she will not taunt Link. I turned to face her, \"That's enough! You don't understand, and you will never understand! Epona has been with Link since they were young! Why are you so mean to us?! We are helping you willingly! Why can't you be like everyone and have a heart?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna stood somewhat shocked. It felt bad, but it was true. Midna shakingly lowered her head, \"I will leave you alone...\" With that, she disappeared into my shadow. Link looked at me with a hint of disappointment in his stare. I would be too, it almost seemed like Midna was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna)<br>\r\nTears were beginning to form in my eyes. \"Why...Why did he say that...?\" I asked myself. \"Do I really seem that cruel to them...?\" My voice was being called, I needed to calm myself. I dried the tears and reformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Tolray)<br>\r\nMidna reappeared from my shadow. \"Let me guess, you two need my help [i]again[/i].\" I was sort of relieved that she wasn't effected. But I sort of wished that she would ease up a little. Midna passed over into the curtain, and the process repeated itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna went on my back still, but something was off. She didn't make a comment saying the Twilight was better than the light, she didn't make some remark to make us go faster, she didn't do any of the regular stuff. She was...quiet.\u00a0Link and I were both surprised, but we kept running. I had no idea where we were, well at least until we saw something. It was a castle, Hyrule Castle. We basically returned from where we once were. Midna was utterly shocked, but never spoke a word. I was getting worried now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink suddenly stopped as we ran. I turned around to see him sniffing a bag. The bag looked familiar, but it was a little too dark to see. Link, however, must have caught the scent. His head shot up, his ears perked, and his eyes shot open. \"...Illia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately knew what he felt. Link loved Illia, and some say she does back. Like a bolt of lightning, Link shot off with great speed. I had trouble catching up, and Midna was having a hard time staying on. It seemed like Illia's scent was trailing towards the castle. However Link's timing was almost perfect, as he ran heartless into the energy walls of those traps. Luckily I didn't need to do much but use an energy field. Link quickly ran inside with me following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was amazed. Sure I knew Hyrule Castle was a nice sight to see, but I saw the many souls wander through the town. The first thing Midna spoke surprised me, \"It's sad to see creatures live like this..,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe weren't that weak to be called creatures, but what she said was true. All of the people in Castle Town were not aware of the curtain of Twilight. It was sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe followed Link to what looked like a bar. I used my senses so I could see what he saw. Sitting right there, was Illia. Sitting next to her seemed to be a Zora child. A Zora was a humanoid fish-like creature that is seen around vast amounts of water. But this one seemed very sick. Link was staring directly at Illia sitting in front of her. Midna looked down at me, \"I overheard a few guards over there. They said something about the lake. We should listen in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will... But I don't think Link will. Should we leave him here...?\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing. Of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes and walked towards the table. The guards around it marked a bridge on the map. \"Alright\" the head solider started, \"The water for the lake seems to have disappeared. People cannot go to the Goddess shrine until then. We cross this bridge here to investigate the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left after that to find Link. He seemed more determined to stop the Twilight from taking over this area. I briefly explained the situation as we left the tavern. We had to fight a few enemies on the way over but we made it to the bridge. A weird smell passed over my nose but I ignored it as we walked over. However the smell kept coming back. \"Hey\" Midna said, \"Do you smell something?\" Link and I sniffed the ground. It smelled like...lantern oil! Link began to growl, catching our attention. A Twilit Bulbin was on the other side. In his hands was a bow, cocked and loaded with a flaming arrow. He shot it to the the other side. A trail of flames started behind us. Then, he shot another arrow in the front. So now, there were two trails of flames coming at us from both ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?!\" shouted Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing on instinct, I pushed Link towards the edge. The flames were coming on faster than I expected. I grabbed Midna, gently, and placed her on his back. \"What are you doing?\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saving you.\" I pushed them over the edge, the lake should have broken their fall. I prepared to jump, but the flames caught up. I howled in pain as the flames burned my back legs and tail. In a last ditch effort, I jumped. But the pain was so great that I faded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Something short...a bit busy lately)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My vision was blurry, my lower body coursing with pain. My eyes eventually adjusted to the faded light from the Twilight clouds. One thing was that I was underwater. The second, I was in my aquatic form. Thirdly, I was on the sandy floor. I tried to move but it hurt. I managed to swim to the surface before I stopped. \"Tolray!\" I managed to turn to see Link swimming out with Midna on his back. He gently grabbed me by his mouth, swam back to shore, and gently let me down. \"Tolray...are you okay?\" he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, \"I just feel really weak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you change forms?\" asked Midna. I could have sworn I saw a bit of concern on her face, but I think that was just my eyes playing tricks. But anyway I was going to try anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused on my wolf form, but I was greet with pain instead of the usual warm feeling. I screamed a bit but it did not last long. I took a look at myself, I managed to change into a bat but nothing else. \"I...this is all I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely I felt myself being lifted. Even more to my surprise was that it was Midna doing it. She carefully placed me onto Link's back. Both Link and I looked at each other strangely but we ignored it as he walked off. \"What happened to all of the water?\" Midna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guards...\" I managed, \"Said there was...something wrong...near the top of the spring. Something about...Zoras...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Midna, how can we get out?\" Link spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused me to look around. I've heard of this lake, but even if the water level was at it's normal height we couldn't get out. We could try to warp out, but we would have to cross that flaming bridge. We were in a hole, literally. My eyes caught a small spirit to what looked like a building. \"Hey Link, try there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir attention was caught onto the small blue flame. I was still to weak to understand the spirit; once again I was too weak. Despite not being able to see, my ears detected something else. It was a Bulbin, a Twilit Bulbin. Link and Midna soon joined me. Link headed to the monster. As we traveled, I could have sworn I saw Midna looking at me. But I ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Midna's thoughts)<br>\r\n<i>This human, Tolray...he's different. He saved his friend and me, and hurt himself. Why would he sacrifice so much to those around him? Does he even care for himself?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Reality)<br>\r\nThe monster encounter was different than most. Instead of it attacking us, it grabbed a hawk reed and blew into it. It was strange, I have never seen a monster do that. But my confidence drained with the answer, and the answer was a loud unnatural shrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying down was a large, monstrous bird. At least I thought it was; it's face looked more like a flower than anything. But that wasn't the worst part. The monster that called it, was now riding on that thing's back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dove at us but luckily Link dodged it. I no longer had the pain but I did not think I could fly. \"Sorry Link, looks like you're going to fight this one on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fine, Link has this.\" We were once again surprised by Midna's words. Did I say something that caused all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs were stood in shock, that gave the monstrous bird an opening. Link was swiftly knocked to the side. He let out a large grunt when he landed. That tore it; pain or no pain, I was NOT going to sit there and watch my friend get hurt. I took to the air despite the pain. I swarmed around the monster controlling it, hitting it with my wings. I wish I had a mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could stop I was swatted away. I fell to the ground in terrible pain, new and old. I felt like I was finished. However, I heard the monster bird screech; not in anger, but in pain. I looked to see Link attacking the beast. The rider was knocked off, soon replaced with another rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird shook heavily and roared as it tried to shake Midna off. \"Stop!\" she spoke, \"I'm your master now!\" The creature stopped, allowing the sudden change. Link and I exchanged looks before staring in awe. \"Hey\" she spoke, \"Do you think that we could use this to get up to the top?\" she asked. We both nodded but wasn't sure how we were going to get there. Midna suddenly grabbed Link and took off. I was suddenly teleported right in front of her. She looked down at me and smiled. I just hung on as we flew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip up was not as easy as what we thought. Several Twilit Bulbins were perched in the rocky tunnel, armed with bomb arrows. Thankfully Midna had better control of that bird than that monster. She evaded the falling stalactites and crumbling columns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird dropped us off on a little hill beside a small shack. Link had a rougher drop off but we all made if safely. I was feeling better, but I did not think I could change to a wolf or fly. I shifted into a snake so I was at least mobile. Midna and I climbed onto Link's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it...cold?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel it too. And I was sure Midna was feeling it as well. But she glared at me a bit; I guess she was never taught that huddling together helps. I instead coiled around Link, providing a bit of warmth. \"Hey look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way I gestured was an icy cavern. I was sure that that was where Zoras were once. But we turned to Midna to decide.</span></div></div>",

But when we entered the center, red structures fell from the sky; creating a ring around us. Red energy flowed between them, trapping us inside. \"Be warned...a creature of darkness...it approaches...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now she tells us...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red portal formed above us. One single thing dropped out before it disappeared. A black creature with markings, like me, landed on the ground with a loud thump. Most creatures from this world cannot survive a fall like that. But then again, <i>that</i> wasn't a creature from this world. It stood up on fours, so we could get a good look at it. It's entire head looked like some weird shield. The back of it's head had hair-like tendrils. The rest seemed human...more or less. But, the real problem was it's size. Most of the enemies we faced before were my size. This thing was at least a head taller than a human. I changed into a bat and flew higher, knowing I couldn't do anything. Link, on the other hand, growled directly at the beast. He leapt and bit the monster's shoulder. It screamed in pain but quickly ripped Link off. Before I could check on him, the shadow beast grabbed me. It squeezed me within it's hand, attempting to crush me. I don't know what it was, but something was flowing up my throat. It rushed to my mouth, straining to come out. I wasn't sure what it was, but I opened my mouth anyway. A loud screech came out and hit the Shadow Beast dead on. It caused it to throw me away and cover what probably could be ears. I flapped before hitting the ground, saving myself. I smiled on the inside and screeched loudly. The beast kept his position; hands over ears and not paying attention. I only stopped when I saw Link rush in. With one final pounce, Link bit the beast's neck. It went down with a scream of pain. It burst, but then all of the particles flew towards the sky. A blue portal formed, but nothing came out. It just stayed there. I turned to Link and I saw him drinking the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing tasted horrible!\" he said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The spring slowly started to glow. A round orb of light suddenly appeared out from the surface. Then, a beast made of light slowly started to form. It resembled one of those sheep we have back at the ranch. Link's been rammed by one of those so many times I'm surprised that he still offers to herd them. But anyway, Link's and my attention was focused on this beast of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ordana...\" it said with a calm voice. \"I am one of the four goddesses that watch over Hyrule. You two are well aware that the power of Twilight has drawn across this land like a large shroud. Sacred blue-eyed beast, you are the lost hero that is meant to save both worlds; the one of light and the one of darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why is Link supposed to save the world of darkness?\" I asked. \"And how do I fit into all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young heroes, you were transformed into these creatures due to the power of the Twilight Realm. The power of the goddesses protected you Link, from turning into a lost spirit. Dear companion to the hero, your prevention from being transformed into a spirit are unknown to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Ordana\" asked Link, \"Will we ever return to our normal forms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As of now you two are under the effect of the massive curtain of Twilight. Nothing here can return you to normal. However, there may be another way. Go within the curtain and find the next goddess at the spring. She might be able to help you there. But be warned, the woods you once knew have been transformed.\" Ordana slowly began to fade, \"Go back were you were first transformed, then all will be revealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spring returned to normal. Link and I were stunned. Midna popped up in front of us both, \"Well aren't you special...\" she said. \"Too bad only one of you is special...\" I tried to give her a dirty look but it's hard when you have no mouth and only eyes. \"Anyway, I told you were supposed to go to the curtain. When we're there I'll pull you in. Come on get to it!\" Midna disappeared into Link's shadow and we were off. We could see the curtain, it was slightly closer. Before we approached it, Link stopped. He turned up to me, \"You might want to hold onto me. I don't think Midna can grab us both.\" I nodded and shifted into my snake form. I curled lightly around Link's neck as he ran in closer. When we were close enough, Midna appeared once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...aren't we a little in a hurry for hugs?\" she said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't my friend to be left behind\" said Link. \"Even if I'm the sacred beast, I don't want Tolray to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised my head and some of my body up, \"But there's a little more room if you want one as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna gave me a glare when both Link and I chuckled. \"Are you two ready or not?!\" We nodded our heads and Midna passed through the curtain. A large orange hand busted through the barrier and grabbed us. Quite harshly might I add. Once we were through I uncoiled from Link's neck and slithered forward a bit more. I turned and laughed. Midna was on Link's back as usual, but she had that shield and sword. Only, she was wearing the shield on her face. \"So these are the weapons you humans use to smite creatures in your world?\" She unsheathed the sword and swung it a few times. Every time barely touched Link's head. She threw the shield down onto Link's head and threw the sword down. It barely got me. \"I have no use for these but I'll hang onto them for you.\" With a snap of her fingers, the sword and shield changed into black energy that was sucked into that mask on her head. Great, so we not only did those errands for nothing but we also have a new unlimited storage space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe traveled to the next spring but we ran into three more of those creatures. Midna taught Link this energy thing that allowed him to attack multiple enemies in a area. Once we arrived at the spring, we met the goddess. However, she wasn't in her full glory. Only a swirling black cloud of light was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sacred beast...\" she said weakly. \"You must collect my scattered light.\" A shimmering ball of light appeared beside Link and a small plant appeared. \"Across these woods are bugs invisible to those of sight. These bugs of evil carry my shattered light. Collect the Tears of Light and place them within the vessel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink made his way over and I tried to. \"Companion...this is a task for one...you must stay.\" I nodded and slithered back to a more comfortable position. I found a whole new respect for snakes now. I just realized something, Ordana never said why I was protected. \"Excuse me goddess...\" I said, \"But why am I a feature of Twilight when I should be a spirit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(For those of you about to add, could you please leave the second slot alone. I'm planning on adding to that later.)</span></div></div>",

Well, she's the only one \"within\" Link's shadow. But, why or how do I have a connection with her? I mean, I was born here and she was born...well technically here but in the Twilight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took slightly shorter than I expected for Link and Midna to get back. The Vessel looked more curved than before and it was glowing. The Vessel of Light slowly floated off of Link and landed into the spring. Light finally appeared over the land. Midna was now more in her shadowy form and floated in front of us. \"I don't really get the big deal is with the light anyway\" she said. \"The darkness of Twilight was just fine.\" She then laughed and flew back into Link's shadow. A glowing orb rose out from the lake as it began to glow. A creature began to form from the surrounding light. I had no idea what the creature was, but whatever it was called it had a really long tail. It completely circled it and ended above it's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am one of the four spirits that protect these lands\" it said. \"I am known as Faron. Both of you were transformed by the power of the Twilight. Most who enter the black world of shadow never return to their original forms. However, each of you have \u00a0a power within you, that has been protecting you. O brave hero, look upon your new form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see Link, but never expected to see him Human. What else was different was his outfit. He was wearing a green tunic along with matching shorts, boots, and a hat. \"That tunic once belonged to the legendary hero that once saved this land\" continued Faron. \"However, your friend wasn't as fortunate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that Faron was now talking about me. I looked down at my hands, nothing seemed wrong. But, on my right arm, was this marking. It looked like something from those creatures's faces but had several branching arms out. I regretted it, I looked at my reflection in the water. I was wearing a brown shirt with similar colored pants. I had this blue hood piece on that currently covered my head and part of my face. I just wish it covered up more. My left eye wasn't human. It was completely black with a demonic red eye. If that wasn't enough, black markings crawled down my face from my eye. I looked up at Link, who flinched back after he saw me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you still have a hold on your Shadow Beast form\" said Faron. \"I tried my best to return you to human. Now, a great evil sleeps within the temple in these woods. Link, chosen hero of the gods, please extinguish this evil before it unleashed into the world.\" With that, Faron disappeared and the spring returned to it's former self.</span></div></div>",
