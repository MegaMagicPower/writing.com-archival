The content filter helps, but I honestly don't see why everyone has to be doing the same thing in a hundred different stories. If you like that kind of stuff, why don't you just add on to someone else's story? The same goes for all of the other fetishes: voraphilia, macrophilia, anthropomorphic animals, weight gain, etc. Just lump them all together into a single interactive, and leave the rest of the site to the people who actually write stuff other than cliched fetishistic garbage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another one that gets me is anime fan-fiction. For every sketch ever drawn in Japan, for every Saturday-morning cartoon, there are at least five different interactives... each containing roughly five chapters. Mostly it's the mainstream stuff: Yu-Gi-Oh, pokemon, Naruto, digimon, One Piece, Naruto, more Naruto... you get the point. Of course, every so often, I run across some incredibly obscure fan-fiction interactive with some unpronounceable name like \"Yekibatsu Shonimari\". Those ones make me sad, because it is clear that the people who wrote them will probably never see a single chapter added on to them, leaving them all alone in their obscure fandom, hoping that they might meet a fellow fan at the next anime convention, who doesn't mistake their painstakingly-crafted Yurimari sword replica for a mere katana...<br>\r\nBut I digress. These anime interactives have their place on this website, and are, for the most part, legitimate. What bothers me, though, is that some people decide to combine their favorite anime with their favorite obscure fetish. This leads to interactives with such titles as \"Naruto Foot Worship\", \"Get Shrunk with Digimon\", and \"Sexy Yekibatsu Shonimari Hairy-Ankled Smoking Nurses Get Spanked!\". The scary thing is, that last one could very easily be an actual interactive title...</span></div></div>",

Before I even got to start freshman year at High Tech High, and make gamer friends, Mom went through a financial crisis, and since she's self-employed, only she takes the brunt. She said \"I know what you're thinking, but this roommate is a gamer too! You can play together and talk about stuff you found out!\" Little did I know he wasn't a real gamer, just a Call of Duty fanboy. Greeeeaaaaat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's wrong with this guy if he's a gangster wannabe and a CoDfag though? He sounds harmless... Ohohoho, you don't understand.<br>\r\n-His dad is a pothead and a deadbeat dad, and he taught him how to be a douchebag.<br>\r\n-He uses the word gay as an insult SO DAMNED MUCH that it's rubbing off on me! (and I'm not homophobic, I'm a supporter)<br>\r\n-Pop quiz: how long does it take for \"Freaking Fadoodle\" to get annoying? BAAAAAA time's up, it always was annoying.<br>\r\n-He's pathetic. his dad has had to rent guest rooms since his son was born, and the mom was ditched for a Snookie impersonator.<br>\r\n-He won't STFU about Jersey Shore. You heard that right. His FAVORITE show on ALL television is Jersey. Fucking. Shore.<br>\r\n-He is an abusive brother. Whenever his (also annoying) brother plays Black Ops Zombies shittilly, he gets threatened and when I'm gone, he CHOKES HIM!!! For crying after being yelled at for NOT BEING INSTINCTIVELY PRO AT FUCKING ZOMBIES. What a horrible person!<br>\r\n-He is stupid, as if you couldn't guess. His grades? Pfft. He can't make a full sentence without gay, bitch, or retard.<br>\r\n-He actually has a small \"gang\" at his school that he's in deep with. So if he gets followed home and doesn't notice, he could get ME shot.<br>\r\n-He's obese at age 12. He eats EVERYTHING in our fridge after 3 days. He bounces so much, when he runs, he shakes our neighbors next door AND in the next apartment. Yes, THAT FAT. (he also pretends he's not, runs as soon as he gets home, and always has his shirt off)<br>\r\n-He's a total slob. Whenever he takes my games (without asking) he leavea them covered in Cheetoh smudges, scratches, and chocolate. He puts all hos games in the wron cases, and he did the same to my games 3 times.<br>\r\n-I have to sleep in the living room on the couch, becaue he took my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. Your move, reader.</span></div></div>",
