Buttercup stood in disbelief seeing her like this. \"Aaah!!

Her sisters sighed at her naivete, but to their further amazement--she was right. Blossom's head snapped back on, completely secure on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was weird,\" Blossom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, see if you can do it again!\" Buttercup shouted. \"I wanna take my head off too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now girls, let's not capitalize on a freak accident,\" Blossom talked down to them. \"We should first figure out the scape of this new ability, and--HEY!\" Blossom's lecture was interrupted by Buttercup detaching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Imagine all the things we can try by separating our heads,\" Buttercup said, holding Blossom's head towards her own. That's when Bubbles snatched up Buttercup's head, taking it off her bod as well. \"Cool! I got this power too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it,\" Bubbles grinned. \"If we can do this with other people...just imagine the bodies we can try out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gives Buttercup a mischievous idea. \"I say we perform a few body exchanges of our own, just to see what it's like being other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlossom asks, \"Who were you thinking?\"</span></div></div>",

With their newfound power of removing heads, the girls wanted to try being grown up. Knocking on her door, they were quickly welcomed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you girls today?\" Ms. Bellum asks. The girls look at each other, curious whether or not to reveal their intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ms. Bellum, what's it like being a lady?\" Bubbles asks very straightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Bubbles, appearance means a lot. High heels, revealing dresses, and manicured hands are the most ladylike you can get,\" the woman responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna hear more!\" Buttercup added. \"Tell me how to kick butt while looking pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ms. Bellum focused on her conversation, Blossom crept behind her. The red Powerpuff concentrated on removing the heads of herself and the curvy woman in front of her. She closed her eyes, hoping to activate her power...and felt it kicking in when her orientation changed.Blossom was about to pop off her head until she noticed the supple cleavage that was now hers--she telepathically switched heads with Ms. Bellum without lifting a hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubbles and Buttercup's eyes lit up when they saw their sister piloting this woman body. Ms. Bellum, however, must've been \"programmed\" to be unaware, as she continued her advice to the girls. \"You two could learn a thing or two from Blossom. Perfect outfit, perfect shape...I can't help but wish I was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlossom chuckled at that irony. \"Thanks for the compliments, Ms. Bellum. I'll catch my sisters up to speed for sure! Thanks for all the advice!\" And with that, Blossom strutted out of Ms. Bellum's house, Bubb;es and Buttercup following behind and grinning. They managed to swing a new body already and the original owner was none the wiser.</span></div></div>",

Buttercup smirked, squatting down to see Sedusa at her new eye level. \"What'd I tell ya?\" She said, \"You'll never win against the Powerpuff Girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair!\" Sedusa whined, stomping her feet. \"Femme Fatale, do something!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSedusa's accomplice held a fighting stance against Blossom and Bubbles.

Why had she and Spike swapped heads!? 'How' had they swapped heads!? Why did Spike act as though nothing had happened!? What was-?

Not used to suddenly having claws instead of hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sword... The note wasn't lying. It actually works.\" Rarity whispered to herself. \"Is this also why Spike was acting as though we had always been this way?...

Different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to take a step forward, only to fall flat on her face. She let out a small cry of pain, then looked back at Spike's lower half. \"Ah yes 'Two' legs. I forgot about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully pushed herself back on to Spike's feet. \"I should get back to town and find a way to reverse this.\" She looked down at the small 'Male' dragon body below her head. \"Or perhaps... No. I couldn't. Twilight would kill me if I do... On the other hoof... She doesn't need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Rarity.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The latest lead they had been following, about a cache of \u201cmagical artifacts\u201d that Ozpin had seemed very insistent might be somehow useful (even though he didn\u2019t actually know what was there any more than they did), had turned out to be a dud. Well, probably. There had been a few items there that they hadn\u2019t been able to identify yet \u2013 they didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d be anything useful, but currently Ozpin (or Oz, or Oscar, or whoever he was now) was away with Jaune and the others and until he got back to confirm their assessment they couldn\u2019t get rid of any of it, or indeed do much of anything else. Thus it was that the four girls were lounging in a room of their current safe house, trying to think of ways to stay occupied and running low on options. Blake Belladonna had all this on her mind as she sat in what she had deemed to be the most comfortable chair and stared at the object in her lap. It had been found along with the \u2018artifacts\u2019 and, despite clearly lacking any magical significance, was ironically the only one that she thought might possibly turn out to be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a book, a dusty old one. On the worn-looking front cover (it had no dust jacket) were the words, <i>Wondrous Tales to Thrill and Inspire.</i> No author was listed. It had been idle curiosity that had originally drawn her to the book, but something to read was something to read, and Blake felt reasonably confident that she could distract herself from the boredom of their current situation for a few hours at the absolute least. She opened the book and was greeted by the smell of an entire library. Blake smiled to herself. She didn\u2019t really think of herself as a \u2018book nerd\u2019, but there was no denying that she found a special little pleasure in the smell of old books. She looked down at the first page, a table of contents. It seemed that this was an anthology of short stories, seemingly drawn from a variety of genres. She read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\t<i>The Saga of the Stars</i><br>\r\n-\t<i>Tales of the Old Frontier</i><br>\r\n-\t<i>Romance of the Knight and Princess</i><br>\r\n-\t<i>The Lives of the Jungle Beasts</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026among others.

How long had she been out? <i>Last thing I remember was turning the page in that book\u2026 </i>that thought was immediately shelved for visitation at a later date as Blake became aware of three things in rapid succession. One: She was in a bed. She had not been in a bed when she\u2019d blacked out. Two: She did not recognize her surroundings. She seemed to be in someone\u2019s bedroom, with wooden walls all around and heavy wooden beams on the ceiling. And \u2018C\u2019: She was not alone. She was, in fact, sharing the rather large bed with two other women she was sure she\u2019d never seen before, one on each side of her, both still apparently asleep. Blake glanced around dazedly, her quick assessment of her surroundings having done nothing to dispel her confusion and quite a bit to exacerbate it. Should she wake the two strange women up? Maybe they could tell her what was happening. She sat up, the sheets falling off her body, and instantly added two new problems to her list. First off, she was naked. While normally waking up unexpectedly naked \u2013 coupled with the unfamiliar surroundings \u2013 would easily take first priority in terms of \u2018things to be concerned about\u2019, in this case it was easily eclipsed by the second thing: this body was not hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026? H-how\u2026HUH?\u201d She bleated helplessly, unable to contain herself in her shock. This body, which could not be hers but somehow was, was muscular, well-tanned and unmistakably male. She looked down at her newly flat chest \u2013 well, maybe \u2018flat\u2019 wasn\u2019t exactly the right word, those pecs were amazing \u2013 and further to her exquisitely sculpted abs. There was little body hair in evidence, but her skin looked rough and more than one scar was noticeable even at a glance. Honestly, it was a body she might have responded to, if she weren\u2019t currently using it. Blake paused. Below the abs, below the navel, the sheets were still covering\u2026 she had to see it. She lifted the sheet delicately. \u201cHoooly shit,\u201d she said. Not normally the swearing type, but if you couldn\u2019t bust out some profanity at a time like this, then what was even the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

She turned to see one of them (the one on her left) looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026no. No, nothing\u2019s wrong\u2026um.\u201d The woman\u2019s expression was quizzical. \u201cCan. Can I ask you something?\u201d Blake felt herself stumbling over the words as she said them. \u201cWhere, exactly, am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked confused. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize your own room? You\u2019ve been stayin\u2019 here a whole two weeks now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, your room. At the inn?\u201d The woman sat up next to Blake, prompting a loud snore from the woman on the right who was still asleep. \u201cYou sure there ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman sat up, the sheets fell away from her body as well and Blake could see that she, too, was completely nude. Blake was pretty sure she knew what had been going on last night, and it was a pretty safe bet that the other woman was naked as well. They were actually both quite beautiful, although their hair was disheveled and their makeup rubbed off. The woman she was currently talking to had dark brown hair (the other one was blonde), archetypal \u2018doe eyes\u2019, and a particularly cute nose (if Blake were to say so). Blake had to admit that she\u2019d felt attraction to other girls before, but she\u2019d never actually seen another woman naked and so close (except for that one time she\u2019d walked in on Weiss getting into the shower). Yet here this one was, staring right at her, smooth skin and round, firm breasts on full display. Blake felt something happening between her legs. It was a sensation she\u2019d never felt before, but she knew exactly what it was. <i>Oh, dear,</i> she said inside her head, and was grateful she\u2019d had the restraint not to say it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me for just a second,\u201d Blake said. She rose from the bed and stumbled across the room, trying as hard as she could not to think about the extra weight from the semi-erect thing between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you goin\u2019?\u201d asked the brunette whose name Blake hadn\u2019t even learned (and she could see now that the blonde was waking up as well).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBathroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong way, sugar.\u201d The brunette pointed to a door on the other side of the room. \u201cC\u2019mon now, the whiskey wasn\u2019t THAT strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake crossed the room (stepping perhaps a bit more gingerly than was strictly necessary) and slipped through the door. The room on the other side was small but well lit from a window high in the wall. Blake saw a bathtub, some towels, and a curious piece of furniture she recognized as an old-fashioned washbasin. No toilet was in evidence. \u201cWell I guess it is a BATH-room,\u201d Blake muttered to herself, \u201cand not a toilet room\u2026still weird that they don\u2019t even have a sink, though. Does this place even have plumbing?\u201d Ultimately, though, it wasn\u2019t the plumbing fixtures (or lack thereof) that drew her attention, but the full-length mirror in the corner. Staring back at her from the mirror was a very rugged-looking naked man, well-muscled but not beefy, with a fine coating of body hair and a few interesting scars. But rising from the shoulders was Blake\u2019s own very female head. Dumbfounded, she leaned in a little closer, running her new meaty man-fingers through her familiar sleek black hair. Her face was clearly a few tones lighter than the rest of her body, but it blended gradually down the neck (smooth, with no Adam\u2019s-apple) into the tan skin of her body. She looked up to her two cat ears and twitched them experimentally. \u201cWell,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI guess that\u2019s why my voice still sounds the same.\u201d She examined her new body some more, gazing over her hairy arms and running her hands over her new chest.  <i>Were my old shoulders quite this bony? I wonder where these scars came from\u2026</i> one thing she was absolutely NOT going to look at was the pen- uhh, the <b>thing</b> down there. It was not necessary. There was no need to acknowledge it. She didn\u2019t have to pee, and it was completely irrelevant that there were two beautiful, naked women on the other side of that door <i>oh no there it goes again THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE!</i> Blake took a few seconds to collect herself until she was ready to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026do either of you know where my clothes are?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several minutes later, once all parties were suitably dressed, Blake and the girls (their names were Barbara and Erin) ventured forth from the room. Blake\u2019s jaw had almost dropped when she first saw her clothes. A long duster, high boots, and pants that looked like they were designed for riding on horseback. More different kinds of leather than she believed she\u2019d ever seen in a single outfit. And the finishing touch: a wide-brimmed hat with what seemed to be a snakeskin hatband sitting on a nearby chair. \u201cWhat am I, a cowboy?\u201d Blake muttered \u2013 fortunately, quiet enough that the women didn\u2019t hear. Blake had been careful not to try to get more information from her female companions, lest she create more confusion. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to her to try to explain her situation (as she understood it) honestly; surely they would ship her off to the looney bin. She would try to get more info from other people she might encounter, but she would have to be careful about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around her; they had stepped out into a very bare and very dim hallway lit only by some candles in wall sconces. <i>Sheesh, this place is old-fashioned,</i> she thought. Something stirred in the back of her mind; she\u2019d first felt it when she\u2019d seen her clothes but she still couldn\u2019t quite identify the sensation. Well, maybe she could: it was the sensation of having forgotten something. But what had she forgotten? The hall opened up into a large common room, and all around were people chatting, drinking, and generally having a great time. Every one of them was dressed to match Blake\u2019s new outfit \u2013 here were more men in dusty leather and cowboy hats, there were women in fancy ruffled dresses, there was even a man with suspenders and a handlebar mustache. Over it all was the sound of jaunty piano music that she had somehow failed to notice until just now. The overall tableau looked like \u2013 no, could only possibly be \u2013 a scene from\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA frontier flick,\u201d Blake whispered, as she realized what her subconscious had been trying to tell her. (NOTE: I am specifically avoiding the word \"Western\" because, while I'm confident Remnant had cowboys at one point, I don't know enough about fantasy geography to say whether they were West of anything.) She was well aware of the well-established genre of films wherein cowboys and bandits clashed along the unsettled frontier of the olden days. She hadn\u2019t been all that much a fan, per se, but the clich\u00e9s were well embedded in the public consciousness. And hadn\u2019t it been just such a story (albeit in a written form) that she had idly intended to start reading the literal second she\u2019d blacked out and woken up here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rubbed the bridge of her nose. This was a lot to process. But unless she\u2019d spontaneously passed out and was having an exceptionally realistic dream, it all fit together. It didn\u2019t make a single damn bit of sense, but it clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls,\u201d Blake said slowly, already wincing in anticipation of the awkwardness that was about to ensue, \u201cthis is going to sound really stupid but\u2026 where, exactly, are we right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the ladies looked at her, looked at each other, and burst into laughter. But as Blake was calculating how to phrase her next words in the least suspicious way possible, a man approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Belladonna? Sir?\u201d It took Blake a second to remember that she was apparently a man now, and also to process that he had used her actual surname despite her having seemingly stepped into the life of a completely different person. <i>Come to think of it,</i> she realized, <i>I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m</i> supposed <i>to be right now at all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Blake asked the man. He was certainly a different sort than the grizzled-looking men filling the rest of the room. He was small, skinny, and nervous-looking. Despite a complete lack of evidence, Blake instinctively pegged him as some kind of servant or stable hand. He hesitantly spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, isn\u2019t your name Blake Belladonna?\u201d Hmm. So I still have my name as well as my face. Interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yeah,\u201d said Blake, realizing that perhaps she was coming off a little too confrontationally and relaxing just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026came in to tell ya Yang\u2019s outside waitin\u2019 for ya, \u2018sall.\u201d The man nervously shuffled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang??\u201d Blake couldn\u2019t believe it. Was Yang here with her? Had she been drawn into this\u2026place by that book, too? \u201cWhere?\u201d She called after the disappearing messenger.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Round back!\u201d Came the shouted reply. A hand rose above the crowd that had already swallowed him, finger pointing behind her. \u201cThat way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake mumbled an apology to Erin and Barbara and dashed off to meet her friend. Locating the correct door took a few tries, but eventually she stumbled out into the sun of a dusty lot behind the building. She was blinking to get her bearings when she heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBlake! There you are!\u201d Blake whipped around, scanning her surroundings. The only other being she could see nearby was a horse. It was a good-looking horse, with a lustrous tan-and-white coat and a long, blonde tail swishing behind it. And at the end of its neck was the head of Blake\u2019s friend, Yang Xiao Long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so don\u2019t freak out,\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake did not quite hear this, as she was busy freaking out. \u201cGAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHFUCK!!! Holy Fucking\u2026.fuck! Yang! You\u2019re a HORSE???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Yang said, a bit sheepishly (horseishly?), \u201cGuess I wasn\u2019t as lucky as you. Nice outfit, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d Blake replied, looking down at herself, \u201cbut I have the wrong body too.\u201d She opened her shirt to show her new chest. \u201cSee? I\u2019m a guy now\u2026as are you, I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Said Yang. \u201cWait, really?\u201d Blake realized that the new position of her friend\u2019s head likely made it impossible to see most of her own current body. \u201cDang, I thought those felt like balls hanging down there! \u2026What do they look like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we need to have this discussion right now?\u201d Snapped Blake. \u201cThere are clearly much more important questions right now! Do you know where we are, or how we got here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know where we are, but I think I know how we got here. It was that weird book! You opened it and then we all got\u2026sucked inside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was my theory too,\u201d said Blake. \u201cDo you think Ruby and Weiss are here somewhere, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were abruptly startled by another woman\u2019s voice. \u201cY\u2019all ready to get tacked up?\u201d A pretty young woman in a checkered shirt and very dirty pants was striding jauntily towards them. She had short red hair, and the pair of light brown desert fox ears on top of her head marked her as a faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTacked\u2026up?\u201d Blake repeated. She idly wondered whether she still counted as a faunus in this version of reality.<br>\r\n\u201cTack.\u201d Said Yang. \u201cIt means riding gear \u2013 like a saddle and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a beautiful horse!\u201d The fox-eared woman said to Yang admiringly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s your name, handsome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang,\u201d said Yang, smiling, \u201cand flattery will get you nowhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Yang,\u201d said the woman, \u201cI reckon this here fella is awful lucky to have such a fine animal as you.\u201d She gave Yang\u2019s back a rub, while Yang smirked and swished her tail. \u201cNow both of you wait here, I\u2019ll be right back with the saddle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe can understand you?\u201d Asked Blake once the woman was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? I\u2019m speaking normally, aren\u2019t I? You can understand me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but\u2026you\u2019re supposed to be a horse! And horses aren\u2019t supposed to talk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know what you mean. But I was talking to some stablehands earlier, and they understood me too. The other horses here all look normal, but for some reason nobody seems all that surprised that I can talk\u2026or that I have a human face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was gazing at that face now. This was a face she had become very familiar with, the face of the girl who had become her closest friend. She\u2019d had dreams about this face \u2013 not that anyone knew about that, of course. There were the same blue eyes, same easy smile. The only concession to her changed species were a pair of horse ears poking up through her blonde hair. Unlike Blake, she didn\u2019t still possess human ears, although that same blonde hair mostly obscured this fact. And behind her lovely locks, a short mane of the same color ran down the horse\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d Yang asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just\u2026 having a hard time accepting all this, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and me both! At least you\u2019re still a person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking you were taking this pretty well, actually.\u201d Blake had been thrown completely through a loop when she\u2019d woken up in a strange place with someone else\u2019s body. But Yang, despite having it even worse (or so Blake thought), was still smiling. That was definitely one of the things Blake liked about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess I just thought that I might as well go with it, right? Not like I can do anything about it right now. And on the bright side, I have a full four limbs again! \u2026Although I guess I went from one arm to none\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake almost had to stifle a laugh. It was such an absurd thing to consider in the midst of such a dire situation. But it did feel good \u2013 while still very disoriented, with Yang here things seemed more OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can come closer, you know,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bite you\u2026 unless I mistake your finger for a carrot.\u201d She gave a wry smile. \u201cUs horses will do that sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walked over to her friend\u2019s side. This was all too weird. Still, she definitely didn\u2019t want Yang to think she was uncomfortable around her. If anything Yang was her primary source of comfort at the moment. She put her hand up, hesitating only a little, and placed it on Yang\u2019s light brown flank. It was so smooth and warm. This was actually her first time touching a horse, come to think of it. She began stroking the short fur gently, a bit too overwhelmed by the moment to consider that she was petting her friend like an animal. Not that Yang minded. In fact, had Blake had a bit more presence of mind just then, she might have noticed her eyes darting away nervously, and a distinct blush creeping into her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis moment was ended by...</span></div></div>",

She was carrying a heavy-looking saddle and some other, less identifiable pieces, all of which she set atop a nearby horizontal wooden beam. \u201cCouldn\u2019t find a bridle, but I s\u2019pose you ain\u2019t got one, huh? Can\u2019t think of how it\u2019d fit on such an unusual face\u2026 oh, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said to Yang, \u201cthat face is what makes you beautiful.\u201d Here she clapped a friendly hand on Yang\u2019s rump, just above the base of her tail. Yang seemed a bit perturbed but smiled again. \u201c\u2018Sides,\u201d the woman continued, \u201cnot like you really need reins if the two of ya can just talk it over where to go. Wish I had a talking horse, it\u2019d be mighty convenient. Anyways, let\u2019s get you all geared up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process took a bit longer than Blake had expected, mostly because there were actually several pieces of \u201ctack\u201d that needed to go on underneath (and thus before) the saddle itself. \u201cSorry if this is a bit uncomfortable,\u201d said the woman as she reached under Yang\u2019s body to tighten some straps around her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t apologize,\u201d said Yang. \u201cAnything that gets a pretty lady to put her hands all over me is OK in my book!\u201d At this she gave an exaggerated wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, you are a charmer,\u201d said the woman as she adjusted a few more things on the saddle pad. Blake\u2019s eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just don\u2019t get a horse boner,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d came the lady\u2019s voice, snapping Blake out of her unpleasant train of thought. \u201cEverything\u2019s ready!\u201d She took a step back from Yang, now adorned with a smart-looking saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d joked the girl-turned-horse. \u201cDoes it suit me?\u201d She struck what she clearly intended to be a heroic-looking pose, flicking her tail and tossing her hair at the same time. Not knowing exactly how to respond to that, Blake turned to the Faunus woman instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks so much,\u201d she began, before changing the subject. \u201cBut let me ask you something.

Don\u2019t know how you might know her, or what your business might be, but I\u2019d sure be careful if it was me in your shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, that sounds about right for Weiss,</i> Blake and Yang both thought at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiled at the woman. \u201cMuch obliged,\u201d she said, and tossed her a coin (she\u2019d had to do some digging around in her new outfit\u2019s pockets, but now she was reasonably sure what all she had on her person and where, including how much money she was carrying). Then she tipped her hat and turned towards Yang. This cowboy thing could be growing on her, she felt. In a couple more steps she sprang up onto the saddle, with just enough momentum to get her belly over the top before falling backwards onto her ass.

That\u2019s what I did the time I rode a horse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t need any help?\u201d the woman called out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I got it!\u201d responded Blake, who most definitely did not have it. <i>Maybe if I put my foot in the stirrup first\u2026no, too high. Let me think\u2026</i> \u201cYang, are you laughing at me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying not to!\u201d Yang giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said the Faunus stablehand suddenly. \u201cSilly me, I never even thought to give you a mounting block!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d asked Blake, but the girl was already hurrying off around a corner. Seconds later, though, she was back, carrying a good-sized wooden crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d she said, placing it on the ground next to Blake, alongside Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoohhhhh,\u201d the two friends said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again,\u201d said Blake, and with the crate as a step she was up and seated on the saddle in a second (with a few more seconds to get properly situated). There was a pause as both girls (or rather, former girls) fully realized the position they were now in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m on top of Yang, haha,</i> Blake thought somewhat dreamily. <i>I\u2019ve got her between my legs\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Blake is sitting on my back,</i> thought Yang. <i>She\u2019s <u>riding</u> me\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell! Better get going then!\u201d Blake almost shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it!\u201d said Yang, her voice a little bit stilted. A single drop of sweat rolled down her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, as if by instinct, gently dug her heels into her mount\u2019s sides, and the two of them were off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every movement of her horse body seemed to jostle against Blake\u2019s groin and make the saddle creak. She was desperate for another distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you said you\u2019ve ridden horses before?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just a couple times, when I was younger,\u201d said Yang. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have called myself a \u2018horse girl\u2019 - except now, well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn\u2019t know what to say in response to that. Fortunately for her, Yang had more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it sounds like Weiss must still be a woman here, huh? Lucky her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d said Blake, remembering what the stablehand had said. \u201cGlad she isn\u2019t a scorpion or something, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019d make a good scorpion?\u201d said Yang. \u201cI think it would suit her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be mean,\u201d chided Blake, though she was clearly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not! Scorpions are badass! And I think her head on a scorpion would look cute, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had to laugh at that mental image. She looked at the town passing them by, every bit the picturesque frontier town as seen in every cowboy movie ever. \u201cHey\u201d, she suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026don\u2019t actually know where we\u2019re going, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, getting directions wasn\u2019t hard. The place they were looking for, the Snow White Dance Hall, was a huge and ornate structure, a far cry from anything else they\u2019d seen so far. No one familiar was in evidence outside, but there were bright lights and sounds of raucous activity coming from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dismounted respectably, if not gracefully. \u201cWait here,\u201d she told her horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the cowboy,\u201d replied Yang. She watched as Blake went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaucous\u201d was definitely the right word to describe what was going on inside. All around was a veritable menagerie of characters, human and faunus, some clean and well-dressed, some dirty and rugged, all talking, drinking, joking, gaming, and generally carousing in every way imaginable. While many looked like cowboys, farmers, or working people from the town, there were also a lot of women with fancy dresses and elaborate hairstyles. Blake expected Weiss to be one of them, but she was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake approached a man who seemed to work here. \u201cExcuse me\u2026 is Weiss Schnee around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake Belladonna, as I live and breathe! Didn\u2019t know you were back in town!\u201d Evidently the man knew her (or should she say, knew <b>him</b>?). She probably couldn\u2019t risk fishing info out of him about who she (he?) was supposed to be, though. \u201cMiss Schnee is in back, freshenin\u2019 up \u2013 don\u2019t think she\u2019d be all too pleased to see you, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me worry about that,\u201d Blake said with a confidence that may not have been entirely justified. Here was more evidence that Weiss, or at least her \u2018incarnation\u2019 in this world, was an unpleasant, possibly dangerous character. And according to this man, she and Blake had apparently had a history? Blake tried to prepare herself for what she might find as she walked down the corridor the man had pointed out\u2026 although surely it couldn\u2019t be as much of a shock as waking up with a male body, or seeing Yang as a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nudged the door open and peered inside. There was Weiss, sure enough, touching up her makeup in front of a mirror. She was wearing a white corset and a puffy white skirt, and at first Blake assumed that she still had her true body, but closer inspection said otherwise: the skin of her body was, like Blake\u2019s, distinctly darker in tone than the skin of her face, and her bust \u2013 heavily emphasized by her current outfit \u2013 was surely a size or two larger than normal. Blake had gotten so caught up in these little details that it took her a second to realize Weiss was looking at her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's it called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The Rainforest Saga</i>\" said Blake. \"No, I don't think so... but let's see for ourselves.\" She noted the page listing and flipped to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...that's...interesting,\" said Ruby.

Instead, she took stock of her environment. All around her was green - lush vegetation running the gamut from ferns low on the ground to towering trees overhead and vines hanging thickly from their branches. The air was warm, and full of animal sounds. A couple butterflies fluttered around the immediate vicinity. Clearly a jungle somewhere in the world - just like the story's title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was on all fours, but something was wrong. On all fours, but it didn't feel like she was on hands and knees. Something felt very strange with her body. She looked down at her hands. Except she didn't have hands.

The way her new body moved definitely felt strange, nevertheless it came to her naturally. No doubt whatever force had transformed her had some built-in feature that saw to that; otherwise she'd have had to learn to walk all over again. But that was how things usually worked in stories where people transformed - no thought for all the technical minutia, except for maybe the barest handwave. Blake had never questioned it, until suddenly finding herself in just such a story. But anyway, there were more important things to worry about right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby?\" Blake called out. \"Are you out there?\" She wasn't 100% certain, but she felt pretty confident it hadn't just been her who had ended up here. \"Weiss? Yang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound of crashing vegetation suddenly broke into Blake's awareness from somewhere to the left. Something large was approaching. \"Who's there?\" shouted Blake, feeling the fur on her back stand up. Ruby, is that you??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the source of the noise came into view. \"No, it's me,\" came a familiar voice, and Blake felt a wash of relief at the sight of her best friend Yang's face. Problem was, that face was attached to the body of a huge brown bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang! You, um... you've...changed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you!\" replied Yang, wide-eyed. \"Are you a panther?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I mean, I think -- But your head! It's still the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" That hadn't actually occurred to Blake, who hadn't been able to see her own face. But it made sense, didn't it? She hadn't questioned why she could still speak in her own voice - talking animals were a dime a dozen in stories, after all - but that would explain it. And sure enough, there were definitely locks of her black hair hanging down at the edges of her vision. <i>Panthers don't have manes, right?</i> Blake touched her face to confirm - gingerly, since she now had paws instead of hands. \"Wow, you're right! Why do we still have our own faces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm always happy to see your face. It's a very pretty one.\" Yang smiled warmly at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake answered with a soft smile of her own, and a blush that was more visible than she realized. \"I'm glad to see you too,\" she said. \"And if we're both here, Ruby and Weiss must be here somewhere, too. We should look for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Yang nodded. \"So...where is 'here?' Like, what's going on? Please tell me you know something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fill you in while we look,\" said Blake.</span></div></div>",

The story I was about to read was about animals in the jungle, and now here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, <b>that's</b> what I call a <i>wild</i> story!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you can still make jokes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls-turned-animals walked side by side through the sweltering forest. Blake stepped nimbly, weaving between trees with scarcely a trace of her passage, while Yang simply powered through any obstacles she couldn't avoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think Ruby and Weiss are here too?\" asked Yang, stepping through some protruding roots as gingerly as she could in light of the bear's body she was now controlling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think they might be animals, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm gonna be extra careful where I step, just in case they're bugs or mice or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't think that was something to worry about, though admittedly she did take an extra-good look before taking her next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them would need to worry long, as it turned out, because the next member of their group had just found them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang! Blake! I found you guys!\" It was Ruby's voice that rang out from the trees. Blake and Yang froze, looking around for her location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up here!\" called Ruby. There were sounds of leaves rustling and branches shaking somewhere overhead, but before Blake could pinpoint a source something dropped down on them. A black hairy creature the approximate size of a cat was now clambering all over Yang, and it took a moment before Blake could clearly see the face of their team leader, Ruby Rose, on the body of a monkey with long black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah!! I'm so happy to see you guys!\" Ruby gushed, still in frenetic motion. \"Blake! You're a panther! And Yang! You're a bear! So cool!!\" She jumped from her sister's back to the trunk of an adjacent tree and then ran along one of its lower branches, seemingly unable to stop moving for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You seem weirdly happy with this,\" was all Blake could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I should <i>probably</i> be worried,\" Ruby replied, \"but this is all so crazy and cool! We must've gotten sucked into that jungle story, and yeah I'm not sure how we're gonna get out, but right now it's SO EXCITING!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down for a second,\" said Blake. \"Have you seen --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we're all here then.\" This new voice came from somewhere down low. Blake's paw had been touching something on the ground she had thought was a vine, only now the vine moved. Looking down, she saw that the 'vine' was actually a white, scaly tail, which slipped away from her foot and under a bush. Attempting to follow its path, she found the tail belonged to a snake, bright white and frighteningly long, the other end of which was hidden in a clump of grass. Then, from the grass rose the head of their final teammate, Weiss Schnee. Weiss was now an enormous serpent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss?\" said Yang. \"Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss is here??\" cried Ruby, who at the moment was too high up in the tree to have seen. \"Let me see!\" A couple leaps and bounds brought her to the forest floor, where she stood face-to-face with the snake that sported her friend's head. \"Ohmigosh,\" she said quietly, \"Weiss...you're so <i>pretty</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss's face flushed red and it took her a second to reply. \"So...you're a monkey, huh? ...I like it. It suits you.\" Blake wasn't sure if that was intended as an insult or not. With Weiss you couldn't always tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" said the heiress-turned-reptile, \"can anyone tell me what the hell is going on??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby spoke before Blake could. \"We got sucked into that book from the artifact cache and now we're in a story about jungle animals...um, probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about the size of it,\" confirmed Blake. \"I'm not sure what to do next, but we should definitely stick together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" said Weiss, curtly. \"I'm <b>not</b> happy about any of this, but you're right. We work best together, and who knows how dangerous this place might be.\" A beat later, a skinny forked tongue flickered out from between her lips and then quickly flitted back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Yang were both staring at her the way one might stare at a kitten that had just made a tiny sneeze. \"THAT WAS SO CUTE!\" They both said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up!\" Weiss retorted. \"Nothing about this is cute! What's the matter with you people?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I think we'd better decide on our next move soon,\" said Blake, looking at the sky through the canopy overhead, \"because I think a storm might be coming.\"</span></div></div>",

She'd spent a whole week skulking around the perimeter, always at a reasonable distance of course, determining the safest angle of approach. After finding it, she had waited until the optimal moment before daring to get close. Now the time had come to make her move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were plenty of rumors surrounding the site, and the lack of official information about it only made things worse. Nobody could say exactly what it was that was being done there - not even some inane cover story had been put forward. Add to that a couple of sightings of mysterious figures strongly resembling Talon operatives, and Lena - \"Tracer\" as her Overwatch colleagues had once called her - decided to get involved. She had no intention of actually doing anything once she made it inside - tonight was for reconnaissance purposes only. Sneak in, see what was going on, sneak back out. Any longer and she'd be sure to catch hell from Emily when she returned. She was probably due for a chewing out as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lena approached the building undetected (as she had anticipated) and hoisted herself through a window. Inside most lights were off, and all was quiet - actually, no: all was <b>not</b> quiet. As Lena listened she could hear a peculiar hum coming from somewhere deeper in the building. <i>Find whatever's making that noise and I'll find the answers</i>, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lena was the picture of stealth as she crept along the corridors, yet perhaps it was not necessary, as she saw no sign of anyone else in the building. Well, that wasn't going to get her to let her guard down. It would be naive to assume that there would be no security, especially if Talon was really involved. Fortunately she had all the equipment she needed with her: her two pulse guns sat snug in their holsters - even though she was intending to avoid trouble, it was always good to have insurance - and the chronal accelerator strapped to her chest was still warm in standby mode. If she did run into trouble, it would be instrumental in ensuring her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the point where the hum grew loudest, Lena found herself facing a large door. She tried the handle carefully - unlocked, miraculously. Very, very slowly she turned the handle all the way and eased the door open just a crack. Light spilled out from the other side, but the door wasn't open enough to see anything. She teased the door open a little further until there was a crack she could put her eye to. From what she could see, the room was large, brightly lit, and empty of people. It was split into multiple levels, with stairs and catwalks above. There was some scattered machinery, but although the noise was clearly coming from inside the room, she couldn't see what was making it. She pushed the door open further and slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fully inside the room, she could finally see the source of the hum. In the center of the room (out of sight from the cracked-open door) stood an enormous device of uncertain purpose. It took up most of the floorspace, and stretched all the way to the ceiling. In addition to the hum, it gave off a distinct whitish glow. Surrounding it were all manner of terminals, energy-measuring devices, and other equipment Lena couldn't name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Is it some kind of power source?</i> Lena wondered as she approached it. <i>Why would they leave it on when no one's around?</i> She poked around the various terminals, some with computers and others with more esoteric consoles. She supposed she might be able to access one of the computers to see what kind of information was on it, but she didn't want to fiddle with anything else. It would also take time, and Lena still wasn't sure she was alone. She walked around the huge machine to see what might be on the other side of it. Beyond the machine, in addition to more consoles and computers, the room stretched on a short ways to a doorless, windowless wall. Along the wall, at several elevations, were more catwalks. And on one of the catwalks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lena's instincts took hold while her conscious mind was still processing. Instantly she leapt backward, just as a bullet embedded itself in the floor where she had been standing. She ducked behind some obscuring machinery and quickly switched on the accelerator. The huge machine in the center of the room made a curious noise as the accelerator came on, but she had other things to worry about at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You really shouldn't have come here, <i>cherie</i>.\" The voice was a woman's, silky, with a French accent. Lena knew that voice, even though she'd only heard it once before. \"But, surely you couldn't resist. Always the hero, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lena said nothing, but drew her pulse guns. As she did so, an arc of electricity jumped from her accelerator to the panel she was hiding behind. <i>Shit!</i> She thought. <i>Bloody thing better not be thinking about acting up now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The woman on the catwalk spoke again. \"They saw you poking around here a few days ago. Did you really think you were being so discreet? Of course, they called me in to deal with you. I must say, I was excited to see you again... Our last encounter ended so poorly, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad you remember me!\" Lena called out from her hiding place. \"Who were you again?\" No response. <i>Right. Now or never, then.</i> Lena rolled out from behind her cover, both guns blasting the spot where her opponent had just been standing. But her opponent was no longer there. Instantly shifting into a crouch, Lena caught a blur of movement overhead, then stood up and pirouetted just in time to catch the figure landing behind her. She fired off another shot, but the figure deftly jumped aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In what seemed like several seconds, but was likely less than one, Lena's eyes took in the sight before her. It was a woman, very slim, in a form-fitting purplish catsuit, which was likely reinforced with armor fibers. She wore black gloves and boots that seemed to be made of a heavier substance than her bodysuit, and on top of her head was a segmented headset featuring multiple lenses, giving the impression of a spider's eyes. Behind the headset, her dark hair was tied back in one of the longest ponytails Lena had seen. Her face itself was fair-featured, lovely even, but there was no sign of warmth or tenderness in her expression. She was quite beautiful, actually, apart from the coldness in her eyes, but the one thing about her that stood out the most was the fact that her skin was a brilliant blue. Lena remembered the last time she had seen this person...the night Mondatta had died. There was no way she was ever going to forget her. This was the Talon assassin known as \"Widowmaker\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n More arcs of electricity suddenly sparked from the accelerator. <i>Crap, not now, not now.</i> Lena wasn't moving, but Widowmaker hadn't fired, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm under orders not to damage the equipment too much,\" said Widowmaker, smiling cruelly. \"So, could you please step away from that machinery just a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lena glanced to her side. The nearest cover was nearly 30 feet away, behind the machine itself. There was no way she could make it at a normal speed, not with a gun already trained on her, but if she used the accelerator... the question was, would it work properly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Right, right, of course,\" she said in response to the assassin's request. \"Just a tick.\" Then, without warning, she let off two blasts from her pulse guns and made a break for it, her accelerator humming to life. Electricity shot from the accelerator in multiple arcs. The glow from the huge device intensified, and the hum became a loud whine. \"<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>\" yelled Widowmaker behind her. Lena knew that she was still running, but it seemed as if time had slowed down. Now the huge device was emitting electricity of its own, and the bolts from the accelerator met the bolts from the machine, dancing between the two objects like a Van de Graaf generator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That...may have been a mistake,\" said Lena as white light enveloped her and overwhelmed her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What Happens Next?</b></span></div></div>",

However, no book had ever told her how to transplant heads, so she tried that on her own. She started by swapping animals' heads, and while her early attempts were not successful, she managed to improve with much more success. She then moved on to humans, and just like the animals, the first tries failed, but later attempts succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one day, Harley had the crazy idea to transplant her own head onto a new body.

As the headliner for tonight's concert at the casino, everyone had eagerly awaited her performance. And she didn't disappoint. Being on the cusp of yet another breakup gave her plenty of new material to write about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Taylor Swift was at the pinnacle of the pop music world. Bathed in the blinding stage lights as well as the applause of thousands of adoring fans, she bowed before her audience:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/tf1IEPT\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/tf1IEPT</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral pyrotechnics flared out in a dazzling display. Purple and blue smoke flowed out onto the stage and covered her exit, along with the rest of the band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstage, she hugged her current boyfriend, who had come to greet her with a large bouquet of roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were wonderful, baby.\" He whispered into her neck. They kissed, and he traced his hand down to hers. \"Do you mind if we talk for a moment out back? It's kind of important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor swept her blonde bangs out of her eyes. \"Of course, honey. I'll always have time for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so the song goes.\" He smiled warmly. She thanked her fellow band mates and stagehands for another successful performance before following her boyfriend out to an alley behind the casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a warm August evening. As usual for the Las Vegas strip, it's an endless cacophony of honking taxicabs, slot machine spins, and street performers. But Taylor and her boyfriend were alone and undisturbed behind the casino after the concert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to talk about?\" Taylor asked expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk about us,\" Her boyfriend said. He kicked a stone along the ground, gathering up the nerve to speak. \"I really, really like you, Taylor. These last three weeks have been the best of my life without exception.\" He scratched the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she could tell by his tone that something was wrong. \"But... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exhaled. \"Wow. I didn't think saying this would be so difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked into each other's eyes, he searching for the courage and she searching for his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he confessed, \"Taylor, what we have together is working. We just get along too well. We have so much in common. I don't want this relationship to end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's expression fell. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued, \"What I'm trying to say to you is... let's not break up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked crestfallen. \"But what about my career? People don't listen to my songs about happy, functional relationships! They need breakups. So I need breakups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is hard, but we'll get through this together.\" He said, holding her hand and looking into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly the problem!\" She said, tears forming in her eyes. \"Why do you always answer my text messages? Why are you there for me when I need you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to leave you alone tonight?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped her eyes. \"It doesn't work like that. I have to be the one to ask you to stay with me, then you have to leave me behind in confusion and heartbreak. I mean, didn't you listen to my album?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them!\" She threw up her hands. He placed his arms around her, comforting her as she placed her head on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can write different songs. Better songs! And they can come from the heart just like the old ones did.\" He said, admiring Taylor's youthful physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you at least call me a failure?\" She asked at last. \"Fine then, but I need to be alone for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe understood and, kissing her passionately, went backstage to rejoin the crew. Taylor sat down on a bench and bawled her eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, a purple-robed magician wearing a top hat approached her and sat down next to her. This man wore a black mask that resembled something out of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He was clean shaven, tall, and carried a ruby-encrusted cane with him. Everything about him conveyed an aura of mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat, then spoke in a deep voice. \"Why are you crying, young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor noticed the man sitting cross-legged next to her. \"Don't you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" He replied coolly. \"You are Taylor Swift, the famous singer. You headlined a concert at that casino over there tonight. You're crying because your boyfriend didn't break up with you. You think you need a constant stream of emotional turmoil in order to write new songs for your fans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was amazed by how much he knew. Was he another stalker?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here for an autograph,\" The man said, spitting out the last word in disgust. \"I'm here to grant you what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it that I want?\" Taylor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want what all celebrities want, at some point in their careers.\" The man explained. \"A reprieve from the usual. The expected. You want to try something new, don't you? Well, I have something interesting in mind for you, that is, if you follow me this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her better judgment, Taylor decided to follow the masked man. \"Are you a magician?\" She asked, after a few minutes of walking along the Vegas strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" He replied. \"Do you see all of these people we're passing? Normally they would be mobbing you, bugging you for attention and photos with them, wouldn't they? I cast a spell over both of us so that we would not be recognised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no choice but to believe him. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is for my closest friends only.\" He said coldly, \"But you can call me by my stage name, Cosmo the Conjuror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I meant...\" She murmured. \"Are you new in town? I'm sorry I'm not familiar with your act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been here for quite some time now,\" Cosmo replied. \"But I don't do commercial. My works are limited only to those who I select personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Taylor walked with him in silence for a few minutes more until they reached a nondescript building next to Fremont Street. Strangely, Fremont Street was dark and quiet with nobody around. Normally, this place north of the Vegas strip would be teeming with all sorts of strange and unique characters, like a circus without the big tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen it so desolate here before, especially at this time of night.\" Taylor shivered. It was a lot colder now than just a few minutes ago as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my stage... Taylor Swift!\" Cosmo swept wide his arms. All the streetlights and buildings in downtown Las Vegas disappeared in a puff of smoke. The ruby atop his cane shined brightly, and Taylor slumped onto the ground asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Taylor Swift know... the masked magician had an otherworldly power to swap peoples' heads around. But she would soon discover this first hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor Swift awoke to laughs and jeers from a strange audience. Staring out into a small showroom, there were about 60 to 70 shadowy figures seated at tables, sipping drinks while Cosmo the Conjuror carried on with his show. Taylor tried to move, but found that her body was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down in astonishment, she saw a wooden stage and a pedestal, atop which her head was perched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE???\" She shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, friends and honoured guests... our volunteer is awake!\" Cosmo announced to a thunderous applause. \"Now we can begin my favourite act of the evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor tried not to cry as Cosmo continued, \"Our guest tonight was just told that her boyfriend would NOT be breaking up with her. Truly a faithful fellow. Everyone, please welcome Taylor Swift's current boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man strode out onto the stage. Taylor couldn't believe it. Did he plan all of this, or was he abducted just like her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe introduced himself to the audience and made it clear he didn't like that his girlfriend's body was taken from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your frustrations completely.\" Confided the magician, placing his gloved hand around the man's shoulder. \"She is a pretty young thing, and it would be a shame to keep her as just a head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call the police!\" The man declared shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call the President for all I care,\" Cosmo shrugged. \"You won't remember anything that happens here, I'll make sure of it. But our lovely volunteer will certainly remember! That is the point after all, or my name isn't Cosmo the Conjuror!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore cheers. He tapped his cane on the floorboards, and two lovely assistants appeared on stage. They were scantily clad in nothing more than a teddy, nylon stockings, and garter belts. They wheeled out a large glass case with a headless body inside. The body was completely nude. Taylor couldn't see whose body was in there from her vantage point, unable to turn her head or neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you folks like to see Taylor's head attached to that body over there?\" Cosmo juiced the audience, hearing peals of laughter and applause. \"Would you like to see that person's head attached to Taylor Swift's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor gulped. Someone else was going to receive her body in exchange? She hoped it would be someone responsible, who wouldn't defile or abuse her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistants, with Taylor's enchanted boyfriend's help, hefted the body out of the case and onto an angled table. They fastened straps around the arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without further ado: Presto-Change-o!\" Cosmo shouted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and Taylor again fell asleep. When she awoke, everyone was gone and she was back on the Vegas strip, fully clothed with her head fixed atop of the body of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taylor found herself standing in the middle of the street. It's daylight now, and several taxicabs honked at her as they swerved out of her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around perplexed. In one hand she carried a soda can; in the other, a set of car keys. Her purse was gone, and the sheer black bodysuit she now wore didn't leave much to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's body felt much heavier than before, and for good reason: Her tits and ass felt huge. Both felt enhanced by plastic surgery, and both strained against the fabric, causing them to jiggle whenever she walked. Her short, waspish figure was a stark difference from the lithe, slender figure she so diligently maintained through constant visits to the gym, the spa, and so on:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/3JMTxPL\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/a/3JMTxPL</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingernails had long, fake beds attached to them, and her right shoulder featured a sleeve tattoo. Taylor never had so much ink in one place before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look!\" A voice called out from the sidewalk. \"Is that Taylor Swift??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby crowd immediately started clamouring for her. Taylor covered her face from the flashbulbs firing from the paparazzi, who seemed to converge upon her wherever she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled away from the crowd as best she could in her four-inch, peep-toe heels, almost twisting her ankle a couple times, fighting back tears as she ducked for cover into the alley behind the casino. It was the same place where she met the magician last night. But he was nowhere to be found now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, her shelf of a chest rising and falling with each breath, Taylor thought about what to do next. She had to get somewhere private in order to take stock of her new body and figure out a way to contact her boyfriend. Maybe he might remember what happened last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor couldn't believe how slutty she looked. She would never be caught dead in public dressed like this, even if she had the body to go with it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tucked her hair into a ponytail, using a scrunchie wrapped around her wrist, and pulled up her leggings so they would cover her asscrack:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/h4L2Do4\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/h4L2Do4</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor minced into the casino, her bum wiggling rhythmically in her leggings as she went. She was toeing quite the 'caboose' back there, drawing the gobsmacked stares of casino patrons as she approached a clerk at the front counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Taylor!\" Said the young man behind the counter. She could tell he was flummoxed by her new appearance, as he tried to stay professional and not train his eyes on her busty figure. \"Great performance last night, by the way. How can we help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to have lost my cell phone and purse last night.\" She murmured truthfully. <i>Along with her whole body</i>, she inwardly thought. But she continued, \"May I please use your phone to call for a pick up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk handed her a phone and she dialed her boyfriend's number. He picked up instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor? I've been calling you all morning but there was no answer. Where are you?\" He asked, clearly concerned about her disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later. I'm back at the casino, can you pick me up in the back?\" She implored. He said he would be there momentarily, and ten minutes later she climbed into the front passenger's seat of their tinted Mercedes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed her strangely as she hefted her buxom frame into the car and plopped her big ass onto the seat. He noticed that she fastened the seat belt snugly against her chest, cleaving her large boobs in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor... what happened to your body?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember everything that happened last night?\" She asked him uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at least I think so. You had a concert, we had a heart-to-heart conversation afterwards, and then you wanted to be left alone.\" He said, apparently forgetting the encounter with the magician and the head swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Taylor told him the whole story, how she met the magician named Cosmo the something-or-other and he whisked both of them onto his stage. How he had been enchanted to forget the magic show, and how she had been swapped onto this woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it could have been much worse.\" Taylor finished her story, looking down at her knockers. She shifted in her seat, picking out the leggings which had again swallowed up into her new asscrack and vagina. \"I need to change out of these clothes, slutty is not a good look for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Her boyfriend nodded. They pulled up to their hotel, and he escorted her into their room without anyone else seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor immediately stripped out of her bodysuit and leggings, disposing the garments in disgust, and searched through her luggage for more modest clothing. She bent over her bags, giving her boyfriend a good look at her full ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed. She spun around, her boobs swaying as she did so. Her boyfriend nervously adjusted his trousers, fighting against a raging hard-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" He said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...\" Taylor said, covering her puffy nips with her hands. She quickly stepped into a pair of panties, but with her new waist size the poor fabric was stretched tightly across her butt, threatening to snap at any instant. She noted that her new body was freshly shaved 'down there,' wondering whether it has had sex recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we'll have to buy some new clothes for you. Not much is going to fit, it seems.\" Her boyfriend stated, watching her struggle into a pair of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's out of breath by the time she's done shimmying into them, pulling them up over her ass. \"And I'll have to go to the gym twice as often to work off all of this junk in my trunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's kind of hot, actually.\" He admitted, still rocking a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor abandoned the idea of putting on one of her own bras, given the dramatic increase in cup size, and threw on one of her baggiest tops instead. The white cotton material stretching against her bust and not offering a whole lot of support:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/KfbAK8q\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/KfbAK8q</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor examined her appearance in the mirror. She threw on a light jacket to cover her tattooed arms, even though it's still hot in August in Las Vegas. There was no hiding her new busty figure, but at least she wouldn't draw attention like she did in that rakish outfit back on the street. Having no doubt those pictures were already en route to the biggest tabloids in the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you mentioned this swap happened at a magic show last night after we split up. Whose body is that under your head?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" Taylor said, sitting down on the bed. \"I couldn't get a good look before Cosmo recited his spell. I lost consciousness after that, and then woke up on the street about an hour ago. But I do know that whoever owned this body most likely has my body now. That's what Cosmo said before he cast that spell, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where we might find that woman... whoever she is.\" Her boyfriend said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is: Do Taylor Swift and her boyfriend find out where her old body went?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taylor Swift stayed inside her hotel room for the rest of the day, too mortified to leave and be noticed. She and her boyfriend ordered room service and watched a few films to pass the time. Ordinarily, she would have hit the clubs, visited her friends, or tried her hand at any number of gambling floors along the Strip. She only got to visit Las Vegas a few times each year and it was one of her favourite stops while out touring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the obvious problem was it wouldn't be <i>her</i> hand being dealt cards or inserting bills into a slot machine. It was this curvy, top-heavy woman's hand. Taylor refused to think of the body below her head as belonging to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor looked at her fake nails and paced the room like a caged animal. Her wide hips prevented her from making the sort of graceful steps that captivated her audiences. Instead, her ass swayed in a sultry, hypnotic rhythm. Her hips pitched back and forth against her best efforts, her creamy thighs rubbing against each other as she walked back and forth. Gone was her poised glide, replaced instead with a sexy strut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! This is horrible!\" She squealed, falling back onto the bed and causing her boobs to bounce about wildly within her top. Everything felt so alien and different compared to her tall, slender figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her boyfriend steps out of the bathroom, bringing the cell phone off his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tay, that was Aidan Phillips,\" He said, referring to Taylor's manager. \"The other band members have arrived in Los Angeles and are wondering when you will arrive. We need to get on the next flight as soon as possible. Otherwise, you might miss your next concert at the Hollywood Bowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor had completely forgotten about her next scheduled performance. She was on tour, after all, debuting her newest album. Los Angeles was the biggest venue on her schedule, the single greatest opportunity to showcase her best songs and electrify tens of thousands of fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTens of thousands of album-buying, merchandise-shopping, ticket-paying fans. If she didn't show up for the performance, it would be disastrous for her tour, and possibly cause her to get kicked off her record label deal by Aidan Phillips. That guy only took on the best disciplined singers; he was well known in the music industry for his short temper and high expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long until the next performance?\" Taylor asked uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boyfriend looked at his watch. \"About six hours. We can still get there with time to spare, but we have to hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But I can't go out looking like THIS!\" Taylor shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still look pretty hot,\" He replied. \"Let's figure out how to get your body back later. Either way, Aidan is expecting you to be there tonight for the performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the room to check out of the hotel and arrange a limousine to transport them to the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor began pacing the room again... until she noticed a very interesting program running on the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a brand new exclusive interview with Kim Kardashian... only Kim looked much different than Taylor remembered her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis episode of Hollywood Insider began with a montage of the female socialite:<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/n069WY6\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/n069WY6</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/Out5S5u\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/Out5S5u</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/XC3cQNB\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/XC3cQNB</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Interviewer: If you've ever watched an episode of The Kardashian Fashion, you know all about Kim Kardashian! She has tens of millions of followers, millions of dollars of net worth, and a family that rivals royalty in terms of name recognition. Yes, this Queen of American reality television has done it all. Or has she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/nnvs1Vv\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/nnvs1Vv</a></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's stomach fell. \"HEY! THAT'S MY BODY!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Kim Kardashian could be seen pirouetting and posing on-screen wearing Taylor Swift's body below her head. The contrast was astonishing; Kim's darker skin tone against Taylor's milk-white skin colour. Kim's surgically enhanced cheekbones, nose, and waxed eyebrows against Taylor's natural body proportions. The seamless transition between her torso and neck. Her dick-sucking, bee stung lips sent an altogether different message from Taylor's girl-next-door figure below her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kim: I've got a new lease on life! I feel years younger, full of energy, and ready to take on the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Interviewer: Take a seat, Kim. Oh my God, your legs look so slender and sexy! And have you gotten taller?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim: (laughs) I'd like to think the camera adds a few inches of height, Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Interviewer: When did you find the time to lose so much weight? You had just given birth to your second child last month... and congratulations, by the way! But usually it takes some time to get your body back into shape after going through something like that, doesn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/RJVQeWl\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/RJVQeWl</a></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor felt like throwing up. She had never experienced childbirth before, and yet here she was sporting a body that had recently gone through a second pregnancy. Her current body had carried another man's seed on two occasions. Her belly certainly had the stretch marks and spider veins to prove it, now.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nKim: (crossing her legs in her chair) I felt like I wanted to be a better mom to my children. Y'know, set a good example for them as they grow up by staying fit and active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Interviewer: That's a noble goal, Kim, but how exactly did all of this happen? Because girl, send me the name of your plastic surgeon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim: What you're looking at is all-natural. I've wanted to become a vegetarian for a long time, so I think I'll try that out and see where it goes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Interviewer: What does your husband, the famous rapper Kanye West, think of your new figure? Speaking of him, you're not willing to take all meat off the menu, are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim: (licking her lips) Well... I think I could make an exception for him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Taylor thought it couldn't get any worse! Is she going to use Taylor's body to have sex with her husband? And Kanye West, of all people! The very person who Taylor Swift hated the most, professionally speaking. She remembered receiving an award at the 2009 Video Music Awards, only to be stood up by Kanye West himself on stage. At the critical moment, in front of millions of viewers, he snatched the microphone out of her hands and loudly disagreed with the decision. Even though he apologised for it later, the two haven't been on speaking terms since... and that extended to his wife, Kim Kardashian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Male Interviewer: Let's talk about your exercise routine. What do you say to your millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram, who want to look as good as you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor turned off the TV in disgust. \"That bitch stole my body and left me with her older, postpartum body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her boyfriend re-entered the hotel room and announced they were ready for check out. Taylor filled him in on the news and what she witnessed on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to her story, he rubbed his chin. \"Wow. So that's Kim Kardashian's body? I thought that tattoo looked familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared daggers at him, so he coughed. \"I mean... look on the positive side, Taylor. Now we know whose body you have. All we have to do is track her down and find some way to switch you two back to normal. She might know more about that magical act from the night before. Maybe she was the one who arranged it in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about tonight's performance in Los Angeles?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still perform tonight,\" He reassured her, rubbing her shoulder affectionately. \"You still have your wonderful voice. Plus, we can just ask for a lot of smoke on the stage and to dim the lights a bit. That way, most fans won't be able to see your body clearly. Some people in the front rows will, of course, but we might be able to play it off like you've put on weight recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I have, haven't I?\" Taylor asked, dejectedly, as she stared down at her gigantic boobs, pudgy belly, and childbearing hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and grabbed her hand. \"Now come on. I booked the first flight out of here to L.A. Our limousine is waiting outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor threw her now ill-fitting clothing into her suitcase and left the room, her boyfriend leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
