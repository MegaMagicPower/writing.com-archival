She's skeptical, cynical, sarcastic, and frequently self-depreciating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vast darkness, but it wasn't dark. It stretched to infinity, but every inch of it was amazingly close to her. She was standing on something, but nothing was below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia knew full well she was dreaming. However, even knowing it was a dream didn't keep her from being amazed at the sight before her. She'd had lucid dreams before, but she'd never been this lucid at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before her, there stood a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not a man. A boy. A boy of roughly sixteen years old, one year older than Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome,\" the boy said, \"to my humble abode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia's sense of humor took hold of her. \"Dreary place,\" she said. \"Would it kill you to clean up a bit? Maybe put in some furniture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy chuckled. \"You're an amusing one,\" he said. \"Most people say something like, 'I must be dreaming', or something reverent like \"I tremble in your presence, O Almighty'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you want me to kowtow?\u201d Amelia snorted. \u201cTo some\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t find the words to describe this person because every aspect of him seemed to shift when she wasn\u2019t looking at it. One moment he would have brown eyes and blond hair, the next he would be so dark-skinned he might as well be a charcoal briquette, and then he looked like a high school footballer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I wanted you to do anything,\u201d the boy said. \u201cHowever, I will ask you something like that right now. Do you want my position for a cosmic day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Amelia said. \u201cDo I want your position? Who are you first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have gone by many names. Odin, Chronos, Brahman, Ra, Yahweh or Jehovah interchangeably. But my most common name is God.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia flicked her eyes from his emerald-green left eye to his sky-blue right one, then back to the left one which had changed to her exact shade of Hazel. \u201cWhat, so you want me to take over as God?\u201d She laughed. \u201cAll right then, Your Lordliness. I\u2019ll accept, <i>if</i> you\u2019re the real thing. What will you do in the meantime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleeping,\u201d God said. \u201cFor the rest of the cosmic day. You would not believe how much sleep I lose over My creation. If God sleeps, then the world is destroyed. So I want to leave My powers in someone else\u2019s hands to sustain the world until I wake up, let them be God. I did that once before, you know, for My son. But he\u2019s gone now, so I need to hand the reins over to someone else. I chose you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust get it over with already,\u201d Amelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d God said. \u201cGood night.\u201d He disappeared, and Amelia sat bolt upright in her bed, wondering why she had had such a strange dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, stripped off her pajamas, laid them on her bed, and took a look at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t attractive at all. If nothing else, she looked like a tall preteen with her height, long hair, and A-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish these were bigger,\u201d she said aloud, trying to heft her breasts and failing because there was nothing to heft. Then she vaguely noticed something\u2026 were her breasts getting bigger? Were they pushing gently against the skin covering them, and then with more force? Oh my God, they were! Speaking of God, she recalled her dream. She had dismissed it as bullcrap, but maybe there was something to it after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned. The possibilities were literally endless.</span></div></div>",

He was a virgin, but that was soon to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom opened his eyes to find himself stood in a completely black void that seemed to go on forever. He was completely naked, but made no attempt to cover himself, even when an old man appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n\"Hello Tom,\" said the man.<br>\r\n\"Uh..hi,\" Tom replied, confused by the situation.<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're wondering what's happening.\"<br>\r\n\"Well yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"It's simple really,\" the old man began. \"I'm God, and I've decided to give you all of my powers.

Instantly it became hard as stone.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God it worked,\" he said. He began stroking it, but then had another thought. He focused his power on his dick, and let out a loud moan.<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH GOOOOOOOD!\" he moaned as he had an intense spontaneous orgasm. He shot his cum into the air and it landed on his chest. He thrust his hips into the air as his orgasm continued. Nearly a full minute later, when he'd completely exhausted his semen supply, his orgasm ended, and he laid there, panting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom decided to practice using his cool, new powers at school, specifically, in the weight room. After all, one of the coolest things he wanted to do was grow the muscles on some of his buddies at school, especially those guys who were skinny, short and nerdy. They were always the targets of bullying by the bigger guys, and they never had much of a chance to grow any bigger. So, Tom wanted to see who he could change, and how easy it was to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wandered around the small gym and spotted Stephen working out on one of the machines, all the way in the far back corner. Stephen was rather shy, so he tried to stay away from the bigger guys, who usually worked out around the free weights area. Stephen was just over 5 feet tall with black hair and brown eyes. He wore glasses and he just kept to himself. He started working out in the gym just because he wasn\u2019t exercising at all, and his counselor advised him to do something in order to stay in shape. Stephen started gaining a few pounds during the first semester, so he wanted to work out just to keep the weight off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom quietly walked over to the lats pulldown machine as Stephen sat on the leg extension machine. He did about four reps, before he let his legs drop down. He was clearly tired. And, no wonder, his legs were hurting, even though he was only lifting 25 pounds. Stephen was wearing shorts and a tank top, which showed how skinny he was. His legs were short and thin. Tom almost felt sorry for him. Stephen just leaned back against the chair and rested, closing his eyes and breathing heavily. He was exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for Stephen to muscle up\u201d Tom thought quietly. \u201cHe has suffered enough. Tom needs to become a teenage bodybuilder, right\u2026 NOW!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething strange occurred in that weight room. Luckily, Tom was the only person who noticed anything unusual. Stephen was overcome by an odd, intense tingling sensation as he relaxed on the leg extension machine. The feeling felt good, in a way. While Stephen was overcome by these feelings, all his muscles started to grow, just as Tom had commanded! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Stephen\u2019s pectorals bulged from his chest, growing quickly into large mounds of muscle. This forced his shoulders to widen considerably. The boy\u2019s arms inflated with thick, solid muscles as his biceps and triceps followed suit. Next, his flat stomach was suddenly covered with washboard abdominal muscles, making him look like a ripped athlete! Stephen instantly resembled a guy who had been lifting weights in the gym for years already! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen let out a loud moan as his muscles continued to grow. The kid\u2019s quads grew into mighty, vertical pillars of thick, wide columns of muscle which ran from his waist to his knees. His calves inflated like helium balloons, exploding into soccer balls sticking out from the back of his legs. Stephen was suddenly so buff; he could barely sit on the leg extension machine anymore just because his legs had grown too wide! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, one more set\u2026\u201d Stephen sighed as he did one more set of 30 reps, lifting 115 pounds on the machine, far more and much heavier weights than he was doing just three minutes ago. His legs were screaming with power, but he was loving it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen finally stood up and flexed. His arms, his chest, and his legs were just enormous! He looked like a totally cool, young, teenage muscle man. Nobody ever dared bullying him anymore. Stephen was the nicest and the smartest guy in his class, and he had the biggest biceps of all the guys in his grade level. Plus, all the girls would gather around him and rub his massive biceps when he arrived at the schoolyard in the morning. They all asked him questions about their homework assignments, since the big, hunky, lovable nerd was happy to help anyone in need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked on and he was happy with his handiwork. As soon as Stephen got up from working out on the machine, he was surrounded by two boys and two girls, who all wanted to rub his massive muscles. Stephen remained that same, friendly guy who never taunted or bullied anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to find my next victim\u201d Tom grinned, as he scanned the weight room for another guy to grow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He almost wished he could wear the robe longer but he knew he had to remove it as soon as mass was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the people started leaving the sanctuary, Josh walked into the bathroom to change when he saw a bright light before him. Then, another boy materialized before him, wearing a brown robe with a rope tied around his waist. The boy was short, he looked around 10 years old and had black hair, and he began to speak to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hi, Josh. I see you like to be the altar boy. That's very good. I'm going to give you my powers for one cosmic day.\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come to worship me during mass every Sunday. From now on, people will come to mass and they will worship you instead!\" the boy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh?\" Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am God, but you will be God from now on, while I sleep for one cosmic day.\" the boy said, as he placed his hands on Josh's shoulders. \"You will now have all my knowledge, my wisdom and my powers. You're in charge of the universe, Josh. Everything you say, will happen. Every one of your commands will be carried out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy with black hair disappeared, leaving Josh alone in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was 10 years old, he had blond hair and blue eyes and he was 5 feet tall. He was God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh walked out of the bathroom, he saw Father Williams, who lead the mass just a few minutes before. The Father asked Josh if he could take off his robe and place it in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"gosh, I would like to keep my robe a little longer...\" Josh sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Williams suddenly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sure, Josh. Keep the robe as long as you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was astonished. The priest had never allowed that before! Josh the walked around and talked to people, suddenly knowing the names of every single person who was there, even the visitors!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He treasured the ability to teleport everywhere and he used it every chance he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then walked into the kitchen where his mother was preparing supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mom, do you mind if I hang out at ethan's house for awhile this afternoon?\" he asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother didn't mind it, which was the expected answer, and so he finished his lunch and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Josh had gotten outside, he heard the sounds of several animals. There was a raccoon, a cat, and the chirping of a bird in a tree. Josh looked up and spotted the bird, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, come to me!\" Josh said to the bird, but somehow, the other animals instantly recognized who Josh was. They realized right away that Josh was God and their creator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird leaped off the branch and flew over to Josh, neatly landing on his shoulder. The raccoon and the cat also came up to Josh, and they rubbed up against Josh's legs. A few minutes later, a stray dog came walking by, and came up to Josh, and started licking Josh's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys know who I am huh?\" Josh grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Josh continued on his way, and the animals just remained standing, although they just watched him from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh reached Ethan's house, he rang the doorbell and Ethan opened up. Right away, Ethan's cat and dog came up to Josh and rubbed up against his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then went up to Ethan's bedroom, where the two boys played video games together. They played a few games on the xbox, and Josh beat Ethan easy at everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ethan took Josh to the large bird cage out in the back of the house, all four birds flocked over to Josh and sat on Josh's shoulders. Ethan was just astonished and he couldn't understand why all the animals liked Josh so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ethan's mother came home, and she started talking to the boys when she entered the bedroom. She just finished telling them that she had come back from church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Josh! Thanks for coming over!\" Mrs. Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs. Jones. You just came from church, right?\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes, I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard your prayer for Mr. Jones. I'm sorry to hear he's sick with the flu. But, don't worry. He'll get better today!\" Josh said to Ethan's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment, Ethan's father was cured and he was no longer sick with the flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's mother was astonished. She just stared at Josh with a shocked look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh... How could you have heard my prayers? I mean, I was praying these things in church to God!\" Ethan's mother wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear everyone's prayers. I am God.\" Josh replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ethan and his mom stared at the boy in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her husband came out of the room, feeling completely cured from the flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Mr. Jones isn't sick anymore!\" Josh smiled. \"I answered your prayer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" both parents said, as they embraced Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was happy Josh came over, and Ethan couldn't believe it. His best friend from school, who came over to play video games with him, was God!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan couldn't wait to tell his friends at school about Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
