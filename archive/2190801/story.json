There was going to be absolutely nothing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve hadn't planned to spend this summer being bored. He had just graduated high school and had no responsibilities until the fall, when college started. His parents were leaving on a month long vacation to Europe, and he would have the house all to himself. Not that Steve planned to have wild parties. He was a little nerdy...well, a lot nerdy to get included in the party circuit crowd. But he did have his own crowd. And his crowd was planning on spending a month gaming at every hour of the day, interspersed with binge television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept all of Steve's buddies had to bail on him. Even his best friend Stan was going to be gone all month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Steve was going to be by himself housesitting until his parents came home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was starting day two of his house sentence when he got a package in the mail. It was an odd package that looked like it had come from the other side of the world, and had taken the roughest route to get to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat observation wasn't far from the truth. When Steve opened up the package, it contained a television remote and a handwritten note from his granduncle Jefferson. The remote control looked like it was an antique, something you would see in a museum display on the golden age of television. The note was hand scribbled by his uncle, and it was barely legible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve could read every other word in the note, but he realized he must be missing something. According to his uncle, the remote was an artifact, or had been magically imbued, or something. But supposedly it had the ability to extract a woman from a television screen and plant her right in front of you, shrunk to six inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn artifact television remote control? That sounded like something from Warehouse 13!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided that either his granduncle had gone off his rocker, or Steve wasn't reading the note right. But shows like Warehouse 13 were works of fiction. Devices didn't exist in the real world that would do what his granduncle said this remote did. I mean, shrunken women? There were all sorts of laws of physics and biology that made the idea of a shrunken woman impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve tossed the note aside and went to get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he ate, Steve thought about some actresses that he would love to see at six inches tall. I mean, he could have a lot of fun with a woman that small. And, except for the internet, female anatomy was still a mystery to Steve. He could find out a lot of things from a six inch woman that he couldn't find out in real life. Because a six inch woman would have to be more cooperative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he would hurt anyone, no matter what her size, Steve told himself. He'd be real gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve shook his head. He needed to get that idea out of his head. You couldn't shrink a woman down to six inches. It was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve went back to the family room and turned on the television. He started scrolling through the menu, seeing if there was anything that would keep his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve saw the 'artifact' remote control lying where he left it. He ignored it, and continued scrolling down the menu of channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Steve swore and grabbed the artifact remote. He told himself he was going to use it just once so that he could get the shrinking fantasy out of his head. With that in mind, Steve started looking for a show or musical video to extract a shrunken woman from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich category of women does Steve select his shrunken woman from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she met Ashton Kutcher's character, she had just initially hooked up with him for the sex. She hadn't decided to get serious about it until he acted like he wanted it to be serious. And then he screwed her over by getting back together with his high school girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve thought Ashton Kutcher must be a douche in real life because he was so good at playing them on television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much sympathy as Steve had for the character that Kelli Goss played, it didn't mean he wouldn't mind having a six inch Kelli Goss to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, as soon as Kelli Goss appeared on the screen, Steve pointed the artifact remote at the screen and pushed a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that same instance, in her apartment, Kelli Goss had just put on a bikini top and thong panties, and was about to put on some short shorts to take a few instagram photos of her skateboarding. Before she had a chance to put on her shorts or shoes, though, she disappeared from her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the world came into focus, twenty-six year old Kelli found herself standing in front of giant eighteen year old guy, wearing only a bikini top and a thong. In truth, it wasn't the boy who was a giant, but Kelli who was only six inches tall. She didn't realize that, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli and Steve stared at each other for what seemed forever, both in a state of shock. It was Steve who came to his senses, first.

It was designed to operate within certain parameters, and to produce certain results within those parameters. And, like most tools, the individual(s) who crafted assumed the user would know how to use it within those limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case, Steve knew that if he pointed and clicked the remote at the right time, it would theoretically give the desired results, i.e., a hot young woman shrunk down to six inches for him to play with. He didn't actually believe it would happen, but that's what he was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) for Steve, the artifact was designed to shrink one chosen woman at a time. It could shrink multiple women, but it was meant to do so consecutively, not concurrently. When Steve tried shrink two women at once, it overloaded the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the remote drew energy and information from both Steve and the internet. The information was accidental. It had all the information it thought it needed. Steve wanted Chasty and Elisha, and the remote was trying to provide that duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it tapped into the internet, it got confused, and tried to find someone to \"team up\" Chasty with. It saw that Chasty had guest starred in an episode of Smallville with Erica Durance, and so decided to team Chasty up with Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it tapped into Steve, it saw that the eighteen year old virgin had only the vaguest knowledge of how women's clothing could \"accentuate\" the figure, and so Steve often confused the \"accentuation\" with reality. So Steve often fantasized about a hyper-idealized form of a woman, and not the woman herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result was that two six inch women appeared before him, both in white bikinis, and both once again in their mid- to late twenties. Both had long hair, reaching down to the middle of their back, which Erica didn't have at that time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were their breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women were now sporting D cups, a fact made more apparent by the fact they were restrained by undersized bikini tops that covered their nipples and very little else. Their bikini bottoms were also \"materially challenged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and the two women stared at each other, remaining absolutely motionless, until</span></div></div>",

The next, there was a six inch bikini clad April Bowlby standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a tossup to say who was more shocked, Steve or April. Steve had hoped the artifact remote was going to work, but hadn't really expected it to. It was the real world after all, and magic devices didn't show up in the mail that allowed eighteen year guys to bend the laws of physics to suit their new fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept this particular fantasy device actually did work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril, on the other hand, definitely wasn't expecting to pop up in front of a giant eighteen year old boy wearing just a bikini. She had just finished filming the last episode for the first season of Doom Patrol and was looking forward to sleeping for a week. April was in good shape, but she was approaching forty, and found she just couldn't snap back into things as quickly as she could when she was in her twenties and filming Two and a Half Men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she suddenly appeared in front of a giant Steve wearing just a bikini, there were quite a few small things (no pun intended) she noticed. The little aches and pains (again, no pun intended) that she picked up in a season filming Doom Patrol had vanished. Her hair was a few inches longer. And her stomach, though never having been flabby, had not been this flat and taught since she had filmed Two and Half Men almost fifteen years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the little things April noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big thing she noticed was a giant eighteen year old boy staring down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril and Steve stared at each other, motionless, for what seemed forever.

Part of that was intentional. Until it happened, Steve didn't think it was actually  going to happen. Plus, Steve didn't allow himself to think about what he was going to do, because if he did, he'd realize that he was basically kidnapping an unwilling person and potentially altering their physical form for life. And if he thought about it too much, his conscience wouldn't have let him even go through the motions of potentially abducting and shrinking someone, no matter how unlikely that would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Steve hadn't thought about what April Bowlby's reaction was going to be. But it sure wasn't what she did as soon as she looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you're a giant,\" she said, eyes wide but obviously not frightened. \"I guess that means I'm in the land of the giants now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes,\" Steve said with uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet,\" April said, looking around. \"You know, this looks nothing like what the land of the giants looks like in BFG.\" April looks back at Steve, her eyebrows furrowed. \"You're a big friendly giant, aren't you? Not one of those giants that eat people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve nods emphatically. \"Very friendly. And I don't eat people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril beams. \"That's good. You know, when we watched BFG, Jake and Allan said it was special effects, but I didn't think so. I mean, it would take a ton of people to make up a giant costume, and they couldn't be that coordinated. So I bet they just took regular giants and put them in make up for the movie. I can't wait to see the looks on those guys' faces when they find out they're wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve listen to April's voice, and the way she says things and the expression on her face, a thought begins growing in his mind. It doesn't seem possible, but then again, having a six inch bikini clad April Bowlby standing in front of him on top of a coffee table didn't seem possible just a few minutes ago either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Steve begins, \"But I didn't get your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Kandi,\" she responds, extending her hand. \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Steve,\" Steve responds, extending a single finger. When Kandi touches Steve's fingertip, she makes a little \"Oh!\" sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hurt you?\" Steve asks, withdrawing his finger quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Kandi replies. \"Just touching you felt kind of nice. But it surprised me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kandi looks around again, Steve realizes that's not a shrunken April Bowlby in front of him. It's a shrunken Kandi. A character from a television show, and not the actress who plays her. So Kandi had come from a world where the characters from Two and a Half Men were real. That seemed impossible to Steve, but then having a six inch bikini clad woman in front of him should have been impossible too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKandi had asked something while Steve was thinking, and he had to ask her to repeat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said,\" Kandi began,</span></div></div>",

T'Pol stood cuffed, sitting in the Defiant's briefing room, as Archer confronted her with her failed plot. She told him that an alliance such as had happened in the other universe was inevitable, and humans would ultimately pay the price for their arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen next, T'Pol would never know. One instant, she was sitting being interrogated, the next, she found herself standing in front of what appeared to be a giant human male, barely out of adolescence, looking down at her. She estimated the being to be at least twenty meters tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing T'Pol noticed was that her hands were no longer bound. She was unaware as how such a situation had arisen, but she decided to take advantage of it. Her hands immediately went to her waist, but she found her weapons and tools were gone. She looked up at the giant humanoid male and, since it seemed to be in a state of shock, decided not to give it any reason to react hostilely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steve had been going through episodes of Enterprise, he stopped his surfing and watched the mirror universe episode. He thought longer hair looked much better on T'Pol, and he particularly like the Terran Imperial uniform T'Pol wore. That top looked as if it would come undone easily, and the pants looked as if one giant tug would pull them down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Steve pointed the remote, pushed a button, and hope for the best, but not really expecting anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Steve knew, there was a six inch T'Pol standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA six inch Jolene Blalock dressed as T'Pol, including the ears, Steve reminded himself. Though he couldn't understand why whatever brought Jolene here in a shrunken form would do so with ears on her. Had the artifact remote brought her from filming a scene or something? If so, wouldn't it have made the news fifteen years ago when the episode had been filmed. But to the best of Steve's knowledge, Jolene Blalock was alive and well, and had made some made to television movie recently. He didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jolene Blalock didn't behave how a shrunken woman should behave. Well, Steve wasn't sure how a shrunken woman would behave, but it wasn't like how Jolene was behaving. The first thing she had done when she appeared was tap around her waist. Apparently, she hadn't found what she was looking for. But she didn't run or scream or anything. Instead, she stared at Steve, as if she was studying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unnerving.

She had had many a talk with a fan about their common view on Vulcan culture, society, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she knew a lot of fans saw her as Enterprise's answer to Jeri Ryan.

She looked down at the picture and blushed, quickly putting the picture away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture was one she had done in a Maxim photoshoot almost twenty years ago. In the picture, she was wearing bikini panties that bordered on being translucent, and nothing else.

Her clothes had disappeared, and her hair was growing out. And her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolene couldn't explain it, but it felt as if her body was growing younger. All the little aches and pains she had accumulated over the years were disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jolene materialized...well, she didn't know where she materialized. But she knew she was nude, save for a pair of bikini panties. Her hair was draped over her breasts, but all that seemed to do was emphasize the air on her bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was a giant eighteen year old boy looking down at her.

Nobody knew if she had been kidnapped, had met foul play, or simply decided to shuck her life and begin a new one. No one really thought the last was feasible. Jessica was at the apex of her fame at the moment, both with her music, her participation in films and her reality show. But as the years passed, and no one could find any evidence of her having been the victim of a crime, the idea of her having simply decided to go and live a brand new life gained more traction, especially among a fringe element. Jessica sightings became as common as Elvis sightings, and just as reliable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a side note, Steve had only been three years old at the time of Jessica's disappearance, and by the time he was eighteen, that disappearance had become a cultural footnote. As Steve pointed the artifact remote at Jessica's last music video, he had no idea that he had been responsible for a change in his timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in 2004, Jessica had just finished filming the part of her video where she danced around the General Lee parked in a barn, while wearing just a pink bikini. She was in her trailer, and had kicked off her shoes, and had drained two water bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's career and fame might have been at an apex, but Jessica herself had a different perspective on things. For one thing, she had just found out that, while she was on location filming Dukes of Hazzard, Nick had been cheating on her. She had thought she and Nick had something special, but apparently Nick had not been as enamored with his new wife as she was with him. The availability of attractive women, couple with Jessica's absence, constant run ins with Jessica's father, and Nick's lack of willpower, had caused Nick to go back to his womanizing ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica leaned back on the couch in her trailer and sighed. \"I wish I could just get away from all this. Let someone else take charge for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish granted,\" a voice said from out of nowhere. Before Jessica could react, the world around her grew fuzzy, then disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing anyone knew, a six inch bikini clad Jessica was standing in the middle of Steve's living room on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant Steve and Tiny Jessica just stared at either, neither believing what they were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve made the first move.

There was an attitude of \"Now you know me, so just ignore how you know me, and pay attention to my serious stuff.\" Halle had always been more relaxed about things. For example, when Catwoman had bombed, Halle had been a good sport and actually shown up to accept her Razzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalle knew a lot of the diehard fans of the X-Men had panned her portrayal of Storm. But she also knew that the majority of fans who had only come to know Storm through the cinematic version of the franchise had absolutely loved her version. And truth be told, she had had a lot of fun making the movie. And it was one of the films that had led to her interviewing/being interviewed by Esquire, which had been a lot of fun, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Halle fondly reminisced about that time two decades ago, the Storm on the television screen shot a lightning bolt.

It was the exact same pair she had wore in the picture that Tony Stark had googled in their first meeting in Iron Man 2. Again, it had been ten years since that picture had been taken, but she somehow recognized it immediately. Even her hair was the same length and color as it had been in that movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the most important thing Scarlett was aware of was that there was a sixty foot giant eighteen year old boy staring down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared at each other for an indeterminate time before the giant broke the stalemate by reaching down to grab Scarlett.

They were still pretty hot. And so was Jessica Biel, who was also in the movie. Steve wondered if she was still doing anything. He couldn't remember hearing from her since she got married.

It's primarily here for me to write on, when I feel the urge to write. But others are invited to join, just as long as you follow the following rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Only women may be shrunk, and they may only be shrunk to six inches. Shrinking and un-shrinking are instantaneous<br>\r\n2) No vore, insertion, crushing, killing, pain or bathroom stuff<br>\r\n3) Everyone over eighteen, please<br>\r\n4) Keep sexual interaction between women to ladies of the same size, i.e., normal size to normal size, or shrunk to shrunk<br>\r\n5) You can bring celebrities in either as themselves, or as characters they've played<br>\r\n6) Try to keep your additions consistent with previous postings<br>\r\n7) If you'd like to see a certain storyline develop, but don't want to write it, feel free to drop me a line, and I can add your idea<br>\r\n8) Do not add Choice of Woman chapters. I have seen too many interactive where you have twenty-plus chapters that are basically \"How about this woman? Yes or No?\"All the choices are in the first two chapters. If you want to add another woman in subsequent chapters, that's fine, but no \"Which woman do you choose\" chapters<br>\r\n9) I reserve the right to edit or delete<br>\r\n10) Have fun</td>",
