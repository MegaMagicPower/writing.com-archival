Next to him, his former girlfriend, now wife Suki looked over him adoringly. Around them was a younger generation of Kyoshi warriors; all young, energetic and somewhat sad that they weren't around for the hundred years war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive years into the peace, the twenty year old Sokka was not only an ambassador to the fire nation but the holder of a dozen technological patents and a contributor to a popular magazine in Republic city. The young strapping lad had never lost his great appetite for meat, it' had only grown. And it was starting to show. While Suki was lean as a whip and twice as fast, Sokka had developed a nice little potbelly. Said potbelly had strained against the buttons of his shirt; which were now opening up in diamond patterns. Suki could barely hide her interest as she gazed at the dark, jiggly flesh under the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a friday night and a feast day of the Water tribe. Sokka had passed the evening telling war stories and badly abusing food and drink. However finely crafted his belt may be, it wasn't a match for the five lizard chickens he'd eaten nor the multiple cups of wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka laughed with the young Kyoshi warriors and gulped back the last of his goblet, finishing his sixth lizard-chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great snap, his belt broke and his brown belly spilled all over his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\" he moaned, only half seriously. \" Oh well,\" he gave Suki a semi-drunken smile. \"What'd you say we take desert to go okay, Suki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping with lust at the size of her fattened husband, with his large love handles and barely there man boobs, the fit female warrior nodded, \"Oh yeah sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd enjoyed greatly feeding her beloved husband, who was a mos wise and considerate ruler. he was a greater Leader than Ozai ever was, bringing his nation to the heights of international prestige and economic prosperity. Yet despite or because of his generous spirit, zuko became stressed out with the work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than taking out his anger on others the way Ozai had, Zuko took to food to calm his troubled mind. And Mai had been more than happy to enable the weight gain of her little Fire Lard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce thin and svele, Zuko's belly now spread across his lap up to his knees. his considerable love handles spilled out over the armrest of his chair in the private dining room. Mai was more than turned on by her soft, squishy firelord. He was more fun this way with more of him to love. Double and triple chins wobbled as Mai fed him deep fried meats and sweet treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt delighted Mai to no end that during these feeding sesssions, Zuko would put on his old robes. there was something wonderful about the way the old robes held back his burgeoning male breasts or split apart for the vast, white dome of his belly. She'd had many a lusty anime style nosebleed over the way that his too small pants showed off just a hint of his soft, jiggling ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko swallowed and belched slightly, Mai giggled. Her displays of emotion were subtle, but to zuko she may as well have broadcasted her emotions by shouting on the rooftops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir meal concluded, the couple decided to head for the bedoom; embarrasingly Zuko was stuck in his chair and needed Mai's help to get up. Though there was nobody he trusted more to help him with his ever growing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe waddled along belly and bum shaking and Mai drank in the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch were the fatty days of Lord Zuko. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The idea behind this is straightforward: pick a guy and get them nice and big before you turn them into a berry. You can have one but not the other (so WG or Blueberry is fine, no need to combine them). If you want girls in on the growth too, fine by me so long as the guys get their turn as well. As for rules, pretty straightforward:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No one sentence entries. Anything that's lacking is subject to deletion or editing by me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No death. This is meant to be fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No bathroom stuff please. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from those rules, have fun. </td>",
