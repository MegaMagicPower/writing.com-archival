My dad was experimenting in quantum theory when he came across research of a parallel universe existing. I never thought in all my life something like this would have been discovered. I almost fantasized of it as a child and now we had actual proof. So when my dad asked me to be part of his first experiment to try to open a gate to that world I couldn't refuse. It was the chance of a lifetime, an opportunity that I thought that I would never have again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that day however, things started to go wrong as my dads portal started to lose quantum balance. It started ripping holes into walls, small black holes quickly absorbed energy and dissipated just as fast. And before I could react, one of these holes got me. I guess I vanished from Earth and my universe. I have been stuck in a dark loop for a long time now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am going out of mind hoping I will see something other then darkness. Today might be that day as things are starting to change around me. Slowly light breaking threw around me and time seeming to return. I thought I might be back in the lab with my dad. But as the world around me started to take shape it was a whole lot bigger. Or maybe I am smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShapes becoming reality as soon I could feel the air and the odd feeling that time was returning. I am finally getting my bearings. What is this place?? It so gigantic, but looks familiar to my world. Am I in?</span></div></div>",

However, the house and everything inside of it was giant sized compared to me. And so as I got up onto my feet I saw that I was in the living room area which had a very mssive couch, chair, a few tables here and there, a TV stand with a truly gigantic flat screen TV on it which currently turned off at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this only caused me to let out a small wistle before I commented out loud to myself, \"Wow, I odn't know who owns this house. But whoever they are they must be very well paid to have all of this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard some thuds coming from another part of the house to which you knew meant that whoever owned this house was about to walk into the living room. This prompted to look around for a bit while you said, \"Oh curd, I better hide somewhere.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAnd so you quickly ran over to one of the front legs of the couch and hide behind that. You then held your breathe as you heard the thuds getting closer along with seeing a very massive shadow as well. And within a few seconds you found your eyes widening in shock when you saw a very heavily muscled and male anthro.....</span></div></div>",

Some machines not even resembling anything that of Earth. Looking around this place is making me a bit nauseous, its so big and nerve racking. I look around the room in order to find anything or something to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE??\" I can't believe what I am seeing. Standing in front of me was the biggest and most, well, non existent mythical creature on Earth a dragon! I gasped as I surveyed his human-like body. He was a cool amber color with an orange cream layer over his pecs and abdomen. He was muscular I could tell from the tight shirt he was wearing that outlined his bulging biceps and shoulders. As my gazed travelled lower I could see that he had a large tail the swooped side to side with such grace. I could feel the breeze from its swaying as he walked on by me unnoticed of my presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I searched the room further it was loaded with creatures of similar nature. A large crocodile, hulking massive creature was ripped head to toe. He had some weight around his midsection, but with how muscular he was underneath it was just defined bulk. Coming out of what I am guessing is a locker room was a slim Iguana who was green with a blue lined down his back. He looked more of a runner, slim and toned. How fitting for an Iguana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, in the corner was a sight to see as well. With huge wonder and amaze I couldn't help but let my jaw drop as I saw a human-like dinosaur. Now maybe this isn't as cool as the mythical dragon, but I still could not contain the air in my lungs at the sight. He had to be a Tyrannosaurus. His large head and massive jaws was accompanied by not so short arms (lucky him i guess evolution in this world helped him out) and massive chest. His powerful legs sent shivers through my spine. His butt tight and muscular and a large tail drooped down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to breathe heavy unknowing of what to do or if it even was a good idea to ask for help from one of these creatures. Taking a deep breathe and gaining some courage I made my decision and headed for...</span></div></div>",

The shelves of canned food, freezers with frozen dinners, lame music on the intercom. Yep my introduction to this new giant world is a grocery store, good grief i was hoping for something exciting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue a sudden shake began to emit from the ground, not a pattern like of an earthquake. But like that of a sequence of footsteps, i felt as if i was going to fall over with the shaking becoming more intense. What's more that must clearly be the inhabitants of this world, i need to be careful after all i went through i can't end up a red splat under someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as i turned to look up i found a heavy and earth shattering force stomp down next to me. I groaned as i was thrown onto the ground and slid on the mopped floor. A shadow was covering the area i was in, sure enough looking up i saw a brown sandal that could cover a house with it's size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion took over me as slid into the foot wasn't a human foot. It was green and the toes had what appeared to be claws hanging over them. I couldn't believe it as i look further up...this giant wasn't a human it was a...reptile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iguana was standing like that of a human, his arms were shaped like that of an athlete's, his scales shaping biceps and five figured hands with claws. He had a wite tank top on, with the front pushing out definitely a sign he had some pecs along with his muscular arms. His face appeared more softer, shifting like that of a human's as he looked over the cans, sighing as he needed to move some around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a door opening made me look from the anthro iguana looming over to the freezers. Standing in front was that of a dragon! His yellow scaled boy was wearing a jacket and sweatpants, they were hugging his body and no doubt squeezing muscle. The dragon had two small horns on his head as he happily picked out his T.V dinners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this is insane, this must be the parallel world in dad's research!\", i beamed excited that my father's research succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the sandaled clad feet suddenly shifted, one passed over you. I felt dread at the sole of the shoe afaid of ending up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get some help, figure out everything.\", i brainstormed, who should i ask for help. Both had the risk of seeing you as a bug.</span></div></div>",

Swiping them in a attempt to escape the mini jungle the dirt beneath be soon grew solid like concrete. Stepping out of the grass, i saw that i was on a giant pathway designed like a sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the new giant area it had a very peaceful aura and open design, there were trees and benches scattered around, along with ponds and some some gazebo like buildings. The sky was turning from a orange to a blue sky, signaling it must be morning in this giant park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to shake like that of a stampede, i tried to keep my balance as i looked up to see the inhabitant of this giant world. Shock filled me as jogging down the sidewalk was that of a dragon! It had a humanoid structure looking like that of a tall athlete, the blue scaled body had white occupying the front of his chest and stomach along with the palms and soles. He had fin like appendages at the side of his head and from the front of his handsome face was a pair of front teeth sticking out. His body was dressed in only a pair of work out shorts, letting his large pecs, biceps, and scaley sick pack be on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in awe of the muscular dragon, i recognized the danger as hi saw his feet approaching the path i was on. I jumped back into the grass, just in time as the place i previously stood  was stomped by the large foot of the dragon. I sighed in relief before looking up as the large firm butt and swishing tail of the dragon past over. The dragon had a nonchalant smile as he ran, unaware of almost crushing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back out of the grass i noticed a change in the park. It filled with voices as with the morning other inhabitants began to arrive in this park. Looking around as people filled the park, i looked in awe as instead of humans scaley beings were walking around enjoying the park. A few figures caught my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a bench was a yellow dragon, two horns on the top of his head. He had huge pecs pushing against a shirt hugging his muscular torso and cargo shorts. He appeared to be in his forties and like that of a father figure as he gave a friendly greeting to those passing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a gazebo, a snake anthro was practicing on a guitar. He was a dark and light green wearing a open button up blacm shirt, showing a lean build and a pair of jeans. He seemed content as he made a melody on the instrument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning against a tree appeared to be a grayish blue raptor, more anthro and having a bodybuilder's built. He had on cut jeans and a biker vest, leaving his huge arms and pecs out. He had a permanent scowl on his face as he crossed his buff arms, though i didn't know if it was just his natural face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly at a water fountain was the blue dragon from earlier, drinking while sticking his butt wrapped in his shorts out. Despite nearly stomping me he did seem to be good natured...not to mention attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a breath before deciding to go try and speak to.....</span></div></div>",

First story that I have ever created on here so hopefully this goes well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive is going to be based on a young adult male in around 20 who is shrunk down and surrounded by giant reptilian animals (Or Scalies for some people, you know who you are).

You've been warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the rules,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. All animals are Scalies: Dragons, Reptiles, Dinosaurs, etc...<br>\r\n2. Animals should be anthro and have the ability to talk. (Non-anthros are <i>allowed</i> just wanna focus anthro)<br>\r\n3. Soft Vore, sex, foot stuff, maw play encouraged. (Please no blood/gore/hard vore, not that type of story)<br>\r\n4. Please have ok grammar. If your chapters are horrendous they will be deleted or if I like them and have time and its even possible I'll edited them. <br>\r\n5. Make it as detailed as possible, give names to characters, and damn I'll say it give it a plot or character development. It is way more fun that way.<br>\r\n6.<b> No women characters</b>, this is a m/m story and will stay that way. Too many giantess stories on here. <br>\r\n7. Have fun. Lots. =)<br>\r\n</td>",
