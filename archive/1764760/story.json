He examined his pale skinny body in the mirror and tried to flex, but the lack of muscle wasn't helping his case. Mark slid into his jeans, pulled on a Halo Reach shirt he recieved with the game and slid on his VANS skater shoes. Mark hurriedly rushed downstairs and quickly grabbed a pop tart out of the cupboard. He hurriedly ran outside and managed to make the bus. Mark instinctively knew who to sit with when he got on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Upon entering Mark took a seat with his best pal in the world J.T. Mark and J.T. went back about 10 years and they immediately began talking about the field trip they were going on, \"Dude! Whole Friday in the woods and a full weekend of playing Halo!\" Mark grinned at J.T.'s statement, \"Hang out at the mall, see some chicks.\" J.T. laughed, \"Like we'll ever get to see some chicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Alyssa Andrews was hurriedly slipping into her cheerleading uniform. It was gameday so she had to wear her wildcats gear. Alyssa was pretty happy. Who wouldn't be. She was the most popular girl and she knew it. She had a perfect body, perfect hair, and a pretty face. She knew however that she didn't have the smarts. That was why Alyssa was dreading this day. She had to go on a boring field trip in the middle of the woods with a bunch of freshmen and her ex-boyfriend Chuck. Alyssa applied her makeup, grabbed her purse, and drove to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mr. Jones' biology class arrived in front of the school Mark and J.T. got on the bus first. Not wanting to get beat up by the senior football players in their class they sat in the middle of the bus. When the football players did come on they were confronted by them. Chuck led the attack, \"You freshmen better get in the back. Your seats have more room.\" Not wanting to get in any trouble the two hurried to the back and awaited the arrival of their dream girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alyssa got on the bus Mark and J.T.'s jaws dropped. Her perfect legs, short skirt, and large breasts made the two drool with excitement. When Mr. Jones finished doing the roll call the bus left the school and headed to the national park outside of town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The whole trip took about 3 hours as the bus went further and further into the park. Pretty soon the road was lined so densely with trees that one could barley see anything in the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bus stopped everyone left the bus and Mr. Jones began to give out partner assignments for the day. He began to call out pairs, \"J.T. Spencer is with Chuck Urlacher\" Mark looked over at J.T. and expressed a long of sorrow for him. Next Mr. Jones said, \"Mark Riley is with Alyssa Andrews\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was shocked. He was paired with the sexiest girl at his school! Alyssa on the other hand was disappointed. She wanted to be with another girl, but she realized that this Mark kid would probably do all the work for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class broke into pairs Mark was extremely nervous and approached Alyssa, \"Hey Alyssa...\" Alyssa looked at him and simply said, \"Hey\" As Mark and Alyssa opened their packet for the day they read where they had to go. They were the fungus part of the class and had to go deep into the forest in order to collect a fungus sample. As far as they knew, they would be on their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark and Alyssa set out to get some fungus an awkward dialogue developed, \"So...Alyssa...How do you like Biology?\" \"To be perfectly honest its really dumb. I can't understand half the crap and its boring. I also hope you ralize that you're doing all the collecting. There is no way in hell I'm going to ruin my nails by picking up some fungus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two got deeper in the woods the two stopped hearing birds chirping and wind blowing. A sudden stillness seemed to fall over the forest. Alyssa began to become creeped out and started getting closer to Mark, which in turn made Mark's erection grow ever so more. Just when the stillness seemed to be complete the two heard a shuffling in the trees and suddenly a book feel in front of them. Alyssa screamed as the book fell and fully embraced Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark being the man in the situation examined the book. The cover read, \"Head Wish\". Mark confused opened the cover and read all kinds of names lining the inside page. As he flipped to the first page there was a message on the top, \"Write your wish here and sign your names\" Mark kind of laughed at the book and showed it to Alyssa. Alyssa said, \"We should probably sign it. Apparently a bunch of other people have. Its like a little tradition.\" Alyssa pulled out a pen and wrote in the book, \"I wish I was smarter and had less pressure on me.\" She then signed her name and handed the book to Mark. Mark, not wanting to dissapoint Alyssa grabbed the pen and wrote \"I wish I was more popular.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a great wind took over the area and leaves began to swirl everywhere. The force of the wind was so strong that the two lost conciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark opened his eyes and saw tree branches above him. He moved his head up and was greeted by an intense pain in his neck. As he sat up he felt something fall on his upper thigh. As he looked down he saw two tan and shapely legs. Confused, Mark reached forward and tried to grab the legs, but was shocked when he saw two tan, dainty hands reaching towards the perfect legs. Mark was shocked somehow he had switched bodies with Alyssa. As he continued to feel her body he heard a groaning coming from behind him. As Mark stood up he took full account of his situation. He attempted to pull down the short skirt, but he was instead showing more of his ass. When Mark looked towards the groaning he saw what was obviously his body, but for some reason there was blonde hair on top on the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was confused. If he had swapped bodies, then why does his body have blonde hair? Suddenly everything clicked. Mark felt his face and could feel his masculine structures and facial hair. He had somehow swapped heads with Alyssa Andrews the head cheerleader!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It seems to her that something is wrong with Mark.  Taking a few moments to actually look at him she noticed that his head was on a very feminine body.  Not realizing why but she decide to look down, only to find that the body she sees is that of a male's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProcessing his for a second Alyssa starts to scream, realizing that the body that her head was attached to was actually male's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please calm down Alyssa.  We are both in the same boat.  Freaking out isn't going to help either of us right now,\" said Mark.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't manage to say anything even remotely intelligible as he looked at the scene with wild, terrified eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror, the figure below him had the long, blond locks and pretty young face of Alyssa Andrews. Her eyes were closed and her face wore a serene, if unconscious expression. Normally, he would have appreciated a close, personal view of Alyssa's beautiful features, but the all-too-familiar body her head now seemed to be attached to made that impossible. From the neck down, Alyssa now had his thin, young, and very male body! The body he had been born with, lived with every day of his life, and woken up with that very morning now seemed to be Alyssa Andrews'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as horrible, his own head was now attached to the gorgeous high school senior's tan, toned, and very, very female body! Mark looked down with wild-eyed awe and terror. As impossible as it seemed, his head was now on the neck and shoulders of the beautiful cheerleader! He could feel the air of the forest on her amazing legs and thighs, the heft of her breasts pushing against the material of her uniform's top, and, the fingers of the long delicate hands he now held up before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This is impossible!!! I'm Alyssa! I have her body!!!!\" Mark screamed. He felt his new neck with his newly acquired slender hands. The skin was smooth, with no evidence of stitching or attachment. Mark closed his eyes and grimaced. \"How could we be so stupid!?!?! Why did we sign that stupid book...\" Mark gasped, \"The book!!!\" He looked around the ground beneath him, his new short skirt lifting up as he spun around and searched frantically. \"I have to find it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while...</span></div></div>",

As Mark strutted over to Alyssa he felt strange as he felt his new tight ass wiggle as he strutted towards her. As Mark got closer he further noticed the bouncing of his new breasts that were bulging out of his blue cheerleading top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark saw the figure in front of him slowly sit up and he kneeled down besides her on his new tan legs. Mark then asked, \"Are you ok Alyssa?\" Alyssa groaned and took what had once been his hands up to the area where her pretty head attached to his body, \"I think so. My neck really hurts though.\" When Alyssa's manly hands touched her new body however she opened her eyes in terror, \"Why am I wearing you cloths kid?\" She then looked at Mark and her eyes widened. She looked at a tan female body wearing a cheerleading uniform with it's navel exposed and abs showing. She then looked up at Mark's head attached to it and screamed in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in God's name is your head on my body?!\" Mark desperately tried to calm her down but his efforts were if no use. Alyssa began to scream and feel around your body. \" My tits are gone! My legs! And now I have the body of some nerdy Freshman boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark decided to take control of the situation by slapping Alyssa with her own hand, \"My name is Mark and you need to calm down and look at the facts. We made wishes in that book and somehow it switched our heads. I don't want to be a cheerleader and you don't want to be me. Get a hold of yourself and help me find this book so we can change back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa wiped the tears away from her face and stood up. She began to further feel Mark's body. When she looked at Mark a noticeable buldge appeared in her jeans and Mark began to think, \"that really is my body.\" Mark stood up with Alyssa, now noticing that he was slightly taller than her now, adjusted his skirt and pulled his top up higher. The two then began to search the forest floor...</span></div></div>",

Mark was at a loss as to what to say to Alyssa, and she was still in shock over having just awoken to the nightmarish situation she now found herself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark bent forward and looked all around him. The alien, strange sensations of a body not his own made his focus a difficult thing to maintain. His new height, center of gravity, and sense of balance were all completely out of whack now. A shy, modest young man; Mark was feeling incredibly exposed in Alyssa's tiny cheer-leading uniform. He could feel the hem of her skirt on her thighs, the cool air on her taught, sexy stomach; he could feel every inch of the sexy body he had lusted after for so long. He was feeling a bit sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her par, Alyssa divided her attention between looking for the book, watching her own body from a strange new detached perspective, and taking in the feel of the odd new body she found her head perched upon. She could hardly believe what had happened to her! How could any of it be possible!?!?! As she watched what had been the body she had formerly been blessed with every other day of her life from behind, she began to feel a strange new sensation in her new crotch. She'd been aware of the feel of something down there before, but now it seemed to be stiffening...almost painfully. She tentatively adjusted it with her new male hands. \"Ewwww....gross...\" she whispered to herself as she grimaced in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shouted, snapping her out of her musings. \"I got it!!!\" He held the book up in Alyssa's former hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God...does it say we can fix this!?!?!\" Alyssa asked as she rushed over and crowded next to Mark and her taller former body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mark could say anything a pair of fellow students came into the clearing.

The pair of Freshmen girls simply called out, \"Hey guys!\" and continued on their merry way. Mark was dumbstruck and wondered why they had not noticed anything out of the ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa then asked you the same thing, \"Mark. Why did those girls not notice anything weird about us?\" Mark now confused asked Alyssa for his wallet. Alyssa was clearly confused, \"Why do you want your wallet. Don't we have bigger things to worry about\" as she pointed at Mark's new bust. Mark grabbed his wallet and opened it to discover a new horror. On his drivers permit was the lovely head of Alyssa. In the picture Mark recognized the Call of Duty shirt he had worn that day. Looking at the information on the permit it was all the exact same except for the facial features section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Alyssa with a new look of terror. Alyssa now concerned questioned, \"Whats wrong? Why are you freaking out?\" Mark handed her the permit and Alyssa too freaked out. \"I can't be you! Its one thing to have some nerdy boy's body, but to actually be him too!\" Mark trying to get a grasp on the situation opened the book to look for a way out of this arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the book with his new delicate hands he scanned the pages for the place to write wishes, but the book had completely changed. It now read, \"Spend thee lives for 1 month and learn ye lesson. If not, than your new flesh will become permanent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark read this aloud and Alyssa once again began to cry, \"This can't be happening. Not to me. I'm too perfect!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark rolled his eyes at Alyssa and then realized that he was now her. He was Alyssa Andrews. His wish had come true, but looking down at his new body exposed in it's cheerleading uniform he too felt sick at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do Mark and Alyssa...</span></div></div>",

How can you just go back to that boring plant stuff when...when...\" she gestured down to her new young male body, \"THIS has happened to us?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark cocked his head and gave Alyssa an annoyed look. \"What else can we do? According to this stupid book we're stuck like this for a month, if not longer!\" Mark shuddered, the thought of being Alyssa Andrews for a month was terrifying enough; the thought of being her permanently was all much too much to bear!

More than a little annoyed, he threw himself into the school assignment and started gathering specimens. Each step reminded him of his bizarre new predicament. The strange sway of Alyssa's hips threw her little cheer-leading skirt up and down; it's short hem brushing against the smooth thighs he now took his steps with. He could feel her lovely breasts jiggle with each footfall. He shuddered and tried to re-focus on the school work as he felt the odd void between his new legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the school assignment down and stomping Alyssa's sneaker-clad feet into the dirt in rage, Mark finally gave in to frustration. \"Damn it! How could I have been so stupid! I don't want to be her!!!\" Tears started to stream down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of someone approaching from behind snapped Mark out of his fit.

Mark and I have been friends since Kindergarten.\" Alyssa nodded and Mark began to notice something strange about the way J.T. was looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the typical relaxed look that J.T. usually had towards him, Mark could tell that he was nervous and trying to be \"cool\". \"Mark\" then asked J.T. if he could have some alone time with Mark. J.T. obliged and left the two alone. Alyssa quickly whispered, \"Way to put me on the spot like that! I don't know any of your friends!\" Mark laughed a little, \"The only real one you're going to have to know is J.T. We hang out all the time.\" Alyssa then asked, \"What did Ashlyn say to you?\" Mark then looked a little sad and said, \"She asked what it was like spending time with a dork.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa felt kind of angry, but she tried to brighten the mood, \"We'll you're certainly not a dork now. In fact you're at the top of the food chain.\" Mark looked down at his body dressed in the tight cheerleading uniform and then looked back into Alyssa's eyes, \"The top of the every guy wants you food chain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Alyssa then got on the bus and sat in the seat where Alyssa had originally sat. On the seat was a Victoria's Secret \"Pink\" purse. Mark and Alyssa sat down and Mark began to rummage through the purse. He found a billfold and pulled it out. Inside was Alyssa's wallet with her drivers license. Mark pulled the license out and was greeted by his big smile, the only problem was his head was attached to Alyssa's body in the picture with him wearing a cleavage revealing spaghetti strap top. Mark leaned over and showed it to Alyssa, \"I hope you don't have that top anymore.\" Alyssa smiled and quipped, \"You'll be surprised at what that top can do. It got me through my econ class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Alyssa.... </span></div></div>",

My mom Jenna on the otherhand is one of those creepy parents who acts like their child and tries to be cool with them. A lot of people text me and Facebook me so be prepared to use my iPhone.

As I recall the book said to try to live by each others lives.\" Alyssa nodded and the car came ever closer to her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window Mark saw that they were now in the rich part of town and exclaimed,\"Your house must be huge!\" Alyssa replied, \"Actually Mark it's yours for alittle while.\" Alyssa pulled into the driveway of what was her large house and turned off the car and said to Mark, \"Welcome home \"Alyssa\". </span></div></div>",

She found herself wondering if every boy she would normally run into during the course of her day had as much trouble as she did concentrating on anything other than looking at her gorgeous body. \"Yeah...what's that old saying? \"It keeps the rain off our heads\".\" Alyssa walked towards the staircase. \"My parents won't be home for a while. Daddy always works late and my Mother is probably out shopping or running around with her girlfriends. Let's go up to my room; I'll walk you through what you're going to have to do at the game tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark let out a frustrated sigh. He'd almost managed to forget that Alyssa's body would be expected to cheer at the school's game tonight. \"Great.\" he said with no pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair walked up the stairs and passed a table in the hall, Mark couldn't help but notice a series of framed pictures sitting on the tabletop. As the only child, Alyssa was prominently featured in the photographs. Or, at least her body was! In each and every one of them, Mark's head now rested on her lovely shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of a very young Alyssa, clad in a sundress now sported Mark's smiling face; Mark's face as it looked at the age of seven or eight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother photo showed Alyssa and her Mother on Vacation in some tropical clime. The pair wore bikinis and were embracing as they smiled for the photographer. Alyssa's incredibly sexy curves, clad only in a small pink bikini top and briefs, had Mark's smiling, slightly disheveled head perched on it's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another, apparently from a past prom or homecoming, Alyssa's body was attired in a very sexy off the shoulder purple dress and a pair of black stiletto sandals. Mark would've been very happy to have taken a look at her dressed up in her finery if his head wasn't winking at him from on top of her sexy body! He was holding hands and posing with that jerk Urlacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's face was pale and his eyes wide. \"This is nuts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa came up behind him and scanned the photos as well. She put a hand on her former shoulder and tried to comfort Mark. \"You won't catch me disagreeing. Don't worry, we'll get through this and be back to normal before you know it.\" She did her best to give him a reassuring smile as she grabbed her former hand with Mark's previous one and led him to her room.</span></div></div>",

Alyssa walked in and laid down on her bed and let out a sigh. She spoke up, \"If I didn't have to teach you how to cheer I would totally take a nap.\" Mark looked over the room and glanced through the drawers and closets. Tight tops blouses skirts and pants were hung up in the closet. Mark could only think about how many of them he would probably have to wear during his duration as Alyssa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then went over to Alyssa and jabbed her with one of his delicate hands, \"Come on Alyssa. Neither one of us wants me to do bad tonight. Show me what I have to do.\" Alyssa grumbled, stood up, and walked over to her computer. She opened up iTunes and said, \"Just follow what I do. We only have one dance tonight and it will be at halftime. Otherwise you'll just have to yell and jump around with the other girls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud techno beat song started to play and Alyssa began performing the routine. She started shaking what was once Mark's butt and gyrating his hips. As Mark watched he felt a sudden urge fall over him. He couldn't explain it. It seemed as if a force was taking him over. Suddenly Mark started dancing perfectly along with Alyssa. He was shaking her ass and jiggling her breasts. Alyssa dumbstruck by Mark dancing stopped in her tracks and watched him move perfectly tothe music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the song ended Mark was now sweaty and he felt the sweat cool his new form. As he stood there breathing hard Alyssa started clapping, \"I guess I don't have to teach you anything. That was perfect. How did you do it?\" Mark caught his breath,\"I have no idea. My body was just moving on it's own. It's like muscle memory or something.\" Mark looked down at his sweat covered female body annd asked, \"Do you have a towel or something? Don't want to sweat through your uniform.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa nodded in agreement and said, \"you should probably take off the top and skirt so it doesn't get drenched before the game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark...</span></div></div>",

Alyssa stood up and walked over to him. \"Here, I'll fold it.\" He handed it to her and then went about sliding the skirt off. Alyssa folded both up and laid them on the back of a chair. Mark stood there for a moment, cool air making the sweat now glistening on Alyssa's tone, tan body suddenly feel a chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, the young man couldn't help but admire Alyssa's body. Even from his new perspective above it, and the oddity of feeling every inch of it as if it were his very own, he had to admit that it was of the stuff that dreams were made of; wet dreams that is. Only a day ago he would have given almost anything to have seen it in it's current state of partial undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I trot out the old \"take a picture it will last longer\" cliche?\" Alyssa asked with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark blushed and looked over at the older girl. \"Sorry. You've always had that effect on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa smiled and winked at him. \"Awwwww...that's cute. Now, let's see if that little cheering trick you did earlier was a fluke or not!\" Alyssa turned the Techno music on again and started to clap in time with it. Looking a little silly as she did so, what with her newly acquired short teenage male body, Alyssa started to dance one of her squads routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's eyes went wide with surprise as a strange sensation washed over his scantily dressed borrowed body. With no input from him what so ever, Alyssa's gorgeous body began to perform the dance routine as well. The bra and pantie clad form, still wearing her sneakers and socks, began to kick, jump, and gyrate with as much grace and skill as it ever had while still sitting beneath Alyssa's pretty head. \"This is so weird! It's like it's on auto-pilot or something!\" He shouted as he looked down at his new toned, tall body performing like a pro. He could feel his long, muscled legs pumping away with each step and kick. He could feel his hips and ass thrust with determined motions. He could feel Alyssa's former breast bounce and strain against the restraining caress of her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Alyssa stopped her own dancing and just watched the show. At first she marveled and smiled. \"That a girl Mark! Thank God my bod seems to remember what to do! You're going to fit right in at the game!\" She clapped and giggled a little, despite the oddity of watching her own body perform with Mark's surprised young head along for the ride. Then, she her smile left her face. She became aware of her new manhood, Mark's former member, snapping to attention once more. The sight of her hot, fit, high school senior body wearing nothing but it's underwear was too much for her new male libido to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncomfortable with her growing lust, Alyssa stopped the music. \"Th-that's enough. Don't want to tire you out before the game.\" She averted her gaze from the sweaty, delicious looking example of teenage beauty before her and looked toward the door. \"Uh...I'm going to go get us something to drink. I'll be right back.\" She left the room, leaving Mark standing there. After a little bit, </span></div></div>",

This being the first time he had been able to gaze at his new body. He first started at his neck which seemingly transitioned from his pale head down into Alyssa's tan neck. He then looked down at his breasts encased in one of Alyssa's blue bras. He raised his hands up to them and felt them. They felt as he dreamed they would, the only problem was that he could feel himself squeezing them and was aroused by the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then moved his hands down to his abdomen with his displayed navel featuring Alyssa's belly button piercing. It was weird feeling his new flat stomach compared to the kind of chubby one he had previously had. Next, Mark ventured to a region he had yet felt during his new predicament, his vagina. Mark cautiously slid his index finger down his dark blue panties and he felt what were the lips of his new vagina. He felt the lips then retracted his hand. He didn't want anyone walking in on him fingering himself. Mark then turned his new ass to the mirror and  began to rub it. Seeing his head on this womanly body while shaking his ass was so strange to Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then heard a buzzing coming from his purse on the bed. Mark walked over watching his breasts jiggle inside of his bra. Mark pulled out the iPhone and slid his pink painted nail across the screen. The text was from Alyssa's mom, \"Are you home getting ready for the game?\" Mark began to punch in with his fingers,\"Yeah. I'm just practicing some moves before I head to the game.\" Mark then noticed that he now had 8 Facebook messages. Quickly glancing through the messages he saw a bunch from the Urlacher kid asking what he was doing with Mark (who unbeknownst to him was actually Alyssa's head on Mark's body). Mark suddenly felt the urge to urinate down in his crotch. It was unmistakable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked out in the hallway and saw that the light was on in the bathroom.

A pretty girl named Alyssa who is currently sitting down on her toilet with what used to be his jeans along with his boxer briefs down around her ankles, but that is not what made him stop right there in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really made him stop was the sight of Alyssa's pretty face showing pure ecstasy, moaning loudly as she moves her boyish hand up and down her smelly sweaty erect teenage five inch dick. Vigorously stroking his former dick causing his former balls to jiggle around as does while Mark just stand still there watching. Not knowing what to do in this situation at all, but it seems like his new body is reacting differently with a strange wet feeling between his feminine legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these strange feelings surging through his young teenage body is really getting into his head as he continues to watch Alyssa who doesn't even know he is standing there. Continuing to jerk off a dick that she only lived with for like two days, feeling all the strange feelings it is giving her making her finally know why boys always do this sort of thing. After a few minutes of this happening Mark finally slipped up, literally as he lost his balance from his weak knees as he fell over into the open door causing Alyssa to just about scream as she jumps and look she in the direction of where the noise came from to see a confused Mark leaning against the door resulting in a very awkward moment as the two look at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stands back up trying to regain his composure while Alyssa tries her best to cover herself up, but only can do so much as she pulls her shirt down covering her crotch. Resulting in wet spots forming on her shirt while Mark just stares at her until she breaks this awkward moment of silence by, \"I..I..it's not...wha..what it looks like. I pr..promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark on the other hand knows exactly what she was doing and responds....</span></div></div>",

Tentatively, he turned around and backed up toward the toilet. \"No choice but to sit I suppose...\" he muttered as he grasped the edges of Alyssa's blue \"spankies\" and began to pull them down. Looking down past his remarkable \"borrowed\" cleavage, Mark couldn't help but stare in wonder as Alyssa's clean shaven little slit became visible. He'd seen pictures and a few movies of course, but this was the first pussy he'd had the pleasure to lay his eyes on. It looked very inviting, despite his discomfort with his perspective. He'd never imagined the first pussy he'd ever see would be his own; even if it was temporary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering Alyssa's round little rump down on the toilet seat, Mark did his best to release his building pressure. After a short pause, he was rewarded with a sense of relief and the sound of water splashing into the bowl. \"Not that different...STRANGE...but similar...\" he whispered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up, Mark stood up and pulled Alyssa's \"spankies\" back up. The feel of the blue material of her panties hugging his new hips, ass, and womanhood was alien, but more than a little pleasurable. Walking over to the sink, Mark went to wash Alyssa's hands. He found that he actually liked the feel of Alyssa's soft, delicate fingers. As he scrubbed with the soap and ran water of the pink-nailed fingers, he looked her slender digits over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up in the mirror, Mark couldn't help but stop and gaze in bewildered awe at the sight of himself reflected in it. His same young, slightly pale, male face, his long, shaggy hair, his eyes, the same head he had seen every day of his life was there just as it had always had been. But now, the tall, stacked, tan, and gorgeous body of Alyssa Andrews sat squarely below his chin. He looked over her slender shoulders. He stared at her cleavage and bountiful breast barely restrained by her blue bra. His mouth practically watered at the sight of her taught, sexy belly and the button-piercing she affected. He looked at the blue \"spankies\", wiggling her broad hips and looking over the gusset. He couldn't help but start to feel around and caress the beautiful form he now found himself stuck with. He ran Alyssa's own hands over her tits, belly, and ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis predicament was slightly enjoyable for a moment; until the horror of it snapped him out of it. \"Jesus...I'm a guy...I don't want to be a chick!\" He closed his eyes and shook his head angrily. Looking back at the mirror, he inspected the point at which his head seemed fused to Alyssa's lovely neck. He still felt a strange soreness, but could find no visible demarcation; just a smooth blending of their different skin tones. \"Is this...magic or something...?\" he asked himself in a hushed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark...</span></div></div>",

While the fabric of the towel rubbed against his breasts, Mark could feel his nipples begin to harden and pleasure began to sweep over his body. Suddenly Mark heard a knock behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark quickly spun around and saw Alyssa standing in the doorway with two glasses of water. She pipped up, \"I thought you would be thirsty so I got you a glass of water.\" Mark grabbed the glass and said, \"Thanks Alyssa.

They're yours.\" Mark chuckled, \"I'm still not getting used to that.\" Mark walked over to the computer and sat down on the chair.

Snapshots from her life, with her body and his head there as if they always had been were laid out before him on the computer monitor. \"This is so weird...I'm smiling in most of them...it's my face, but, it's like I'm a totally different person...\" Mark muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa came over and looked over her old shoulder. \"You are a different person...you're me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one photo, Mark could see a trio of cheerleaders, all clad in their sexy uniforms. Two of Alyssa's senior friends flanked Alyssa's tan, taught, teen-dream of a body; a body sporting his smiling face. Mark winked at the camera as he cavorted in the image like a happy, carefree young lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another, Alyssa's sexy body was dressed in a very small white bikini, her mouthwatering breasts pushed out as she posed fro the camera. Again, Mark's smiling, sunglasses wearing face looked right into the camera. \"That's from summer vacation.\" Alyssa whispered as she remembered the trip she had experienced herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed half-halfheartedly. \"It looks like I had a good time.\" He felt the odd, foreign twinge of Alyssa's body getting aroused as he looked at the image of that same body wearing it's tiny bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark clicked on another photo showing Alyssa's tall, sexy body wearing a pair of tiny Daisy-Duke cut-offs, cowboy boots, and an incredibly small, tight t-shirt. Oh how he would have loved to have seen that amazingly sexy body, with it's perky tits and long, delicious legs dressed like that in the flesh. He shook his head and tried to excise the thought from him. He would have loved to have seen Alyssa dressed like that, without his happy face mocking him from atop her shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark clicked open yet another linked photo to discover a truly horrifying picture. In it, Alyssa's lovely body was dressed in her cheer-leading uniform. She was seated on that jerk of an ex-boyfriend of her's lap, her arms around his neck. Mark's head was leaning in, kissing the older boy passionately. \"I think I'm going to be sick...\" Mark whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa leaned over and clicked away from the photo. \"Don't worry Mark...that's ancient history.

Despite everything, Mark still couldn't quite believe he was looking at his own teenage male body from afar; with the hottest senior cheerleader in school's head where his own should be. Almost as shocking as what had befallen them, Alyssa had actually been incredibly nice to him all day. \"Not a thing silly. I just want to see what my bod looks like from someone else's perspective. It'll be neat to see me without needing a mirror.\" Alyssa practically squealed with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed but didn't put up too much of a fight. Truth be told, he was actually enjoying the attention from Alyssa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa pushed a few of her garments around in the closet and looked back at Mark. \"Let's see...what should we put me in first...\" she said. Finding something in the closet she laughed. \"Oh! I've got it!\" Alyssa fished a couple of articles of clothing out and rushed over to Mark. \"I bought this outfit a week ago and still haven't decided if I like it or not. Here...let me help you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark considered protesting but acquiesced. Alyssa pulled a silky purple tank top over Mark's head and slid it down her former body. The feel of the girly fabric actually felt rather nice on Mark's soft new skin. Alyssa adjusted the top and used it to mask her former bra. \"Hmmm...\" she appraised how the top looked, \"...I guess it's okay...I kind of wish it was cut a little lower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked down at Alyssa's former boobs, now his and smirked. \"I don't. I'm not a show off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa smiled and lightly smacked Mark on one of her former shoulders. \"Smart ass. Now let's put on the skirt.\" Alyssa helped mark pull on and adjust a short black pleated skirt that fell high on her former thigh. \"Oooo...I like that!\" Alyssa cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark touched the skirt and looked down at himself. Even from this angle, he had to admit Alyssa's body was amazing. \"If you wore this stuff to school you'd definitely catch me staring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa blushed and flashed Mark a beguiling smile. \"You know Mark, you can be surprisingly charming.\" She stood with a slightly flirty stance that looked a bit ridiculous with Mark's former skinny male body doing it; but Mark felt like a million dollars getting that smile directed at him. Alyssa's eyes went wide. \"Oh! I almost forgot shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grimaced a bit as Alyssa came back over to him with a pair of black high heel pumps. \"Do I have to wear those things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa smiled. \"Shoes make the outfit silly. You have so much to learn about being a girl. If you thought my legs looked great before wait until we get these on my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa sat the heels down in front of Mark and held his new arm to steady him as she gingerly placed each of Alyssa's cute little former feet into the tall black shoes. Mark teetered as he tried to stay upright. \"You walk around in these things?!?\" he asked in exasperation as he took a couple of unsteady steps forward. Alyssa let go and took a step back to get a look at her original body in it's new ensemble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa liked the look she'd put together. At first, she just stood there and congratulated herself on putting together such a cute outfit. But, as she watched her sexy, tall, tan former body in all of it's glory stumble around on it's amazing legs; Mark's slightly disheveled and uncomfortable looking teenage male head on it's shoulders, she began to feel the sensation of Mark's former young manhood stiffening in response. Without thinking, she let her eyes drift over the eye candy that her body was and admired the sight. \"Jesus but I'm hot...\" she whispered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took a couple of edges of Alyssa's new little black skirt in her former delicate hands and stood in front of a full length mirror in the girl's room. He didn't look happy, but he had to admit that Alyssa really did know how to dress herself to best effect. \"I wouldn't want to wear it for too long, but you do look beautiful in it. I just wish your face was looking at it from where I am now...and that I were in my own shoes over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa...</span></div></div>",

Looking at Mark dressed in her former purple tank top and short pleated skirt she could barley conceal the raging boner that had formed in her pants. The heels on Mark's new dainty feet emphasized the curves of his new tight ass and the muscles of his new perfect legs. Watching Mark struggle to walk on the heels was comical, yet Alyssa knew that she needed to control herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark meanwhile struggled to walk around in the purple heels. They were slightly uncomfortable, but their effect on his new female legs was wonderful. Looking at his ass Mark was amazed by how much better it looked. It was larger and more prominent and Mark could tell that it was much sexier. Turning around on his purple heels Mark noticed Alyssa staring at his ass. Shaking his male head back and forth said, \"Why are you looking at me so much?\" Alyssa blushed and stammered, \"I... just want to see how I look in that outfit...that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark felt the hem of the skirt and sighed, \"Well lets see what else you have in there...\" Alyssa smiled and reached into the closet and pulled out a blue and silver dress. Mark looked at it and replied, \"How am I supposed to squeeze into that?\" Alyssa showed Mark the back and pulled down a zipper. She then helped Mark pull off his tank top and pull down his skirt. Mark struggled to pull on the dress, but when it was on his jaw dropped. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.newsgab.com/attachments/celebrity-pictures/271477d1274452289-alyson-michalka-blue-gray-dress-cw-network-upfront-presentation-nyc-5-20-10-alysonmichalka_thecwnetworkupfrontpresentation_11_122_1164lo.jpg.\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newsgab.com/attachments/celeb...</a> The dress was one of the sexiest things he had ever seen.

Inside she struggled to unzip Mark's tented jeans. \"God this thing is sensitive...\" she muttered in half-disgust and fascination. The sight of Mark's little impromptu fashion show using her former body was having an amazing effect on her borrowed teenage male anatomy. Pulling the jeans and boxers down, Alyssa looked over Mark's former member, now swollen and throbbing. \"Not bad Marky...\" she couldn't help but giggle. Her face contorted a bit as she gingerly touched the penis she now found herself stuck with. \"How does he deal with this thing?!?!? Does it do this every-time he sees me?!?!\" She couldn't help but wonder aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, out in the bedroom Mark continued to look over Alyssa's former body; a body he now found his teenage male head transposed upon. He twisted and posed a bit in front of the mirror, noting with more than a little bit of satisfaction the way Alyssa's tits strained against the sexy dress's fabric. \"How does she move around with these things hanging from her all day?\" Mark wondered aloud as he cupped Alyssa's magnificent tits with her own hands. Mark couldn't help but smile; he may not have been happy having his head put on the lovely Miss Andrews' body; but he had to admit it felt nice. He bent forward to get a better angle in the reflection with his new cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of his impromptu breast exam, Mark walked over to the corner of Alyssa's bed and put one of her heeled feet up on top of it. Mark nearly whistled with admiration as he ran Alyssa's soft, delicate hands up and down the mouth-watering shaft of sex that was the young woman's leg. \"God, what I wouldn't give to be able to feel these things with my own hands...\" Mark whispered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while...</span></div></div>",

She ran her male hands around the neck area and sighed realizing that for another month she would be stuck in this condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa walked out of the bathroom and was greeted by Mark examining what had once been her breasts. Alyssa made coughing noise to let Mark know that she was back in the room. Mark blushed, \"I'm sorry. It's just...I can't help it. They're right here.\" Alyssa smiled, \"Don't worry about it. I get it all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark caught off guard by Alyssa's entrance looked at Alyssa's clock which now read 6 p.m. Mark then questioned, \"When am I supposed to go to the game?\" Alyssa shocked by how quickly time had passed grew upset, \"Shit! You're supposed to be there at 6:30!\" Mark hurriedly slipped out of Alyssa's high heels and tight dress while Alyssa frantically pulled out his uniform. Mark stripped down to his spankies and bra and slid the cheerleading skirt over his tan legs and struggled to slip the top over his impressive breasts. \"Is getting your clothing on usually this much of a challenge?\" asked Mark. Alyssa answered, \"When your a cheerleader everything is hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then slid his dainty feet into Alyssa's white cheerleading sneakers and he looked to Alyssa, \"Who's driving?\" Alyssa replied, \"I'll drive you there and watch.\" Mark nodded in agreement and the two went downstairs.

He must have tripped somewhere along the lines, and was unconscious right now. That was the only thing that remotely made sense. Yet as Mark moved around he couldn't help but notice the very real sensations that this new body of his brought on. The sway of his hips and breasts, the wind blowing on his exposed skin. If this was indeed some dream then it was the most lucid dream he had ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim he stopped his search for the book for a second, lifting one of his new dainty hands and pinching himself on the cheek. \"Ow! Dammit,\" he winced, unintentionally scratching himself. So this was reality, that had hurt. Somehow then he had actually switched heads with Alyssa, the head cheerleader and one of the most popular girls in school. He might think that having such a thing happen would be arousing, kinky even. Yet experiencing it now Mark was just terrified, and desperate to find a way to resolve this. Just how exactly had they ended up like this anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Mark could recall before passing out was writing in that book. He doubted a book somehow caused this, but it was a good place to start. And so he went back to his searching, hoping to find it around here somewhere. Alyssa was still out unfortunately, meaning he had to look around by himself. No way could it have gotten far, they were in the same spot that they had been before this all happened. Yet everywhere he checked there was no sign of it, not a single trace of so much as a page. Had someone come by and stolen it? That didn't make sense though, surely they would have noticed his predicament. So where was it then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Someone else found the book then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by the sudden voice Mark spun around on his heels, alarmed that someone was out here with them. Standing a few meters away was another man, a bit older than him, late twenties perhaps. He was what you might call handsome, Mark supposed, with a defined jawline, roman nose, deep brown eyes and a well trimmed chinstrap beard on his face. He wore a black longcoat and trousers, and a black homburg cap. He seemed much too primped and preen to just be wandering around in the woods, something was fishy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who the hell are you...?\" Mark managed, frowning as he pointing one of Alyssa's fingers at the man. \"And how do you know about the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man flashed a brilliant white grin, reaching up and adjusting his cap casually. \"Me? I'm nobody important. Though I guess you can call me the Stranger for now. I like it, has a bit of mystery, don't you think kid? As for the book...\" he replied, speaking in a Boston accent. With a snap of his fingers the aforementioned book appeared in his other hand, though this time it was bound closed by a strap. \"The book is mine, that's how I know about it. It's a fun little toy I like to use. Poor, unsuspecting souls like yourself and blondie over there stumble across it, write their names inside, and then presto! The biggest surprise of your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that book was a toy then? Some twisted toy, making people swap heads. And from the way this guy was talking it sounded like he considered it all a game, that was pretty warped too. \"So you do this to people for fun? Is that it?\" Mark asked, placing his hands on his hips in a testy manner. It seemed like his body still had some habits leftover from its proper owner, he certainly wouldn't do that himself. Realizing his stance he instead folded his arms over his chest, having to adjust once or twice because of his new 'assets'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do kid. It's interesting to see how folks like you handle being changed. Life can be pretty boring if you just go on living like every other Joe out there, from day to day. I like to spice things up, you know? Come on, you can't tell me your life didn't just become <i>much</i> more interesting thanks to me? You ought to be thanking me kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking someone for this? This guy really was something else. Mark looked back down at himself for a moment, still feeling a bit otherworldly with his head on Alyssa's body. Well there was no denying it, this really was happening. And this loon was responsible for it. Right... Well then, he'd probably better get things sorted out. \"Alright, listen up...\" he began, looking back at the Stranger. </span></div></div>",

The young man jumped at the noise, goose-pimples forming on his new exposed legs, arms, and shoulders. Whether those goose-pimples were from the chill to the forest air or his own creeped-out state, he didn't take the time to ascertain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you even do this to us?!?!? What is the point?!?!?\" Mark was equally frightened and pissed off at this point.

Like I said kid, it's for fun. You're around as long as I have been and things start to get real old, real fast. I've got to entertain myself somehow, and what better way then to mess with people?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending the arm with the book, the Stranger glanced down and without doing so the strap came undone, the book flipping open on its own. The pages rustled briefly before they began to turn, coming to the page where Mark and Alyssa had written down their names. \"Hundreds of saps like you have written in here. Some were fixed, others were stuck. It's an experiment I guess, if I need to give you a reason. Can people really understand one another? Or are we all stuck in our own little bubbles, and too selfish to walk in another person's shoes?\" The Stranger paused, giving a small chuckle as he snapped the book shut. \"I guess you're doing that last bit pretty well right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark wasn't sure what made him angrier, the fact this guy was toying with him or that he'd done this to other people. It took a seriously messed up individual to do something like this, it could easily ruin lives. And all for amusement, that just wasn't right. Much as he loathed the situation he was in Mark was coming to terms with just how powerless he was. He could snap and get angry all he wanted, but in the end this man and his book held the power to fix things. Seeing that he sighed, lifting one of his new dainty hands and pinching the bridge of his nose, shutting his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... Just tell me what we need to do to fix this, and I'll do it. I don't want to be stuck like this forever, it feels.\" Mark paused, glancing down at himself, \"Weird. It's not me.\" He'd imagined getting close to Alyssa before, sure, but this was far from what he'd expected. He couldn't enjoy this, not when Alyssa's self was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like I said, kid. If you can understand the little bombshell you're attached to there then you'll be changed back. I'm telling you though, it's harder than it sounds. Most folks I do this to never end up changing back.\" Seeing the color drain from Mark's face brought a smirk to the Stranger's, he was having fun. \"It's wicked tough, but I'm sure you can figure it out, you seem like a bright one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind Mark again came a groan, and Alyssa was beginning to really stir. She'd come to any second now, and he'd prefer not to be here when the girl did. \"I'll be watching both of you, don't worry. If you do what I want then I'll fix both of you, no tricks. But that's only if you can get it, got it?\" Vagueness aside he'd left Mark with instructions, provided the kid had actually followed closely enough. Flashing another brilliant white grin the Stranger tipped his hat, tucking the book under one arm possessively. \"Until we meet again, kid. You have fun now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark wasn't sure what to say any longer, about any of this. He watched wordlessly as the Stranger turned around and walked off, disappearing into the trees some ways away. He was left alone again, his head mistakenly on Alyssa's body, and her head on his own. Remembering that she had been waking Mark turned around, watching as Alyssa sat up, her eyes closed as she rubbed at her head. Smiling nervously he walked over, kneeling down and giving her a slight wave. \"Hey... Uh... Glad you're awake.\"</span></div></div>",
