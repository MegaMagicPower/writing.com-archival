He'd been hidden in his little student flat, as the celebration had become a little shady, with one of the foreign students sneaking some alcohol into the results reveal. They all knew they'd passed, it was simply a matter of the marks that any of them achieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtains remained closed, blowing in the light breeze. They kept the heat of the day from intruding into the room, and he wasn't sure his eyes could take the full glare of the Sun quite yet. He was also worried about the linger smell of alcohol. Probably overly much. He thought, it was such a break in his behaviour. But that same unfamiliarity ensured, even the small amount of wine he'd tried had knocked him for six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in bed, his eyes were able to focus, and the room was no longer so unsteady. 'So, this is a hangover.', he told himself. Promising not to experiment ever again, and wondering how anyone would choose to experience this discomfort, this nausea, this ... lack of facilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting his head sink back onto the pillow, he closed his eyes, and performed a mental survey of his body. The rasp in his throat would be settled with a drink from the pitcher of water on the bedside table. He slaked that thirst first. The squirming in his stomach felt as if he'd swallowed something, and it was still alive inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheets slipped lower, falling from Farouk's shoulders, to his lap. The brushing contact made his nips respond, and in a moment, they felt too warm, and too cold. Covering them, cupping them with his hands, he cursed his failure to resist temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way, he'd consume alcohol ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deeper smile spread over his face, as he saw the envelope with his final results in it. The certificate to keep and frame would follow in a few days. However, nothing would spoil that achievement.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m afraid you are in the beginning stages of The Transition.\u201d The doctor told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Michael Peterson. Currently single 25 year old working as administrative assistant at a large corporate office downtown in the city. You live with a roommate, your good friend Jesse who had known since high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last couple days you had been experiencing stomach cramps and abdominal pain. You decided to go to the doctor and check it out only to get the worst news of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several scans and tests the doctors showed you X-rays confirming your worst fears. Your internal organs were beginning to shift around. Making room for a new womb and set of ovaries that were slowly developing inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you personally had nothing against anybody who had gone through a Transition your family was a bit more old school. Your dad was a bit of a hard ass who would always tell you \u201cman up\u201d and \u201cboys don\u2019t cry.\u201d Your mom said boys should be boys and girls should be girls. They never viewed transgender people highly and when the transition started they said it only would affect unsure about their sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought by now you had passed any point where the Transition could possibly affect you. However the doctors said it can still hit people in their early or mid 20\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news came like a ton of bricks. You were sent home with pamphlets and paperwork. Told to visit websites and support groups if needed. They said you would start noticing the real changes soon but there was no knowing how severe they would hit yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis...this has to be a mistake...\u201d You said still in denial as you looked at your reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the only person you really knew that was going through the Transition. One or two people you went to school with had to go through it but you never knew them very well. There were also a couple people at your office that had gone through it when they were younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were struggling to come to terms with this as you went home. What would you tell your family and friends? Would they even accept you anymore? </span></div></div>",

Doctors weren't known for their jokes, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pamphlets you ignored, and the websites and support groups all felt premature. As if this were all some kind of joke, or a mistake. You didn't know anyone who'd transitioned! There were few jokes around the office. Told with a nudge and a wink, the cute secretary well... she wasn't always a secretary. You'd nodded along, smiled, and not asked any questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd situation, you didn't want to call BS on the story, or admit you believed it. It certainly could be a prank, in either case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling, you pick up the letter and read it once more. The blood results don't mean anything to you, and neither does much of the letter describing the progress. You hope, that in all that confusing detail, you've misunderstood what it all means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas the opening paragraph is plainly written, and confirms that you have been afflicted by the transition. The medical details were frustratingly vague. The spread of the Transition was unknown, whether it was airborne, or spread by food or water, or just shit out of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, choking back a wail, you read it once more. Knowing that by the end you'll be the but of the office jokes, the laughing stock of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown allowed the cruel and uneducated to suggest their own reasons. Moral weakness, or divine intervention, or just plain corruption. There wasn't always sympathy, for those afflicted. Some being disowned by their families to avoid the shame... or the risk of being infected!? There are transition houses, for those abandoned by their family. For those making a new start from a blank slate. Others wanted... needed to carry over their achievements from ... from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready you were having trouble with your appetite, knowing you'd lose weight, muscle mass as you changed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read up on the timescale for the changes, again scowling at the paperwork. It's late for you, the prime age for the transition to start is late teens, to mid-twenties. It's not so common you worried about it, but you had thought this was past as a risk.</span></div></div>",

You had no idea what your family would say, especially your father who old school ideals on gender roles wasn\u2019t ready for the idea that his only son might soon be his new daughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night in bed you were lost in thoughts. Was this real? If it was what would you even look like? These plus a million more questions filled your mind as you picked up your phone and looked up a few articles on the transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read how the process usually takes around a week. Each morning usually brings new changes to the victim however it is common to also experience spontaneous changes at random times especially regarding the sexual aspects such as breasts, butt, and genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t deal with this any longer as you closed your phone and went to bed. Hoping a nights rest would better calm your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning finally came you arose and got up heading to the bathroom to perform your morning rituals. You noticed however your shirt and underwear felt a little off. They felt a bit baggy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping on the scale your eyes suddenly went wide. You easily 10lbs lighter! That was impossible! How could you lose so much weight over night? Rushing to the mirror you noticed things had only gotten worse. You had also lost an inch of height. You were 6\u20192 before but now seemed closer to just 6 feet tall. Your hair also seemed shaggy, too long like you hadn\u2019t gotten a hair cut in a month. Your normally short dark brown hair looked messy now, you normally never let it get this long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...it\u2019s real...it\u2019s really happening.\u201d You said as this was the first physical evidence you saw that confirmed things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called out sick for work and spent the next several hours in hours room simply trying to take stock of all this. All you wanted was to wake up from this nightmare but you knew it was getting worse....Maybe...help wasn\u2019t such a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing on some gym shorts and t shirts your pants were now too baggy to fit proper. You tossed on some sandals and a hoodie and drove off to the local community center where you saw the Transition support group was meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParking at the center you saw several people talking and smoking outside. They seemed like normal people, nothing out of the ordinary at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you got out of your car and made your way to the entrance but the fear you felt kept you from going inside...what would they say? How would they judge you? These thoughts plagued your mind until you heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you look new is this your first time?\u201d A soft feminine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around you were shocked to see a gorgeous redhead standing beside you. She had pale white skin and freckles but not too many, just enough to be cute. Her long flow red hair came past her shoulders as she brushed it aside. She had large breasts concealed by a rather low cut blouse and she was wearing a black mini skirt and thigh high heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...yeah...this is the transition group right?\u201d You asked trying not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m...Dave....Sorry Daniel. My transition ended months ago and I still feel weird calling myself that. Come on in. Dr. West inside He is amazing. He used to be a woman years ago when the transition was first starting in people but he was one of the first major therapists who started these support groups.\u201d She said guiding you inside.</span></div></div>",

This whole experience was very uncomfortable for you and the last thing you wanted was the bring attention to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dr. West went around the room he noticed you. Sitting silent and uncomfortable as he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, you are new right? From what I can tell you must only be a couple days into the transition at this point huh? I\u2019m sure this whole things seems like your mind is melting and your not even sure what to think huh?\u201d He said in a soft and kind voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard not to open up to his charm. Dr West looked like a kinder older gentleman. A well groomed grey beard and his dark glasses made it easy to assume he was a kind man. You knew he was probing you to answer as Daniel was nudging you and smiling as you finally caved and gave in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes....alright! I hate this! I hate this whole thing! Why me? Why don\u2019t I have a choice? Why now?\u201d You said in an explosion of emotions of both anger and sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your shock and surprise nobody said a word. Everyone just stood up and clapped after your speech as Daniel reached over and gave a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations you just completed step one.\u201d Dr. West said point to his three step process written on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep one- Let it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep two- Accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep three- Move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. West went into a speech about his three step process and how to the naked eye it seemed over simple and generic but that was on purpose. He went into a speech talking about how traditional step by step processes for something as complex as the Transition were useless. Every person has a unique experience and that it requires a unique tailored experience. His three step guide is meant to be a simple overview to remind us of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there for an hour listening to people tell their stories. From people sharing how their families were torn apart, other how they lost their jobs, lovers, and friends. It was honestly quite depressing at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you also heard stories of hope. Of how people found new purpose and new life. There was a woman there sharing how she just had her first baby with her new husband after transitioning. Her husband used to be her best friend as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you feel better and happier. The whole experience seemed to put you in a better mood. After the end of the session you found yourself out in the parking lot feeling as if a weight had been lifted off you. Maybe you could do this? Maybe your family might accept you? Everyone there had gone through what you did and seemed to be turning out okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got in your car your cell phone suddenly started to ring. You noticed the number was coming from your doctor\u2019s office. Where you were just diagnosed with the transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Mr. Peterson, this is Dr. Olsen, is this a good time?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure what\u2019s up?\u201d You asked a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell per your request we did another blood test on you to determine your transition levels.\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know...the changes have started I know it\u2019s real...\u201d You said interrupting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...oh...no sir that\u2019s not the reason for my call. The transition is confirmed yes...but we found..some abnormalities in your blood.\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worried you a bit as you took a deep breath. \u201cWhat kind of abnormalities?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...to put it plainly the estrogen levels in your blood are spiking at a highly abnormal rate. I\u2019m afraid you actually have a more advanced version of the transition then we planned. It seems to be a case of Hyper Transition.\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor went on to explain over the next few minutes how in rare cases like yours the body actually rapidly over develops into the opposite sex. You weren\u2019t just going to become a female...you were going to become a total sex bomb of a female with much larger breasts, wider hips, greater curves, larger butt, etc. To top it off your libido and sex drive would also be affected resulting in stronger sexual urges and desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all these changes wouldn\u2019t take affect until you have already transitioned into your normal female form and would hit you randomly with powerful waves of pleasure and ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you were finally beginning to have some kind of acceptance this bombshell gets dropped on you...</span></div></div>",

You wonder which is better, still keeping your mind, in these horrific bimbo bodies, or losing your mind to lust and becoming the bimbo you appear to be. You have to think about boosted sensitivity, coming with these changes. If coherent thought is even possible if the simple act of breathing is an erotic risk. The teasing brush of fabric over these magnificent breasts, or the hot flush of a breath of warm air from your own lungs to be too arousing to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther results pop into view, and you see the <i>other end</i> of Hyper Transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/11f75399cbbfcbf28c9940e142e5a45d/tumblr_pxnnskHQTe1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/11f75399cbbf...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e60725090c93b0f9edb47142c73f6eb6/tumblr_pxnnrmCWrs1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/e60725090c93...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/567be4e6f841dbd59303623afff60ab5/tumblr_pm24iqFpJ01w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/567be4e6f841...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/06/dc/4b06dcebd8d029336c4a75e9f7912b11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/06/dc/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/ad/a3/ceada33f4b1e4ae318a52f5171cc949a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/ad/a3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/7b/ec/5f7bec706143b3735b1eeed9833e9076.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/7b/ec/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you'll need speciality clothing if you end up with anything approaching these types of body. Your hands run over your hips, as you consider if one day you'll wake to hips that wide, or an ass that full. From the pictures you're curious if exhibitionism, or submissiveness come with a boosted set of hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunting for some hope, you switch to more research. Apparently, the extremes can be affected by the subject's biases, or society's ideals. You don't want to think of yourself as preferring bimbos or full-booties queens. But if you're going to be shaped by these factors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click a link, and further images fill the screen. Illustrating less-extreme Hyper Transition... for you, if not ideal for their afflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/fc/93/4dfc937b36e6ad14fb2e50926fcaf605.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/fc/93/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/25/e5/5025e53fc7daf4899c9116a7b82eb47c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/25/e5/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/8c/b2/0d8cb20adbf57aaa76193233fedee42d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/8c/b2/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, the new women don't look erotic to you, but they all inspire one thought. You feel a twitching, as you respond to those over-inflated lips. The thought of a blow-job working sub-consciously, your body betraying your mind. It's your first erotic reaction you've felt since you got the news. Trying not to read too much into it, and hoping this doesn't define your future. Your mind still wanders, as you consider how you'd handle life, if you were cursed with such rude lips yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacktracking a link, you want that temptation removed from sight as soon as possible. Alas, you must've hit a wrong icon as the screen fills with more Hyper Transitioned. This time, they're ..<i>.'blessings'..</i>. are more evenly distributed. If no less extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing down the browser, you realise your future might be a lot more limited after you complete the Transition. Your hope of returning to work, feeling like it's fading into the distance. You hoped to keep your old job, or at worse (as rumours/jokes suggest) becoming a secretary. Now even those hopes feel am<i>bitch</i>ous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers shake as you go to re-open the browser, to look for more modest examples of Hyper Transition, surely these aren't typical!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe this was the last time you would see yourself as the man you were still were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014One Week Later\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week has passed since your diagnosis. You told your work and filed for a Transition Leave of Absense. Fortunately it was illegal for them to fire you and it was required to give you a month of paid leave to readjust to your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou filed for Transition with the government as well. You assigned your new name as Michelle Peterson. You also had the hard conversation with your roommate Jesse. You were surprised at how much he had your back and didn\u2019t think any differently of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest part was telling your family. Your mother actually took the news pretty well as did your younger sister who had just turned 21. Your father however refused to speak...You could see the anger in his eyes but at the very least he didn\u2019t blame you for your condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took care of this early on so they could still see you as a man. However as the days progressed the changes got more and more noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin days you had shrunk down to 5\u20197 and weighed in barely over 100lbs. Your body hair had fallen out more and more leaving your skin perfectly smooth. Your finger nails were getting longer as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later your female form was developing rapidly. Your hips were wider, your butt larger, and breasts had started to form on you. Your voice was much higher as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week to the day you awoke and saw yourself in the mirror as you sighed. You looked exactly like you would have being born a female. Your vagina finished forming last night as the final female changes settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dark brown hair touched your shoulder as your modest B cup breasts jiggled with every step you took. You looked to yourself sighing. You were actually kinda cute. Nothing special that anyone would look at twice but not bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t updated your wardrobe much yet. You purchased yoga pants and sports bras to deal with the changes easier. You mostly wore those now along with flip flops and whatever you had that still fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally if you were a normal transition person this is where things would end and your new life would begin. However for you this was just the beginning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were actually more nervous now than even before. You hadn\u2019t been totally honest with everyone. You had kept the news of the hyper transition to yourself...You had no way of knowing what would happen so you did want anyone to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you planned on visiting the support group again. You hadn\u2019t been back since your first visit and it felt like it was time. You tossed on your yoga pants and sports bra which fit nice and snug as you through on one of your old t shirts which was now huge on you. You tossed on some flip flops and grabbed your...purse...Yes you now had a purse with yours wallet and keys and phone inside...one of the first new female items you got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you as you drove off to the support group several strands of your dark brown hair were getting lighter in color. Turning into a bright platinum blonde...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Transition is a phenomenon that begun around 10 years ago. Nobody knows why it started or where it came from. All humanity could do was adapt to its effect on our lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Transition is a metamorphosis that causes its host to gradually change genders over a short period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Transition affects only those young in age, usually between the range of around 18-25. Currently the Transition is estimated to be affecting around 1% of the total population. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Transition affects everyone differently. The most common case is where the host gradually turns into the opposite gender equivalent version of themselves over the period of around a week. This however is never guaranteed as the effects can vary widely from person to person. There really isn\u2019t any way of knowing what a person will end up looking like until the process is completed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Transformation Process also varies greatly from person to person. Some people feel nothing and only change during their sleep. Others feel large amounts of discomfort and see their changes right before their eyes which come in waves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the process is complete it is permanent and irreversible. All the person can do is adjust to their new body as best they can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had led to several societal changes. One of the first things that happened was large amount of support groups started popping up to help those going their Transitions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Transition also leads to varying degrees of mental changes. Each person experiencing it goes through different stages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people experiencing their transitions refuse to accept their bodies and do everything they can to look and act like they used to. These people became known as \u201cDeniers.\u201d While others fully embrace their bodies, take on new names and new identities. These people became known as \u201cEmbracers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people going through the transition usually fall somewhere in between. They accept they are changing but aren\u2019t ready to give up their old lives. The mental stress of the transition affects everyone differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-Rules\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Do not shame other authors or create road block posts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sex is fine but keep it R-rated. Nothing too graphic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Focus should be on gender transformations, other kinds of changes need to be approved by me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Posts should be at least one paragraph in length. Do not post endless choice chapters or simple one sentence responses. </td>",
