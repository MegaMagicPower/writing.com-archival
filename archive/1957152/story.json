You couldn\u2019t stay at the lifeguard station during the winter so Roxy\u2019s friend Elisa built you a new house out of an old cuckoo clock she found in her basement. You still couldn\u2019t believe it was the cold season already. You remember the last day of Summer. Fran gave everyone their last paycheck of the season and sent you, Stella, Roxy and Chihiro away. Chihiro quit her job at the beach and went to Fearfield to get a new job, April went back to her workshop in town and Mesa said something about heading to another job she had back in the countryside. As for Stella, you don\u2019t even want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what to do during the winter, until Roxy mentioned she worked at Grimmsly Lodge in the mountains, a ski resort and told you they were looking for ski instructors. She introduced you to her Bahamut friend Elisa and while you were intimidated at first when the hippo/fish/dragon monster looked down and smiled at you, you two became friends and she and Roxy convinced the manager to hire you. You\u2019ve been working there for a few years now, as long as you\u2019ve worked at Gravefield Beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t so much for cold weather though and there were dinosaurs in the mountainside, a lot of which were carnivores, but there were two things you liked best about working at the lodge. There was no Stella to condescend you and there was no way you\u2019d run into that mermaid Paisley. You were in an environment where your most hated predator couldn\u2019t possibly survive. It was perfect. But as you get up, you feel a cold breeze and start to shiver. This job wasn\u2019t like your old job at the beach at all. It\u2019s so terrifyingly cold even indoors and you have to quickly put on your jacket, gloves and earmuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what are you going to do today?</span></div></div>",

Since you already work with her everyday in the Summer, you figure that you might as well see what\u2019s going on with the big gargoyle girl. You walk out of your house and climb down the stairway installed specifically for you and make your way to the nurse\u2019s office. Roxy worked as a nurse during the winter, which made sense since she worked as a lifeguard in the summer. Sometimes she was even sent to fly out and look for anyone who might be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the nurse\u2019s office and walk right under the door to see Roxy was already here and humming to herself as she was organizing medicine. Roxy was wearing a bright white nurse\u2019s outfit with slight pink highlights. You didn\u2019t want to say it, but you think Roxy\u2019s been putting on weight lately. Of course she was always big boned, even in the Summer, but she got even bigger in the winter. But you\u2019d never say it to her face. Roxy was sensitive about her weight and once threw you right into a large tree when you pointed it out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roxy is humming to herself, you see her lizard like tail moving back and forth and run forward and grab the tip before climbing up  one of the gargoyle giantess\u2019s wings. You\u2019re about to climb to Roxy\u2019s neck but Roxy flaps the wing and you fall yelling down the wing until you fall deep between Roxy\u2019s giant yellow breasts. Your gargoyle friend feels the impact as her breasts and belly shake and she smiles. \u201cHi Stephen.\u201d She says. \u201cHe, hey Roxy.\u201d You say nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy shakes her enormous mammaries and smiles down on you. \u201cDon\u2019t get up, you can stay there. I\u2019ll let you out when I need you.\u201d You sink further down the cleavage and are stuck between two yellow mountains of gargoyle flesh. You let out a sigh, but you don\u2019t mind. Given how cold this lodge gets, you could use the extra warmth. But knowing you and Roxy, you\u2019ll both see some excitement soon.</span></div></div>",

Your gargoyle friend walks up and answers the phone. \"Hello?\" asked Roxy. \"Hey Maza,\" said a familiar voice on the phone. \"It's Elisa.\" Elisa was Roxy's best friend and a bahamut, a creature resembling a cross between a hippo and a fish, apparently with a dragon thrown in for good measures. She was a ski instructor at the lodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Elisa,\" says Roxy. \"You hippo headed rascal. What's up?\" \"I was taking a beginner on the slopes and the little hot dog tried to write a check her ass couldn't catch. I need you to prepare the infirmary right away. Elisa out.\" Roxy let out a sigh. \"Well Stephen,\" she says to you as she lifts up her ample cleavage. \"It looks like we're going to work already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear loud footsteps and realize that it was a particularly heavy monster coming, the shadow wasn't tall enough to be Camille and the shape of the head didn't look like a loxodon or a minotaur so it couldn't be Elektra or Comet. Then you notice the shadow has a pair of wings and the head of a hippopotamus. It was Elisa and she was carrying the injured monster inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, what kind of monster was it? You don't think you've seen Elisa's student before.</span></div></div>",

As you observe Roxy checking her over you notice that the patient has a nice full figure. She's not overweight but definitely has some meat. Roxy goes to get some bandages, leaving you alone for a second. You're right near the werewolf's head, and start to feel her breathing on you. She seems to be waking up. You're glad she's okay but then she begins sniffing. Her eyes are still closed but she seems to zero in on you. Before you can act her tongue rolls out and scoops you up. \"Rox-\" you start before you're dragged into her mouth. Inside you are tossed around as she tastes you and sucks on you like a piece of candy. You crash into her teeth and thank god that she's still only half awake. Otherwise she might start chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy walks back over to treat the girl's wounds. She took a spill and got a cut on her arm, but nothing serious. She notices that you're not there and looks around confused. Its then that she sees the girl is breathing steadily. She's relieved but then notices that she has something in her mouth. Putting two and two together she decides to investigate. Taking her claws she gently pries open the wolf's jaws. You spill out and crawl away as fast as you can. You're covered in saliva and begin wiping it out of your eyes. \"Thanks Roxy, how did you know?\" you say to your gargoyle partner. \"Hey, when your partner is  human, you get used to certain situations.\" she says. You laugh a little. \"Yeah I guess I'm getting used to stuff like that too.\" Roxy goes ahead and patches the girl up. After about ten minutes she stirs and sits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" she asks. \"You're in the infirmary.\" Roxy answers. \"You took a spill during snowboard lessons and passed out. You just have a scratch, so its nothing to worry about.\" The werewolf checks her arm. \"Well thanks for helping me out. My name's Sabrina.\" she says. \"No problem its my job. I'm Roxy by the way, and this is my partner Stephen.\" she says and holds you out. \"Hey, I'm Stephen.\" you tell the giant werewolf. \"We've already sort of been acquainted. You kind of tried to eat me while you were out.\" Sabrina reaches out and pats your head. \"Sorry about that little guy. Instincts must have kicked in. I don't normally eat humans, but sometimes I slip.\" she says. You're relieved that she's friendly. Its good to know she won't try to devour you. Now that she's okay, what does she want to do? </span></div></div>",

To your surprise, your back is soon met by the soft yet leathery surface of Sabrina's huge furred finger rubbing your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense taken.\" she chuckles. \"well, Howl and seek is a game where one wolf acts as leader, trying to find the other missing pack members. Only problem though is that all the other pack members are hiding and we aren't allowed to use our noses to track them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"then...how exactly are you suppose to find them?\" you ask curiously only to cause another giggle to erupt from Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"simple. We howl.\" she answers. \"once the leaders howl, all the other pack members have to howl to. That way, we could know whether they're close or far.\" the whole rules of the game were extremely, if not an exact mirrored version of the common Marco Polo game you always played in the pool. In fact, the great similarities end up growing your smile ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I get it now.\" you reply with a nod. Sabrina smiles as she slowly attempts to get into a sitting position. Just as you were going to insist on her lying down, she surprisingly manages to sit up with hardly any sign of pain or cringe on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...seems like I'm doing a lot better now.\" she states while shrugging her shoulders in a circular like motion. After giving a small stretch, her eyes soon fall upon your tiny form as she slowly kneels down above you. \"well...it was great to talk to you.\" she says giving a nod. \"but...I was wondering...\" </span></div></div>",

With little hesitation, you began to scramble our way upon her massive hand before making your way to the center of her padded palm. Once you were in a secured position, she slowly makes her way up from the bed and proceeds to make her way to the desk of the infirmary. After signing some basic information regarding her injury it wasn't too long before you and her began the trek to the lodge. Once she was out in the white landscape of the mountains, a small shiver ends up running down your spine from the sudden breezes emerging. Even if you were dressed in layers of clothes, your size and the overall chilliness of the mountain didn't seem to do much against the bitterness of the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, you weren't the only one who noticed the cold temperatures. Above, Sabrina was gazing down at you noticing your sudden shivers upon her hand. \"cold?\" she asks while tilting her head slightly to the sides in a canine manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention soon snaps to her face as you shake your head. \"i'm fine.\" you say not wanting to seem like a burden to a guest at the lodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're lying.\" Sabrina quickly says accusingly with a slight scowl on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no need to worry.\" you quickly retort. \"I'm dressed perfectly for this weather.\" you reply in a rather assuring tone before another cool breeze causes a shiver to run down your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not convinced.\" Sabrina says with the scowl still on her face. \"here, this should help.\" immediately your tiny form was brought upwards closing in to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina? what are you-\" before even having a chance to finish your question, a huge blush ends up enveloping your face as you found out where you were being lead. With a small drop, you soon found yourself nestled right above the soft furred cleavage of the huge wolfess. All about you, her warmth radiated making you forget momentarily about the cold temperatures outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that better?\" she asks as her eyes focused upon your hidden form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"e-errr...\" you stammer trying to think of the right words to say. \"well, it is warm.\" you reply causing Sabrina to let out a small giggle and bounce you about in her sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well glad I could help.\" she answers as she continues onwards towards the lodge</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with all the weirdness you've seen in your life, all the times you'd gotten sat on, stepped on and (nearly) eaten; spending most of your adult life living around giant monster women didn't quite prepare you for the sight that granted you down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga and Lydia were standing with their faces inches from each other, both wearing furious death glares that would have melted the armor off a battleship as they kept up their shouting match...and ignoring a thick clouds of smoke that were pouring in around them, from both their respective rooms. Lydia's wand actually <i>drooped</i> in her hand as she gesticulated with it wildly--that thing was made of metal; just how hot WAS this fire?!--and her cape was on fire, though she ignored this. She was too busy ranting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD you to keep your TOYS away from my potions!\" Lydia snapped, her pink ears twitching. \"Tinkerers like <i>you</i> may not understand how magic works, but even all those disgusting...<i>machines</i>--\" She spat, like she'd eaten something disgusting, \"--need a little care to cobble together! I figured you'd at least respect my workshop, you clockwork-worshiping, steampunk-addicted--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy clears her throat; with you in her cleavage and the building smoke it knocked the wind out of you. \"Erm, ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy went unanswered as Helga cut her off, pushing back against Lydia and pressing their faces even closer together. If not for the troll's glasses, the two women's eyeballs would have ground against each other. \"I kept my machines under <i>perfect control</i>, you little Luddite rodent! YOU were the one who went around slinging those...<i>insults to logic</i> you call 'spells' around without warning ME! What, you didn't think that whatever overblown party trick you were doing would affect metal?! Maybe you should have read those molded spell books of yours a little better; or better yet, stop it with this occult <b>bullshit</b> and take some damn science classes!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure growls, her lip curling. \"Hey! Listen, you two..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting hotter; the smoke was getting worse. Already you could hear alarms going off. Crap, and you'd just woken up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia looked ready to bludgeon Helga with her (partially-melted) wand. \"My spells can outdo ANYTHING your stupid contraptions can do, and that's a fact--no, wait; it's a <i>law of nature!</i> Machines are only for lazy bi--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><i><b>\"QUIET, GODDAMMIT!! BOTH OF YOU!!!\"</b></i></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure's roar stops the argument dead in its tracks. Mostly because its targets were clutching their ears in pain and wearing faces like they'd been punched in the stomach. At their first sign of recovery, you werecoyote boss bellows again, though not as thunderous as before. \"You two can have this pissing contest later--and no, I won't hear <i>one freaking word</i> about who started it!! Unless you two want to pay for the reconstruction yourselves, you'll kindly stop bickering and <b>help us put out this fire before it burns this lodge to the ground!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding their ears, both Lydia and Helga cease their shouting and look around...and immediately start coughing horrifically. Roxy tosses them some face-masks she'd nabbed from a first-aid kit, gesturing for everyone to squat down and get under the smoke. Elisa, given her girth, has to squat especially low. \"I won't ask exactly how this happened; just tell us, can we put this out and save the lodge?\" the Bahamat asks, glaring at the pair over her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it can be put out.\" Lydia's answer was immediate. \"The potions that got mixed when...the <i>incident</i> happened..\" she glared at Helga but made no further commentary; \"...were volatile stuff, but the fire itself is mundane. One of those extinguisher-contraptions would do, but I managed to snatch some anti-catalyst potion.\" She reached into her cape and produced a sizable flash of a fizzy, blue liquid. \"This will cancel out the reactions instantly, and kill the fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmirably, Helga kept herself from any commentary of her own, though she winced when her rival had pulled the potion from seemingly nowhere (thus slapping the laws of material space square in the jaw),and even with her wearing the surgical mask you could see her smirk when Lydia described said potion using words like \"catalyst\" and \"reaction\". The troll girl looked at her workshop and reported, \"The fire in MY room is small, but it's burning like crazy and there's some nasty fumes building up. Some of my machines are still undamaged by all the heat, and they could help us put these fires out...that water-cannon I made last week can douse a whole room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's your answer, then!\" Vernon coughs, from atop Azure's head. \"We can use Lydia's potion AND Helga's contraptions--maybe even together!--to put out this fire! If they're as good as you say they are, we'll have this under control in no time!\" Despite the smoke and blaring alarms, he's grinning like a loon. Elisa, Roxy, and you all give feverish nods, hoping against hope the two girls will be sensible and put aside their rivalry for once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>===What Happens Next?===</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the fires keep on burning, both Helga and Lydia look to each other. You seriously hope that both of them would bury the hatchet before Grimmsly Lodge burns to the ground. However, Helga and Lydia still glare at each other. It would seem even in a dire situation, the troll and weasel giantesses weren't too keen on working together. \"Are you kidding?\" asks Helga. \"You're putting the fate of the entire lodge in the hands of that bubble butted stoat and her crazy potion? How do we even know that thing will work? For all we know, it could be made out of something flammable that would make the fire worse.\" Lydia gets made and holds up her claws dangerously close Helga's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a magic potion, Helga,\" says Lydia through gritted teeth. \"It doesn't matter!\" \"Magic?\" asks Helga. \"What a load of minotaur.\" \"You're a troll! A creature related to fairies! Something that humans used to believe were creatures of mythology.\" \"Well, most trolls can't use magic! It's nature telling us not to rely on such flights of fancy.\" Azure grunts and slaps herself in the face. \"You IDIOTS! Can't you see that there's a fire! We could all be killed here!\" Vernon let out a groan and held his face. \"<i>I'm</i> the idiot for  thinking those two could work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga grunts and then attempts to bring out a machine that looks like some high-tech pump with a firehose attached to it. Lydia is less than impressed. \"<i>That's</i> what you're planning on putting out the fire with? It looks like an oversized toilet cleaner.\" Helga gives a growl and holds up the hose. \"Oh yeah?\" she asks. Lydia takes out another potion and out of spite, pours it down the fire hose. The potion then bubbles up and hardens, rendering the hose useless as Helga tries to turn it on. \"You moron!\" yells Azure. \"What did you do that for?! That could've been useful!\" You and Roxy shake your heads. Those two had some <i>really</i> messed up priorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the fire grows more intense and Elisa gives a grunt. The hippo/dragon hybrid breathes fire at of her mouth at the flames that are coming in fast. \"Elisa!\" yells Azure. \"What are you doing?!\" Elisa points out that the fire is less intense than before. \"Fighting fire with fire,\" says Elisa. \"Literally. Come on, Roxy, we need to put out these flames. Leave those two fools to argue.\" Roxy and Elisa burst through a burned wall and see the fire spreading. Wasting no time, they both flap their wings in order to fan the flames. Outside, several of the other staff are busy hoping to put out the flames. Felicia and Connie are escorting the guests out while Victoria tosses snowballs at the flames and Elektra sprays water from her trunk. \"Good grief,\" says Felicia. \"What a calamity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, the flames have been put out. Fortunately, nobody was hurt. The bad news was that a good chunk of the lodge was burned, including Azure's office. Azure let out a groan and lowered her head. \"My lodge,\" she says. \"Look at the damage that fire did to my lodge. I had a Gimghoul Painting in there worth thousands of skulls!\" \"At least nobody got hurt,\" says Vernon. \"But it'll take weeks to repair this damage.\" You sit on Elisa's shoulder as both Helga and Lydia give nervous looks. Suddenly, Azure turns to face the two and she is <i>pissed</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You imbeciles! You mean to tell me that you two despise each other so much that you couldn't be bothered to work together when our lives were in danger! For all I know, one or both of you caused that fire in the first place!\" \"It's her fault!\" yells Helga pointing an accusing finger to Lydia. \"You're a liar!\" yells Lydia. \"I'll bet one of your contraptions short-circuited and caught fire.\" \"If that's true, maybe you sabotaged it. Then again, that would require brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" shouts Azure right before she slaps both of them in the face so hard that it leaves an imprint. Your coyote boss roars so loud that even Vernon is scared. \"Because you two were too busy arguing to stop half the lodge from burning down, you two have to pay for repairs! And you'll both be extremely lucky if I don't evict you afterwards!\" Lydia bites her lip. \"I'm kind of short on cash this month.\" \"Same here.\" Says Helga. Azure growls. \"Well then, you better get the money. I don't care if you have to sell your own organs. I want you both to get the money in seven days or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia and Helga grumble and then go off to find work to earn enough money to fix the lodge. \"Loser.\" Mutters Lydia. \"Jerk.\" Says Helga. Azure lets out a sigh and turns to face you, Roxy and Elisa. \"I want you three to follow those idiots and make sure they don't do anything stupid.\" You all nod your heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly who are you going to follow?</span></div></div>",

If you too agreed to work together, then that fire wouldn\u2019t have burned down half the lodge. Lydia gave a scoff. \u201cWell,\u201d you say. \u201cMaybe you and Helga should work together. After all, the two of you on your own can\u2019t possibly earn the money to fix Grimmsly Lodge in only 7 days. How much money do you even need to earn.\u201d Elisa gives a snort. \u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cConsidering how much damage was done, I\u2019d say 100,000 skulls.\u201d \u201cSeriously?\u201d you ask in surprise. \u201cThat much? Lydia. You\u2019re in over your head. You should jut find Helga and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia casts a spell that makes your mouth disappear and you grunt and groan as the kamaitachi lets out a scoff. \u201cI would rather be handcuffed to Persephone Howler for 13 years than work with that no account gadget head. I can get that money all by myself.\u201d \u201cLydia!\u201d yells Elisa. \u201cBe realistic. You can\u2019t earn that much money in 7 days by yourself. If you ask me, Azure is being a tad unreasonable with her demands. Lydia gives a scoff before she enters the outskirts of Thrillerville. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Just get off my case and let me make the money my way.\u201d Lydia stomps away as your mouth grows back and you give a deep breath. \u201cThat weasel is so stubborn.\u201d You say. Elisa gives a grunt. \u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cIf she\u2019s going to be that way, we should leave her alone to make her own mistakes. After what happened, she\u2019ll be lucky if Azure doesn\u2019t decide to evict her.\u201d \u201cEvict her?\u201d you ask. \u201cElisa, Azure looked ready to kill her and Helga both.\u201d Elisa nods her head and then the bahamut hears her big hippopotamus-like belly growl loudly. Elisa taps her stomach and lets out a sigh. \u201cCome on,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave Lydia to stew in her own juices. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa stomps up towards a revolving sushi restaurant and plunks herself down in three chairs at once as she begins picking up plates of sushi and gives you a piece of tuna to eat. You turn and see a sign that reads \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d. \u201cHmmm,\u201d you say. \u201cMaybe Lydia or Helga could find a job working here.\u201d Elisa gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding? I wouldn\u2019t trust a witch to cook my dinner.\u201d \u201cElisa,\u201d you say. \u201cThis is a sushi shop. No cooking required.\u201d Elisa nods her head as she continues to rack up the plates and even gives a belch. You then hear even more ravenous sounds and see that next to you and Elisa is a bespectacled minotaur giantess with a striped body resembling the pattern of an okapi, a relative of the giraffe, of which is in the same order as bovines. She had long brown hair with silver highlights and she was devouring sushi like it was going out of style. Elisa gave a whistle. \u201cAnd I thought I had a big appetite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur woman stops eating sushi and turns to face Elisa. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but overhear,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know somebody looking for a job?\u201d You step back in caution. After all, all the minotaurs you knew ate humans and you were afraid this giantess would think you were a tasty treat. The minotaur gives a scoff. \u201cTell him not to get overheated. I don\u2019t eat humans. In fact, I\u2019m married to one. Anyway, I have three sons and daughter-in-laws who run a restaurant in Direopolis. It\u2019s a good place but after eating here, I\u2019m going to ask them to put sushi on the menu. Getting back on track. One of my daughters-in-law injured herself the other day and they\u2019re looking for a temporary delivery girl. If you know somebody who can do deliveries, I could put in a good word. Trust me, those three boys of mine know better than to argue with me.\u201d Elisa and you blink and actually think about this. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a good idea,\u201d you say. \u201cThanks, Mrs...\u201d The minotaur woman swallows a live eel before speaking. \u201cViola Poe,\u201d she says. \u201cIf your friend shows up and still is looking for a job, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for my help. But it\u2019s got to be before five. I\u2019m heading back to Direopolis today.\u201d With that, Viola gets her big butt off of the 4 damaged stools she was sitting on, pays for her sushi and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Elisa begin to consider recommending Lydia to Viola and her sons when Lydia comes into the sushi shop.</span></div></div>",

I'll have to rob a bank just to keep Azure pleased.\" Elisa gives a smirk at Lydia and Lydia looks at her in confusion. \"Why are you looking at me like that, Elisa?\" Elisa gives a snort. \"We might have found you a job, Lydia.\" Lydia blinks. \"What kind of job?\" You give a nervous look. \"Being a delivery girl for a restaurant.\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"Are you kidding me?\" she asks. \"That's demeaning.\" \"It beats being homeless,\" says Elisa. \"We just met somebody who can hook you up with a job.\" Viola waddles her fat butt up towards Lydia to investigate her. \"Hmm,\" says the minotaur. \"Name?\" \"Lydia Kama.\" \"Age?\" \"23!\" \"Special skills?\" \"Magic.\" \"Are you licensed to drive a vehicle of any kind?\" \"Does a bicycle count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola lets out a sigh. \"Well,\" she says. \"To be honest. I've seen better resumes, but anybody is welcomed to work at Neo Neapolitan. Goodness knows, those boys of mine need all the help they can get.\" Suddenly your eyes pop. \"Neo Neapolitan?\" you ask. \"Wait. You're Allen, Wes and Norman's mom?\" Viola nods her head. \"Wait,\" says Elisa. \"Then you're Corona Poe's mother as well.\" Viola gives a scoff. \"Well of course I am,\" she says. \"How many other minotaurs do you know with a surname like Poe. I gotta tell you, those three boys are always getting themselves into trouble. But they're not stupid enough to argue with me.\" You could believe that. Arguing with one's mother was a terrible idea. Especially when she was a 1300ft high minotaur built like a sumo wrestler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia just lets out a sigh. \"Azure will kill me if I don't reimburse her. I can't really be picky. You got yourself a deal, Mrs. Poe.\" Viola nods her head and then walks away. \"Meet me in my car. I think I can convince Patty and Wes to hire you. If Wes proves stubborn, I'll just stomp him. That always sets the record straight.\" Lydia just gives a grumble. \"Me,\" she says. \"A talented sorceress. Forced to deliver fast food.\" Lydia goes to follow Viola and you and Elisa stare at each other. \"Do you think that she'll be able to earn enough money to pay back Azure for the damages in one week, Elisa?\" Elisa just lets out a sigh. \"One week delivering takeout won't earn half that much in a <i>month</i>,\" says Elisa. \"We better follow her. She'll need some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa takes you and follows Lydia and Viola to a strange looking jalopy of some kind. \"That car is ancient,\" thinks Elisa. \"She can't seriously think about driving it.\" Viola sits in the driver's seat while Lydia sits in the passenger seat and Elisa squeezes into the back seat as you sit on the tip of Elisa's snout. Viola opens the glove compartment and to Lydia's surprise, reveals an older male human sleeping inside. \"Up and at them, Sterling.\" Says Viola to her husband. Viola's husband springs up and then notices Lydia and Elisa. Before he can say anything, Viola covers his mouth with one of her fingers. \"In case you're wondering. These girls will be filling in for Pam until she's back on her feet.\" Sterling looks at Lydia nervously. \"Are you sure that's a good idea, Viola.\" Viola gives a scoff. \"Direopolis is <i>full</i> of kooks, Sterling. One or two more won't make much of a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Viola starts the car and drives away on her way to Direopolis. \"Is Neo Neapolitan a particularly popular restaurant, Viola?\" asks Elisa. Viola nods her head and moos. \"It's the most popular restaurant in Direopolis. Mainly because of its unusual menu. It helps that most monsters in Direopolis are large women with larger appetites.\" \"So your sons and their wives make a lot of money.\" \"Theoretically, yes,\" says Viola. \"But a lot of times they have to give a chunk of their cash to Mia.\" \"Mia Maza?\" you ask. \"You mean the handy woman? They need her, <i>that</i> much?\" Sterling nods his head. \"Yes.\" Elisa gives a gulp. \"That's not a good sign. Uh, out of curiosity, how did Pam get injured in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSterling rolls his eyes. \"She was delivering pizza to one of the regular customers, a mad scientist and on the way out, she took out an unlabeled elixir from the fridge and drank it. It turned out to be an experimental rocket fuel that exploded as soon as she drank the whole thing. She's lucky to be alive but she'll be in the hospital for some kind.\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"What kind of idiot would drink from an unlabeled vial?\" \"The sad part,\" says Viola. \"That's not <i>nearly</i> the dumbest thing she's ever done.

Viola parks in the parking lot of a strange looking restaurant that looked like it was pieced together from a pizzeria, donut shop, ice cream parlor, pancake house and 50s-style burger joint. You've heard of Neo Neapolitan, but this was the first time you've seen it. \"Holy crap,\" says Elisa. \"Who designed that place? Dr. Frankenstein?\" Viola lets out a sigh. \"My daughters-in-law couldn't agree on what to sell. Patty wanted to make the place a pizzeria, Salli wanted to sell burgers and pancakes, largely because of her own taste for blood but Pam wanted to make it into a donut shop.\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"What a dump.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"That dump is the only job option you have right now.\" Sterling rolls his eyes. \"Don't let Patty hear you call Neo Neapolitan a dump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa carries you and both she and Lydia follow Viola into the restaurant where two of the three proprietresses were waiting, both of which were nearly as tall as Viola herself and just as fat. First was Patty, the cook. She was an extremely pear-shaped and pink-skinned werehippopotamus with a blue tattoo of a pyramid over one of her eyes and long red hair that reached down towards her enormous rear. She was wearing a red tank top and skin tight black pants with an apron and gold jewelry. Next to her was Salli, the head waitress. You knew her all too well because she was Elektra's daughter, though thankfully she didn't share her mom's taste for human flesh. Salli was a vanilla-skinned hybrid of a loxodon and a vampire. She resembled an Asian elephant with vampire fangs in her mouth and her trunk and long black hair. She wore a gothic outfit with teal and black makeup and a hair clip shaped like a vampire bat. She was levitating off of the ground and carrying a large umbrella shaped like an imp. Both were accompanied by their human husbands. Patty's husband, Wes, was on the tip of her snout while Salli's husband, Allen, was hiding in his wife's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asks Wes. \"You found somebody to fill in for Pam and Norman? But, Mom...\" Viola gave a snort and looked down at her son. \"Is that a problem? You need a delivery girl and she needs work. Her landlady will skin her alive otherwise.\" Allen just gestures to Wes. \"Humor her, bro. You know how nasty she can get when she's mad.\" Patty walks forward to inspect Lydia who growls slightly at her. \"She doesn't look very friendly,\" says the hippo giantess. \"I'm not so sure.\" \"Oh, don't worry, Patty,\" says Viola. \"As long as she's smarter than Pam.\" Patty rolls her eyes. \"That's not much of an accomplishment, but she'll do until that stupid porker gets out of the hospital.\" Then Patty turns to Elisa and smiles at the bahamut woman. \"Now, you,\" she says. \"I've been waiting for another hippo girl to apply for the staff. Do you know how to cook?\" \"Well,\" says Elisa. \"I breathe fire and sometimes use it to heat up my food.\" Patty then hands Elisa an apron. \"Good,\" she says. \"You can start in the kitchen. Your boyfriend can join you.\" Your eyes pop out. \"Boyfriend?!\" Patty must've thought you and Elisa were a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both hippo giantesses stomp towards the kitchen, Viola taps Patty on the shoulder. \"Uh,\" she says. \"While I have you, Patty. This morning I ate some delicious revolving sushi in Terrordale. Perhaps you should invest in something like that.\" Patty gives a snort. \"I'll think about it, Viola. But where am I going to find somebody to run it for me? It's hard enough juggling burgers, pizzas, donuts, pancakes and sundaes. I'll let Dorothy find somebody once she gets back from Hawaii.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia lets out a grumble as she takes out her bicycle and begins to adjust the wheels. \"How demeaning,\" she says. \"I'm a great sorceress and I'm forced to deliver takeout.\" While Lydia was groaning, Viola sat down at a table and placed Sterling on top as Salli walks up to take her order. \"We'll take a half dozen meatball parm calzones.\" Says Viola. \"And two diet Hauntling Colas.\" Says Sterling. Salli writes down the order but then she hears a phone ringing and answers it. \"Hello?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the phone is a baku woman, you'd say 1075ft high. She resembled an anthropomorphic tapir with platinum skin and light purple stripes. She was bald but wore a pair of round glasses. From the looks of it, she was somewhat obese and she had her leg in a cast. \"Hello, Salli,\" says the baku woman. \"I heard from your mother-in-law that you have a new delivery girl.\" Salli gives a blink. \"Mayor Merry,\" she says. \"You're just in time. We need to break her in.\" The mayor gives a smile on the other end of the line. \"Well,\" she says. \"In that case, I'll take an order of 12 double cheeseburgers and 3 large fries.\" \"And for the drink?\" Mayor Merry scoffs. \"I have drinks at home. Normally I'd come over, but that stupid succubus broke my leg the other day.\" Salli gives a trumpet. \"At once. Lydia! We have a job for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until Patty has finished the mayor's order (with help from Elisa). \"Viola wasn't kidding,\" says Elisa. \"Your customers sure do eat a lot.\" \"That's what makes a restaurant a lucrative business in Direopolis.\" Says Patty. \"Out of curiosity,\" says Elisa. \"How much do you usually make on a weekly basis.\" \"Depends.\" Says Patty. You blink. \"Depends on what?\" you ask. \"A),\" says Wes. \"Depends on who comes in. Some of our customers are bigger gluttons than others and B) Depends on how much damage is done to Neo Neapolitan that week. A lot of that money goes towards paying Mia. Exactly how much money does your friend need to pay off your other boss?\" Elisa bites her lips. \"100,000 Skulls.\" Patty gives a look of shock. \"Are you kidding me? You'd need Corona, Vienna, Claire <i>and</i> Mayor Merry to pop in for a meal for that to work and in the same week? That's not very likely. Heck.

Elisa waddles up behind her and gives a grunt. \"Stephen will be coming with you.\" Lydia gives a scowl. \"I sense a lack of trust.\" \"Just making sure that you don't get into any kind of trouble. Salli told me this was a really strange town.\" Lydia moans before you're placed on the weasel giantess's shoulder and she rides off. Elisa shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia peddles her bike as she makes her way through Direopolis. \"I hope that Helga can get the other half of the money you owe,\" you tell her. \"It doesn't sound like this was a very profitable job.\" Lydia gives a glare. \"I can make all the money without any help from that no account literal troll. I could just as easily find a second job out here.\" \"But Neo Neapolitan closes at 8,\" you say. \"I don't like your chances. And you only have 7 days.\" Lydia sticks out her tongue but then she hears a siren blaring. \"What the?\" you ask. \"Were we going over the speed limit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car pulls up and you see that the driver is a mountain ranger. From the looks of it, she was a chubby but hourglass-shaped teal-skinned weredolphin with violet hair. She resembled a humanoid porpoise dressed as a Texas ranger. \"Hold it right there, kamaitachi,\" she says. \"I don't think I've ever seen you in town.\" Lydia gives a growl. \"I'm just delivery the mayor's lunch. I work for Neo Neapolitan.\" The dolphin giantess looks around and inspects Lydia but she's not convinced. \"What kind of a rube do you take me for?\" she asks. \"The delivery girl for Neo Neapolitan is Pamela Petunia Hocker, a wereboar. Height: 1350ft. Weight: 1800lbs (in scale). Hair: Blonde. I.Q.: Very low. You don't match that description. More than likely, you're an identity thief who has kidnapped and/or murdered the real Pam Hocker and stolen her job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \"Are you kidding me?\" you ask. You heard that the mountain rangers were the closest thing Direopolis had to the police. But from the looks of it, this dolphin giantess was the most incompetent cop you've ever met. Roxy's sister, Petra, should've seen what a dummy this woman was. \"You moron,\" you say. \"Lydia is a temp. Pam is in the hospital. Call the doctor. Call Patty and Salli. They'll confirm the story.\" The dolphin giantess, who you identify as \"Delphine\" from her name tag, is skeptical but calls the restaurant. At that time, Viola and Sterling were in the middle of their meal when Salli flies up to the phone. \"Hello?\" asks Salli. \"Mrs. Van Richter,\" says Delphine. \"I have an identity thief claiming to be your delivery girl here.\" Salli lets out a sigh. \"She's a temporary delivery girl, Delphine,\" says Salli. \"Pam hurt herself on the job and had to be hospitalized. It will be a week before she's back.\" Salli then hangs up and lets out a sigh. \"What's wrong?\" asks Elisa. Patty lets out a sigh. \"One of our customers,\" she says. \"Delphine. She's an inept mountain ranger who jumps to conclusions all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with you and Lydia, Delphine gives a glare. \u201cYour story checks out, but I\u2019m keeping an eye on you, weasel. They don\u2019t give this badge to just anybody you know.\u201d Lydia gives a growl. \u201cIt sounds like that\u2019s EXACTLY who they give a badge to around here.\u201d Delphine gives a glare and then drives off, leaving you and Lydia to make your delivery. \u201cGeez,\u201d you say. \u201cThat was harrowing.\u201d Lydia gives a growl. \u201cJust as long as we get to the mayor\u2019s house without anything bad happening. I don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s a time limit I\u2019m supposed to be delivering this food within.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Lydia makes her way to Mayor Merry's Japanese-style house and walks in the front door. The baku giantess takes the food and pays Lydia as she gives a smile. \"Thanks, Ms...\" \"Lydia,\" says Lydia. \"By the way, Ms. Mayor, do you know anybody else who is looking for somebody to do paid work in Direopolis?\" Mayor Merry bites into a burger before the tapir-like giantess answers. \"Well,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that it's a good idea while you're already working for Patty and Salli, but I've heard some rumors. Hmm. There's no way Cora will hire you. You're a kamaitachi. I heard Trini was offering money to participate in one of her experiments.\" \"Trini?\" asks Lydia. \"Who's that?\" \"She's our local inventor. Don't tell her I said it, but she's kind of a bumbler.\" Lydia's eyes pop and twitch when she hears the word \"inventor\". \"No way!\" yells Lydia. \"I'm not <i>that</i> desperate.\" Mayor Merry scratches her injured leg before letting out a slight belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she says. \"There are only three other jobs I can think of. One of Claire's maids at the hotel quit due to Brenda insulting her. Honestly, I don't know why Claire hasn't fired or eaten her yet. Mrs. Oda is also looking for help at the beauty parlor. Finally, Deneb is looking for a housekeeper to tend to her place while she's at... \"work\".\" Lydia nods her head and then starts to ride her bicycle away. \"Uh,\" you say as you ride on Lydia's shoulder. \"Lydia? Neo Neapolitan is the other way.\" \"I'm not riding to Neo Neapolitan. I'm going to apply for a second job.\" \"I don't think that's a good idea. Patty and Salli might not like it.\" Lydia gives a growl. \"I'm not going to let Helga outdo me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh as Lydia rides all the way to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lydia rides up towards a beauty parlor of some sort. It was a Japanese style place with anime portraits of the monster visitors painted on the sides of the walls and the barber poles appeared to have stripes shaped like dragons. You just stare at Lydia. \"Lydia,\" you say. \"This isn't a good idea. After all, juggling a job in a restaurant and a job that involves falling hair? That's a bad combination.\" Lydia gives a hiss. \"Come on,\" she says. \"There's no way I can make 100,000 skulls in one week working at Neo Neapolitan. I just hope most citizens aren't as bald as the mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia walks inside to see a fat apple-shaped Japanese dragon teenager with purple skin and a yellow underbelly. She had bright red hair that looked as though it was dyed. From her uniform, she worked at the parlor. She was fixing a barber's chair while there was another dragon in the corner. This one was an elderly-looking male dragon with pale green skin and from the looks of it, he had fallen asleep reading the newspaper. You look closer and see the newspaper was written in braille. The male dragon was blind like Zoey. You then notice that there was a pitch dark room in the back, hidden by curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia scratches the window to get the teen dragon's attention, as she bumps her head on a ceiling fan and grunts. \"Excuse me,\" says Lydia. \"Is the boss here hiring any new hair stylists.\" The teenage dragon turns her head and notices Lydia. She sees Lydia's apron and realizes she's a delivery girl for Neo Neapolitan. \"Oh. You must be the stand in for Mrs. Hocker. Wait. Why do you want a job here if you already work for Mrs. Round and Mrs. Van Richter?\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"I need a lot of money to pay off a debt in only a week. Who's in charge around here.\" The teenage dragon scratches the back of her head. \"Well, my mom's the boss, but she doesn't really like having strangers in the house. I'll go ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage dragoness walks into the back room and then you and Lydia give looks of surprise as you hear loud stomping noises. \"What the heck was that?!\" you yell. From what you could tell, who or whatever made those stomping sounds was at <i>least</i> 4 times bigger and 10 times heavier than that teenage dragon. \"Hey, Mom.\" you hear the teen dragon's voice say. \"What is it, Akira?\" asks a surprisingly light and feminine sounding voice from what was obviously a particularly large monster. You give a look of surprise. \"Wow,\" you say. \"That huge dragon is the boss?\" Lydia gulps. \"I don't think whatever is in there <i>is</i> a dragon. She's clearly some kind of monster big enough to use dragons as dental floss.\" You blow on your finger as Akira speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a kamaitachi lady in here who wants a job. But she's already working for Patty and Salli.\" \"Hmm. I'll have to think of some reasonable hours but alright. Tell her she starts first thing tomorrow.\" \"Okay, Mom.\" Akira walks out of the back room and you hear her mother stomping away. \"Good news, Miss,\" says Akira. \"You have the job. Just one condition.\" \"And what is that?\" asks Lydia in confusion. \"The condition is that you aren't allowed to watch mom as she's working.\" You give a gulp. \"Your mom must be enormous based on her footsteps.\" Akira nods her head. \"She is. She's the biggest monster I know. She makes Patty, Salli and Pam look like dwarves in comparison.\" You gulp. That woman sounds like she could make Petra look like an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the beauty parlor, Lydia was wheeling back to Neo Neapolitan. \"I don't think you should take that job, Lydia,\" you say. \"You don't even know what kind of creature you're working for. You said yourself she was too big to be a dragon.\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"You worry too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment...</span></div></div>",

You shake your head. \"You're a glutton for punishment, you know that, don't you, Lydia.\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"I can handle two jobs.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"I should hope so. Patty and Salli won't like it if they find out you're moonlighting.\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"You worry too much. And if you tell Salli or Patty or even Elisa, I'll eat you.\" Lydia snaps her teeth and you gulp as you get the message. As you and Lydia enter the restaurant, you see Salli on the phone. \"Another customer?\" asks Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli shakes her head. \"Not exactly. But it does have a way for you to earn some extra cash to pay off your debt.\" You give a look of surprise. \"Uh-oh.\" You think. Lydia, however, apparently not satisfied with the two jobs she had already scored, smirked. \"Oh really?\" she asks. \"What do I have to do?\" Allen climbs the tip of Salli's trunk before speaking. \"Pam's brother Lon is looking for somebody to help him with his landscaping work, just for the afternoon.\" You give a blink. \"Pam has a brother?\" you ask. Patty shakes her head. \"Brothers. Plural. Pam has one older brother, one younger brother, one older sister and one younger sister. Unfortunately, when it came to brains, it was first come first served and Pam's older sister didn't leave anything left for the rest of the clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly why does Lon need Lydia to help him.\" Wes let out a sigh. \"Because he just got through with an appointment with the eye doctor and Vienna recently hired him as her gardener.\" Elisa's jaw drops. \"Vienna?!\" she yells. \"The gargoyle jazz singer!? She lives here!?\" \"Oh yes,\" says Patty. \"Vienna is an old friend of mine.\" \"You're sisters-in-law with Corona Poe and you're a friend of Vienna's?\" asks Elisa in more shock. \"You have connections, girl.\" Patty nods her head but then you hear the sound of an engine. \"What is that?\" Wes rolls his eyes. \"Lon, probably. I know the sound of his obnoxious motorcycle anywhere.\" You and Lydia give looks of horror. \"You mean the guy just came out of the eye doctor's office and he's driving a motorcycle!?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a loud screeching sound and you look forward to see a motorcycle coming right at the door. The rider of the motorcycle was a purple-skinned and slightly chubby male wereboar with long platinum blonde hair and what looked like a goatee riding forward. He was wearing a motocross outfit and a pair of goggles. From the looks of it, several of his teeth, including one of his tusks, had been replaced with gold. The pig man clearly couldn't see where he was going because he wound up shattering the front door before finally stopping on one of the tables as he let out a loud squeal and crash landed in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty slaps herself in the face and mutters as the wereboar giant gets up and shakes his head. \"One of these days,\" he said. \"I've got to get those brakes fixed.\" \"Geez, Lon,\" growls Patty. \"Do you want to join your big sister in the hospital.\" \"Get off my case, Patty,\" says Lon as he holds his head. \"Pam is right. You <i>are</i> a hothead.\" Patty glares and then shakes the frying pan in her hand at the time. \"Must resist. Must resist.\" Salli however, has more patience with the pig man and floats up to him. \"Hey, Lon. We found somebody to help you out at Vienna's.\" Lon gives a squeal and then squints as Lydia walks forward. \"I didn't know there was a troll in this town.\" Lydia gives a growl. \"I'm not a troll, you moron! I'm a kamaitachi!\" \"Lydia,\" you say. \"I'd be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia realizes her mistake and clears her throat. \"I'm sorry about that. Lydia Kama. I'm ready for some landscaping.\" Lon gives a snort. \"Great,\" he said. \"I was afraid that I was going to be alone with blurry eyes working around Vienna's garden.\" Elisa rolls her own eyes. \"Does asking for time off mean anything to you?\" Lydia follows Lon and you crawl up to the weasel giantess's ear. \"I don't know about this, Lydia. Anybody who tries to drive a motorcycle after getting his pupils dilated can't possibly be the best person to work for.\" \"It's just for the day, bug! Shut it!\" Lon is about to get on his bike but Lydia stops him. \"Oh no,\" she says. \"I saw you driving. I'm taking over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia gets on the bike as Lon gets in the sidecar and then she jets off screaming. From the look on Lydia's face, she had never even rode a motorcycle much less drove one and you had to hold onto the tip of Lydia's ear to avoid being tossed out into the city. \"This was a bad idea!\" you yell.

From the looks of it, it was a large and mildly opulent looking hotel that had a sign outside depicting a chameleon with rainbow stripes and a bright tongue. Lydia gave a laugh. \"With two jobs, I'll have that money back in no time.\" \"I don't know, Lydia. If Patty and Salli find out you're moonlighting, I don't think that they'll like it. Besides, I heard the CEO of this particular hotel chain is very neurotic. I wouldn't want to work for somebody who's emotionally unstable.\" Lydia then squeezes you and you grunt before the weasel giantess looks down at you. \"Well, I heard that Miss Melon is the only regular customer at Neo Neapolitan who swallows humans. Maybe I'll offer you up as a snack to settle the deal.\" You decide to shut up, you were getting nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lydia was walking up towards the hotel, a rather fat werehyena with golden fur walked by and she stared at Lydia. \"Don't tell me that you're applying for a job here?\" asked the hyena giantess. \"You're in for a colossal headache.\" You give a gulp. \"Claire is <i>that</i> hard to work for?\" The hyena gave a scoff. \"The boss isn't the problem. There is one very rude fellow employee who worked my last nerve. It's lucky for her that it's illegal for monsters to eat humans in Direopolis. That's the only reason she's survived so long. I don't know why Miss Melon doesn't just fire her. Believe me, if she wants me back, a raise won't be enough.\" The hyena giantess walks away and you blink. But Lydia doesn't take the warning seriously and walks into the hotel, the gargoyle doorman lets her in with no problem. The manager is a bright pink furred wendigo without any horns on her head. \"Excuse me,\" says Lydia. \"Who am I supposed to go to to get the maid position.\" The wendigo gives a blink. \"Oh,\" she says. \"I'll take you right to Ms. Melon's office. She'll be in shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager leads Lydia to the office and knocks on the door. \"Hello, Ms. Melon? Huh, guess she isn't here yet. Wait right here.\" Lydia rolls her eyes and walks into the office and places you on Claire's desk. She looks around and sees paintings of dinosaurs on the wall that looked expensive.\" You walk on Claire's desk and see a photograph of what you assume to be Claire herself and another monster woman. From the photograph, you see that Claire is apparently a rather fat and bottom heavy silver-skinned werelizard resembling a chameleon with a hunched back and long red hair worn in a bob cut. From the looks of it, her tongue was multi-colored, which explained the name of her hotel chain. There was another lizard woman in the photograph, most likely her sister. Claire\u2019s sister was a brass-skinned frilled werelizard with a red and yellow-colored frill and short blue hair (though you didn\u2019t know if it was natural or dyed). From the looks of it, she was chubby and bottom heavy but not nearly as heavyset as Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLydia,\u201d you say. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait around all day for Claire. If you take too long coming back from delivering the mayor\u2019s food, Patty and Salli might fire you.\u201d Lydia gave a scoff. \u201cOh please,\u201d she says. \u201cClaire probably pays twice as much as those...\u201d Before Lydia finishes her sentence, she hears yelling. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Brenda! If you keep up with your bad attitude, I swear, I\u2019ll transfer you to our hotel in Panicburg!\u201d yells a rather stressed out sounding contralto. You\u2019re so shocked you fall and land in the seat of Claire\u2019s chair and grunt. At that moment, Claire walks into her office twitching. Claire stood 875ft high making her almost three times as big as Lydia. She was grumbling to herself and then walked over to a coffee machine in the corner of the room to fix herself a cup and Lydia looked in surprise as Claire dumped half a sugar bowl into her cup and let out a sigh. \u201cWhy is good help so hard to find,\u201d muttered Claire to herself. \u201cYou try to offer equal opportunity for humans and monsters but some of them just have to be...\u201d It was at that moment, Claire realized that Lydia was in the room and then she turned and looked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Claire walks over to her chair and you gasp as you look up and see her enormous rear. It was almost as big as Patty\u2019s and completely dwarfed the chair. She was wearing underwear that appeared to bear a Jurassic Park logo. You then try to run as her rear comes down like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, but it is to no avail as you\u2019re completely trapped underneath Claire\u2019s massive behind. You let out a groan as Claire speaks with Lydia. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d asks Claire. Lydia is at first nervous but then speaks. \u201cWell, I came to apply for the maid job.\u201d Claire simply stares at Lydia. \u201cDo you have any experience?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a sorceress.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a sorceress. I\u2019m looking for a maid to replace Juliet. I have a very important clientele coming and I can\u2019t settle for amateurs.\u201d \u201cOh come on,\u201d says Lydia. \u201cHave I heart. I need to pay off my debts from a lodge that burned down.\u201d Claire clutches her chest and gasps. \u201cBurned down!? You mean to tell me your lodgings caught on fire? You didn\u2019t have anything to do with it, did you. If you think I\u2019m allowing a fire hazard in my hotel, you\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me! It was a stupid troll fiddling with strange gadgets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia then screams as Claire lashes out her tongue to catch a butterfly that flies over Lydia\u2019s head and then pulls it back into her mouth before chewing it like bubblegum and swallowing it. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a trial run,\u201d says Claire. \u201cI expect you to be here at 6 tonight. Don\u2019t be late. If you do a good job, I might keep you.\u201d With that Lydia smiles and walks out, leaving you trapped under Claire\u2019s behind. You let out muffled yells but neither Lydia nor Claire hears you. It looks like you\u2019ll be trapped under Claire for....</span></div></div>",

It sounds like Lydia and Helga get along well as Pam and Corona.\" \"Corona?\" you ask. \"Wait! I'm an idiot! Viola Poe, Corona Poe! Corona Poe is your stepsister!? That's incredible.\" \"Yeah,\" says Wes. \"And we knew here <i>before</i> she became famous. I hope Lydia gets along better with Corona than Corona does with Pam.\" \"Corona doesn't get along with Pam?\" Wes lets out a sigh. \"Corona used to have a human boyfriend herself. They were inseparable. Unfortunately, he was killed by a wereboar. Pam is a wereboar. Do the math.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"I see.

Patty, Salli and Pam have trouble getting along with each other, but that's mainly because we see each other on a daily basis and drive each other nuts.

Do any of you have other issues with your in-laws.\" Wes bites his lips. \"Actually, Salli's dad gets along well with Allen.\" \"He's a vampire right?\" \"Yeah, but he doesn't prey on humans. I think that's why he and Elektra got divorced. As for Norman, he gets along well with Pam's parents <i>and</i> her siblings. Ironically the moron has the least amount of in-law trouble.\" \"What about you, Wes.\" Wes gives a grumble. \"Don't get me wrong,\" says the oldest Wraith brother. \"Neith is easy enough to get along with but that Carter really turns my wheels!

She looks 100% werehippo to me.\" \"Well she's half human. You can see it in her eyes.\" You then look back at Patty and Wes before speaking. \"If she's half human and you're 100% human, then what will your kids look like?\" Both Wes and Patty's eyes pop out and Patty even clutches her chest as if she was having a heart attack. Wes bites his beard and twitches his fingers before he puts his hand to his ear. \"I think I left the teapot on.\" He said, dodging the question altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh as you walk up to Elisa cutting up vegetables. \"Elisa,\" says Destiny. \"That's a pretty name. \"Did your parents name you that for your midnight hair and tan skin.\" Elisa shrugs her shoulders. \"I have no idea.

I have another sister named Jeddah and she's younger.\" Patty nods her head. \"Me. I never had sisters, but with the sisters-<i>in-law</i> I have, no thank you.\" \"Patty,\" says Elisa as she chops some peppers. \"Is it because you're the cook.\" Patty lets out a sigh. \"If you must know, my full name is Cleopatra. I'm an Egyptian monster. By the way, I didn't know you were Stephen's girlfriend.\" Elisa scoffs as she cuts up some dinosaur meat. \"I'm not. I don't even have a crush on anyone.\" Patty gives a smug grin. \"Maybe a big purple man will come in and change your life.\" Elisa gives a scoff. \"Very funny, Patty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to look through the window to the kitchen and see that Viola and Sterling are still the only customers and they had moved on to a neapolitan sundae. \"Don't think we don't know what you're doing,\" says Sterling as he bites into a cherry the size of a wrecking ball. \"It's still early. Somebody will pop in. Oops.\" Sterling slips and falls, covering himself in strawberry ice cream before Viola picks him up. She rolls her eyes and giggles before tossing her husband into her mouth and slamming her jaw shut. You gasp and scream as you see Viola swallow Sterling. \"Oh my gosh!\" \"What's wrong?\" asks Wade. You gag a few times before speaking. \"Viola! Sterling! She ate her own husband!\" Wes rolls his eyes and then points to Viola spitting Sterling back out into her hand, cleaned off. Both of them share a kiss before going back to their dessert as you look in confusion. \"Oh,\" you say. \"I forgot minotaurs were still bovids.\" \"Don't worry,\" says Wes. \"Dad's indestructible, just like us. I think he even enjoys it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh before another customer comes in. This customer was a giant light blue-skinned Loch Ness Monster woman with long white hair. She was very obese, especially below the belt. She wore a Saturday-style spandex orange and black outfit and what looked like an engagement ring on her finger. She was carrying a cooler in one hand and a tackle box in the other. Apparently she fished for a living. \"Oh,\" says Salli as Elisa walks out of the kitchen. \"It's Lapis.\" \"Lapis?\" asks Elisa. \"Is she a customer.\" \"Yes,\" says Allen. \"And the opposite. She comes by the restaurant to sell the fish she catches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli floats up as Lapis smiles and takes out her wares. There was a giant squid with horns, a flounder with the pattern of a bumblebee and a fish that looked like a hybrid of a lobster and an octopus. You let out a whistle. \"Wow,\" you say. \"Look at all those fish.\" Lapis then takes out what looks like a big ball of seaweed. \"What is that?\" asks Allen. Lapis scratched her head. \"I don't really know. I pulled it up from Neptune knows where. I thought you could use the seaweed to make a salad. Elisa rubs her chin and rips off the seaweed and what she sees makes her and you scream. \"What?\" asks Lapis before she sees what she caught and gasps. \"Oh ****!\" Allen screams at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, what Lapis hooked up was a sea mine. \"A mine!\" yells Salli. Allen hides in Salli's ear as Patty and Wes drop their jaws. \"Oh no.\" Says Viola as Sterling hides in her hair. \"Now, calm down,\" says Lapis. \"This mine looks ancient. I'd say 100 years old. There's no way it's still active.\" Unfortunately, the mine began to hiss and Lapis tossed it to the side in fear. \"Get rid of that mine!\" yells Patty. Elisa grabs the mine and then throws it at the window, not checking to see if it was open first and you and Wes plug your ears.</span></div></div>",

Patty lets out a sigh. \"This is why we can't get insurance.\" \"Look on the bright side, Patty,\" says Salli. \"At least it wasn't Pam's fault this time.\" Patty covers her face and starts swearing in Swahili as she waddles up to the phone. \"Better call Mia.\" She says as she dials the phone. Elisa places you on Patty's shoulder next to Wes so you can overhear the conversation. Suddenly you hear somebody pick up the phone and what sounds like a toilet flushing in the background. \"Patty,\" groans Mia. \"I should've known. I'll be over in two shakes of a cat's butt.\" Mia then hangs up and Wes lets out a sigh. \"Mia comes over so often to fix shit that we might as well put her on the payroll.\" \"How much does Roxy's cousin usually charge?\" asks Elisa. Salli gives a trumpet. \"Let me put it this way. She's practically the fifth richest citizen of Direopolis.\" Elisa bites her lip and soon enough, Mia walks in and is shocked at the damage done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened here? It looks like a mine went off!\" At that moment, Lydia comes back from her delivery and is smiling as she has the payoff in her hands and is counting it. \"I gotta say,\" says Lydia. \"I'm not much for this town, but the mayor sure is a big tipper. At this rate I'll be able to pay off my debt in no time.\" That's what Lydia thought, but Mia takes the money from her hand. \"Hey!\" yells the weasel as Mia puts the cash away. \"This is a down payment,\" she says. \"You can pay the rest after I'm done.\" Mia then switches her prosthetic hand for one that ended in a drill and whirled it as she picked up some screws and planks of wood. Lydia then notices the hole and gasps. \"Please tell me that's an inexpensive hole.\" She says. Mia gives a scoff. \"At this size? I'd say it's worth at least 1000 skulls. The entire wall needs to be replaced.\" Lydia gives a loud yell and pulls her ears in frustration. \"One step forward and three steps back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa then walks over and Mia notices her and you. \"Hi, Elisa. Hey, Stephen.\" \"Hey, Mia,\" you say. \"You come here often?\" Mia points to her large behind and growls. \"These danger magnets keep me so busy that I have to eat most of my meals here.\" Elisa then has an idea. \"Hey, Mia. You think you'd be interested in repairing Grimmsly Lodge? Half the place was damaged in a fire.\" \"Who's the idiot who started the fire?\" \"Idiots,\" you say. \"Plural. One of them is the kamaitachi subbing for Pam. She and the other idiot have to earn 100,000 skulls in one week.\" Mia stops and replaces her drill hand with a hammer hand before Patty hands her a milkshake to drink. \"Seriously? That much damage. I guess I could take a crack at it. As long as nothing happens to Neo Neapolitan in that time frame. Oh, but it can't be tomorrow. Vienna asked me to build a gazebo. And it also can't be on Monday. I've got an appointment with the dentist that day. Tuesday doesn't work either. Jury duty. And there's too much to do on Wednesday for me to even tell you. Of course, since Roxy is my cousin, I'll give you a discount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia gives a scoff and crosses her arms. \"Well,\" she says. \"That's gracious of you.\" Viola rolls her eyes as she starts licking her bowl. \"I hope that Helga, whoever she is, is making more headway.\" Sterling nods his head before Salli answers the phone and nods her head before telling Patty the order. \u201cWell,\u201d you say. \u201cIt looks like Lydia\u2019s getting a second... Ugh!\u201d Lydia grabs you and squeezes you as she holds you up in the air. \u201cAnd you\u2019re coming with me this time, bug! I\u2019m not letting some wereleopard abscond with any more of my cash.\u201d Elisa lets out a sigh as Patty brings out the takeout. \u201cSo,\u201d asks your bahamut friend. \u201cWho\u2019s next on the list for deliveries?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You remembered that Howler was April's last name. She must've had a relative in Direopolis, seeing as you knew for a fact that April came from a rather large family. \"Howler?\" asks Elisa. \"Patty, this wouldn't happen to be a werewolf would it.\" Wes rolls his eyes. \"With a name like Howler, no. She's actually a mummy.\" He says with a hint of sarcasm. \"They're a two girl couple,\" says Salli. \"Crescent Howler and Trini Grunewald. The former is an artist who specializes in sand castles and sculptures.\" You realize that Crescent would most likely be a relative of April's seeing as all of April's relatives you knew of were artists in one form or another. But sandcastles? You've seen a lot of sandcastles on the beach that were as big as actual castles but you never thought of sandcastles as being art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about, Trini?\" asks Elisa. \"Is she a werewolf.\" \"No,\" says Salli. \"She's a saber-toothed tiger.\" \"A saber-toothed tiger?!\" you yell. \"I thought those things were extinct.\" Patty gives a scoff. \"Maybe in the human side of the world. She's actually a subspecies of weretiger. I gotta warn you, though.\" \"Why?\" you ask with a gulp. \"Do those two like to... eat humans?\" Salli gives a trumpet. \"Don't worry. Crescent is allergic to humans. As far as I can tell, Claire is the only customer we have who likes to swallow humans.\" \"Then what's so bad about those two?\" asks Elisa as Patty comes out with the pizzas. Patty lets out a sigh. \"A lot of Trini's inventions can wreak havoc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia gives a face like she's about to have a stroke. \"An inventor!?\" she yells. \"Nuh-uh! There is no way I'm delivery food to one of those blights to the monster world! An inventor got me into this mess in the first place! Find somebody else to do it! Get Tanya to take it!\" \"That's not Tanya's job,\" says Patty. \"It's your job.\" \"Why is it MY job!? Why can't you or Salli delivery it.\" \"Because Salli can't go out in the sunlight without burning herself,\" says Allen. \"And Patty can't drive.\" Patty looms over Lydia angrily. \"If you don't deliver these pizzas, I'm in the right to fire you.\" Lydia gives a growl and reluctantly takes the pizzas before walking out with you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it! Me, a sorceress with style, forced to cater to a mad scientist!\" You let out a sigh. \"Would you knock it off. I don't know who this Trini is, but as far as you should be concerned, she's a customer. Patty said she and her wife are two of their best customers. Guess they're too busy to cook for themselves.\" Lydia let out a sigh as she peddled down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until you and Lydia arrived outside of the Howler-Grunewalds' address. It was a strange high-tech looking building that appeared as if it came out a science fiction movie set thousands of years in the future. Outside were domes that contained sand sculptures that took on the shapes of different species of monsters as well as figures from mythology, strange-looking animals and one sculpture of a female werewolf eating a handful of humans while sitting on a pirate ship. \"What an.... interesting decor. It's like the past meets the future. A sand sculptor and an inventor. I wonder how those two became an item.\" Lydia gives a scoff. \"Who cares?\" she asks. \"Let's just deliver these pizzas and get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was when you and Lydia freeze in place because you hear strange sirens. Out from behind the corner comes a strange-looking robot that had the lower half of a tank where its legs should be, a purple torso with a hunched back and lobster claws for hands and a head with a large red artificial jewel in the center of its video-camera-shaped face as well as a metallic looking hood that was the same color as its torso and looked welded to its body. robot made a buzzing noise as it looked up at you and Lydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" asks Lydia. You give a gulp. \"It must be one of Trini's inventions. Don't make any sudden moves.\" You and Lydia watch as the robot whirs and seems to scan you both. Its red jewel turns blue and then it beeps again. \"INTRUDER DETECTED!\" yells the robot in a high-pitched metallic sounding voice. \"INTRUDER DETECTED! ASSUMING DEFENSE PROTOCOL!\" Lydia gives a growl and holds her claws. \"Insolent machine!\" \"Wait,\" you say. \"That robot must be a guard. We're new in town, so it doesn't recognize us and can't tell if we're friend or foe.\" Lydia takes out her wand. \"Oh yeah,\" she says. \"I'll fix this robot's wagon!\" However, the robot fires a laser beam from its jewel and melts Lydia's wand as Lydia looks in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot beeped again. \"HOSTILE INTRUDER DETECTED! ASSUMING ATTACK PROTOCOL!\" You and Lydia are forced to run as the weasel giantess is chased by the irate defense robot. The robot shoots what appear to be cherry bombs from its claws and even singes the tip of Lydia's tail as Lydia screams. Lydia even drops one of the pizzas where it is run over by the robot. The cheese splatters all over the robot and it begins to spark and twirl around as it shoots lasers more erratically and forces Lydia on all fours as you grab her by the tip of her ear. \"Now it's malfunctioning! I just hope those two won't miss just one pizza.\" Lydia lets out a scream as a laser burns her other ear and you bite your nails as the robot gets closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you and Lydia see salvation as up ahead...</span></div></div>",

How can we be sure that stuff isn\u2019t counterfeit that you just magicked up.\u201d Lydia gave a scoff. \u201cYou sound just like that moron, Helga. It\u2019s real money. That you can be sure of. And from the looks of it, it\u2019s enough to cover my debts. Hee, hee, hee.\u201d With that, the obese weasel giantess walks away as you and Elisa follow her in disbelief. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she could get 100,000 skulls that fast,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cSomething\u2019s up.\u201d You nod your head in agreement. It seemed too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lydia returns to the lodge and hands the money to Azure as Helga looks on in absolute shock. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d asks Helga. \u201cHow did...!? What ha..!?\u201d Azure flips through the suitcase and counts all the money as Vernon sits on her shoulder. \u201cWell I\u2019ll be dipped,\u201d says Azure. \u201cIt\u2019s all here. Exactly 100,000 skulls. That\u2019s remarkable and unbelievable.\u201d Lydia gives a smug smirk. \u201cAnd I covered it all myself while a certain troll was slacking off.\u201d Helga gives a glare because she\u2019s clearly suspicious. \u201cHow did you earn all that money in so little time? I\u2019d bet 100,000 skulls that your 100,000 skulls is fake.\u201d Vernon climbs down onto Azure\u2019s large belly and looks over the money. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is definitely real money. Non of the serial numbers are the same so it can\u2019t be counterfeit.\u201d Lydia gives a laugh as Helga is incensed. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t do anything to help pay off the damage that YOUR machines did to the hotel. If I were you, I\u2019d be looking for another place to live.\u201d Lydia laughs and walks away as Helga jumps up and down in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy is just as surprised. \u201cYou say that you took your eyes off her for only half an hour and she earned 100,000 skulls?\u201d Elisa gives a grunt as she stuffs her face with pretzels. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened. It doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d \u201cThen where did she get the money?\u201d asks Roxy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d You let out a sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d you say. \u201cAzure had to send the guests home and give the staff time off until the place is back in order. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth.\u201d Roxy lets out a sigh. \u201cI guess.\u201d She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, Azure, Felicia and Vernon have returned to their house in the city and Felicia is busy playing a video game while Azure is fixing herself a sandwich in the kitchen. \u201cHow long until the lodge is back in order, Mom?\u201d asks Felicia. Azure chops some salami before she answers her werejaguar daughter. \u201cIt will be 3 weeks,\u201d says the werecoyote giantess. \u201cBut at least Lydia came through with the money.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d says Vernon. \u201cIt\u2019s the least she can do after she and Helga let half the lodge burn down with their bickering. Things are really looking up.\u201d Azure nods her head before she starts to walk into the living room with her lunch. It was at that moment there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia puts her video game on pause and answers the door before giving a look of shock. \u201cUh... Mom.\u201d Into the room walked a policewomen. She was a red-furred and haired obese werecheetah woman with speckles all over her body.  \u201cIs there a problem officer?\u201d asks Azure. The policewoman lowers her sunglasses and glares at Azure. \u201cAzure and Vernon Skinwalker, you are under arrest for robbing the Terrordale 1st National Bank.\u201d Azure and Vernon give looks of shock as Felicia gasps and drops her game controller. \u201cThere has to be some sort of mistake,\u201d says Azure. \u201cI was nowhere near the bank.\u201d \u201cNo mistake,\u201d says the cheetah woman. \u201c100,000 skulls mysteriously disappeared from the bank and the Vulcan construction company reports that you paid the exact amount to them for reparations to the Grimmsly Lodge owner by you. In addition to the bank staff, your fingerprints were found all over the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure\u2019s eyes pop and she realizes what happened. \u201cGreat Wankatanka!\u201d Azure thinks to herself. \u201cLydia must\u2019ve robbed the bank. Note to self: when I get out of this, I\u2019m going to KILL that weasel. \u201cOfficer,\u201d says Felicia. \u201cThere\u2019s some mistake. My mom\u2019s no criminal. She wasn\u2019t anywhere near the bank.

Vernon was in the same cell and Azure gave a growl as a yellow-skinned hourglass-shaped manticore woman in a green prison staff outfit was outside. \"I'm telling you, Vice Warden,\" says Azure with a growl. \"I didn't rob the bank. One of my tenants did and tried to use stolen money to pay off her debt.\" The manticore gave a scoff. \"You must think I'm stupid. Like I haven't heard that excuse before.\" \"I want to see the actual warden.\" Complains Azure. The manticore shakes her head. \"No can do, Mrs. Skinwalker,\" she says. \"The warden is out sick with a cold. I'm the warden today and I don't believe you one bit.\" The vice warden then turns and licks her lips as she spots Vernon. \"And just in case your husband tries to escape, here's a fair warning; a lot of the staff and inmates love to nom on humans.\" The vice warden laughs wickedly and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn rage, Azure scratches the cell walls. \"Just wait'll I get my hands on that weasel! I'm going to murder her!\" Vernon blows in his wife's ear. \"We're already in enough trouble, Azure. Threatening to kill Lydia isn't going to help our case.\" Azure gives another growl before she sits down on her prison cot which breaks under her weight and leads to her prat falling. Azure rubs her behind in pain and growls to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Azure is in the prison cafeteria and looks at what passes for food in Under Gloom. She sniffs her tray and gags. \"What the heck is this gunk?\" asks Vernon. \"I've been eating monster food for 22 years and I've never seen anything so putrid looking.\" Azure gives a groan. \"Monster food is already unappetizing to humans as it is, so when it comes to prison food, they have to go the extra mile. This slop looks outright poisonous.\" It was at that moment another inmate sat down next to Azure. She was a centaur with the lower body of a quagga, dark skin and a garish looking face with her prison uniform reduced to a bra. She looked very interested in Azure who gave a growl at her. The centaur girl then looks at Vernon and licks her lips. \"Are you going to eat that human?\" Azure bites the centaur girl's hand as she reaches for Vernon and makes her scream in pain. The centaur blows on her hand before Azure growls again to tell her to back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, it's visiting hours and Felicia is visiting her mother in prison. \"I can't believe Lydia would stoop to bank robbery,\" says Felicia. \"Don't worry, Mom. Dad. I'll get you both out of this.\" \"I hope you're not planning to break us out, Felicia,\" says Azure. \"I don't want Lydia dragging you down either.\" Felicia gives a hopeful smile. \"Actually,\" she says. \"I hired a lawyer to spring you. She'll be over later.\" Vernon gives a gulp. \"Which lawyer?\" he asks in worry. Felicia gives a purr. \"Kate Rowling.\" \"Kate Rowling!?\" yells Azure. \"Hiring that harpy costs an arm and a leg!\" \"But she's good at what she does, Mom. She\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d Azure lets out a sigh. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she asks. \u201cI have nothing else left to lose. Besides, I can always beat the money out of Lydia\u2019s hide later. I just hope that she hurries. I don\u2019t like the looks of some of the inmates.\u201d Vernon gives a scoff. \u201cHow do you think I feel? That overweight hyena guard tried to eat me while I was locked in the jail cell.\u201d Azure just lets out a sigh. \u201cJust please try to keep what\u2019s left of Grimmsly Lodge in tact. Above all, Felicia, do NOT let any more inventors or sorceresses onto the premises. Try to limit the damage. Until I get out of this mess, you\u2019re in charge. Do not let ANYONE walk all over you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nFelicia nods her head. \u201cYes, Mom.\u201d Azure gives a somber look and kisses her daughter before visiting hours end and Felicia walks away. \u201cI sure hope Mrs. Rowling will be enough to get Mom and Dad out of the slammer.\u201d As Azure and Vernon were being walked away by the onryo serving as the temporary vice warden, Azure raises an eyebrow. \u201cHow exactly did the regular warden get sick?\u201d The onryo lets out a sigh. \u201cOne of our more troublesome inmates tried to escape when his cellmate was on garden duty. It rained that night and the warden spent hours chasing that creep. Her daughter always warned her that creep was ruining her health.\u201d Azure let out a sigh.<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nWe now cut to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: For more info on Kate Rowling, see Monster Cove)</span></div></div>",

You walk right to the front door, reasoning that Elisa was probably already outside. She was a monster called a bahamut, a creature you were certain only one exists. According to Arabian myth, it was a fish with a hippopotamus\u2019s head that supported the world while in Dungeons and Dragons Bahamut was a dragon. Elisa however combined the two viewpoints, being a hippo with a dragon\u2019s wings, and a fish\u2019s gills. She was also carnivorous but fortunately for you she didn\u2019t eat humans. You were actually scared of her when Roxy introduced you but you got used to Elisa fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out the front door, a strong cold wind blows past you and you hold onto yourself tight so as not to be blown away. But it wasn\u2019t the cold you had to worry about because you felt tremors, except they weren\u2019t as powerful as a monster\u2019s footsteps. There was something big coming forward, but this something big was something small compared to the monsters. The only thing it could possibly be was a dinosaur. While dinosaurs were extinct in the human world, they were very abundant in the monster world and were considered a delicacy. In fact, they were Elisa\u2019s favorite snack. But unfortunately the dinosaur right in front of you was a big tyrannosaurus rex and he looked hungry. The t-rex roars loudly and you scream as you\u2019re forced to run. Just your luck that the dinosaurs in the area somehow adapted to the cold. The tyrannosaurus snaps its jaws as it comes closer towards you and gains fast. And you just got away from Paisley season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it looks like the t-rex is going to grab you, it lets out a whimpering roar as something pulls it up into the air. You look up to see Elisa, your bahamut friend. Elisa licks her lips and opens her mouth wide before she drops the tyrannosaurus in her awaiting maw and swallows it whole. You tremble as you see a dinosaur shaped bulge travel struggling down her neck. While Elisa didn\u2019t eat humans, you were scared to death of the fact that she ate dinosaurs. It reminded you what kind of titans you were dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon swallowing that rex, Elisa rubs her fat stomach. \u201cTyrannosaurus, my favorite flavor. Thanks for treating me to breakfast Stephen.\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d you mutter. \u201cThanks for saving me. But do you have to eat those big dinosaurs in front of me?\u201d \u201cWould you rather I eat you instead?\u201d asks the dragon like fish hippo as she smiles and shows you her skyscraper sized teeth. \u201cUh no,\u201d you say. \u201cThat\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d Elisa lets out a loud laugh. \u201cJust kidding Stephen. You know I don\u2019t eat humans. No offense but you guys taste horrible.\u201d You let out a sigh of relief, thankful that you won\u2019t be Elisa\u2019s meal anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Elisa lowers a clawed finger for you to climb on before she places you gently in her scarf. \u201cCome on bite-sized,\u201d she says teasingly. \u201cTime for work. There\u2019re several new guests itching to hit the mountain.\u201d The hippo dragoness flaps her wings and you hold on tight to her scarf as she flies you away. It wasn\u2019t easy being a ski instructor to giant monster girls, but at least you had Elisa to help you. \u201cThere she is.\u201d The bahamut says. You both fly down and you look to see that your first ski student of the day is...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I'm not sure what kind of monster that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa flies down and you hang onto her scarf tight. A cold wind blows you off, but you grab onto the hippo dragon's hair to keep from blowing away. You definitely didn't want to end up like Fatima. As Elisa flies to the ground and sticks a landing, your hands slip and you have to grab hold of the tip of her tail before you slam into one of her titanic butt cheeks. Elisa feels this and reaches back to grab you. \"Will you stop fooling around?\" Elisa asks. \"Sorry,\" you say. \"But you're got more insulation than Roxy. I thought I'd be stuck.\" \"I'm part hippopotamus,\" says Elisa angrily. \"What do you expect? Oh, there's our... guest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery monster was wearing a lavender snowsuit that covered her entire body and she appeared to have mechanical legs attached to a harness on her body that were making those creaking noises. \"Huh?\" you ask. That's when the guest swings her tail and reveals it to be that of a purple tiger shark. \"Good day,\" says the guest in a familiar British accent. \"Stephen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you gasp as you see the guest's face. \"Paisley!?\" you yell. It was in fact Paisley, that mermaid giantess who tried to eat you all Summer. Just when you thought you were finally safe from that man-eater. \"Stephen?\" asks Elisa. \"You know this woman?\" You shiver and nod your head a few times. \"This is Paisley. That mermaid I told you about. Some idiot sold her a harness with mechanical legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaisley sneezes slightly into her hand. \"What dreadful weather. How does a fellow water breathing monster stand such an atrocity.\" Elisa inhales through her gills as you dive in and hide in your bahamut friend's cleavage. Elisa gives a slight glare at Paisley. \"Roxy warned me about you Paisley,\" she says. \"You better not try to eat Stephen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaisley gives a sinister smile and pretends to be serene. \"Oh, don't worry. I only came to learn how the land locked monsters have fun in such terrible conditions. Shall we start with the lessons. you give a glare because you still don't trust Paisley at all. Elisa shoves you further down her breasts to the point where all you can see are mountains of fat brown flesh. \"Right this way mermaid girl.\" Says Elisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver and try to stay right where you are because you know Paisley's gonna make a move on you when Elisa isn't looking.

She actually was rising from the ocean like a monster, and she gives a kiddish monster like roar, that the people clap and smile too, and in another area, there is Kari, who is relaxing on the beach with her 8 legs somehow standing the hold time. Guess there isn\u2019t a way for her to sit down easily. The two were bonding together at a beach nearby, and the people thankfully allowed them to be here. They are good icon stars, so what the heck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh... Sonia, you just love being a monster to those kids.\u201d Kari smiled and giggled just as Kari watches her little sister play with the little kids on the beach.

She stood at 100 feet tall, small for a monster, must have been a kid, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\"  she said politely, then she spotted you and her vision seemed to tunnel. \"My name's Siobhan\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si-bob-han?\" Elisa  said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female panda growled in annoyance, clearly used to having had to explain this quite a bit. \"It's pronounced Sheh-bahn for those two aren't familiar with it.\" she said with a shrug, not taking her eyes off you or even blinking. It was making you nervous, \"since mom was a banshee, I was given an Irish name. My FATHER was the werebear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?! She was a hybrid?! Well...that was nothing unusual. But China and Ireland...long distance relationship and unusual combination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoo-kayyy! Could she PLEASE stop staring at you!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...do you mind if we stop at the lodge, I'd kill for a steak right now.\" the pandaren asked. Would she PLEASE AT LEAST BLINK?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steak? Aren't pandarens vegetarians?\" your Bahamut co-worker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" Siobhan said. Her attention still not leaving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRIPS! She's a carnivore?! Was that why you were so firmly in her sights to where she was only just barely acknowledging Elisa's existence compared to you?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or rather, I <b>CAN'T</b>. I was born with a condition that makes it so my body only accepts meat, and to prove it, all you have to do is take a look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and you yelped in surprise, nearly falling off Elisa's scarf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly accept meat...no kidding! Siobhan had teeth like a mako shark!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned apologetic. \"Sorry, little one. Don't worry...I don't eat humans. Well...not the good ones, part of the condition is pretty odd: the lower their morals, the more compelled I am to eat them. Because of that, the Under Gloom warden wants to hire me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief, thank god for that! But now Elisa was looking confused. \"UNDER GLOOM?! How could the warden have the gall to hire you?! You're what? Twelve years old?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born September 7th, 1988. Malnourishment because my body can only accept one kind of food's made me short for my age.\" Siobhan growled, her fingers twitching dangerously. As though aiming to strangle someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Behemoth gulped and backed away nervously. \"Ahaha...my bad. Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat, \"Well, back to the matter at hand...you're hear to learn to ski, right?\" you said, aiming to get this hybrid's attention off your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the banshee/pandaren nodded, then went to get a pair of skis, then held out a paw-like hand for you to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you're the instructor, right? Let's go!\" she said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa looked miffed at the fact that the newbie wanted YOU to teach her, but you shrug and climb onto Siobhan's hand. Yeesh...! They were so warm, you actually considered ditching the winter-wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing you deep in her scarf and tightening it so that you think the only way you'd ever get loose would be if you snapped  in half, your new trainee wadded towards the bunny slopes, leaving Elisa standing where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready? I know it's not a sleigh ride, but we could have a good time, little guy!\" she purred, suddenly with a lustful tone as she started batting her eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could make sense of the crazy mood-change, Siobhan propelled herself forward and down the slope. The icy are making you push it out of your mind.    </span></div></div>",

Elisa at this time had returned to the lodge and was looking out the window to see the hybrid sliding down the hill and then shook her head before drinking some hot cocoa. \"Something bothering you, Elisa?\" asks Roxy as she bites into a sausage. \"I'm a little concerned about Siobhan asking Stephen alone to be her instructor. I'm not sure if I trust that carnivorous pandaren.\" Roxy shrugged her shoulders. \"She told you that she only eats bad humans. Stephen's no bad human. After all, there are a lot of monster girls who want him as their boyfriend.\" Roxy turned and pointed specifically to Felicia and Dinah who were waiting on tables behind her. \"Besides, she's only a newcomer. What harm can she do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiobhan was rushing down the mountain and laughing as you turn and see some large mountains that were covered in snow. \"Siobhan,\" you say. \"Be careful. Too many loud noises could set off an avalanche.\" But Siobhan just kept on giggling as she leaned forward. Her laughter makes your ears hurt which is only natural since she's half banshee. But as Siobhan keeps on laughing, the snow starts to rumble and you look to see that the snow was coming down faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Siobhan!\" you yell. \"What?!\" yells the pandaren somewhat irritably, unintentionally releasing a sonic blast that strikes the mountainside. Both of you stop and slowly slip down the slope as the snow begins to rumble and zoom down from the mountainside. \"Avalanche!\" both of you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow comes rushing down and Siobhan skis faster as you hold onto her tight. Elisa and Roxy see the snow coming down from the mountainside from the lodge window and look in horror. \"Good grief!\" yells Roxy. \"Oh no!\" yells Elisa. Both the gargoyle and bahamut run out and spread their wings. \"I am not letting Stephen become the next Fatima.\" Said Elisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Elisa and Roxy are flying off, you and Siobhan are going down faster as the snow keeps following you both. \"Faster!\" you yell as Siobhan keeps skiing.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the bahamut-girl slows to a stop, gently lowering herself to the ground with each flap of the wing, you climb out of the scarf somewhat to get a glimpse of who you'd be teaching today. It was always a good idea to know what you're dealing with when it comes to monster girls. Something about how they looked was usually a big enough clue as to what their thoughts on humans were, and if you would look like a bite size snack to them. You mostly avoid the werewolves, though. Although April was kind to you back at the beach, you've come to learn that werewolves being friendly to humans is...not a common trait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the rim of the scarf, though, you get a good glimpse of the monster you were dealing with, but aren't entirely sure what you were looking at. It looked kind of like a rabbit, but with horns? That can't be right. Unfortunately, as you lean even closer over the edge to take her in, Elisa touches down with a thud, and, expecting you to be contained snugly inside her scarf, didn't bother to make sure you wouldn't go flying forward. Which is exactly what you did. You let out a yell as you fall forward a hundred feet or two infront of Elisa, landing in the thick monster snow with a thud. Standing upright and brushing it off, you look up to see Elisa walking over you to greet the monster. Crap. Didn't she see you fall out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort, due to your body sinking down a couple feet in the snow as you try to walk, you make your way around the bahamut, about to yell at her to pick you up, when you stop and look towards the monster you're going to be training, deciding that now would be as good of a time as ever to get acquainted with the sight of her. Your previous thoughts were now confirmed; she was some kind of monster you've never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong legs and drooping ears, along with the poofy tail, nearly made you brush it off as a were-rabbit, but the horns on her head proved this to not be the case. You thought about it. You know that this kind of monster had a name of some kind, but names failed you at the moment. You'll remember it later, probably. Either way, you get another good look at her as Elisa and this girl talk about...whatever they're talking about. This woman is, unlike the vast majority of monsters you've seen, rather petite. She was quite clearly an adult, but her body shape was deceiving. Aside from her legs, which you guessed were full of muscle after years of jumping, her frame was rather thin, and concealed inside a thick winter jacket and matching pants. You wondered why a creature covered in fur would need such a warm coat, but her fur didn't look particularly thick, and probably didn't help all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and here's my partner now!\" said Elisa, stealing your attention as you look towards the bahamut. She's prying open the scarf to show you to this girl! \"I know you might not have expected to see a human working with me, but...Stephen?\" she asks, looking concerned as she doesn't find you between herself and the scarf. \"Stephen, where did you do?\" \"Elisa! I'm over here!\" you yell, and the bahamut looks even more confused, looking around her body to find you, as if you're stowed away on her and she just hasn't spotted you. The rabbit(?) woman, however, spots you instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a yelp as she reaches down, grabbing you with furred fingers and hoisting you into the air. You feel momentarily sick as she lifts you up faster then you expected, before suddenly stopping and unfurling her hand, holding you above her face in what looks like awe. Her face was very animalistic, and very much resembled a rabbits, aside from a few minor human-like traits such as feminine eyebrows and a more human-like mouth, though still very rabbit-like. You're honestly terrified. You had no idea if this thing was a human eater or not. And now, you were at her mercy. She didn't seem to regard you as food, though. She just looked curious, moving her hand around and eyeing you up and down. \"Wow... I never thought I'd see one so close!\" she muttered, and it hit you. This was the girl's first time seeing a human. She looked to be an adult, though, so that was very curious. How could a monster <i>not</i> have seen a human, given how often they're devoured in the monster world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacky, could I have him back?\" says Elisa, and, reluctantly, 'Jacky' gives hands you off to the bahamut again, and she sets you back down near her scarf, only you hold on tighter this time. \"Stephen, this is Jacky the Jackalope. Jacky, this is Stephen. He's my partner.\" You look over at Jacky and she gives a nervous smile. This girl had clearly never seen a human before, so in the interest of giving her the right idea about your species, you offer your hand out for her to shake. \"Hello, Jacky. My name's Stephen. Nice to meet you.\" She extends her hand to shake back, but quickly realizing that it wouldn't work, she touches your hand with her pinky finger, still larger than you, and tries her best to shake. You look up at Elisa, who only smiles in response. Jacky seemed kind towards you...but mostly ignorant about humans. You now wanted to leave a good impression on her, so that way she'd be able to help out other humans in the future, and not, well, eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacky and Elisa prepare for the snowboarding lessons, of which are Jacky's first, you decide you should strike up a conversation with Jacky. Maybe she'd feel a little less apprehensive to talk to you if you warmed up to her. She already seemed to like you, but was still curious, glancing at you often while she and Elisa talked. Your goal was to make sure this girl got a good idea of how good humanity can be, and not how tasty it can be. So, as the lessons have nearly begun, you begin to talk to the Jackalope...</span></div></div>",

You liked Azure. She was just like Fran in that she was friendly to humans. But she went farther than Fran because she actually married a human. Even though she and Vernon have been together for 25 years now, you wonder how they made it work seeing as she was 140 times bigger than than he was and she was a monster species that normally eats humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk under the door to Azure\u2019s office and saw the stairway up to her desk. She installed it so Vernon could get around without getting stepped on. You walk up the stairs to see Vernon was already there painting his giant wife\u2019s fingernails. \u201cHey Stephen,\u201d Vernon says. \u201cHow\u2019s life treating you?\u201d \u201cFine Vernon. Good morning Azure.\u201d Azure turns her head and looks down on you with a smile. \u201cGood morning Stephen. On time as always. No wonder Roxy recommended you.\u201d You give a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVernon then lets out a grunt as Azure grabs him by the shirt. \u201cThat\u2019s enough for now Dear. Stephen and I have to talk.\u201d Azure stretches out the front of her pants before she places Vernon gently inside and snaps them back. Azure giggles as her husband struggles and tickles her. Then she begins to moan in ecstasy and you look in slight disgust. Was this really the right time for them to be doing that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to see me Azure. Am I in trouble.\u201d Azure lets out a laugh but you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from you asking her the question or her husband tickling her. \u201cFar from it Stephen. I just noticed you\u2019ve been helping Roxy and Elisa out a lot.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing. They\u2019ve got two of the most important jobs at the resort. Uh, after you of course boss.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d says Azure with a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re working too hard with those two. Maybe you need a change of pace. I have a different job for you today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross your fingers and hope with all your might that she\u2019s assigning you to help Connie as a tour guide. You said you were going to summon the courage to ask the naga giantess on a date all Summer but you blew it and never got around to it. This could be a second chance. You\u2019d really like Connie to be your girlfriend one of these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though Connie was a coworker and not just a guest in the winter time, you had other things you could be doing. There was another coworker named Ripple, a three headed cerberus with a head for rage, sorrow and joy. But the heads kept shifting which one controlled her body and the three contrasting personalities made her very dangerous. Of course, Azure would never intentionally put you in harm\u2019s way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe you\u2019d be assigned to check on the boarders. There were two monsters who rented the rooms below Grimmsly Lodge. First was Helga, the daughter of Fran, your boss at your Summer job. Helga was an inventor and the smartest monster you knew. It made you wonder how someone like Fran could\u2019ve possibly given birth to her. The other boarder was a capricious kamaitachi weasel sorceress named Lydia. Lydia and Helga hated each other and were usually feuding over something stupid. For neighbors they didn\u2019t get along well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen last would be a problem that wasn\u2019t even a coworker (anymore). Fatima, the Wraith of the last human who worked at the lodge. She was blown away in a snowstorm and froze to death before anyone could find her. It was nobody\u2019s fault, but she doesn\u2019t realize that Azure, Elisa and Roxy searched everywhere to find her. That ghost monster thinks her friends abandoned her and she plays mean practical jokes and causes trouble in the lodge for revenge. Usually, you have to pacify that big undead baby and it\u2019s never any fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Azure,\u201d you say. \u201cWhat\u2019s my job for today?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Why did Azure have to do that with Vernon in plain view of you? Sure he was hidden in her pants... but still, it's indecent. You clear your throat to remind Azure of why she called you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says your werecoyote boss as she starts to sweat. \"Stephen, I want you to be careful for today's assignment. You're going to be working with Ripple in the kitchen today. She's preparing some difficult dishes today I suggested for the guests. Stegosaurus pot pie, millipede stir fry...\" You gag and hold your mouth. \"One of these days,\" you say. \"I've got to get used to monster food one of these days.\" That's when Azure looks at you sternly. \"Be on high alert. You know how unstable that cerberus is. I don't want to see you hurt or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately salute Azure and go down the stairs to leave her to the husband in her underwear. You were used to talking to multiple headed monsters due to your experiences with Laura, the four headed hydra scuba diver in the Summer. But Ripple wasn't like most three headed monsters. All three of her heads had incompatible personalities that matched the highlights in their hair. The left head dubbed Ripple Yellow was always happy and excited while the right head, Ripple Blue, is a pessimistic crybaby who only looks on the dark side. The most dangerous head was in the center and called Ripple Red. Ripple Red was constantly pissed off and highly aggressive. Unlike Ripple Yellow and Blue, the middle head is a predator who eats humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat makes the heads scarier is that they take turns controlling the body and they switch at random. But you're almost there. You walk into the Grimmsly Cafe, momentarily hiding behind a barstool as that human eating loxodon Elektra walks by with her trunk in the air. As Elektra stops to sniff the air, you make a run for the kitchen and roll under the door before you let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smell the air and recognize the sent of brachiosaurus sausage before looking up to see Ripple's well muscular back as she's working on the grill. \"Hi Ripple!\" you yell up. \"Good morning!\" Ripple begins to turn around, but which of the cerberus chef's heads is in control of the body today?</span></div></div>",

The device had a spiral shape in the center of what looked like a planetary grid. As Helga was making some adjustments to what looked like a handheld, oversized motherboard-like device, you look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were machines of all sorts that looked too complicated to even guess what they were supposed to do along with a large master computer with several monitors that looked linked together. There was even a machine that looked similar to Iron Man's armor, albeit distinctively more troll shaped and colored red, green and black. Helga was very good with tools and gadgets and spoke perfect English. That made it unbelievable that she was the daughter of your other boss, Fran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fran was as friendly as Azure was, the troll from the beach was just plain stupid to the point of speaking like the Hulk before later cartoons started portraying him smarter. Fran was barely one step ahead of a caveman. But Helga on the other hand was the smartest monster you knew. How a smart cookie like Helga could've been given birth by a bunt cake like Fran was beyond you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" said Fran. \"And done. Stephen, that machine you are standing on right now, is in fact a teleported that I've been working on in order to help you better move around the lodge without having to worry about predators like Elektra and Comet or rely on Elisa or Roxy to carry you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it work?\" you ask. Helga bent down and showed you the motherboard-like device that was beeping in her hands. \"I still have to install the other teleportation pads but this handheld control will allow you to be zapped anywhere in the hotel. Of course, it would only work if you're on the teleportation pad when it activates.\" You smile. That would save you a lot of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so you thought, because at that moment, without even warning, Fatima appears above you and lets out a shriek. Helga screams in response and drops the control panel. This caused it to break and unfortunately for you, it activated the teleportation pad and you let out a scream as the transporter broke you down into particles before zapping them away to reconstruct you elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fatima faded away laughing, Helga gasps. \"Oh no!\" she yelled. \"This is terrible. By my calculations, Stephen has been teleported to the other side of Mons Terra.\" Helga wasn't kidding. You had been teleported to a far, far away city in a part of the monster world you had never even knew existed. Where are you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Here, I want writers to make up their own monster location and describe the area around it)</span></div></div>",

You are immediately assaulted by the cold and start shivering. You start walking but have no idea where you are going. You don't know where this place is but you know Helga's machine probably had a hand in sending you here. Looking around you see that the buildings have a Victorian style to them. You decide to get inside one of them and warm up so you turn toward the closest one. As you approach it you suddenly feel a huge presence bearing down on you and turn in time to see a giant set of talons coming from above. They land on the ground and you find yourself wedged in between two of them. Looking up you see that they belong to a chubby harpy girl with blue feathers and average sized breasts. She's wearing a white blouse and a black skirt that reaches down to the point where her bird legs begin. Her hair is blue like her feathers and is short and very straight. She walks forward and enters the building, taking you with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the building you feel much better. The heat from her talons and the warmth from being inside feel great. You don't know if this girl is friendly or not but you need some help. You begin knocking on her talons hoping she'll feel you. You succeed and she looks down. When she sees you her eyes widen and her hair raises a little bit. \"A human?\" she says and reaches down to pick you from her foot. \"Hello there.\" she says politely. You hear that she has a British accent. \"Hi there my name is Stephen.\" you say. \"I hate to ask but I'm in sort of a bind and could use some help.\" she smiles and pats your head. \"Of course, I'll help any way I can. My name is Jaylene\" This girl is very polite. You're glad she's the first person you met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you hear someone else coming and see a huge werewolf girl with pure white fur and long flowing black hair. She's got an hourglass figure and is wearing some sort of dark purple gown with long sleeves. Although it doesn't really show any of her fur you can tell her boobs are fairly large. She passes by and glances at you in Jaylene's hand. She stops and leans forward to give you a sniff. You don't know what she's doing but then she walks away. \"Are you planning to eat that?\" she asks Jaylene. \"Of course not!\" your new friend answers. \"He's lost and needs help!\" The wolfess heads into another room while Jaylene follows. \"Good, he doesn't seem to be of good quality.\" You don't know whether you should feel relieved that you're not going to be eaten or insulted. \"This is Snow Howler.\" Jaylene tells you. She likes to eat humans but only those she deems acceptable.\" You nod and look around to see you're in what appears to be a sitting room. Like the outside this place gives off a Victorian era feel. Even the way the two girls are dressed seems that way, and Snow has  British accent like Jaylene. \"Excuse me.\" you call up. \"But what is this city called?\" Jaylene blinks and tilts her head. \"Why this is Chillingham.\" she answers. Chillingham? You've never even heard of it, but it gives an obvious British feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow pours herself a cup of tea as well as one for for Jaylene. Then you hear rumbling and another monster enters. This one is a sort of Frankenstein monster. She's pear shaped and her skin is slightly green. You can see stitches in various places where her different parts were sewn together. She has wavy red hair reaching her back and her chest is big, but her hips are bigger by comparison. She's wearing a tight button up shirt and a long skirt, and there are two . \"Hello everyone!\" she says as she enters. When she sees you she leans in quickly and studies you intently. \"Jaylene, where did you find this human?\" she asks. \"Just outside, he's lost and needs help.\" Jaylene answers. The new girl grabs you and holds you up to her huge face. \"My name is Mary and I'd be glad to help you! You can stay in my room with me and we can get to know each other better!\" she says. You are gently snatched away by Jaylene. \"Mary is a bit of romantic.\" she explains. Mary folds her arms. \"That may be, but I can just tell he's special!\" You roll your eyes. You're actually used to this kind of thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl enters next but this one doesn't make any stomping sounds. Thats because she slithers in on a giant black snake tail. She's a naga like Connie and has light skin with shoulder length brown hair. She's quite fat but is pretty attractive. She's wearing a tight shirt like Mary. As she gets closer she spots you and smiles. \"Would you be willing to share that little morsel?\" she asks Jaylene. \"No, Addy, I'm helping him!\" Jaylene says protectively. \"Well maybe I'll help myself to him later.\" the naga tells her while eying you hungrily. You were kind of hoping she'd be friendly like Connie but you can't win every time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls all get settled and relaxed a huge vampire woman comes in the room. She's taller than the others and has purple skin with long black hair. She's got a voluptuous figure with huge breasts and hips. \"Hello girls!\" she says cheerily. \"Hello Miss Tu!\" the girls answer in unison. \"I trust your day is going well!\" she asks as she pours herself a cup of tea. \"Yes, I can't really complain.\" Snow says as she sips her tea. \"Yes, and I found my soul mate!\" Mary tells the vampire. Miss Tu smiles. \"Really? What is he like?\" she asks. \"Just see for yourself! Jaylene has him!\" Mary answers. Looking over Miss Tu sees you and stands up quickly. \"A human?\" she says as she walks over. \"What is someone as small as you doing here?\" she asks. Realizing you haven't actually explained yet you tell everyone your story. \"Terrordale?\" Miss Tu says. \"Thats practically on the other side of Mons Terra!\" Just great. \"My relative April lives in Terrordale.\" Snow says matter of factly. She's related to April? Compared to her cousin Snow is a bit snooty. \"Can he stay here for now?\" Jaylene asks. \"Now you know this is a women only boarding house.\" Miss Tu tells her. \"He's just a human! He won't cause any trouble!\" the harpy pleads. What is Miss Tu's decision?</span></div></div>",

He can stay with me in my room!\" Mary cheers as she grabs you. She hugs you to one of her boobs and smothers you for a second before you are grabbed by Miss Tu. \"I think it would be best if he stayed with Jaylene.\" the massive vampire says. As she holds you you catch a glimpse of her massive cleavage and she gives you look. You turn away quickly but she shakes her head with a smile. Mary lets out a groan as you are handed back to Jaylene. Addy is giving you a hungry look while Snow doesn't seem to care at all. \"Can I just spend a little time with him?\" Mary pleads. \"Lets give him some time to get settled first.\" Jaylene says and walks toward the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy climbs the stairs and you catch one last wink from Mary as you go with her. When she reaches her room she enters and you look around. It seems pretty simple and is very tidy. Makes sense given her polite nature. She sets you down on her dresser and begins going through the drawers. \"So are there any more girls living here?\" you ask. \"Oh yes. Jaylene answers. \"There are quite a few, and Miss Tu looks out for us all. She's been around for a while.\" Thats very likely. Even though monsters age differently in general, vampires tend to live a long time. \"Sorry about Addy though. Just try to keep away from her.\" she warns . \"Don't worry, I'm used to being around monsters. I still think its lucky that Snow doesn't think I'm good enough to eat.\" you tell her. She pulls a shirt from her dresser and looks at you. \"By the way, do you know her cousin?\" she asks. You rub the back of your head and sigh. \"Yeah...April is kind of in love with me.\" you admit. Jaylene has to stifle a laugh. \"Really? From what I've heard, she doesn't eat humans but I didn't think she'd be in love with one.\" You shrug your shoulders. \"It happens more than you think.\" you say, thinking about all the girls who are after you, including the Frankenstein you just met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaylene makes the shirt she got out up into a little bed for you and places it on her bedside table. \"You can sleep here.\" she says and places you in it. \"Thanks.\" you tell her. You didn't even realize how late it was until she just said that. You begin to get comfy and notice that she's started to undress. She has her blouse off when she turns to face you. Her hair flies up and her face goes red. \"I'm sorry! I can't believe I already forgot about you!\" she stammers and rushes into the bathroom, grabbing her night clothes. When she comes out she's ready for bed, but her face is still flushed. \"I'm just used to being alone in here.\" she says as she lays down for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a night's sleep you wake up and look toward Jaylene. She's still asleep so you decide to get out and explore. At first you hesitate, but its not like you've never been around a bunch of monsters girls before. You jump from the table to her bed and are greeted by her huge sleeping face. You look up at her and notice that she's quite pretty. Then her sleep breathing knocks you onto your butt and you decide to get going. You climb down her bed and make your way to the door. You slip under it and venture out into the hall. You walk for a bit and then a huge rumbling starts. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

When she spots you she walks back over. \"Yes?\" she asks, standing over you. You look straight up at her, with her boobs partially obscuring her face. \"Do you think you could give me a lift?\" you ask. The white wolfess sighs. \"I suppose.\" she says and bends down, offering you a paw. You climb aboard and she carries you down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is April?\" Snow asks as she enters the sitting room. \"Oh she's great!\" you answer. \"She's just about the sweetest girl and is usually in a good mood.\" Snow nods and smiles. \"Her trinket shop is doing well too.\" you say. \"Her stuff is really popular with the beach goers and tourists. She's pretty successful I'd say.\" Snow nods again. \"Well an artistic streak does run in the Howler family.\" she tells you. \"I myself am quite adept at sewing.\" You look up at her interested. \"Can I see some of your work?\" you ask. Snow points over at a tapestry on the wall. \"Thats one of mine.\" she says. The tapestry is incredible. It depicts a giant bat over a building that looks like the one you're in. The detail is amazing. The building looks so real, and there are even leaves blowing in the night air as well as a full moon. \"I made that in gratitude for Miss Tu.

I mean, she's very nice and sweet but I-\" Snow cuts you off. \"Don't worry, I expected as much. April is a bit of a romantic and often talks about her true love. She's told many of our pack about it.\" You're relieved that she's not holding it against you. She walks back over with a tea set and pours herself a cup, then spoons a tiny bit onto a saucer. She lifts you onto the saucer near the puddle of tea. \"I apologize, but I couldn't find any human sized cups.\" she says. \"Its fine, you say and sip the tea on your knees. \"Its good.\" you tell her. Snow reaches down and scratches your head, like your some kind of pet. \"I know you don't have romantic feelings for April, but I wish for her happiness. She's not the type to give up.\" Looks like Snow is being nice to you because April is in love with you. She might seem a bit snooty, but she really is a nice girl. Next...</span></div></div>",

You weren't even sure what you were up against or if this new monster was friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope for the best. The shadow looks obese but still humanoid and appears to have wings of some kind. You're really hoping that it's a gargoyle like Roxy and cross your fingers. Aside from Eartha from the KDP at the beach where you worked in the summer, all gargoyles you knew were harmless to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look up and see just what kind of monster this girl was and she didn't look like any species you've seen. She had bright teal-colored skin and from the looks of it, she also had long hair, the color of the rainbow reaching down to her monumental ass. From the looks of it, she was the same height and weight as Roxy. You look closer to see that the girl had a strange and hollow horn shaped membrane growing out of the center of her face and a pair of transparent insect like wings with thick spiky membranes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it, this new giantess was wearing a red and black colored bikini that exposed her large belly and appeared to be slightly lose, as if she had taken it off earlier. She also appeared to have claws for fingers and toes. She looked like a fairy but she didn't resemble a pixie like Stella or even a spriggan like Eunice. You then see the girl yawn and reveal that not only did she have a forked tongue but she also closed her eyes <i>vertically</i>. You had never seen a girl like her. She must've been a species exclusive to this side of a monster girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mab damn it,\" says this girl. \"Working my big bum off at the Xanadu nightclub as a hood ornament with the rest of the plus sized faes. My hips are tired. Sometimes a changeling just can't rest.\" Changeling? Those creatures fae folk substituted for human children according to some sources. That was what a changeling looked like? You didn't think fairies were supposed to get that fat. Wait, she said she worked at a nightclub? This woman must've been an exotic dancer or even... Holy Cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changeling woman rubbed her stomach and let out a yawn. \"I wonder what I've got left in the fridge,\" the fairy giantess says. \"Maybe I'll dig into that pizza I've had for a while.\" The changeling woman reached into her G-cup cleavage to get her house keys, but the fat fairy dropped her keys and let out a groan.The keys fall near you and the changeling woman bends down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changeling reaches for her keys but picks you up as you grunt. From the look on her face, she did not expect to see a human walking down the hallway. \"A human?\" the changeling asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hope that this changeling was friendly towards humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grunt right before she opens the door to her room in the boarding house. You couldn't move. Between the fat in her breasts and her soft belly, the changeling's body felt like a planet of pudding. She was in Roxy's weight class alright. You sink in the changeling's cleavage as you heard strange sounds, as if there was the sounds of moving in a kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before the fairy giantess reaches into her cleavage and yanks you out as you groan and then she drops you on a kitchen table and from the looks of it, she has at least four boxes of leftover pizza stacked and was already stuffing her face. \"We don't see an awful lot of humans around these parts,\" says the changeling woman. \"If you weren't so puny, I might've considered eating you.\" You step back nervously as the changeling proceeds to swallow another slice of pizza. \"Who are you and why are you here?\" the giantess asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Stephen. I'm a friend of Jaylene's. I'm staying with her. I was kinda zapped here from Terrordale.\" \"Terrordale?\" asks the changeling as she throws away the empty pizza box on the top of the stack. \"That's on the other side of the globe.\" The changeling then opens the next box and eats the pizza inside. Yeesh, no wonder she was so fat. \"So, I get it. The girls volunteered to keep you while you figure out how to get back to Terrordale. I'm Tanya by the way.\" You stare at Tanya as she continues to eat pizza. \"What?\" \"I-I've never seen a changeling before.\" Tanya lets out a belch before answering you. \"That's because changelings don't go to Terrordale. We only live on this side of the monster world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tanya moves to the third pizza box. \"I'm sorry,\" you say. \"It's just I never had much luck with the fae race back home. There's this fairy I know named Stella and she's a total jerk.\" Tanya lets out a scoff as she eats more of her pizza. \"That's how fairies are,\" she said. \"Most of us get great pleasure out of playing tricks on humans.\" \"Well, I also know a spriggan named Eunice.\" \"My best friend is a spriggan.\" Says Tanya as she licks pizza sauce off her cheek with her elongated tongue. \"Well,\" you say. \"Eunice is kinda... in a mental hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" says Tanya before she belches again. \"Any other fairies you know?\" \"Well, I know a mother and daughter pair of trolls. One of them is my boss at my summer job, her name is Fran. She's real sweet, if not very bright.\" Tanya lets out a laugh. \"Honey,\" she says. \"Trolls and bright go together like peanut butter and ketchup and I know from experience.\" \"That's not true,\" you say. \"In fact, Fran's daughter, Helga, built the machine that zapped me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya scoffed and then moved onto her fourth box of pizza. \"No wonder you got zapped if a troll built the machine.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"That's it, I guess. Uh, you mentioned you were coming back from Xanadu?\" \"My shift just ended,\" says Tanya as she taps her oversized stomach. \"It's a nightclub for monster men... and sometimes women... to gawk at SSBBW fairies, elves, spriggans, all manners of the fair folk shake their hips and get a little more action behind the scenes, for a price.\" You blink your eyes just as Tanya cleans off her last box of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was interesting to hear.\" You say as Tanya gives you a smirk. \"You know,\" she said. \"I know a certain six women of assorted fae species who would love to get their hands on you.\"</span></div></div>",

And now Mary's after me.\" Tanya lets out a laugh that fills you with dread. \"She has good taste and I have a great idea. I'm off the clock now, but I think I can arrange something.\" You're suddenly very afraid. Before you can protest, Tanya shoves you back down her cleavage as you grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changeling then takes off and you find yourself sinking deeper and deeper beneath the fairy giantess's fleshy boobs. They're as thick and fatty as Roxy's back home. You're guessing that Tanya was the exact same weight as your gargoyle friend, except unlike Roxy, she seemed proud of it. You see that it is snowing outside, which makes you wonder why Tanya is only wearing that skimpy bikini. Then you look out and you start to hear loud celtic-style symphonic music playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see what appears to be a medieval-themed nightclub with a neon sign reading \"XANADU\". This must be the nightclub that Tanya looked at. As Tanya was walking around the building, you look inside in surprise. Inside there were three pole dancers on the stage who looked just as tall and obese as the changeling you had just met. First of them was a dark black skinned drow girl with long silver hair and a purple patch over her left eye as well as spider web tattoos on her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the drow girl was a dark yellowish-tan skinned and freckled leprechaun woman with bright green eyes and a golden-red hair reaching down to her massive ass. The leprechaun blew a kiss to a minotaur who was looking her way. In the center was an obese spriggan girl whose skin was bright pink on one side of her body but sparkling white on the other side. Her hair was even split colored light blue and pink and she let out a laugh as she shook her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight club? This looked more like a brothel. Tanya walks into the back entrance and you see three more giantess exotic dancers. One of them was a bright yellow-green giantess resembling a humanoid bulldog. She was a Cu Sith, a canine fairy. Next to her was a bright aqua skinned gremlin girl who appeared to be wearing an orange colored fedora that matched her magenta colored hair. Her devil's tail was swinging as she applied makeup. The last of the giantesses was a red-orange-skinned giantess with crimson hair as bright red as blood. From her hair and her hundreds of teeth, she was a redcap. All of these giantesses are just as tall and fat as Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cu Sith giantess turns around and looks in surprise. \"Tanya,\" she says. \"Back so soon? I thought you were done for the night.\" \"The night's just getting started, Regina.\" Regina just raises an eyebrow before the spriggan girl walks back with the leprechaun and drow by her side. \"It sounds to me like you found someone fun, Tanya,\" says the spriggan in a British accent. \"Doesn't it Lola? Gilda?\" The leprechaun giantess lets out a laugh. \"That's a laugh. But it would be a nice change of pace from the usual lads that come into this place.\" Lola, the drow, just lets out a giggle. The gremlin and redcap are the last to look forward. \"Well,\" says the spriggan. \"Why are you here, Tanya.\" \"Believe me, Hildy,\" says Tanya. \"You won't be disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smiles and then she digs into her cleavage to pull you out and suddenly all the giantesses gasp and smile uncontrollably. \"A human?!\" yells Hildy, the spriggan girl. \"Let me at him!\" yells the gremlin in the fedora. \"I can't wait to shove him up...\" \"Get lost, Ginnie,\" says the redcap. \"I haven't had sex with a human for fifty years.\" Gilda, the leprechaun pushes the redcap to the side. \"Don't be so stingy, Crimson,\" she says right before she shakes her oversized breasts in your face. \"Like what you see you wee human?\" Lola, the drow giantess just shakes her large rear in your face and blows a kiss. Regina, the Cu Sith smirks and you see the lust in her bulldog-like face and Hildy slaps her hips. \"What do you say, Love? Normally we'd charge money, but humans get in for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, girls,\" says Tanya. \"Let's just show him a good time. Line up.\" You were biting your nails. This was like six Aprils in the same room.\" On the left side of the room, Ginnie the gremlin, Crimson the redcap and Hildy the spriggan stare at you as Hildy even starts to lower her bikini top. You then look to the right to see Gilda the leprechaun, Regina the Cu Sith and Lola the drow all licking their lips in lust and twerking your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.... M... G..\" Is all you can mutter. So which girls do you choose first?</span></div></div>",

You have a soft landing and look up to see two huge fleshy walls. You've landed in someone's cleavage. Judging from the fat that one breast is white and the other is pink, it must be Hildy, the spriggan. She looking down at you with a grin and licks her lips. \"Well hello there cutie.\" she says, then promptly begins massaging her boobs together. \"Mmm...\" she murmurs. \"Hey share him!\" Ginnie says. \"Sorry, its just so good!\" Hildy tells her. \"Just knowing its a human makes it feel soo much better, and he's especially cute!\" As she continues to play with her boobs you try to gain some bearings. You grab a handful of boobflesh and Hildy gasps and giggles intensely at your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, its my turn!\" someone says and grabs you from Hildy's cleavage. Soon your looking into the face of Crimson the redcap. Her hair is the color of blood and looks wild. \"Come here little guy.\" she says and gives you a kiss. After the smooch she gives you a big smile, showing all of her razor teeth. She holds you over to her hair and tells you to grab on. \"Now hold on tight.\" she says. She then begins dancing, starting slow at first but then speeding up. Her hair swishes about, rubbing you along her shoulders or breasts every now and then. She dances faster and her hair begins to flail around. You are beginning to slap against her boobs now, apparently pleasing her. Each time you collide with one of her tits she moans a little. This goes on until she grabs the lock of hair you're on and holds it against her boob. She holds you there, relishing the feeling of you on her body. \"Oh yeah...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your position smushed against Crimson's boob you hear another girl. \"All right, hand him over.\" she says. It must be Ginnie. The next thing you know you're being handed over to the aqua skinned gremlin girl. She immediately holds you in front of her chest. You're staring at her giant boobs when something pokes you. It turns out to be her tail. \"Okay, grab on.\" she says, prodding you with its pointy tip. You follow her advice and latch on. Her tail moves behind her and starts swishing slowly. Ginnie has control over it so its not so bad. You find yourself being rubbed against her back before moving lower. Now you're on her ass, being sensually slapped against each cheek. Next she inserts you between, into her crack. Inside you see her thong as she smushes her ass cheeks together. They're big and soft, jiggling with every move. The whole time Ginnie's tail has been doing this, she's been feeling herself up. That's what you call multi-tasking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ginnie's turn over she brings you to her front side and grabs you from her tail. \"Come on girls.\" she says. The three of them move closer together and press their boobs against each other as Ginnie drops you. You land in the waiting group of boobs with a bounce. They do their best to grind you in there until your time is up. You're assaulted from all sides by soft fleshy walls of different colors. Blue, orange, pink, white, and it feels great. When its over Hildy holds you up and you see the remaining girls waiting for you.</span></div></div>",

You look down at her mouth and shut your eyes, preparing for the worst. Suddenly you hear a voice call out. \"Stop right there!\" You open your eyes in surprise and see that you're still alive. The changeling is still holding on to you, probably surprised at the outburst as well. You look around and see the one who called out behind her. Its a violet skinned gargoyle. She looks 1000 feet tall and is heavyset, though not as much as Roxy. On her head are two horns curved downward, like a bull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle marches forward and looks down on the changeling with her arms folded. You notice that her outfit looks like a police uniform. \"Alright Tanya, hand him over.\" The gargoyle says with her hand out. \"Oh bugger off Theda. I found him so I'm eating him.\" The changeling, who you now know is Tanya, says. Theda puts a claw on her shoulder and grips tightly. The changeling groans and reluctantly drops you into the other waiting palm of the gargoyle. \"Spoil sport.\" she grumbles as she walks away. \"Thats my job!\" Theda calls after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour savior turns her attention to you. \"You okay little guy?\" she asks. Her accent is a bit thicker than the others you've heard. \"Yeah.\" you say with relief. You were hoping to meet a gargoyle, and unsurprisingly she's a cop. \"Thanks for saving me. My name's Stephen.\" She offers a claw, which you shake and introduces herself. \"Constable Theda at your service! Always happy to help! But what is a human like you doing here?\" she says.

Certainly it was far far far away from where you are working, but what you didn\u2019t expected is where you ended up. After taking a few moments to wake yourself up, you started to look around at your surroundings. You are of course smaller than anything around here, but what you are surprised to notice around the area is that it is all in Japanese language. You had no clue at all what Japanese is, other than seeing a few monsters or whatever in the longue from time to time that are like monsters from the Japan era, or more specifically the Edo era. The city looks to be modern, with railway stations, big natural buildings, and all the other good stuff, but what you didn\u2019t expected was to see that it also looks so ancient at the same time. The temples were that from the Edo period, where it looks like a master house, but it looks a little bit more modern, but essentially it is like a mixed of both worlds here. \u201cWow, this looks so beautiful here. I wish I can go exploring a bit in it.\u201d you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis city is just amazing, Neo Monstoyko could be where I am living next for sure. (not the best name but it will suit for)?\u201d said by an unknown voice just as a whole group of monsters come by. Surprisingly, you notice to see that they are glorious, but also pack in a lot of weight as well, but you cannot get your eyes off of them at this moment. \u201cSo this is Neo Monstoyko, a monster world version of Tokyo, Japan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the BBW girls that you see is an angel like girl, but she is oriental unlike the angel that you would normally envision in your head. She still has two big white rings, but pretty much everything you are seeing of her is white all the way down to her clothes. She seems to be around normal height for a girl in the monster world, give or take 500-700ft tall, but you did notice to see that the angel has no face at all and is covered in a hood, and the only thing you see inside the hood is some eyes. \u201cYou are so good Hiyuki in terms of your appearance.\u201d Said by another girl in the group, and now you known the angel is Hiyuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second of the girls is a red big overweight but glorious salamander dragon who\u2019s flames are black like the dark fire itself. You can see in her red eyes that she has some sort of a contest like feel in that gal as she looks at Hiyuki a bit fiercely. \u201cOh yeah, let\u2019s see what the audience will think of you when Sayuki, the salamander flames up the whole contest with her body.\u201d Sayuki said to Hiyuki as if she has a fierce rivalry with her. This might be getting interesting as you hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, a rivalry is not the best thing to have in a group like this. Why not we all just go and have some fun.\u201d said by the big black dragon that moves in a funny way. All Chinese dragons do that all the time, and from the tone of her voice. She seems to be the wisest of all. \u201cAfter all, I Soyuko know that is for sure.\u201d The red Chinese dragon is all fancy on her decoration as a dragon, with the teeth and everything, and it even moves funny as well. However all 3 of them have a repulsed smell and even you do to the point where you gone into hiding just to get rid of that smell, and then you notice some sort of a yokai ghost spirit that is yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan I wish I ain\u2019t dead, or smelling so bad right now.\u201d The yellow yokai ghost said. She seems to look like a beautiful girl, but is big like the others, and also has some really really bad smell. \u201cThis is what happened when Yukika ended up dead.\u201d She muttered to herself, but the others covered their mouth to tell her something happy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you are still beautiful, because even in death, true beauty can be found.\u201d Said Soyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I like to see that statement put to the test when I come on show!\u201d said by a flipping fat but hot pink cat girl wearing a cute dress and was waving her head and shaking her booty. She was also listening to music on her iMonphone (iPhone in monster land) and even shook her breasts that are big as well. \u201cYumie is surely going to put the dance on all of y\u2019all fools.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah big catty butt, I want to see you try that when the green kappa girl known as Makatya joins the game.\u201d Said by the blue and totally overly excited kappa that is like the other girls beautiful, but also heavy on the weight as well.

She had orange fur with black stripes, long, silver hair tied in a ponytail, and green eyes behind cat eye glasses. But what you really noticed was that she was morbidly obese. Her breasts were the size of overinflated beach balls, and her stomach was the size of a bean bag chair. You couldn't see her butt, but you had to guess it was massive too. She was wearing a black leotard that barely fit and a lab coat. She was sitting in a motorized wheelchair, so you had to guess she couldn't move on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat. \"Excuse me, miss?\" You call up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looks down at you and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Stephen.

But all my friends call me Tigra, since they say I look so much like her. Would you like to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and enter her room. Looking around, you see that she must be a scientists. Test tubes, beakers, and medical books lined the desks and bookshelves. Pictures of viruses were on the walls. Near the wall was a Doctorate, and it was for virology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a virologist, if you couldn't already see from my achievement.\" Helena began, refering to her doctorate. \"I've studied some of the most intriguing illnesses in the world. For monsters, I've studied Wing Rot, Reverse-Photosynthisis, and Multi-Eye Disorder. For humans, I've studied Cholera, Polymyositis, and, probably my most frightning, Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a muscle disease, I'll explain at another time.\" She says. \"But, there is one disease that I truly wish to understand. That would be nebutori.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard of that. It was a magic disease that made woman extremely fat and lethargic. You wonder why she would be interested in it. You didn't have to ask, though, because she went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I was in college, another virology student was infected with it. She was immobile for days. She just laid in bed, eating junk food, while doctors worked on a cure. Luckily, this strain wasn't infectious. She was cured and returned to her normal size. Since then, I've wanted to understand it, break it down, and make my own strain. One such attempt made me as you see now.\" She said, patting her gargantuan stomach. \"In fact, I'm actually still growing as we speak, it's just not obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to make your own nebutori?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not just any strain.

And then it just came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot be serious.\" the surprise that briefly crossed your face gave way to incredulous horror, and you berated the massive weretiger. \"Ridiculous! A gender-focused, infectious virus that gives women everywhere, of every race, a difficult time, and you want to make it worse??! Of all things?!?\" again, silence filled the room, and you suddenly realised your position. Thankfully, she wasn't short-tempered, and she just began to play with her bosom and belly fat, wobbling it in a seductive manner while her wheelchair creaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, most of the female population around the world, save most of you humans, is rather well-endowed and curvaceous. So just a few extra tons won't be harmful. Think about it, being so big and plushy and soft is a dream. Just lazying about, eating what you want, doing what you want, while being even softer and warmer than a pillow... or a bed for that matter... Sure, those aflicted by my own strain will be rendered immobile, but they'd have reinforced bones and muscles to support themselves, and also be in high heaven.\" she sighed deeply, rubbing her dome of a gut. She was sorta right, most females you've met thus far were a little heavier than normal, considering their size. You cannot help but blush a bit, seeing how her flab shook and jiggled, so you mentally slap yourself and pinch your nose, regaining your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... wait, what if you were to work on a permanent cure? Wouldn't you get even more credit for it?\" you ask, looking up to her puffy face. Stopping just to dismissively wave her hand, she moaned a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I've considered that already, but why be a stick of a woman with a few insignificant deposits of fat on your body, when you can be a true woman, with plenty of curves to go around?\" she wheeled herself forward, her apron of a belly inching closer to you. Acting on instinct, you took a step backwards, to which Helena simply chuckled. \"Relax, buddy, I'm not going to hurt you, in fact, why don't you try rubbing my belly, just to feel how wonderful and soft it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'd rather not.\" you say, hoping your cheeks weren't as flushed as you thought they were. As a response, the massive doctor just wheeled herself a little closer to you, giggling like a schoolgirl at your apparent shyness. Not wishing to anger your host, you comply, and reach out to cope a feel of her blob of a belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt nice. You had to admit, it was as soft and warm as she described, earlier. But still, to force other women, monster or human, to have this physique forever was a little too much. So you thought about it, while she kept purring in bliss, what if... \"Say... what if I told you of a way you could realise this... uh... fantasy of yours, AND at the same time, get popular and credited for your achievement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\" she moaned, a wide grin on her feline face. She was so curious at to what you had to suggest, she leaned as much as possible to see you better, a task made harder by her enormous boobs, but she didn't seem to mind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you gotta admit, a lot of folks won't take kindly to a highly infectious and incurable strain of nebutori... and that making a cure for the normal cases would bring you a lot of attention, the good kind, not to mention recognition...\" listening, she frowned and her face started to darken a bit, so you internally hoped your idea wasn't as bad as it seemed. \"...so why not get both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, all she did was blink in confusion. \"Come again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, you come up with a cure to a sickness that bothers a lot of women's lives, and at the same time, you create a pill that contains a moderated dose of nebutori, so those that share your mindset, or are curious about it, can indulge themselves, without infecting anyone else.\" listening in, her face loses all form of expression, thinking deeply. You keep trying to convince her. \"If they catch on, which I think they will, coming from the one who found the permanent cure to nebutori, aka YOU, you could make yourself a small fortune selling the cure in a pill AND selling varied doses of the sickness, likewise in pills. This way, everyone gets what they want, yourself included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passes in silence, as she contemplates your idea.

After all, the whole idea of someone purposely creating synthetic nebutroi was nothing short of madness. Sure, you were a chubby chaser, but even you have limits. That\u2019s when Helena gives a smile and a sigh. \u201cI suppose y\u2019all are right. Some girls actually have the poor taste to want to be stick thin and not have anything to do with nebutori. I could make that permanent cure, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath a sigh of relief. \u201cThank goodness. Don\u2019t get me wrong, uh.. Tigra, I love obese monster girls, but not everyone does.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a darn shame,\u201d says the tigress as she lets out a sigh. \u201cBut not undoable. But first thing\u2019s first.\u201d You let out a gulp and then Helena wheels her way to a safe in the wall and unlocks it. From your point of view, you could see the tiger woman\u2019s colossal ass. It looked even bigger than her stomach since her Leotard looked like dental floss on her orange striped cheeks as her tail was moving from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena takes out what looks like a vial of a strange glowing red chemical that was bubbling. Nebutori wasn\u2019t red. That you knew and that\u2019s when the tigress turns around and lets out a purr as she holds up the vial. \u201cThis is my latest batch of nebutori. It\u2019s not highly  infectious yet but it works incredibly fast. Once I\u2019ve created the nebutori for the fetish pills, I\u2019ll be able to use it to create an anti-serum that could create immunities to the disease in the monster body.\u201d \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d you say. \u201cSort of.\u201d You see Helena\u2019s tail wagging and jump up to grab the tip before climbing up, scaling her ass like two squishy canyon walls before you climb her ponytail to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how do you know that gunk even works.\u201d Helena scratches her chin with a claw and then adjusts her glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m already infected and nebutori only works on females. What we need is a guinea pig.\u201d You give a gulp. You don\u2019t like the sound of that. You\u2019re terrified of who she would use that crap on. But Helena isn\u2019t thinking about that and pours the serum into a mold and begins to shape and roll it into a pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a good chance that Helena was going to use the nebutori pill on either one of the staff or one of the guests. You were thinking about who might be affected and how they would react. You imagine the possibilities. Well, Helga would probably hate having to trade in her muscular troll body for a fat blob-like body and given Ripple\u2019s three heads, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to decide what to think of it. Then you imagine how Camille would be affected and laugh to yourself. After all, an obese long-necked giraffe girl would look rather funny. Victoria though would look ridiculous since only half of her body is organic, while Dinah might actually like it given your preference for fat ladies. Zoe probably wouldn\u2019t notice given her blindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019re thinking, Helena lets out a laugh and then puts a red nebutori pill in with a jar of similar looking sour balls. \u201cI\u2019ll just offer the next person to come in, a sour ball. If I\u2019m lucky they\u2019ll be the first to test out my project.\u201d You were of two minds of this, but then again, since she said she\u2019d work on a cure next, who were you to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when there\u2019s a knock on the door and Helena gives a purr and smiles. \u201cCome in.\u201d She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who comes in?</span></div></div>",

It was none other than Felicia, the head waitress and Azure and Vernon's adoptive daughter. She was a black furred were-jaguar with long black hair and bright green eyes. She was wearing her usual yellow maid's outfit that hugged her chubby body. Felicia was one of many female monsters who wanted you as their boyfriend. Between her, April, Abilene and Dinah, you couldn't get a moment's peace. From the looks of it, Felicia was carrying a pitcher of a strange drink you couldn't identify with a few glasses. \"Hi, Stephen!\" shouts Felicia with ecstasy as she comes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver. \"Hi, Felicia..\" Felicia blows you a kiss and even waves her tail in your direction. Helena is staring herself before whispering to you. \"Quite a chubby kitty that jaguar girl is.\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"That's just Felicia. Azure's daughter.\" Helena gives a look of surprise. \"Daughter?\" she asks. \"But she's a werejaguar.\" \"She's adopted.\" You whisper into Helena's ear. Felicia just waddles over and places the drink on the table. \"I thought since you were hard at work in the lab, I'd bring you some chilled soul-fruit juice, Tigra.\" Helena gives a smile and pours herself a glass. \"You're too kind, Felicia. What a lovely name. If you dyed your hair, it would be more appropriate.\" Felicia gives a look of confusion before she finally realizes what Helena is saying. She then smiles at you. \"Stephen, do you think I'd look good with white hair?\" You stop to think of that and then you begin to imagine Felicia and Connie both with pure white hair, forcing you to cover your nose to prevent it from bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena sips some of her drink before laying the glass on her stomach. Then she gets an idea. \"Say, Felicia, can I interest you in some candy.\" \"Sure,\" said Felicia. \"I always did have a real sweet tooth.\" Tat's when you realize something and gasp. Before you could warn Felicia about Helena's plan, Helena shoves you between the rolls of fat on her stomach. You gag as the sweaty black spandex-covered boulders of tiger flesh sandwich you in. Helena makes sure you're restrained as Felicia reaches into the jar of sour balls and unknowingly takes the experimental nebutori one and eats it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she gags as she swallows it. \"I take it you're not one for sour candy, sugar?\" asks Helena as she feels you beating against her fat. \"Not really,\" says Felicia. \"But thanks, Tigra.\" Felicia skips away before Helena reaches into her rolls of fat to look for you. \"Dag gum,\" she says. \"I can never find anything in here.\" First Helena takes out a giant toasted newt that she proceeds to eat and then she fishes out her cellphone before she takes you out and you have to take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad?!\" you yell. \"You just gave the nebutori candy to the lodge master's daughter! Do you have any idea what will happen.\" Helena just lets out a sigh. \"Relax, Stephen,\" she says. \"She might even decide she loves it. She's about to look like a goddess. Just like me.\" Helena gives a wily purr as you bite your nails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, out in the hall, Felicia is walking by when she sees Vernon at her toes. \"Oh,\" said Vernon. \"There you are, Felicia. That light fixture has been on the futz and your mother wants me to take a look at it. Could you give me a hand.\" \"Sure, Daddy.\" Says Felicia. The jaguar giantess then lifts her tiny father into the fixture as Vernon fixes it. \"Thanks, Darling.\" Felicia then places Vernon back on the ground but as Vernon looks up at his titanic daughter, something puzzles him. \"Felicia, are you getting taller?\" Felicia doesn't understand what her father is talking about. \"I don't know what you mean, Daddy. I am considering going white-haired, though.\" As Felicia walks over her father, Vernon looks up to see that Felicia's butt seems to be getting bigger with each step to the point that her star-covered panties appear to be coming apart. Felicia also appears to be as tall as Azure when before she was 100ft shorter than her coyote mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVernon gives a puzzled look as he walks the other way.</span></div></div>",

There was a loud knocking at the door. \"Felicia!\" yells Elisa. \"What's taking you so long?\" \"Just a few seconds more, Elisa.\" Once Felicia cleaned the sink, she saw her new white hair in the mirror and smiled. Now she looked more like the super heroine who shared her first name, which was only fitting since the suggestion came from a Tigra-lookalike. Felicia giggled and twirled her newly bleached hair. \"How will you like me now, Stephen.\" Elisa knocked at the door again and Felicia stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa looked in surprise at the fact that Felicia bleached her hair. \"Felicia?\" asks Elisa. \"So,\" says Felicia with a smile and purr. \"How do I look?\" Elisa bites her lip nervously. \"Like you just aged fifty-years in fifty seconds.\" Felicia lets out a scoff. \"It's only important that Stephen likes it.\" Felicia wiggles her rear as she says this but then grunts because she hears a cracking noise. She looked and saw that the sides of the bathroom doorway had broken due to her large behind. However, from the looks of it, Felicia was completely oblivious. \"Geez,\" she says. \"I hope we don't have termites.\" Elisa could only watch dumbfounded as Felicia appears to be as tall as she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Helena inspects her jar of sour balls and notices some of them were wet. Apparently, the nebutori ball had leaked. \"Dagnabbit!\" yells Helena. \"That nebutori must've leaked. Anyone who eats any of these here sour balls is asking for it. I better get rid of these.\" The Tigra lookalike takes the jar of sour candy and uses her wheelchair to move down the hall. \"Now,\" she said. \"Where is that durn, garbage disposal.\" But as she wheels down the hall, Lydia opens her door and causes Helena to yell as the door hits her in the face. Helena tosses her jar of sour balls and it lands in the hands of Camille who is walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weregiraffe giantess knows absolutely nothing about the nebutori and lowers her neck to get a good look at the candy. \"Huh,\" she says. \"Azure told me to refill the candy dish in the lobby. This must be what she had in mind.\" Camille takes one of the sour balls and swishes it into her mouth, unaware of the nebutori slime. Camille moans in ecstasy as the sour ball makes its long trip down her enormous neck. \"Yum,\" says Camille. \"Sour candy. My favorite.\" With that, Camille takes the sour balls into the lobby, unaware of what she's about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the cafe, Felicia had gotten as big as Elektra and was waiting tables as the patrons (mostly the monster men) stared at her voluptuous body. The jaguar giantess herself hadn't noticed how much fatter she had become. At this point her maid's skirt was barely covering a fraction of her massive rear. One manticore is even slapped by his girlfriend for staring at Felicia's ass. Felicia moved to a table where a red-skinned male gargoyle can't help by stare at her swelling breasts and belly. \"Hello. Welcome to the Grimmsley Cafe? I am Felicia and I will be your waitress. What interests you on the menu, sir.\" The gargoyle just constantly looks at Felicia. \"Do you come on the menu?\" he asked, obvious lust in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Elektra is in a bad mood as she brings back used dishes. \"What's wrong, Elektra?\" asks Ripple's sorrowful right head. Elektra let out another grumble as she trumpets from her trunk. \"I just got a letter from my daughter in Direopolis and as it turns out, she's been dating a human. That idiot has been putting bad ideas in her head.\" Felicia let out a sigh as she overheard. She knew for a fact that Elektra was once married to a male vampire and their daughter was a vampire-loxodon hybrid who was currently a teenager. Elektra and her husband were divorced because they couldn't agree on what attitude towards humans to raise their daughter on. Part of the reason why Elektra was always mad was because she lost custody of their daughter and Direopolis was miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElektra just trumpets loudly. \"Humans are not mates,\" says the elephant giantess. \"They're food.\" Felicia gives a hiss. \"You better not be planning on trying to eat Stephen, Elektra. Mom says that if you catches you snacking on your coworkers, you'll lose your job.\" Elektra raises her trunk and tries to glare at Felicia only to gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Felicia was 1200ft tall, even taller than Elektra and she looked absolutely bloated. She had a 1000ft wide belly and butt, a large pair of E-cup breasts and a triple-chin. Her maid outfit looked tattooed to her skin at this point. Elektra and Ripple dropped all four of their jaws. \"What?\" asks Felicia. Azure and Vernon were about to hear about this situation because Azure was walking into the kitchen with Vernon riding on her snout. \"What do you mean Felicia's getting bigger? As far as I can tell, she's a fully grown young adult werejaguar.\" \"I saw her earlier, Azure. She's putting on a lot of weight.\" \"Felicia's been chubby since the day we took her in. You're probably over...reacting....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure walks into the cafe and sees her ginormously fattened daughter waiting on tables and blushing. \"Hi, Mom.\" she says. At this point, she has finally realized how big she had gotten. She was even able to use her hips as serving trays at this point. \"Oh my gosh!\" yells Azure. \"Felicia!? What did you eat?\" Felicia gave a nervous purr as she rubbed her triple chin with her pudgy fingers. \"Just one sour ball from Dr. Kroft's room.\" \"That's impossible,\" says Vernon. \"One sour ball couldn't possibly be that fattening.\" Azure remembers something and then growls. \"Wait right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure stomps down the hallway and is growling as Vernon holds onto her canine snout. \"You try to be nice,\" says Azure. \"But no. I'm going to give that fat cat a piece of my mind.\" \"Which one?\" asks Vernon. Azure gives a glare at her tiny husband right before...</span></div></div>",

The weregiraffe looks as though she\u2019s in the same XXXXXL boat that Felicia is in. The giraffe woman\u2019s thighs had expanded so much that she could use them as serving trays, her legs were as thick as tree trunks on steroids and her neck is extremely bloated to the point that her head looks miniscule. Her breasts are shaking as she walks and Azure drops her jaw as she looks at Camille. \u201cCamille?!\u201d yells Azure in surprise. \u201cHi, Boss,\u201d says Camille with a puff. \u201cYou might want to invest in a motorized scooter in the near future.\u201d Camille hums to herself and walks down the hall, her panties shrinking with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCamille!?\u201d yells Azure. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Camille turns her neck but it takes a minute or so for her head to keep up with it before she gasps. \"Heck if I know,\" says the titanic giraffe. \"My guess is that it's something in the candy.\" \"Candy?\" asks Vernon. \"What candy?\" \"The candy in the lobby. Those sour balls. I even ate one myself.\" Azure then gives a growl. \"That maniac!\" she yells. \"So Felicia isn't the only victim of Helena's nasty experiments. I am going to kick her ass. Given how large it is, it should take me until dawn.\" That's when Vernon realized something. \"Dear,\" he said. \"Didn't you eat one of the sour balls.\" Azure just gulps. \"Oh hell.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure grunts and holds her chest as her jeans begin to rip apart. She inhales and exhales as her cheeks begun to expand One of them nearly pushes Vernon off Azure's shoulder. Vernon tries to regain his footing but slips down and grabs Azure by the nipple just as Azure's shirt tears slightly at the neck opening and reveals her bra. Azure grunts and then bits her lips. This can't possibly end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lobby, Roxy and Elisa were busy speaking. \"I say he should get the electric chair,\" says Roxy conversing with Elisa as they walk down. \"Considering what he did to people in his experiments it would be rather poetic.\" \"I don't know, Roxy,\" says Elisa to her gargoyle friend. \"I think I prefer what his boss suggested they'd do to him if they caught him. Heck, they oughta use nine inch nails for that job.\" Elisa then spots the jar of sour balls and the hippo-dragon hybrid takes a sour ball, unaware of the consequences of it and throws it into her large mouth before continuing her conversation. \"Given that the hero had to kidnap him to force him to fix the mistake and they still couldn't trust him,\" the bahamut says. \"He definitely deserves it.\" Roxy takes a sour ball herself. \"Well yeah. Then again, he's not one to talk. Given everything else he's done, he deserves the same miserable fate. If I met him I would cut his vocal chords and then introduce him to Paisley.\" Elisa lets out a laugh. \"That's cruel. He'd probably make Paisley sick.\" \"I guess,\" says Roxy with a sigh. \"Mmm. This is good candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy grabs two more sour balls and swallows them as well Elisa smirks at Roxy. \"Careful, Roxy. You're going to get even larger.\" \"Blow me, Elisa. When was the last time <i>you</i> saw your toes.\" \"I'm 1/3 hippopotamus,\" says Elisa. \"What's <i>your</i> excuse?\" Roxy grumbles. \"I get enough of that b.... blatherskite... from my sisters.\" Comet was listening and she knew what Roxy almost said because she was glaring at her. The Holstein giantess walks away carrying her skies and from the looks of it her breasts and udder have gotten larger and she had a noticeably pudgier belly. \"Is it just me?\" asks Elisa. \"Or is Comet putting on weight.\" Roxy puts down the candy and Dinah sneaks it and grabs one of the sour balls before chewing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, is it hot in here.\" Says a voice. Elisa turns to face Zoe, the blind landshark and drops her jaw, revealing her hippo teeth. Zoe was enormously fat with three chins and her hammerhead was drooping. She had an enormous belly and her ass at this point had taken up the entire couch she was on. \"Zoe?\" asks Elisa. \"Oh,\" says Zoe. \"Hi, Elisa. I'm sweating like a pig here and this coat just won't come off.\" Zoe wasn't wearing a coat but because she couldn't see what happened to her body, she couldn't see how fat she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, you are walking into the lobby, being extra careful to make sure that you aren't trampled underfoot by a monster giantess. However, as you\u2019re walking down the hallway, you yell because with how many more fat giantesses there are, it had become more and more difficult. A lot of the guests had put on a rather noticeably large amount of weight. You move and dodge a talon that looks like it belongs to Sora. You look up to see the gray pterosaur-like wyvern had an even fatter ass than she had before, to the point where her tail looked like dental floss in comparison. You looked closer to see that Sora was taking photographs of fat monster girls that walked down the hallway. Hippolyta was so obese that her wings looked too small for the hippogriff to be able to fly and she was forced to walk on all fours as she dragged her large, large belly. That mean pegasus girl, Blair had gotten so fat that both types of her cheeks had several layers and her pants have torn revealing her horseshoe print panties, something that she is really steamed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately run in to find that Roxy had just swallowed three more sour balls. \u201cElisa!\u201d you shout. \u201cRoxy!\u201d \u201cWhat is it Stephen?\u201d asks Roxy as she puts down the candy jar. When nobody is looking, that wraith, Fatima, ghosts her hand through the floor to steal the candy. \u201cSour balls,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favorite.\u201d Fatima then proceeds to steal the entire jar. Of course, none of you knew what eating that candy would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa picks you up in her chubby hand and takes you up to hers and Roxy\u2019s face. \u201cSomething weird is going on.\u201d You say. \u201cEverybody is getting fatter.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d says Elisa smugly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that everybody was as bad a compulsive eater as Roxy.\u201d \u201cGee, Elisa,\u201d says an annoyed Roxy. \u201cLook at the time, it\u2019s go shut your trap o\u2019clock!\u201d Elisa then realizes you\u2019re right. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d think there was an outbreak of nebutori.\u201d You then twitch your fingers. \u201cStephen?\u201d asks Roxy. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Elisa gives a snort and bears her fangs. \u201cYou know something don\u2019t you.\u201d \u201cW-Well,\u201d you say. \u201cThat new tenant, Helena Kroft, she\u2019s working with nebutori in her lab. She was working on nebutori pills.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding?!\u201d yells Roxy. \u201cWho would want to take a pill that makes them ten times fatter?\u201d Then you gasp because you realize that the sour balls must\u2019ve been soaked with the nebutori and that the pill leaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Roxy,\u201d you say. \u201cHow many of those sour balls did you eat?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asks Roxy defensively. \u201cIf that\u2019s another crack about my weight, I\u2019m sticking you where the sun don\u2019t shine.\u201d \u201cShe ate exactly thirteen,\u201d says Elisa. \u201cI counted.\u201d \u201cYou two knock it off, Elisa,\u201d says Roxy. \u201cOr I swear, I will shove Stephen so far up where you sit that your grandchildren will be born will hemorrhoids.\u201d \u201cThirteen?\u201d you ask to yourself in horror. \"Oh no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho\u2019s POV do you follow now?</span></div></div>",

You could feel your pants ripping as your ass blew up, and your belly was catching up fast too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still bloating by the time you get to Helena's door. You're too angry to knock, so you simply kick the door in, breaking it in pieces. When you do this, the momentum causes Vernon to lose his grip and fall, but you catch him and place him on top of your right breast. Helena wheels around in surprise at the sound of her door splintering. But then she sees you and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello Azure.\" She says. \"I see that my experiment is working-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't give her a chance to finish before you grab her neck. At this point, you seriously consider suffocating her with your still bloating body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one reason why I shouldn't smother you with my own body.\" You threaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm the only one who can fix you.\" She manages to choke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at her for a moment, then sigh and let her go. She had a point. Of everyone here, she's the only one who knows how this works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She says. \"Oh, and speaking of your body, it should stop bloating right... now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you feel the bloating stop. Now smiling, Helena wheels over to her closet and opens the door, revealing a full lenght mirror. You look at your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were truly massive. You swore you looked like a mobile version of the succubus painter, Ambrosine Peinture. You arms and legs had bloated to the size of pillars. Your belly had swollen to about 1000 feet wide. Your breasts were equally as big, shredding your shirt. And your ass was also the same size, destroying your pants. Even your cheeks had blown up. You looked almost comical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like the experiment was a success.\" Helena said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to her. \"You said you could fix this?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. I was originally going to make this incurable, but Stephen convinced me otherwise.\" Helena explained. \"I've been working on the antidote ever since Stephen left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better have been, or I'm tossing you out of Grimmly Lodge. Without your wheelchair.\" You growl at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Once I finish it, I'm going to release it publically as a pill. It will help women gain the curves they want. Isn't that great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but you still don't have the right to use my lodge as a testing ground. Now, do you have that antidote?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena sighs. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's one ingredient I still need.\" You give a growl and bear your teeth through your bloated face. \"Of course there is. Well, tell me what the damned ingredient is?\" Helena gave a scoff. \u201cY\u2019all familiar with zombie-face bugle mushrooms?\u201d Vernon tries to maintain his footing on your breast before he is forced to grab hold of your hair. \u201cZombie-face bugle mushrooms? I\u2019ve heard of those. They\u2019re used in apothecary. But they\u2019re also very hard to find.\u201d Helena gives a nervous laugh. \u201cIt might be a while before I can make the antidote. I only ordered the mushrooms this morning and they won\u2019t be here for days.\u201d\u2028\u2028You growl at the tigress. \u201cI can\u2019t wait days for this foolishness to end! I\u2019ll tell you what, Doc,\u201d you say that last part spitting. \u201cI\u2019ll go down to Terrordale and get the damned mushrooms myself. Come on, Vernon.\u201d You waddle towards the door as your husband holds onto your fur and you grumble. However, you forget just how big and fat you\u2019ve gotten and get stuck in the doorway before you start to swear. \u201cHello!?\u201d you shout. \u201cI could use some help over here.\u201d Elisa waddles over and you see clearly that the bahamut was four times larger than she was before. Her belly was dragging on the ground even though she was holding much of it up, her butt was now so big that her jeans were reduced to a loincloth and her cheeks were so big that her hippopotamus-like snout looked undersized. She even snorted. \u201cGeez, Azure. I didn\u2019t think the mistress of the house would get stuck in her own doors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a growl as Vernon tries to hold back his laughter and then you realize something. \u201cWhere\u2019s Roxy?\u201d she asked. Elisa grabs you by the arms to pull your massive hulk out and grunts. \u201cRoxy ate too many of those tainted sour balls and now she\u2019s twice Ambrosine Peinture\u2019s size. Her eating habits betrayed her big time.\u201d \u201cServes her right,\u201d says Vernon. \u201cShe\u2019s a bigger pig than a wereboar.\u201d You let out a moan. \u201cWell, I want you to find those nebutori-laced sour balls and flush them down the toilet, we can\u2019t have anyone else getting infected.\u201d Elisa just grunted as she continue to pull. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too sure about that, boss lady. Nebutori is very contagious. Whoa!\u201d Elisa tugged so hard, she pulled you out of the doorway but also tore out a part of the wall as you grumble. \u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cNow get out of my way.\u201d As you\u2019re waddling down the hall, Elisa turns her head. \u201cWhere are you going, Azure?\u201d \u201cThat ****ing tiger needs one last ingredient to make an antidote for this mess but it won\u2019t be here for days. I\u2019m not waiting. I\u2019m going to Terrordale to pick it up at the store.\u201d Elisa gave a look of horror. \u201cBad idea, Azure. You\u2019ll spread that virus through the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028However, your judgement was clouded by stress and you waddle down the hallway and out the front door. You place Vernon on your back before you run down the mountain on all fours through the snow. As you do this, what\u2019s left of your shirt and pants fly off as your body jiggles and shakes with each step. \u201cWhoa!\u201d yells Vernon. \u201cWhoa! Steady there, Azure! Steady!\u201d But you pay Vernon no heed as you continue to run. You\u2019re surprised that your bloated body could get this far and you were panting and sweating heavily. By the time you reach the bottom of the mountain and walk into Terrordale, you\u2019re almost out of breath. Vernon climbs up to your ear to speak with you. \u201cYou feeling okay, Azure Honey.\u201d You breathe deeply before speaking. \u201cI\u2019m just not used to this weight. Let\u2019s just get the mushrooms from the supermarket and then we can get back to Grimmsly Lodge.\u201d You walk down the street as Vernon speaks into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAzure,\u201d he said. \u201cZombie-face bugle mushrooms are very rare. They only grow in the darkest caves in the dankest swamps. And they\u2019re really expensive. Don\u2019t you think you should wait until Helena\u2019s order arrives. To be perfectly honest, I think you look better like this.\u201d Vernon gives a playful growl and tries to motorboat your fur, only to stop when you stare at him.\u201d \u201cFlattery will get you nowhere, Vernon. I\u2019m not letting my lodge turn into a fat farm. Besides, I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s at least one pack of those damned mushrooms left in... unk!\u201d Before you can finish your sentence you bump into somebody. Somebody with rather large breasts. \u201cHey!\u201d the yell. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re... Azure? What happened to you?\u201d You recognize that voice and then look forward in shock. Standing in front of you was a 1300ft violet-skinned gargoyle woman with short and spikey hair. She had an average build but gigantic breasts that obscured her torso due to her Lactose Overload Syndrome. She was wearing a tailored gray business suit and high heels. This woman was Breccia Stone, CEO of Stone Inc. and was a business partner of yours, having set up Grimmsly Lodge as a spa and health resort during the summer. \u201cBreccia!\u201d you yell. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. No time to explain. I need to get to the supermarket ASAP.\u201d As you dash off, Breccia looks in concern but then she shrugs her shoulders and then reached into her cleavage for her cellphone. What the gargoyle businesswoman didn\u2019t notice was that her belly, thighs and ass were expanding to the point where her stockings were coming apart. You had inadvertently touched her and gave her nebutori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were not thinking about the consequences of your actions at the moment because you were singleminded in your search for the mushrooms for Helena\u2019s antidote. \u201cSo what if they don\u2019t have the zombie-faced bugle mushrooms in the store?\u201d asks Vernon. You give a growl as you squeeze into the supermarket. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to go directly to the source.\u201d You turn to the female cashier who was too busy reading a Dr. Madman comic book to pay you any heed. The cashier was a bored-looking harpy girl with the wings and talons of a secretary bird with dark-skin and short black hair worn in a ponytail. She didn\u2019t even look at you as you came in. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d you ask. \u201cDo you sell Zombie-Faced Bugle Mushrooms?\u201d The cashier points to an aisle and you waddle down, not noticing the cashier\u2019s stomach is expanding due to you passing the nebutori onto her. As you reach the end of the aisle, you look ahead to see where they would keep the mushrooms. \u201cI really hope they have those shrooms.\u201d You grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do they have the zombie-faced bugle mushrooms?</span></div></div>",

Nobody! That naga who dared to challenge me will rue the day.\u201d Raven tossed several strange liquids into another beaker and the beaker let out some smoke. Then, Raven gave a smirk and dropped a pearl into the glass meant for Connie before she poured the potion in both glasses as it let out a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross your fingers as you desperately hope that Raven doesn\u2019t do anything too completely sinister to the naga you love. \u201cNo,\u201d you say. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d But it\u2019s too late because Raven walks out with an evil smirk on her face. At that time, Connie is warming up by the fire and shivering. \u201cWhy the hell did I get a job way out here? Stupid Connie. You\u2019re cold blooded, remember.\u201d That was when Connie turned her head and then spotted Raven as she was purring. \u201cBonjourno, Signorina. You must be Connie.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Connie. \u201cYou must be one of the new renters. I just met another one, an immobile tiger woman I believe. I\u2019m Connie the tour guide.\u201d Raven smiled, ready to put her plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the immortal sorceress, Raven Eckerton. The most beautiful monster in the world.\u201d Connie let out a scoff. \u201cOh please. Another sorceress. I hope you get along better with Helga than Lydia.\u201d Raven then handed Connie the class with the pearl in it. Connie had no idea it was a potion and  assumed it was a strange monster beverage.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d said Connie. \u201cThat\u2019s very neighborly. I love strawberry milk.\u201d Raven gave a smirk. \u201cI hear that some people find you attractive.\u201d Connie then drank the potion and then hiccuped slightly. \u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard of it. I\u2019m not really looking for a relationship right now.\u201d Then Connie grunted. She didn\u2019t know it but she swallowed the pearl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Raven. \u201cYou are quite large for a naga.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an anaconda-type naga. We\u2019re the largest of all Nagas.\u201d \u201cNot only that,\u201d said Selena. \u201cBut you are very heavy, signorina. Did you get that way from eating humans.\u201d Connie let out a scoff as Raven drank her half of the potion. \u201cOf course not. I can\u2019t eat humans. I\u2019m violently allergic to them. If I ate a human, I\u2019d puff up like a balloon and my digestive system would be rumbling all night.\u201d Then Connie twitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Connie looks at her hands to see them becoming wrinkled and also sees them getting scrawnier. Connie gasped and then looked at Raven who was glowing. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \"It's not killing you, my dear Connie. I'm just taking what makes you...\" Raven then grunted because she felt her already large butt swelling and her cleavage was shaking as her belly stretched out of the keyhole on her dress. Raven held her head as her face became more youthful and Connie's face became more wrinkled and Connie grunted as she was getting skinnier and skinnier, so much that her breasts seemed to shrink. It made sense. You were attracted to Connie because you had a thing for heavy set women, so now Raven was getting all of Connie's body weight right until Connie is rail thin and Raven is now...</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately, the door opens. your taken back at the sight in front of you. you've seen plenty of large monsters in your time but this lady sure takes the cake, and then some. All you could see of the new tenant was her incredibly muscular body,which took up the whole frame of the door, it was a wonder how she even fit through the door. You couldn't even see what she looked like as her head was cut of from sight by the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you where seeing if your memory was correct. Then this huge monster in front of you was none other than Morgan Wayne the worlds largest monster, a title she clearly deserves. You read about her in the Daily Tombstone titled <i>The monster who wouldn't stop growing </i>.According to the article Morgan was kidnapped as a baby and experimented on by humans, which caused her body to grow to extreme proportions and if the article is to be believed even now years later she was still growing larger.She was a bit of a minor celebrity in the monster world, she even had a documentary and a straight to TV movie made on her life. Your pretty sure you remember reading that the monster world almost went to war with the human world over this. Not that it surprises you wars have been stared for less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou must of been standing there for a while because a loud voice from above seemed to catch your attention. \"hello can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, w..well\" Your heart was beating a mile a minute you weren't really intimated by her vast size, though it was hard not to  be but spending your days surrounded by people who are  building sized helped with that, but you had no idea what her thoughts where on humans. Did she hate them, us, you for what you kind did to her, had she forgiven us. you had no clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on I need to re-position myself a bit to see you\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the ground beneath you shake as Morgan took a few steps back from the door so she could actually see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh a human, what brings you here little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..well..I..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow easy there little guy I know I might look a bit scary but I'm really just a teddy bear at heart\" she gave a wink and a smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so you don't hate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked at you confused. \"Why would I hate you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"for what happened to you\" The words just came out before you even had a chance to think. you quickly slapped your hands round your mouth looking up at Morgan with a horrified look of worry on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan pinched the bridge of her nose as she let out a heavy sigh \" Not this again. *Sigh* I take it you know who I am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Look despite what you might of heard or think I don't all humans how could I just because a couple did wrong. I mean it would be very hypocritical for me to hate humans when monsters do unspeakable things humans everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit that what she said made sense. you where treated horribly by certain monsters in your life not to mention the countless humans around the world being eaten by some monster right now. You were starting to feel better, your heart had started to beat at a normal level.<br>\r\n\"I guess your right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled and knelt down so she was closer to your level in hope to seem less intimidating \"of course I'm right. feeling better now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"good now tell me little guy what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so caught up in meeting Morgan that you almost forgot the whole reason you were even  here to begin with. \" oh right. sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ok\" Morgan gave you a gentle smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly \" erm yes ok. My name is Stephen and I work here at the Grimmsly Lodge. I was asked to meet the new renter and see how there settling in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh well I'm doing fine all things considered, I mean the beds a bit on the small side but that's my problem not the resort other than that every thing's fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou smiled looking Morgan in her red eyes \"well I'm glad well i got other duties to attend to but if you every need anything don't hesitate to ask\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith that you turned round to meet up with Vernon and report back to him on Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan watched as you walked down the hall grinning showing off rows of her sharper than normal teeth \"Maybe I'll take you up on just that\"     <br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on Roxy's shoulder as you and her sat in the cafe enjoying a nice meal whilst you and her where on a lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so Roxy how has your day been so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy swallowed a huge piece of her burger before answering \"hmm, not bad same as usual really. some dumb kid from the city who thinks they got pneumonia, a weretiger who fell over trying to snowboard the minotaur the weretiger crashed in to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed \"same old ish just a different day huh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"god you have no idea.\" Roxy took another bite of her burger \"so..*munch*.. what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused to think about what you did today but only one thing really stood out to you \" same as usual really, well except I met Morgan Wayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy turned to look at you on her shoulder with a confused look \"who?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou smiled \" you know, the worlds largest monster\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy still had no clue who you were talking about,though her interest had peaked a little with the fact that the worlds largest monster was now staying at the lodge. \" That's cool and all but I still have no idea who she is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour not surprised as long as you've known Roxy she hasn't shown you that she was someone to read the newspaper preferring to get her news off social media. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really you've never heard of her?\" you brought your voice to just above a whisper \"she was the monster that humans experimented on\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy finally seemed to recognize who you where talking about \"oh yeah I remember her. She was all over the news when I was young. Jeez, shes here. And you met her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she didn't try to kill you? being a human and all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to let out a heavy sigh. \"I really thought she would.but shes actually very nice once you get past how terrifyingly intimidating she looks or the whole human thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour conversation with Roxy didn't get to far when Felicia came over to talk to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Stephen... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear your stomach growling, so you shrug your shoulders and decide to head for the Grimmsly cafe for some breakfast. You\u2019re certain they could spare you something to eat. You make your way to the cafe using one of the flash tubes Helga installed for easy human travel. One of the things you liked best about your job at the lodge was that it was designed to accommodate tiny humans like you. Once in the cafe, you spot a table by a window and climb up the table cloth before you reach the top. You can already smell Ripple cooking hot cakes and kentrosaurus meat. Now all you had to do was wait for one of the Lodge\u2019s five waitresses to come to your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head waitress was Azure\u2019s daughter Felicia. Unlike her mother, Felicia was a werejaguar, a feline monster. Since Vernon was too small to impregnate Azure, they decided to adopt. Having a human father made Felicia, a normally predatory monster, completely harmless, sort of a daddy\u2019s girl that happened to dwarf her daddy more than one hundred times. While she would never hurt a human, Felicia is somewhat playful, just like a cat and is especially fond of you. Azure even joked to you that maybe Felicia shares her taste in men. You're certain that Azure's right about Felicia flirting with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately not all the waitresses were like Felicia, the rest were scary at best and dangerous at worse. There was Camille, the weregiraffe. She was so tall, even Roxy\u2019s amazon of a younger sister Petra was shorter than her, but most of that was neck of course. Camille was a psychic and read your mind so she could answer questions you hadn\u2019t asked. If that weren\u2019t scary enough, she told you she knows when and how you\u2019re going to die and you don\u2019t want to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a monster that reminded you of April from the beach. Dinah the werecrocodile was just as flirty as April or Felicia and her more predatory appearance made her more intimidating. Especially since she doesn\u2019t like other monsters to get near you. One time she even snapped at Azure when Azure called you into her office. You\u2019re terrified of what would happen if Dinah and April ever were in the same room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was also a monster that was unintentionally dangerous. Victoria was a Frankenstein monster who was put together from the bodies of deceased supermodels and was built as a war machine. But she was too nice and went to Fearfield. Victoria\u2019s \u201cmother\u201d for lack of a better word, cut several corners when she put her together and both Victoria\u2019s undead and metallic parts tended to fall off at the worst possible times. It\u2019s a miracle she hasn\u2019t lost her job as a waitress. But one time her metal hand fell off and nearly crushed you. You\u2019re afraid one wrong move and Victoria\u2019s ill-built body will kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most dangerous waitress however was Elektra the loxodon. Even though Elektra was an elephant based monster, she was no herbivore. Elektra's favorite food was humans and saw all humans, even humans that came to eat at the cafe, as food. The only one she never tries to eat is Vernon and that\u2019s only because he\u2019s married to her boss. One time, you caught her shaking seasoning onto you as she waited on a table beside you. Elektra was just as bad as that mermaid enemy of yours Paisley and she wasn\u2019t even confined to the water. If Elektra was your waitress today, you might just become the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who will be your waitress today?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just for you.\" she says with a wink. Then she leans down and puckers up before planting a huge kiss on you. She walks way as you wipe her saliva out of your face. You then start eating your food. It tastes great! Ripple really knows how to cook. While you chow down a low rumbling signals someone walking over. You swallow the bite  of egg in your mouth and look up to see Dinah leaning on the table with her face right next to you. Her cleavage is also in full view,  \"Dinah?!\" you exclaim, and almost choke. The werecroc pats you on the back with a claw until you collect yourself. \"You surprised me!\" you tell her. She shrugs. \"Sorry, but I couldn't help it. You looked so cute I had to watch!\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your meal a little awkwardly. You're used to Dinah's behavior but having her giant eyes on you through your whole meal is a little unnerving.

Rolling your eyes you take your last bite. Immediately the werecroc starts walking toward you. She's probably going to clear your table as an excuse to flirt with you. When she reaches your table however, she reaches down and grabs you! With a grin she stuffs you in her cleavage and finishes clearing your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinah's huge breasts jiggle as she walks, causing you to be tossed about a little as well. Despite her scaly exterior, Dinah's underbelly is very soft. Her boobs are no exception, and feel like amazing pillows. You would never tell her this though. It would go to her head and she would never let you go. She really is just like a reptilian April. They're really nice girls, but you're into Connie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside your prison Dinah is still on duty, except now she's working with a big smile. The other waitresses assume she's in a very good mood. If they only knew why. When its time for the cafe to close she walks out with you still in her bosom. As she walks down the hall she pulls you out slightly and pats your head with her claw. \"Was your day comfy Stephen?\" she asks. \"Yeah, sure.\" you answer. \"I think I should get going now though. Its getting kind of late.\" Dinah makes a pouty face. \"What? The night is still young! We should head to the lounge! Or maybe you'd prefer to come to my room?\" she suggests with a lusty look. You roll your eyes. \"I think Roxy might get a little worried if I don't head to the room soon.\" you tell her. Roxy, being your partner back at the beach, is your roommate here. Unfortunately this may have been the wrong thing to say to the yandere crocodile. \"Why would you need to see that leather winged butterball?\" she says angrily. She grabs you between two claws and pulls you up to her face. You're dangling in front of her eyes, which give you an accusing stare. You start to get nervous and then you crack. \"I guess I can stay out a little longer.\" you say with a sigh. Dinah jumps for joy and heads off without even asking for your input.

She walks over to the hot cocoa machine and makes her self a cup. She also fills a tiny cup for you and heads back to her chair. She smiles down at you and scratches your head. \"Here you go Stephen.\" she says and lowers the tiny cup to you. You sip your cocoa as she does the same with hers. You find yourself settling further into her boobs as you get more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd have a good time.\" Dinah says when she notices how relaxed you are. You look up and see her looking down at you with a smile. You nod with an awkward smile. You don't want to make her too excited so you're trying not to give her an excuse. Unfortunately you fail and she begins to giggle. \"I knew it! You are having a good time!\" she says happily. \"We'll do this all the time, and eventually we'll move in together!\" You almost choke on your cocoa and sit up quickly. You grab a handful of boobflesh to steady yourself, making Dinah jump a little. \"Ooh! Trying to get a little closer?\" she asks. \"Uh, Dinah? I think you're jumping the gun here a little.\" you tall her. The giant werecroc just looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be shy! I just know we're meant for each other!\" she argues. \"Look at how well this date is going!\" you don't know if you would call this a date but you really don't want to argue. Dinah's claw comes down and begins pushing you into the side of her fleshy boob. She's very gentle, taking care not to make you spill your cocoa. \"Doesn't that feel nice?\" she says soothingly. \"You could have this all the time!\" You decide the best thing to do is to just ride it out until you can get away from her. \"I even put a little something special in our drinks!\" she pouts. You snap to attention. \"What do you mean?\" you ask. \"I put a little rum in them!\" she says. You taste your cocoa again and now you notice the rum. You know she didn't mean any harm, but you think she may have miscalculated on your tiny cup. What happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you sit there between the two mountains of flesh you begin to notice even more how soft they are. You begin fondling them with one hand as you sip your cocoa with the other. Dinah feels this and peers down at you. \"Oh, are you feeling frisky?\" she asks. You finish your cocoa and gaze up at her with a smile. With your eyes still locked with hers you open your arms wide and hug her boob flesh to yourself. You snuggle and cuddle with it as Dinah's face turns a little red. \"Stephen, whats come over you?\" she asks a little excitedly. Then it hits her. \"Oh no! I must have added too much rum to your drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the werecroc above you worries you nibble on her boob. she jumps a little and looks down in shock. \"Don't worry, I feel great!\" you tell her. You definitely sound a little loose but not full on drunk. As if to prove your point you bury your face in her flesh and start kissing and licking it. Dinah gasps and plucks you from your spot. \"Now this is what I've been waiting for!\" she says and gives you a smooch. You return the kiss and attack her lips your own mouth. She then sets you on her shoulder and you grab her long blonde hair to snuggle up to. You sidle up to her neck and lean against it while cuddling her hair. Dinah smiles and pets you as she relaxes by the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it gets even later Dinah decides to call it a night. You have dozed off cuddled up to her neck and she's enjoying it greatly. Reluctantly she nudges you to wake you up. When you slowly open your eyes she grabs you between two claws. \"I think its time to turn in for the night.\" she tells you. She gets up and walks to the hall, carrying you in her boobs again. She at first heads for Roxy's room to drop you off but decides to enjoy your suggestive state. \"Lets head to my room.\" she tells you with a grin. \"Anything you say.\" you respond and start snuggling her boobs. Silently cheering, Dinah goes to her room with you in tow. When she gets there she locks the door and carries you to the bed. Her lust is growing, but so is her conscience. She begins to wonder if she should take advantage of you in this state or if she should let it leave your system. What happens?</span></div></div>",

In fact, the first time you met her, she sucked you up her trunk and would've dropped you in her mouth if Azure hadn't stopped her. This was not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elektra,\" you say. \"Come on, not this again, not so soon. Elektra, you're an elephant. Why eat me? You're supposed to be an herbivore.\" Elektra picks up a saltshaker with her trunk and starts to salt you. \"I'm not an elephant, Stephen. I'm a monster that looks like an elephant. I can't help it if you humans are nature's most perfect food.\" Elektra then clicks her pen. \"But I just finished breakfast myself and I might decide not to eat you, today that is. And if I do decide, you're entitled to a last meal, that way, you're good and stuffed.\" Elektra hold her pen with her trunk to her notepad as she continues to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know who was scarier, Paisley or Elektra. Arguably Elektra. At least Paisley couldn't leave the water. Elektra tapped her stomach with her free hand and you could see drool run down from the loxodon's lip to her chin. \"So, what will it be today, Stevie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely didn't trust Elektra, but you did want breakfast.

To your luck, before you even have to go on duty, Felicia had already put wood in the fire. You sigh in relief and decide to get warm. You look around and see that this was the area the ski guests hang out in when they visited. There were in fact five regular customers that usually showed up on the weekends to cut loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of them was Hippolyta the hippogriff. She was a likable monster, if a little obsessed. She was a treasure hunter and swore that there was something she was after in the mountains. According to Hippolyta herself, a wererhino pirate called Captain Blackhorn hid a treasure worth millions somewhere in the mountain area centuries ago and Hippolyta wanted to find it. Fortunately for you she wasn\u2019t particularly greedy and offered you some of the treasure if you wanted to come along. But you kept turning her down. Sometimes you wonder if that pirate\u2019s treasure really exists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course another of the regular customers was Connie\u2019s friend, Sora the wyvern. Sora was a photographer who took pictures and cut them up for art projects. According to Connie, Sora\u2019s gone on dates with as many men as there are species of monsters. Sora tended to flirt with you but she also saw humans as tiny seat cushions. She didn\u2019t sit on you hard enough to squish you, but she did have some sort of weird fetish when it came to humans. You\u2019ve seen her shiny pewter ass up close one time too many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a friend of yours who was also an enemy at the same time. A landshark by the name of Zoe. The hammerhead giantess saw humans as nothing more than food. But fortunately for you, Zoe lost her eyesight years ago and couldn\u2019t tell one species of monster from another. She assumed you were a shape shifting fairy and you decided to humor her. It disgusted you to be lumped in the same group with Stella but better safe than swallowed. Fortunately the shark woman could be very sociable to people she doesn\u2019t think of as food. You wonder how Zoe could snowboard like a pro if she couldn\u2019t see a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the more obnoxious guests was that condescending pegasus Blair. She saw herself as the best skater and the most beautiful monster in the world despite being as fat as Roxy. Blair saw you as an unintelligent slave and spoke to you as if she was talking to a little kid. She doesn\u2019t understand you work as an employee at the lodge and believes you\u2019re Azure, Roxy and Elisa\u2019s slave. Because of this, she thinks it\u2019s no big deal for her to order you around and expects you to do whatever she says. If you have to give her one more hoof massage, you are going to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most terrifying guest was Comet, a minotaur skier. Comet was also your friend Mesa\u2019s niece. While it\u2019s ambiguous whether or not Mesa would cook and eat you, Comet was blatantly dangerous to humans. She would squish or eat you on sight. But it wasn\u2019t always like that. She had a human boyfriend that she used to love more than anyone else. But one day Comet caught her boyfriend cheating on her with a salamander. She was so heartbroken at the betrayal, she thinks humans should go extinct and is out to see that happens. She especially hates you because you\u2019re a doppelganger of her ex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see a shadow cast over you. One of the regulars was in the room and you turn around to see which one it is.</span></div></div>",

Getting eaten is not fun, and plus you had so many close encounters, that it is almost impossible to decide where to start. You remember all the traumatic times that you got nearly ate by Paisley, that one son of a bitch you call a mermaid tried to kill you, and you remember all the bad memories you had with her. No wonder why you are saved so many times by Roxy, and even Chihiro herself. \u201cUh\u2026 Sora, I am not too sure about this. Don\u2019t you think this is going really really far?\u201d you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not silly, we are only going to be taking pictures of the moments that lead up to you getting devoured. You won\u2019t be actually devoured at all, and plus the reason I am doing this is that I want to show people how good humans are. Now true they are humans that I do like to keep as friends like you for one, but they are some really bad humans that deserve to get eaten. (Wade for example in Monster Gaol, but she doesn\u2019t know that at all), and I have invited a special partner that is going to be helping you on this job, I bet you will be really pleased to see her.\u201d Sora told her just as she reveals the mystery guest that was being lowered into the area (who was in somehow a very big container that no one saw that was real until now. It was filled with water). It was none other than Paisley (I am not explaining her looks again, so don\u2019t ask me, you know how she looks like by now). You were screaming in terror just as Paisley was swimming in the tank that Sora brought in a little while ago somehow, and Paisley sees you screaming and so she growls and etc. \u201cARE YOU FREAKING CRAZY?!!!!!!\u201d you shouted in terror as Sora (the wyvern dragon) comes over to calm you down. \u201cCalm down Stephen, call down, I promise you that this will be over quick, and plus, she won\u2019t eat you.\u201d She said just as she flapped her wings and gets her camera ready. Paisley then rises from the container and then comes over to the deck where you are waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPaisley, you better not eat me this time.\u201d You shouted to her, but Paisley smiled and snickered a bit. \u201cAh relax dude, she paid me 200 dollars to not eat you actually during the photo shoot. I am just going to get moments that leads up to the eating of you, and I promise that this won\u2019t take long at all, but any other time, I will come for you dude.\u201d She threatened to you, and then you just want to escape the photo shoot, as you never know if she will actually eat you for sure. You hope it isn\u2019t the case, but it could be. Sora seems to always have something interesting with you, but you are kinda scared of her as she tends to use you as a relaxing pillow or something. You just want to be done with this mess, as it\u2019s not good at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you in Stephen?\" Sora asked you, hoping that you would do this for Gulp Magazine. \"Oh what's wrong, is Stephen is too chicken to do it?\" Paisley mocked and mocked you like a chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your reaction?</span></div></div>",

Hippolyta wanders through the maze-like cave and eventually reaches a dead end. \"Well, at least we did our best...\" you begin to say, but she cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it!\" she yells. You don't understand Sensing your confusion she explains. \"There's air coming through this crack in the wall. There's something behind here!\" She's getting really excited. Unfortunately, no matter how hard she tries, the wall was too tough for any of her tools to break. \"Well,\" she says. \"Since we can't break the wall you'll have to head to the other side.\" She takes you out of her cleavage and lowers you to the crack. You honestly can't help getting a little excited too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way through the crack and come out on the other side. \"What do you see?\" she calls out. \"Nothing!\" you respond. \"Just a bunch of rocks frozen in ice!\" You make your way to the wall of ice and absentmindedly kick a piece thats sticking out. It breaks, causing various cracks to appear one after another. Sensing whats coming, you dive out of the way as the ice shatters and the rocks topple forward. The largest one smashes into the wall, cracking it open. Hippolyta strolls forward and plucks you off the ground. \"See? I knew you'd be a great treasure hunter!\" she says. The two of you make your way to the end of the cave, but what do you find?</span></div></div>",

But that's not what caught both yours and Hippolyta's attention. In the center of all the treasure was a giant, beautiful statue made of garnet crystal. It appeared to be a dragoness statue. It was twice Hippolyta's height. The statue had short, spikey hair made of amythests. It's eyes were solid emeralds. It's body was enormously fat. If she were human sized, she'd probably weigh 3 tons. The statue's huge breasts were resting on it's gargantuan belly, and it was sitting on it's enormous butt. The statue had a long tail and wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it!\" Hippolyta said happily. \"We actually found the treasure! I told you it was real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were actually right for once.\" You said, surprised. \"I'm amazed. How on Earth did Captain Blackhorn move a statue this big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares. We're going to be rich and famous.\" Hippolyta yelled. There was a tear in her eye. \"It's all so beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much.\" The statue replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you jumped. The statue was talking? \"You talk?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can.\" The statue said. \"My name is Lora. I used to be a member of Captain Blackhorn's crew. She must not have trusted me. While we were hiding this treasure, she hit me in the back with a curse. Believe it or not, I wasn't always a statue. That curse did this to me. She said that I would be this treasures guardian for all of time. I can leave anytime, but then she hit me with another curse. It made me so fat that I can't move. I've been stuck here for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze. That sucks.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know you want this treasure, but the curse means I have to guard it no matter what.

The wound even started to bleed from the crystal spikes. Lora opens her mouth wide enough that her mouth is somehow as big as Hippolyta and shows a large tongue made out of rubies with sapphires for teeth and an esophagus lined with peridot. She tries to swallow Hippolyta whole but Hippolyta quickly grabs a gold scepter to hold Lora's mouth open as Lora continues to roar. \"We better get out of here!\" you yell. Hippolyta runs on the ground and groans as the wound on her leg acts up and even hears her knee cracking. \"Hippolyta!\" you yell in worry. \"Don't panic,\" says Hippolyta. \"I'll be fine.

You let out a groan. \"You have got to be kidding me!\" you yell. \"I get chased by predatory mermaids, minotaurs and elephants and a dragon made out of crystal is what eats me!? WTH!\" You then start to hyperventilate and gulp. \"Don't panic, Stephen,\" you say. \"You've gotten out of worse situations than this in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then gasp and look around to see that Lora's stomach was filled with skeletons of humans and monsters who apparently tried to plunder Captain Blackhorn's treasure in the past and were eaten by the dragoness. You become more worried and see you are still waist deep in the amber stomach juices and climb upon the skull of a what appears to be a werebat and then shake off the amber liquid. You have no idea if the stuff is corrosive and there was no way for you to tell if these fallen humans and monsters were actually digested or they just starved to death and decayed over a long period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the booby traps and security measures you've seen in treasure hunting and adventurer films, none of them could prepare you for this kind of trap. You can only hear the sounds of Hippolyta and Lora fighting and there isn't even a sound of a heart beat or a digestive system. Then again, nobody could hear any form of bodily functions underneath all these crystals. You see that Lora's body appeared somewhat transparent from the inside but you can barely see what's going on, other than the fact that Hippolyta has picked up a shield in an attempt to fight off the dragon. Suddenly, things get really hot in the stomach and then you gasp. \"Oh no! Oh no! Dragon breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately duck as a stream of fire comes up from where Lora's intestines would be and fires up her throat for her to breathe the flames. The insides then shake and you tumble into a pile of human bones as the giant crystal dragon flies through the air. You bite on your nails and sweat. Even if Lora doesn't digest you (You don't know if she even could), you wouldn't survive if this keeps up.\" You have got to get out of here.</span></div></div>",

You and Hippolyta look on in surprise. \"Is that Felicia?\" you ask. \"What happened?\" asks Hippolyta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure gives a look of concern as Felicia continues to snore. \"I don't really know,\" she says in regards to her sleeping daughter. \"She was doing her job as a waitress when suddenly she said that she felt tired and then she plunked herself down for a nap. That's not like my daughter at all. I've never known her to slack off on the job.\" Felicia then lets out a yawn. \"Not so loud, Mom,\" she says. \"I'm trying to sleep.\" Felicia then begins to snore before the couch breaks under her weight.

She flashes you a smile and leans in close, which is a little awkward for Hippolyta seeing as you're back between her breasts. \"Well... \" she says. \"Now that I've adjusted a little to my situation, I've realized some things.\" You give her a confused look. \"The magic of that amulet may have preserved me perfectly, but it still feels like I've been asleep for years. It feels good to stretch my legs, but there are other things it feels like I haven't done in ages.\" She says that last bit suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second and then understand what she's getting at. \"Sorry, I'm not really interested!\" you say waving your hands frantically. Blackhorn looks surprised at this. \"I mean don't you mind that I'm a human?\" you ask, trying to diffuse the situation. Blackhorn brushes off your question. \"I'm a pirate, I do whatever I want! I'll have you know that I've been to bed with almost as many humans as I've eaten!\" Your eyes widen at that last statement. \"Don't worry though, I never eat my mates.\" she says with a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but i really think we should focus on getting out of this cold!\" you say. \"Come on Hippolyta, lets get a move on!\" The two of you move ahead towards the lodge. Its not that you don't find Blackhorn attractive, she really is. You've always had a thing for bigger women and she has a nice full body. Hippolyta once even told you that she was regarded as one of the sea's greatest beauties. Its just not your style to jump into something like that. Besides, you were into Connie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reach the lodge, what happens?  </span></div></div>",

You give her an awkward look. \"Actually....\" With that Blackhorn steps forward. \"Who is this?\" Roxy asks, eying her in confusion. \"This is Captain Blackhorn.\" Hippolyta says. Roxy looks skeptical. \"No really!\" you say. \"We found her in a cave! She's been sleeping for centuries!\" Roxy just stares at you. \"Uh huh.\" You sigh and decide to explain everything from the top. Once  you're finished Roxy suggests taking Blackhorn to see Azure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three of you reach Azure's office Hippolyta decides that Azure can handle things from here. She leaves as Blackhorn opens the door. Azure is sitting at her desk looking like she's in pleasure. When she spots the two of you she tells you to hold on. Then she reaches down her shirt near one of her breasts and pulls out her husband Vernon. She sets him on her desk and turns her attention to you. \"So how can I help you two?\" You explain Blackhorn's situation and Azure thinks for a minute. \"Okay, how about this? You can work here!\" Blackhorn looks shocked. \"A job? But I'm a pirate! I don't make money I take money!\" Azure leans back in her chair. \"Well you don't have a ship, crew, or treasure, so I doubt being a pirate will help you these days. And I don't think you plan on robbing my lodge all by yourself, so I'd suggest taking my offer.\" You look up at the wererhino and try to convince her. \"Its your best choice, we're just trying to help.\" She looks down and smiles weakly at you. \"Fine.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Blackhorn is given a dark purple maid outfit and placed in the cafe. She looks around with a semi-angry look. \"I can't believe she wants me to  wear this! I'm a captain for goodness sake!\" You try to reassure her. \"Don't worry, you look great!\" Your words seem to calm her down. \"Just listen to the other waitresses and you'll be fine.\" She lifts you to her face. \"Thank you, I don't think I'd be able to cope with all this without you.\" You could swear there was something in her tone, but shrug it off. You feel vibrations as another maid comes over. Its Felicia. \"Hi! You must be the new recruit my mom told me about. I'm Felicia!\" she gives Blackhorn a big smile and then turns to you. \"And its nice to see you again cutie!\" When she calls you cutie Blackhorn's eyes narrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of relationship do you two have?\" the wererhino asks. \"We're just friends.\" you answer, sensing a little trouble. \"Yeah we're just friends for now.\" Felicia adds. \"For now?\" Blackhorn says with a hint of jealousy. Then more vibrations signal the coming of another monster. \"For now?! What do you plan on doing with MY Stephen?\" Oh god its Dinah. \"YOUR Stephen?\" Blackhorn responds. The werecroc tries to snatch you away. \"Yes, MY Stephen. I love him and he belongs to ME!\" Blackhorn keeps you out of her reach. \"Well he rescued me from an eternal slumber, and we're going to go to bed with each other to celebrate!\" Your eyes go wide at this. \"Wait a minute! I didn't-\" But you are interrupted by Dinah. \"What!?\" she exclaims. You look over at Felicia and see that Blackhorn's statement has her looking annoyed too. And she's the nice one! \"I doubt Stephen would agree to that.\" she says with an offensive undertone. You certainly didn't! You don't even know why Blackhorn is acting like this! You thought she only wanted to mate! Now she actually has feelings for you?! You sigh in frustration. Not another one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls stand firmly. A rhino, a jaguar, and a crocodile, with you in the middle of it all. Before anything can happen though they are interrupted. \"Guys can you get to work please? We need to take care of the customers.\" Victoria says. \"Okay.\" Felicia says. \"Lets do our jobs, and the best waitress can have Stephen!\" Wait a second! You're not some prize. You try to protest but Blackhorn speaks first. \"Fine! Captain Blackhorn doesn't back down! I'll win and make him mine!\" Dinah of course can't stay silent. \"No way! He'll be mine!\" The other maids in the cafe roll their eyes. They decide to take turns holding you while they work, with Blackhorn going first. The three big beautiful women go their separate ways as you hang your head. How did this happen? You then see someone coming into the cafe. Who is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sigh and lay back on her midnight skin, wishing this whole situation was a dream. These three giant girls were competing for you, even if they decided this without any input from you. All you can do now is wait until their work is done so you can get out of here. You stare up at Blackhorn as she tends to her first customer. \"Um, what can I help you with today?\" she asks awkwardly. It will probably be a while before she gets used to this. After all, she's been a pirate until just today. Although the maid outfit does look good on her, and now that she's not wearing the pirate hat you have a full view of her hair. Its black and reaches down to her back. Its really pretty, and seems to be naturally straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blackhorn walks away from the table she glances down and catches you staring. She gives a loving smile and winks. Seriously, where did this come from? Is it because you're the first guy she saw after waking up? Whatever the reason, you'll just have to bear it. At least your presence is making her at ease. You feel your hair being ruffled as she rubs your head affectionately. Looking over you see that Dinah is giving Blackhorn a jealous look and Felicia is giving an angry pout. Then you see a new customer enter and gasp. Its April! She's a werewolf who also happens to be in love with you. What are the odds!? Seriously! You dive into Blackhorn's breasts in an attempt to hide yourself. You really don't need a werewolf thrown into the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackhorn however, notices your burrowing. \"Are you okay? You look a little tense.\" You look up and force a smile. \"Nope, just getting comfortable.\" you respond quickly. \"Oh, then let me help!\" she says and tucks you in with her finger.  You pray that one of the other maids takes care of April, but of course luck is not your friend.You see April getting closer and closer and quickly dive out of sight. \"Hello, my name is Blackhorn and I'll be your waitress.\" she still sounds a little stiff. As she takes April's order the werewolf's nose picks something up. She sniffs the air and looks at Blackhorn's boobs. Blackhorn notices and brings it up on her way to the kitchen. \"That wolf girl was staring at my chest. what was that about?\" You look up and shrug. \"Who knows?\" you answer, knowing fully well April probably picked up your scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackhorn gives Ripple April's order and picks up the order of her first customer. As she takes it the table April is still watching her. You try to stay out of sight, but your cover is promptly blown. Felicia walks up tho the two of you and demands that you be handed over. \"Its my turn to hold Stephen, so gimme.\" Blackhorn gives a resentful look, but gives you up. \"I'm only doing this because I know that I'll be the winner in the end.\" Once again you try to tell them that you didn't approve of their wager but once again you are ignored.As you switch girls you hear stomping and look over. Oh shit! April saw you and she's coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the werewolf reaches you she confronts Felicia. \"What are you doing with Stephen?\"she asks suspiciously. Felicia and Blackhorn eye her as Felicia answers. \"I'm holding him, the three of us are taking turns. We can't decide who should get him.\" Wow. That was straightforward. April gets a little angry at this. \"I'll tell you who should get him! Me! He's MY boyfriend!\" And with that the gauntlet is thrown. April's outburst lights a fire in their eyes and causes Dinah to rush over. The four girls begin squabbling over you, but manage to keep it civil. At least they remember where they are.  \"Can you stop fighting over that little twerp and get to work?\" Elektra calls over.  All four girls shoot her a look, but they do separate. Felicia smiles at April as she walks away. \"That's right, ma'am, we have jobs to do. Your waitress will bring you your food when its ready.\" April protests. \"I want my boyfriend!\" Felicia shakes her head. \"Sorry, but he's an employee here too. He can't just spend time with you.\" April stands her ground. \"Fine\" she says, and...</span></div></div>",

April won't take no for an answer however and persists. Eventually Felicia can't take anymore and calls her mother. When Azure hears the situation she turns to April. \"I'm sorry miss, but we currently have all the waitresses we need. We even just hired someone.\" Felicia chimes in from behind her mother. \"Yeah!\" April glares at her and Azure looks at her confused. \"You seem pretty determined about this sweety.\" Then she sees the way Felicia's holding you closely to herself. \"Oh I see whats going on.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you hear a crash and everyone looks to see what it was. Victoria was carrying a tray of food when both of her arms fell off. Camille rushes over to help clean up and Elektra picks up the two stray arms. Azure suddenly smiles and turns to April. \"Well it looks like a position just opened. One of our waitresses needs to get  off early so she can pull herself together, so you can work here just for today.\" April jumps for joy and the other waitresses protest. \"Mom! What are you doing?\" Felicia says. Azure gives her a sly grin. \"I'm rooting for you honey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that April is given  an orange maid outfit and put to work. She of course demanded to join the competition, something the others were against. \"What's the matter? Scared I'll mop the floor with all of you?\" April says smugly. The others then allow her to participate just to prove her wrong. These girls are going to send you to an early grave. When Felicia's turn with you ends she hands you over to Dinah, then Dinah gives you to April when the time comes. As you ride in Aprils cleavage you notice that she's sort of a natural at this. It kind of makes sense though. Despite the crazy love thing she is one of the nicest monsters you know. Accommodating others must be no problem for her. What now?</span></div></div>",

You remain like this until someone you recognize walks in. Its Blair, the pegasus girl. You don't really like her as she treats humans like inferior beings. You don't worry about it this time though because you have April with you. Following Blair is another pegasus girl that you know from the beach. Its Abilene, Blair's older sister. She has chocolate colored fur as opposed to Blair's yellow fur and white hair that she always has tied into pigtails. She usually dresses in a one piece bikini but  right now she's dressed in jeans with a pink sweater in addition to her cowgirl hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two winged horses sit down at a table and wouldn't you know it April is the one to serve them. As she hands them their menus Abilene spots you in her cleavage. \"Stephen? Is that you?\" You wave at her timidly. \"Uh, yeah. Hows it going?\" You would have rather avoided talking to her because you know she has a crush on you just like the other girls. It makes you wonder why so many girls are after you but you can never seem to make it with Connie. \"You know this human?' Blair asks her sister. \"Yeah, he's a lifeguard at the beach I work near. Sometimes patients escape and he helps to bring them back.\" You sigh in relief that she didn't say anything problematic, but as soon as you do she continues. \"And he's gonna be my boyfriend one day!\" As soon as she says this April stands up straight  and Dinah who was nearby strides over. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" April asks with her arms folded. Reading her response Abilene stands up. \"It means I love  him and I'm gonna have him.\" she responds. By this point the other girls have gathered around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou half expect an argument to break out but Blair interrupts. \"Excuse me but I'd like to order.\" she says impatiently. \"And would you sit down sis? Its embarrassing to hear you talk about that human like that.\" Abilene as well the four other girls round on her. \"What do you mean by that?\" They all say. \"He's a little sweetheart!\" Abilene tells her sister. \"Whatever can we just order? I'm hungry and being around this many of you is suffocating me.\" That seemed to break the tension and Abilene sits down in a huff. The  other waitresses and April go back to their duties. April takes their orders while Abilene stares at you in her breasts. After she shoots them one final glare she heads to the kitchen. You hang your head while April carries a tray. All these girls after you and not one of them is Connie. Maybe you should just muster up the courage to tell her your feelings. That might get these girls off your back.

I'm actually visiting my cousin who lives on the mountain.\" Even if she doesn't want to get you too close to her, April still likes Connie.They're not best friends or anything but they got along whenever they met on the beach. \"Hi Connie!\" you call to the giant naga. She notices you in Aprils boobs and smiles. \"Oh hey Stephen. Are you working here too? she asks. \"Sort of.\" you answer and then look up at your werewolf friend. \"Hey April, would you mind leaving me at the table while Connie looks at the menu?

Connie's a nice girl, but she doesn't know what she's missing out on.\" April tells you. As she talks you begin to see her in a different light. Before all she did was pursue you, but now she's trying to comfort you. She had loved you since she met you, but only now are you starting to appreciate it. \"Thanks April.\" you say with a smile. \"I'll need a little time, but I'll get over it.\" April hugs you to her cheek and is overjoyed to feel you return the hug. She has to stop herself from jumping for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day involves you being passed around from girl to girl until the cafe closes. They all try to flirt with you but your mind always drift towards April. When its time to close the girls can't decide on a winner for their competition. You didn't really expect any of them to admit defeat in the first place. April happens to have possession of you when she leaves so she takes you to you're room your staying in. \"So how are you holding up?\" she asks as she carries you. \"I'm okay. It was a big shock at first, but you helped me get through it. You've always been there for me, and I'm starting realize how important a friend you are.\" you tell her. April blushes at this and smiles. She had been waiting for you to say something like this to her forever. The two of you talk and decide that.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd feel bad leaving you by yourself.\" she says. Before you can can answer she begins walking toward the lodge exit. Normally you would protest and inform her that you wouldn't be by yourself because you're rooming with Roxy, but right now you honestly wouldn't mind spending some time with April. Besides it seems like she pretty much decided anyway. Even though she's trying to comfort you she's still her old self. Th two of you reach the door and she proceeds to stuff you into her shirt. \"Its pretty cold out, so just ride in here until we get there.\" she tells you. You relax and enjoy the softness of her furry breasts as she makes her way outside and through the snow. You feel comfort and warmth from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you hear a door shut and April pulls you out. \"Okay, here we are!\" she says. You look around and see that you're in a cozy looking cabin. \"So this is where you're staying?\" you ask. \"Yeah. Well, its my cousin's cabin, and I'm staying with her while I'm here.\" she answers. Her cousin? You start to wonder what she's like when you hear someone walking towards you. \"April? You're back?\" they ask. When they enter the room you see that its another werewolf. She's fat, but in a good way, and has gray fur with a reddish tint. She's wearing a pair of jeans and a sweater that hugs her body, emphasizing her generous figure. She sees you and looks at April. \"Who's the human?\" April lifts you to Selene's face and introduces you. \"Selene, this is Stephen. Stephen, this is my cousin Selene.\" she says to the two of you. Selene gives you a sniff. \"So this is your boyfriend?\" she asks. You look up at April at this and she gives you a smile. She's always telling people that you're her boyfriend. This time you don't mind playing along and return her smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you head into the next room. You can't help but notice the way Selene is looking at you. Before you can think too hard about it April speaks. \"Well the two of us have had quite a day, so we're going to get some sleep. The two of you can get better acquainted tomorrow.\" she says. \"Okay, good night April.\" Selene says and heads to another room. April carries you to a bedroom and closes the door. \"Hey April, does your cousin eat humans?\" you ask. \"Yeah, she loves them. Don't worry though, she wouldn't eat my boyfriend, so your safe.\" April assures you. The look Selene gave you before says different but you decide to trust April. You are then placed on the bed while April begins to undress. You immediately go red and try to avert your eyes but fail. April sees your reaction and laughs. \"Don't be so shy, you just spent all day in my boobs. Besides, your my boyfriend.\" Boobs are one thing, but she's totally naked! Also you're not technically her boyfriend, although you aren't really against the idea. You never thought you'd be feeling this way about the obsessive  April. Soon April lays down in the bed, causing you to tumble own the mattress and bump into her plump ass. She picks you up and gives you a smile and a lick. Where does this lead?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As her tongue runs over your body you give it a kiss, causing it to shoot back into her mouth. As she holds you above her face you see that she has a huge smile on her face. She's been waiting for this moment forever. You suddenly feel like that one little kiss sealed your fate. Her tongue shoots back out at you and caresses you more intimately. When she pulls it back she brings you to her lips for a series of kisses, which you return. Each time you kiss her back she becomes more and more enamored. You notice that she's panting as well and look at the rest of her massive body. From your vantage point you see that her other hand is buried between her legs. She's pleasuring herself while she covers you in her saliva. You stare in awe as this mountain of a woman is consumed by lust. Has this all been building up the whole time she's been chasing after you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril suddenly convulses for a second and finally lies still for a moment panting. She places you between her breasts and you try to relax as well. You don't get the chance as April nudges you with a claw. \"Ah ah ah, Stevie, you have work to do. My girls need some attention.\" she says as she presses her breasts together slightly. Part of you is surprised that she's still not satisfied but another part if excited as well. You grip her furry boob flesh and begin to climb the valley you're in. April moans as you grab handfuls of her flesh and the movement around you tells you that she's working down below again. When you finally reach the top you stare at the expansive body before you. Its like a beautiful landscape of curves and fur. Off in the distance you see her hand going into the canyon between her legs. She starts to buck up and down a little, causing you to fall over. Before you fall off of her boob you grab the nearest thing, her nipple. The second your hands grip it she squeals in delight and bucks even harder. Deciding to go with it you kiss and lick it, and even hug yourself to it. Above you April is biting her lip in anticipation. After a while you step it up and start nibbling on it. This drives her over the edge and she convulses again before laying still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both lay there for a minute resting until she picks you up once again. You look at her and see a lustful grin on her face before she begins moving you toward her nethers. Seems like she's ready for the finale. You are dropped between the furry columns that are her legs and find yourself assaulted by the scent of her womanhood. Its so strong you feel a little dizzy and at the same time turned on. April's claw returns and nudges you toward the inside of her legs. As you stand before her massive privates and inhale the scent in the air you can't hold back any longer. You step forward and go to work. Above you April is bucking harder than before while panting and moaning. As the both of you near the end she brings a paw down and presses you in to help things along. She actually begins to growl as she gets closer and when she reaches her limit she lets out a howl. Her paw leaves you and you find that you are stuck to her nethers and have to pry yourself off. You land on the bed with a plop while April pants above you, tongue hanging out. She picks you up and brings you to her face. \"I love you.\" she says before dropping you between her boobs and closing her eyes. You drift off to sleep as well with a smile.

Standing up you look toward April's head and see that she is still asleep. You decide to let her sleep and lay back down yourself. Just as you do however she yawns above you. Her eyes open and immediately lock onto you. A huge grin appears on her face and she grabs you between two claws. \"I can't believe we actually did that! It wasn't just a dream!\" she says happily. You chuckle awkwardly. \"Well you gave me quite a workout, you know that?\" you tell her. \"Well get used to it.\" she says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril gets out of bed with you still in her paw and grabs a towel. \"Time for a shower. I think we could both stand to get cleaned up.\" she says. She has a point. You smell yourself and feel your hair. Its a little hard from her dried juices. April enters the bathroom and gets in the shower. She holds you in one paw and turns on the water with the other. She stands there for a moment and allows the two of you to get wet. Then she grabs some soap. \"Okay, time to get you clean.\" she says and lathers you up. When she finishes with you she works on herself. She sets you on a small ledge on the wall and scrubs herself, taking care to make sure you're watching. She spends extra time on her breasts, and relishes the sight of you staring. When she finishes she picks you up and exits the shower. After the two of you are dry she carries you to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Stephen, time for some breakfast.\" April says. She opens the fridge and pulls out some eggs. You watch from the table as she begins to make french toast. She also cooks up several handfuls of pork that smells like bacon. As everything cooks a booming noise signals someone coming. A shadow appears over you and you look up to see Selene. she looks at you with hungry eyes before heading over to the fridge. You don't really know if being with April will stop her from eating you. Still, you have to admit that she's attractive. You get a good look at her giant ass as she digs through the fridge. It must run in their family. Both girls return to the table at the same time and set down their plates. April has french toast and bacon, while Selene has the same except a side of humans as well. You cringe as she gobbles them down. \"I wish you wouldn't eat that while we're here.\" April tells her cousin. \"Its not like I'm eating HIM,\" Selene says nodding to you. \"Besides, its my house.\" April rolls her eyes and begins eating, placing you on the plate as well. You dig in and eat your fill. April is a great cook. When everyone finishes April nudges you and you fall into a puddle of syrup. \"Whoops! Guess I should clean you up!\" she says and plops you onto her tongue. She swirls you around in her mouth until you're clean and spits you into her paw. \"Jeez, I thought you got enough last night from what I heard.\" Selene comments. You and April blush and look away. What are you doing next?</span></div></div>",

The girl you've been in love with for so long just turned you down. A giant finger gently begins to rub your head and you look up at Felicia. You're really thankful that she came over and rescued you from that situation. She had always  been a little sweet on you, and right now you're seeing it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reaches the other girls they all try to console you. You assure them that you're fine and tell them not to worry. Truth be told you feel more than a little sad, but for some reason being with Felicia helps you feel better. Even though all of these girls like you Felicia had always been the least crazy of them. She was a bit hyperactive at times, but now she's pretty calm as she tries to console you.

She saw the look in your eyes and knew that your heart had been broken. She's glad that you're taking it so well though. You lean against one of her fingers as she carries you in her paw and sigh. You enjoy its feeling and think to yourself that being with Felicia is really helping you. You honestly didn't expect to feel this way, but you may be over Connie sooner than you think.

After sitting down on her bed she crosses her legs and sets you on her lap. \"So are you sure everything's okay?\" she asks. \"Yeah,well as okay as I can be.\" you answer. A claw comes down and begins stroking your back. You're starting to enjoy it when the claw switches sides and pokes you in the stomach. You are pushed onto your back and Felicia starts tickling you.

Instead of taking you back to your room how about you just stay here?\" she suggests. You don't see any problem with that. You sleep in the clothes you have while Felicia goes and begins to undress.

She turns and sees that she's got you flustered. \"Oh, did I forget to tell you to cover your eyes?\" she says innocently. \"Well since you've already seen this much I guess there's no point in stopping now.\" Then she takes off her top to reveal her massive breasts.

The wererhino gently cups you in her hands as she carries you away. When she gets to the other girls she announces that its her turn to hold you and puts you in her cleavage. You just kind of sit there and try not to think about the rejection you just went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blackhorn serves her customers she glances down at you every so often. Seeing you so sad made her feel bad at first, but now its kind of annoying her. You let out a sigh when suddenly you are forced into the side of her breast. She's poking you gently but firmly with a smile. \"Why are you moping so much?\" she asks with a hint frustration. \"Its not the end of the world if that naga turned you down.\" You struggle to balance yourself in her boobs and look straight at her. \"You don't-\" you begin before her finger returns and pokes you back into the flesh. \"I don't what? I don't understand?\" she says. Then it hits you. She basically lost her entire life when she was frozen, yet she's coping with it. You helped her when she woke up, so now she's trying to help you during your hard time. This realization makes you see her a little differently. While you think this she's still pressing you into her boob, which you are starting to enjoy. Her skin is thick, with her being a rhino, but still very comforting. She catches you smiling, which makes her smile as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cafe closes the girls can't decide on a winner for their contest. You expected as much so you don't say anything. While everyone is starting to leave Roxy walks in. \"Hey guys, Azure wanted me to show Blackhorn to the room she'll be staying in.\" she tells you. Blackhorn follows her through the hall while holding you in her hands. \"So how did your first day go?\" Roxy asks. \"Anything happen?\" You and Blackhorn look a each other and blush a little. \"Nothing really.\" the wererhino answers. When you reach the door to her room Roxy stops and faces her. \"Okay this is where you'll be staying.\" she says. Then...</span></div></div>",

You can see that Blackhorn has some regret with giving you to Roxy, but she willfully regains her composure, opens her door to her room, looks back at both of you, then forcefully with a better tone says \"See you all on the next shift,\" the wererhino stares down at you with hidden disappointment while all this is said.

Okay, she definitely wasn't Roxy or Elisa. As far as you know, Elisa's eyes didn't glow. That's why she usually relies on her fire breath to see in the dark. There was definitely no way it could be Roxy. Roxy's eyes glowed red, like all female gargoyles. You never knew why gargoyle eyes glowed in different light depending on the gender.

You land on her foot and hold on for dear life. Eventually you are thrown from her furry foot and land on Dinah's scaly foot. You are then thrown from here into the air. You come down into the fray and grab onto April's tail. As the girls fight you are swung back and forth until you fly off and across the room. You smack right into Dina's tail and try to keep a better grip this time. These two don't even realize they're throwing you back and forth. They're just duking it out like an old monster movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinah tries to swing around and smack April with her tail, but April grabs onto it just in time. In the midst of her battle she happens to spot you hanging on to the scaly appendage. Her expression instantly softens. \"Oh Stevey!\" she cries, grabbing you and letting go of the scaly appendage. \"Are you okay? I'm so sorry I didn't notice you!\" Dinah sees you and also joins in while trying to butt April out of the way. \"Are you hurt baby? I'll take care of you!\" They shoot each other angry looks and you're afraid they're going to start fighting again. However in a stroke of good luck Azure walks back into the room. \"Dinah, we need you back in the cafe.\" Dinah looks at April and April smiles smugly. \"Yeah, they need you. Besides, Stephen here was told to be my guide, so we should get going too.\" Dinah grits her teeth, but Azure calls her again and she begrudgingly walks away. \"Now that the tramp is gone, lets get back to our quality time.\" April says to you with a smile. Where does she want to go?</span></div></div>",

You try to keep the mood light and look around. You spot a bunch of wood carvings on a nearby table. \"What are those?' you ask. \"Oh, those are Selene's work.\" April answers. \"She makes wood carvings and takes them to the lodge so they can sell them as souvenirs. I help a little since I have experience selling crafts.\" She then sits you down on the table. The carvings are small to the two wolves, but you still have to look up at them. \"These are really good.\" you note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene smirks. \"Of course they are. Sculpting is my specialty.\" April picks you back up and carries you to a window. \"Look, outside.\" she tells you. Through the snow you can see shapes which you realize are ice sculptures. There are quite a bit of them. As you marvel at her work Selene cuts in. \"Impressed?\" You nod your head. \"Yeah! All your sculptures are great!\" She leans in closer. \"Thank you. I can do a lot with sharp instruments.\" she says, flashing her teeth. April pulls you closer to herself. What now?</span></div></div>",

Her demeanor changes when April looks her way however. As much as it pains you, you feel the need to stick close to April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wolves walk to another room to eat. April hugs you to her chest before sitting you down on the table. The softness of her furry breast is admittedly nice. \"Okay, just let us cook up something and we'll all have a nice meal.\" she tells you and gives you a smooch. \"Um, you have something for a human like me?\" you ask. April smiles. \"Well as you know, I don't eat humans. I do eat their livestock though. I was going to have some cattle and chickens, and it would be easy to cook up a little for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the table and watch the two of them work. Even if you wish you could get out of here, you have to admit both of them look pretty good. You observe their figures from behind and take notice of their plump asses and furry tails.

Soon they walk over to the table and set down the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou note that when April said they'd prepare \"a little\" for you, it was obviously relative to them. You find an entire cow and chicken before you, both completely cooked. You look over and see that your meal is but a fraction of April's. You look at Selene's plate and shiver. She's not only got livestock, but cooked humans as well. You try to dig in to your food, which April cuts for you with her claws, since they have no human utensils. As you eat you look up at April and marvel at how she eats more than one cow at a time. You obviously can't finish all of yours and April eats the remains in one gulp. You look over at Selene for a split second and immediately look away as she gobbles up some humans. Once everyone's done, what do you do? </span></div></div>",

Mesa told you that Comet had been dating a human boy for five years and she adored him. But one day, she caught her boyfriend cheating on him with a salamander girl from Horrorville. Comet was so upset with what happened that she developed an outright hatred of humans to the point where she'd smash or eat them on sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Comet walks in, she lets out a snort and prompts you to hide behind some firewood by the fireplace. Is Mesa was to be believed, Comet's boyfriend looked a lot like you, which is why, whenever Comet saw you, she would be filled with great rage and try to kill you on sight. That heifer was downright horrible. From the looks of it, Comet had come back from skiing and laud her skis on the coffee table as she took a seat and took off her hat before letting her hair down. You watch her carefully to make sure she doesn't see you. You once saw Comet stomp a human on the beach into the ground and then crush another one into a bloody smear between her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact was that Comet just plain scared you. The only human safe from her wrath was Vernon and even then Comet told Azure that Vernon was going to betray her one day. While Comet reached into her coat to take out and eat a candy bar, she spotted Sora walking past her and gave her an angry glint, prompting the wyvern to stop in her tracks. \"Get.\" Muttered Comet. \"Excuse me?\" asks Sora. \"Get,\" says Comet. \"I don't like your kind around here.\" Sora lets out a slight growl. \"Can't say I like you much either, stupid cow.\" The reason Comet was nasty towards Sora was because Sora was a wyvern, a type of dragon. The monster who stole her boyfriend was a salamander, another type of dragon. Because of that, any monster in the dragon family was automatically an enemy of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sora walked away, Comet took a few bites of her chocolate before...</span></div></div>",

When that happens she could pile drive Roxy despite your gargoyle friend being A) more than twice Avery's size and B) way too heavy for a monster Avery's size to lift. It all started when she was twelve and she and her human boyfriend were kidnapped by a vampire serial killer. The murderer through some strange method caused Mark to generate so much blood that he inflated and exploded. The killer was going to drown Avery in her dead boyfriend's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Avery went berserk and tore the killer to pieces with her teeth and was rumored to have eaten some. When the cops finally showed up, Avery was the one to be arrested and was given 25 years in the K.D.P. You're certain that Avery being put in a mental hospital at such a young age screwed up Zoe.

On her back were medium sized wings. But you weren't focusing on that. Your attention was on her breasts. They were ENORMOUS. You couldn't see her torso behind them. She was wearing a grey business suit, showing off a lot of cleavage, and high heels. Next to her was a slim gorgon girl with blue scales holding a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized her as Breccia Stone, the CEO of Stone Inc. and one of the richest women in the world, second only to Marah Screamson and Sasha Rasto. Stone Inc. was a massive company with many facets, but it's biggest business was in travel. The company owned several hotels and travel agencies. She was known for being cold and calculating, but she was friendly towards humans and her girlfriend Slitha, who you assumed was the woman gorgon next to her. She was also famous for a charity/home that helped women with Lactose Overload Syndrome, a condition that only affected gargoyles, werewolves, and succubi. It made their breasts enormous and full of milk, but prevented them from lactating. Breccia was one of the more well-known cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wondering what she was doing at such a small place like Grimmly Lodge, so you went over to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreccia looked down at you. \"Oh, hello.\" She said in a French accent, bending over to talk to you.

Azure had walked in and heard the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreccia stood up, her breasts sloshing again, and looked at Azure. \"Yes. I have a feeling that you will see an increase in lodgers and finances if you sell to Stone Inc. Maybe even do some repair work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we talk this over in my office?\" Azure asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.

Sitting down, Breccia's breast completely filled her lap. Breccia noticed you walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Stephen right? We were just talking about you.

But she has a use for it in the summer and some of spring.\" Azure explained to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You ask. Grimmly Lodge closed in the summer and was empty. \"What are going to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple. During the summer, Grimmly Lodge becomes Grimmly Spa and Health Resort. It's going to be for women who have Lactose Overload Syndrome like myself. It will include massage palors, hot tubs, a bar, a gym, and specialty lodging designed to fit werewolves, succubi, and gargoyles. Azure will be manager for when it's Grimmly Lodge, and I have a gargoyle lined up to be manager for when it's Grimmly Spa and Health Resort.\" Breccia explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have this figured out.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trying to get this spa and resort off the ground for some time, but couldn't find a location. When I learned that this place is closed in the summer, I jumped at the opprotunity. It will still be owned by Azure, but it will be a part of Stone Inc. We will also need to do a little construction. Things like widen doors, add sports courts, create new rooms, ect.\" Breccia continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Azure started \"She actually has a job lined up for you, Stephen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're a ski instructor at the lodge and a lifeguard at the beach, but how would you like to add masseur to that resume? You will recieve on the job training.\" Breccia told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sounds like fun.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now if you will excuse me and Azure, we must finish our business.\" Breccia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the office. You couldn't believe it. Not only was this place going to be open in the summer as a spa, but you would get to work there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour late, Azure and Breccia left the office. Azure had agreed to the business plan and Breccia would convert the lodge in the following summer.

Breccia had told you that any day where you weren't working at the beach, you could take your masseur job at the lodge/spa. You couldn't wait to see what was going to happen.  The lodge switched to the spa 2 weeks ago, but you hadn't had the chance to see it until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the parking lot of the lodge. From the outside, it looked no different, with the exception that the front doors were wider. You walked up and slipped through the bottom crack of the door. The inside wasn't as different from the outside, but for some reason, you thought it felt different. Maybe it was because you were never here in the summer until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see that, even though it switched to spa only two weeks ago, business was booming. The lobby was filled with new patrons, all with Lactose Overload Syndrome. Though they had the same condition, their breast sizes varied. Some women's breasts were only slightly bigger than their head, while other's obscured their torso's. One gargoyle's breasts were somehow bigger than she was (you'd never heard of women with LOS getting that large).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gargoyle walked up to you. She was only 100 feet shorter than Breccia, but had similarlly sized breasts. She had grey skin, yellow eyes, and yellow hair. She was smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Stephen. My name is Graphia. I'm going to be your manager during the summer.

She walked into the palor and, instead of lying on a table, lied down on her breasts, which were big enough to BE a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was lying down, you got a better look at her. She had to be around 1200 feet tall. Her hair was long, reaching her wings, and indigo. Her eyes were blue. With the exception of her massive breasts, her body was fairly slim. You had to wonder how she even moved with those breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephen, this is Kana. She will be your first client. Your job is to massage the backs of clients.

It feels like sandpaper to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sighed. \"Alright. Let's prop you up. Stephen, get your arm band back on. This might take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla walked over to Kana and manuvered her to sit on a nearby table, with her breasts resting on the floor. Carla then picks you up and drops you on top of Kana's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck Stephen. You're going to need it.\" Carla says before turning her attention to another werewolf who walked in.

Massageing the front was WAY harder than the back. First, there was much more area to cover. You also had to deal with her cleavage, which was a canyon to you.

You could barely get any footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, though, you manage to almost finish after nearly 7 hours. You just have one more spot to cover.

She's loves to dream, and come up with fantastic worlds and amazing characters. So it's fitting that she is a novelist. Her most famous series is the \"Zyzoranda Dimension\" series, about an amazon who saves the dimension of Zyzoranda from an evil werecat sorceress. When not writing, she's either brainstorming for her next book, or admiring her crush, Elisa Starking. If it isn't Elisa, then she's admiring her dream type of woman: women with enormous rears.</span></div></div>",

Her enitre body was made of transparent purple slime. The slime on top of her head was made to look like short, spikey hair. Even her eyes were solid purple slime. She had the appearance of a pear shaped woman with a medium waist and C-cup breasts. She didn't have any legs: her lower half was a slimey tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized her as Ivy Noroi. She lived alone in a nearby cabin and didn't come by very often. The few times she was here, she was doing one of three things: brainstorming her next idea, flirting with Elisa, or flirting with her type of woman: women with enormous rears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was a famous novelist, best known for her \"Zyzoranda Dimension\" series. They were fantasy novels about an amazon fire nymph who saves the dimension of Zyzoranda from an evil werecat sorceress, which is made difficult by the sorceress being her lover. The books were insanley popular, so she was usually working on her next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to find out why Ivy was here, so you called up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ivy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy looked don and noticed you. She then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Stephen. What's going on?\" She asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here today?\" You yell up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brainstorming my next novel. I'm going to try and write a murder mystery, and I want to set it in a ski lodge.\" She told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds cool. Need any help?\" You ask. You did want to see Ivy's writing in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not. You can help me with...\" Ivy started to say before getting distracted. A succubus with an enormous ass walked in and took Ivy's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ivy?\" You yell, trying to get her attention back. \"Ivy? IVY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy suddenly looks at you. \"Huh? What? Oh, sorry Stephen. That succubus caught my eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding.

Want to come with?\" Ivy asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I've never seen her here before, so I might as well get to know her.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Ivy replied, before picking you up. You partially sank into Ivy's slimey hand, but she didn't notice and walked over to the succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her clear purple hand, you saw the succubus. She was facing away from you, looking out the window. She looked about 100 feet shorter than Ivy. She had long hair tied in a ponytail, horns on the top of her head, a spade tail, and medium bat wings. Her upper half was slim, but that wasn't her defining feature. What both you and Ivy noticed was her massive rear. It was easily Elisa's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You heard Ivy say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus turned around. Now facing you, you saw her breasts were medium sized. When she saw Ivy, the succubus smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh. Ivy Noroi. I can't believe your here. My name is Jenny Arker, I'm a HUGE fan of yours.\" The succubus said quickly in a Texan accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Good to meet a fan. This is Stephen. He works here.\" She opened her hand to show you to her. Since you weren't looking THROUGH the hand anymore, you saw that the succubus (Jenny) had black hair, grey eyes, and orange skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ms. Arker.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" Jenny said curtly. She then turned her attention back to Ivy. \"Anyway, I love Zyzoranda. My favorite book is the 7th one 'The Fall of Zyzoranda Tower'. Where on Earth did you get the idea for High Priest Neko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ivy and Jenny continued to talk, you thought to yourself 'This woman really likes Ivy's books. I mean, yeah, they're good, but not perfect. There is some slow pacing and I wished Ivy would explore the relationship with the two leads more. Maybe I'll bring it up to her later.' You though to yourself. You looked up and saw that Ivy was finishing an autograph for Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you SO much.\" Jenny yelled happily. \"Now, you're probably wondering about my butt. Yes I saw you looking. Well, I saw you at a book signing 8 months ago. You said you liked women with truly massive asses. So I used a special workout to make my butt as big as possible, just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Ivy's smiled wavered. \"Really?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and don't worry, I plan on going even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear. Well, me and Stephen need to go. He's going to help with my next book.\" Ivy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Bye\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye.\" Ivy replied before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obsessive fan. I've had to deal with them before. They're nice, but way too clingy.\" Ivy replied. \"You want to go to my cabin to help me?\"<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAn hour later, you were at Ivy's small log cabin, a small walk away from the lodge. Ivy was at her typewriter, while you were standing next to it. So far, you got the first chapter done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. So we've had our first victim. Now how do we introduce our lead?\" Ivy asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could anwere, there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not expecting anyone.\" Ivy said before getting up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shadow you see makes you turn pale as it is a large and obese shadow resembling a humanoid elephant. It was a loxodon and the only loxodon you knew was Elektra; a.k.a. the land equivalent of Paisley. You thought elephants were supposed to be vegetarians, but Elektra was just as bent on eating you as Paisley was and was more mobile than her. You could not believe it. And no Roxy or Elisa to defend you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously turn around to get a good look at what you believe to be your impeding doom. But you look in surprise because this was a different loxodon. She looked similar to Elektra, being a loxodon that resembled an Asia elephant and therefore of the variety with tuskless female but she was 350ft taller than Elektra and had a slightly larger stomach. She had a bluish shade to her black hair and her skin was a pale white color that resembled vanilla ice cream. She was dressed in a black and turquoise-colored Gothic Lolita outfit with a skirt, striped sleeves and leg warmers and skull-shaped earrings and a hair clip that was shaped like a bat. Her eyelids, toenails and fingernails were also painted black and she was holding an umbrella in her trunk that resembled a mollusk of some sort. The oddest thing was that she was levitating slightly off the ground with one of her legs lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loxodon notices you and is just as surprised to see you as you are of her. \"Oh,\" she says. \"You must be Stephen.\" You give a look of surprise but before you could ask how this elephantine giantess knows your name, you notice a human hiding behind her left ear and he appeared to be shivering. He was scrawny and had blond hair and was a pair of khaki pants with a gray hoodie and boots. He looked to be in his early 20s. You raise an eyebrow. This loxodon wasn't anything like Elektra. Not if there was a human on her that wasn't inside her. \"Uh, yeah. I'm Stephen. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loxodon girl gestures to the human behind her ear that it's safe to come out of her ear and then he climbs onto the loxodon's finger. From your angle, you notice that this loxodon girl has <i>fangs</i>. Both in her mouth and in her trunk. \"H-Hello,\" says the loxodon's human mate as he waves to you. \"I'm Allen Van Richter and this is my wife, Salli.\" \"Van Richter?\" you think to yourself. That was Elektra's last name. And from what you knew about monster culture, the husband takes the family name of the wife, unlike the case with humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli holds down her trunk and you nervously shake it, being very wary of the fangs in the trunk. \"Uh,\" you say. \"You wouldn't happen to be related to a loxodon named Elektra would you?\" Salli lets out a sigh as Allen gives a nervous look. \"Yep,\" Salli says. \"She's my mom. I take it you know her.\" \"Actually,\" you say. \"She's tried to eat me several times!\" Allen lets out a groan. \"Yeah. She tends to do that.\" Salli laughs nervously. \"Well, you don't have to worry about me. I don't eat humans.\" Then Salli grabs you with her trunk and puts you on her shoulder next to Allen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip. \"Uh,\" you say to Allen. \"Not to be rude, but why does your wife have fangs? Loxodons don't have fangs.\" \"Salli isn't 100% loxodon,\" said Allen. \"Her dad is a vampire.\" Your eyes pop. Vampire? That would explain the fangs and the levitation but for a vampire to get that close to Elektra? \"I didn't know Elektra was married.\" \"Not anymore,\" says Salli. \"My folks have been divorced for years and I was raised by my father in Direopolis. It's a mountain village that's far from here.\" \"And it's full of crazies,\" says Allen. \"So Salli and I took my brothers and their wives out for a retreat.\" You raise an eyebrow. \"Brothers? Wives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen laughs nervously. \"Well, my older brother, Wes married a werehippo and my younger brother, Norman, he married a wereboar.\" \"They have good taste,\" you mutter to yourself. \"Uh. Where are they right now?\" Salli let out a sigh. \"Knowing them, Pam probably got them lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in what appears to be the bottom of the ocean near the ruins of Atlantis, there is a car driving through the bottom and inside it are two female monsters as tall as Salli. One of them was a pink-skinned werehippo with golden red hair and a tattoo of a pyramid over her right eye. She was also wearing earrings shaped like scarab beetles. The driver was a brown-skinned were boar giantess with long blonde hair, six tusks and leather wings growing out of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the last time I let you drive, Pam,\" says the hippo woman in an annoyed tone. \"I should've known you'd get us lost.\" \"What choice did you have, Patty?\" asked Pam the boar giantess. \"You don't even know how to drive.\" In Patty's belly button was a tan-skinned bespectacled human male with black hair and a goatee and he rolled his eyes. \"That's a very generous definition of \"knows\" in your case, Pam.\" There was a buff young man with short blonde hair who looked like a beefier version of Allen, riding in Pam's cleavage and her glared at Patty's husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the lodge, you decide to ask several questions. \"So, Allen. How did you and Salli meet?\" \"Well,\" says Allen. \"We met in Gooseshout High in Direopolis.\" \"Wait? A human enrolled in a school for giant monsters?\" \"Oh,\" says Allen. \"You don't have to worry. Me, Wes and Allen are descendants of Achilles. We're indestructible.... except for our heels.\" \"Then how did you wind up in...\" \"Because our older sister went to the same school.\" \"Sister?\" Salli lets out a laugh. \"Actually, Corona is Allen's step-sister. That's what happens when your dad marries a minotaur.\" \"Minotaur? Corona? Corona Poe! The actress!? A lot of Terrordale monsters are colossal fans.\" \"Well, Corona is the one who introduced me to Salli and then I introduced my brothers to Salli's friends. Of course, Pam and Norman got married as soon as they could after high school, then Wes and Patty got hitched and finally, I proposed to Salli.\" \"I doubt your in-laws took it well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli gave a nervous laugh. \"Well. Actually Dad gets along find with Allen and Mom is kind of apathetic to Allen.\" \"I see. So, what do you two do in Direopolis?\" Salli levitates higher and closes her umbrella before she speaks. \"Well,\" she says. \"We, my brothers-in-law and their wives run a restaurant called Neo Neapolitan. Patty and Wes are in charge of the kitchen, Allen and I wait tables and Pam is the delivery girl.\" \"So you're a waitress? Like mother like daughter. What kind of restaurant is Neo Neapolitan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the Van Richters give a nervous laugh. \"Well,\" said Salli. \"I wanted the place to be a burger joint but Patty wanted it to be a pizzeria and ice cream parlor and Pam wanted to turn it into a donut shop. We came to a compromise and made it all four. Then last year, I had the idea to add pancakes to the menu.\" \"What?!\" you yell. \"A restaurant that's 1/5 pizzeria 1/5 ice cream parlor 1/5 pancake house 1/5 burger joint and 1/5 donut shop?! What the actual heck?\" \"Believe me,\" says Salli with a sigh. \"You should see some of the customers. Oh. I'm hungry. Come on, Allen. Let's see how a different restaurant measures up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink as Salli levitates into the cafe and plops down onto two chairs before putting her umbrella down. These two were obviously from a very weird side of the monster world. Just who shows up to wait on the Van Richters' table?</span></div></div>",

But she wouldn't try and devour you in front of her daughter, would she? Salli clearly wasn't a human eater, but it's possible that Elektra tried to copy her diet onto her daughter. As you're trying to figure out your next move, that man-eating elephant has reached your table. \"Welcome to the Grimmsly Cafe,\" says Elektra. \"I'm Elektra and I'll...\" At that moment, Elektra realizes who is at the table and gives a look of surprise. \"Salli?\" she asks. Salli smiles and wraps her trunk around her mother's. \"Hi, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElektra is speechless and hugs her much larger hybrid daughter. \"What are you doing here, Salli?\" asks Elektra with a giggle. Salli gives a laugh. \"The girls and I decided to take a vacation and I convinced Patty and Pam that a skiing trip would be the perfect excuse to see you.\" Elektra smiled and then saw Allen trembling in fear behind the salt shaker and lets out a sigh. \"Hello, Allen.\" She says. Allen nervously waves to his mother-in-law. \"I still can't believe you married a human, Salli. But I'm not one to talk.\" Elektra then sees you and you gasp. \"Stephen,\" she grunts. \"It's lucky for you that my daughter and my son-in-law are here, or I'd swallow you on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli let out a sigh. \"Come on, Mom,\" she says. \"Humans make much better company than they do food.\" Elektra let out a sigh. \"You're definitely your father's daughter, Salli. Speaking of which, how is that blood guzzler doing.\" You gulp because Elektra said that last part with a venomous tone in her voice. Apparently she and her ex-husband weren't on good terms. \"He's doing fine,\" sighs Salli. \"But he misses you. When are you going to come back to Direopolis.\" Elektra gave a scoff. \"You must be joking. And why can't Dimitri come and face me himself? I'm better off without him and I'm pretty sure that human-shaped wood tick feels the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Allen out of curiosity. \"What happened between Salli's parents, Allen?\" \"I don't know,\" says Allen. \"They were divorced before I even met Salli and Salli never told me anything. I'm sure she knows but refuses to speak.\" Then you see Elektra let out a sigh. \"What hurts the most is that I can never forget what happened,\" says Elektra. \"But enough, how is Neo Neapolitan doing.\" \"Doing great,\" says Salli. \"I remembered the pancakes you used to make for me and convinced Patty to add them to the menu since the last time we saw each other.\" Elektra let out a haughty laugh. \"Like that pink river horse could improve upon my pancake recipe. Speaking of which, chocolate chip with french toast, whipped cream and cinnamon and a glass of blood orange juice, right?\" Salli smiles and nods her head. \"You know me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Elektra kisses her daughter and walks off towards the kitchen to tell Ripple her daughter's order. You give a sigh of relief. \"I guess there's some decency in Elektra after all.\" Allen let out a sigh of relief. \"She's not always a mean man-eater. It's just that she doesn't bother with me because I can't be digested.\" Salli shrugs her shoulders. \"I never really cared for the taste of human myself.\" Elektra then takes an apple out of a nearby fruit bowl with her trunk and sinks her fangs into it to cause it to wither as she sucks it dry and then sprays the juice into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have exotic taste, Allen,\" you tell Allen. \"A vampire elephant? That's surreal.\" \"My sisters-in-law aren't exactly normal monsters either.\" Says Allen. \"Uh,\" you say. \"Allen. Tell me about your brothers and their wives.\" \"Well,\" says Allen. \"Wes is the most level-headed of us, but he's got a sharp tongue on him. Opposites attract I guess because Patty has got quite a temper on her and gets annoyed easily.\" \"She's a werehippo, right? Doesn't surprise me. They're known for having ferocious attitude.\" Salli then lowers her head to speak. \"Don't forget, Patty's dad is a human and yet he gives Wes more grief than her monster mother.\" You were shocked at that. You had no idea that humans and monsters were capable of interbreeding. Then you realize something. \"Wait,\" you think to yourself. \"If Patty is half human and Wes is 100% human, then any child they have would only be 1/4 monster. But would they come out monster or human? That's a frightening thought.\" You then cough and shake your head. \"Patty is the cook at Neo Neapolitan, isn't she.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli nods her head. \"Patty's the best... er, second best cook I've ever seen. My cooking is mediocre compared to hers and Pam only knows how to make donuts.\" You had to wonder how Patty could keep up. It sounded like she was the only one in the kitchen and yet she had to juggle with preparing at least 5 different types of food. It also sounded like Patty was the big boss around Neo Neapolitan. \"And your other, brother?\" you ask Allen. \"Norman?\" asks Allen. \"Well, in contrast to Wes, he's hot-headed, reckless and immature. He and Pam are a perfect match. Those two are always getting themselves into trouble or otherwise screwing up. Patty is always flustered with them. Pam's job is to deliver takeout since it's the only thing she can do right, Salli can't go out in the sunlight and Patty doesn't know how to drive.\" \"I see. She's the wereboar, right? Don't tell me, she's a hybrid too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" says Salli. \"Pam is 100% wereboar. But the strangest thing, she was born with wings. Nobody else in her family has them, so she's basically a mutant.\" You blink. This family was really bizarre. Three indestructible brothers, a minotaur actress for a stepsister and three wives consisting of a half-human hippopotamus, a vampire elephant and a literal flying pig. You then cough. \"Uh. You mentioned that Corona Poe was your sister-in-law, Salli. Do you and Corona get along?\" Salli lets out a sigh. \"Corona gets along fine with me and Patty, but she hates Pam. Her boyfriend was devoured by a wereboar a long time ago and the wereboar in question looked similar to Pam.\" \"I'm really sorry,\" you say. \"Now tell me, Direopolis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Direopolis is the weird part of the monster world,\" says Allen. \"All our customers are weirdos with some strange quirk or another. We've got a catoblepas who is trying to combine basketball and sumo, a Jersey Devil archer who eats nothing but garlic, a sabertooth tiger mad scientist, a Nemean lion witch doctor, an elderly werecheetah who may or may not have been a phantom thief 100 years ago, a succubus who fancies herself a super villain...\" \"Good grief,\" you say. \"It sounds like you set up shop in crazy town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Into the lobby waddled somebody you did not wish to see and this causes you to groan. \"So much for having some peace. The woman who came in was Shelby Pogovodon, a 735ft tall ogopogo, a monster resembling a more unpleasant counterpart to a Loch Ness Monster. Shelby was a green-skinned monster with a bright red mohawk and long tail. However, the most noticeable thing about her was that she was missing one of her arms. It was eaten off by an unknown creature. You don't know what it was and you don't want to know, given how large and horrifying such a beast would have to be. For some reason, Shelby hadn't gotten a prosthetic arm and left the stump exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelby was also enormously obese, even more so than Roxy, Felicia and Dinah. Her belly even touched the ground as she walked. Shelby was a would-be BBW model. However, the reason she was so enormous was mainly as an excuse to attract you. She was yet another stalker much like April, Felicia, Dinah and Abilene and you had enough suitors already. She was swimming by when she saw you rescue a human kid from drowning. Being a lifeguard, it was your job but Shelby saw you as a hero and just your luck, she had a thing for heroes. She's been packing on the pounds ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't going to get any peace if that bloated ogopogo saw you, so you try your best to sneak away. As you do, you notice that Shelby was wearing nothing more than a pink bikini with yellow decorations of dinosaur teeth. It was abnormal attire for the slopes, but you heard that ogopogos loved the cold, so it made sense. As you were trying to slip away, you stop as the Canadian cryptic puts her webbed feet on the ground, nearly crushing you, and then turns on the television in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the television was a cartoon of the infamous Dr. Madman and the cyborg maniac appeared to be inside a computer and was taking apart a wall made up of data and eating everything. \"Mmm,\" he said. \"Emergency contact information. At that moment, Dr. Madman's arch nemesis, the bounty hunter, Mangaga, came in to confront him. \"Dr. Madman!\" yells Mangaga. \"What are you doing?!\" \"Eating those files,\" said Dr. Madman as he continued to eat the binary code. \"With no left overs. Mmm.\" Dr. Madman then took out a carton of milk from his belly bag and chugged it before letting out a belch. \"Nothing like milk and <i>cookies</i>. Get it?! We're in a computer!\" Mangaga lashed his arm out at Dr. Madman but accidentally broke the firewall and caused a stream of numbers to sweep him away as he yelled. Dr. Madman shook his head. \"And people call <i>me</i> destructive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" groans Shelby as she activates the Hex Finity function on the television. \"I can't stand this guy. He's so annoying. Aha, here we go.\" You mentally gag as you figure out which movie she ordered. It was a horror movie called the Red Freighter. It was supposed to be a horror/comedy film with a generous definition of <i>supposed to be</i>. Truth is, the Red Freighter was one of the worst movies ever created. Then again, Shelby had bad taste in movies. On the screen, there was a red freighter floating at the docks and from the looks of it, it was in terrible shape as the crew was getting on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you were about to leave the lobby...</span></div></div>",

Before you can get out of the way, Shelby gets her enormous self right out of the seat and waddles her way over before she grabs you. The ogopogo lifts you up in the air and then sniffs you and even licks you as you yell. Her tongue is as cold as ice and causes you to tremble in pain. \u201cIt is you!\u201d yells Shelby happily. \u201cHey, Stephen! What\u2019s shaking!\u201d Shelby lets out a laugh and presses you into her green and scaly cheek. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Stephen?\u201d You laugh nervously. \u201cI kind of work here, Shelby.\u201d Shelby gives a blink. \u201cYou do! That\u2019s excellent!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan and shake your head. With how many would-be suitors that you had, Shelby included, it sometimes made you think you\u2019d be better off with predatory monsters like Paisley. If Felicia or Dinah or goodness forbid, April, saw you with Shelby, it would be a total headache. Shelby licks you again and you moan before the ogopogo puts you on her head between her horns. \u201cSo, Stephen,\u201d says Shelby as she laughs. \u201cHow have you been doing?\u201d You let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing fine. Except the other day, I got turned down on a date with Connie.\u201d Shelby let out a sigh. \u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cOh. You poor thing. That\u2019s no good. I mean, who could turn down a cutie like you. Oh!\u201d Shelby tries to snap her fingers on her stub only to remember that that arm had been destroyed and had no fingers. So, in order to correct herself, Shelby snaps the fingers on her good hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d says the ogopogo. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d you ask. \u201cThe Cryptid of the Month calendar?\u201d Shelby just gave a laugh. \u201cOh, no, no, no, no, silly. You see, your friend Chihiro won tickets to the premiere of a movie that\u2019s arriving in theaters tomorrow and it\u2019s showing in Terrordale. She only needed one ticket, so she gave the rest to me, so I was wondering.\u201d You give a gulp. From the sound of it, Shelby  was asking you out on a date to go to the movies. You were so not looking forward to that. From what you knew of Shelby, her taste in movies was terrible. For one, she actually liked the movie, Crystal and the Bedazzles. You saw that movie and you wish you hadn\u2019t. There was next to no plot or character significance at all. The only thing worse that you could think of was that movie that was a remake of a classic from the 70s. You saw that by accident due to a mishap when you got stuck in Reimu\u2019s hair due to her chewing gum. It was supposed to be an action movie, but there was more flirting and dialogue than there was action. You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Shelby as she rolled her eyelids. \u201cI was wondering if you wanted to come. Here\u2019s the tickets.\u201d Shelby hands you a ticket as big as a surfboard and you expect the movie she want to see to be something terrible. However, when you take a closer look, you realize just how wrong you were and gasp. \u201cGargoyles of the Galaxy II!?\u201d you yell. You remembered that movie. It was awesome and funny. It made you cry at the beginning and end but also made you laugh everywhere in between. You had trouble deciding which of the characters was your favorite. The original movie won 5 stars. You could not believe that for once, Shelby picked a winner. \u201cThis movie,\u201d you say. \u201cIt sounds awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nShelby nodded her head. \u201cKendall said you would. So what do you say, is it a date.\u201d You were beginning to think about it and then you nodded your head. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d \u201cYayzies!\u201d yelled Shelby as she held up her hand. She would\u2019ve clapped it, but she remembered she only had one and blushed. Perhaps this premiere might be a good idea. Besides, Shelby was friendly enough. You could agree to one date. You nod your head and into the room walks none other than...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(9/21/2016: Under new management. Originally created by RedHurricane)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Stephen from Monster Shores. Summer has ended and Gravefield Beach is closed for the season. What are you to do? Thankfully, your partner Roxy hooked you up with a winter job at the snowy mountainside near Terrordale. Until it gets warm enough for swimming again, you\u2019ll be working as a ski-instructor at Grimmsly Lodge. But by the sea or in the mountains, you\u2019ll still be getting into plenty of mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slope Staff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Roxy Maza<br>\r\nSpecies: Gargoyle<br>\r\nHeight: 750ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A tall yellow skinned gargoyle girl with long black hair.

Indoors, she wears a nurse\u2019s outfit.\u2028<br>\r\nDescription: As with Monster Shores, Roxy is your loyal partner and best friend. You mainly stand on her shoulder to act as a second pair of eyes to the gargoyle giantess. While very friendly, Roxy can lose her temper when either you\u2019re being antagonized by bullying monsters or when someone makes fun of her weight. In the winter time, Roxy acts as a nurse at the lodge, applying her lifeguard knowledge to monsters injured around the general area. Half the time, you\u2019re helping Roxy out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Azure Skinwalker<br>\r\nSpecies: Werecoyote<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant silver furred coyote woman, heavyset in body shape but surprisingly attractive for her age. Is easily recognizable by the white crescent moon shaped birthmark in the center of her face. Due to her fur protecting her from the cold, she wears little more than an indigo shirt with gray pants.<br>\r\n\u2028Description: Azure is your supervisor and the manager of Grimmsly Lodge, playing a similar role to Fran. Azure has a mild attitude towards you and is usually carefree. Even though she\u2019s a type of monster that normally eats humans, she\u2019s perfectly harmless and even allows humans in the lodge and warns them about the carnivorous guests. Azure also has a human husband named Vernon that acts as her assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Vernon Skinwalker<br>\r\nSpecies: Human<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A middle aged man with graying hair and a well built body that puts even your frame to shame. Usually seen wearing a red lumberjack's shirt and snow pants.<br>\r\nDescription: Vernon is Azure's human husband and assistant.

Sports long blue hair that reaches down to her enormous rear. Elisa always wears a bright red scarf that along with her black snow suit.\u2028<br>\r\nDescription: Elisa is Roxy\u2019s other best friend that you only see in the winter time. During the winter time, you spend half your time helping Roxy treat injured visitors and half with Elisa teaching visitors how to ski or snowboard. Fortunately for you Elisa is very friendly around humans and especially likes men. It takes a lot to get her angry but when this does happen, she can be the scariest monster you\u2019ve ever seen. When enraged just enough, she breathes fire. Her favorite food is the dinosaurs that roam the mountainside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Connie Andrews<br>\r\nSpecies: Naga<br>\r\nHeight: 400ft<br>\r\nLength: 600ft<br>\r\nAppearance: From the waist up, Connie resembles an overweight dark skinned goth girl with long black hair with indigo highlights. From the waist down she had the tail of a purple anaconda in place of her legs. Connie mainly wears black makeup with a black pearl piercing on her navel. Wears an indigo colored snowsuit with a hat.\u2028<br>\r\nDescription: As she is in Monster Shores, Connie is the one monster you have a crush on. While most nagas wouldn\u2019t think twice about eating humans, Connie is unable to eat you without suffering an allergic reaction. During the Summer, she\u2019s a surfer, but to your delight, she works as a tour guide in the mountain area during the winter on certain days. This gives you another chance to try and win her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ripple World<br>\r\nSpecies: Cerberus<br>\r\nHeight: 650ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A hulking three headed and brown furred werewolf who is the most muscular monster you\u2019ve ever seen.

All three of Ripple\u2019s heads have ginger colored hair worn in ponytails. All she wears for clothes is a bikini and an apron since her fur protects her from the cold.<br>\r\nDescription: Ripple is the chef at the cafe built into the Grimmsly Lodge. You have to be careful around her because her three heads have different personalities. Her center head is an angry brute, her right head is a constantly depressed crybaby and her left head is a hyperactive optimist. While the left and right heads are harmless, Ripple\u2019s center head eats humans and what\u2019s worse is that it\u2019s not easy to tell which head is in control of the body at any given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Waitresses- There\u2019s a cafe built into the Grimmsly Lodge where Ripple works and you know the five waitresses personally.

Despite being a predatory species and being somewhat hyperactive, Felicia is very fond of humans, mostly because her adoptive father is a human. However, she is also really playful in regards to humans, like a cat with a ball of yarn. Thankfully for you, she\u2019s also very careful not to hurt humans and in fact is extremely hostile towards monsters that do eat humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Camille Longneck<br>\r\nSpecies: Weregiraffe<br>\r\nHeight: 1500ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large green weregiraffe with a pear shaped body and long yellow green hair.

She may not be a human eater, but she has weird psychic abilities such as telekinesis and can read minds. Camille has a morbid habit of asking you if you\u2019d like to know how you\u2019ll die that you find creepy of her. Camille mainly has a cruel sense of humor regarding humans, albeit not outright malicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Victoria Marian<br>\r\nSpecies: Frankenstein<br>\r\nHeight: 500ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An hourglass shaped Frankenstein with long black and white striped hair worn in a ponytail. Victoria\u2019s right side is organic and made up of different patchwork corpses of different colors while the left side of her body is completely made of metal with a mechanical eye.

Wears a blue maid\u2019s outfit.<br>\r\n\u2028Description: Dinah is the winter equivalent of April and stalks you in a manner that would make the werewolf girl jealous. Dinah purposely wears the skimpiest maid\u2019s outfit so she can flirt with you and sometimes gives you free service. Sometimes if you\u2019re not careful she\u2019ll even snatch you up. Doesn\u2019t like other monsters to get near you, not even Roxy, Elisa or Azure and can get insanely jealous if she thinks another monster has the hots for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Elektra Von Richter<br>\r\nSpecies: Loxodon<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An enormous humanoid Asian elephant, really large in body shape but still beautiful. Has long black hair with two red highlights and wears a red maid\u2019s outfit.<br>\r\nDescription: Elektra is the best waitress in the Lodge after Felicia and provides the fastest service. Mostly because she has a photographic memory regarding orders. Unfortunately for you, Elektra is the land equivalent of your mermaid nemesis Paisley. She loves to eat humans and has made it perfectly clear that she wants you in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mountain Regulars<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sora Hofferson<br>\r\nSpecies: Wyvern<br>\r\nHeight: 750ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A pear shaped gray skinned dragoness with her purple pterodactyl like wings attached to her arms.

She has a reputation as a serial dater and she\u2019s somewhat interested in you but you\u2019re intimidated by the fact that she\u2019s a carnivorous monster. Sora has an odd habit of lightly sitting on humans and she\u2019s used you as a seat cushion a few times. Sora is a friend of Connie, but the other monsters don\u2019t like her much because she doesn\u2019t ask permission when she takes pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hippolyta Grimwald <br>\r\nSpecies: Hippogriff<br>\r\nHeight: 600ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large hippogriff with bright silver feathers and wings on her back with talons for hands. From the waist down she has the lower body of a gray furred horse. Hippolyta only wears a white A-shirt.\u2028<br>\r\nDescription: Hippolyta thinks of herself as a treasure hunter and comes to the mountainside every year because there\u2019s supposedly a pirate\u2019s treasure worth millions in skulls (monster currency) hidden somewhere in the mountains. So far she hasn\u2019t been successful finding it. She\u2019s invited you to accompany you several times, offering you a share of the treasure, but you have yet to take the hippogriff giantess up on that offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Zoe Joss<br>\r\nSpecies: Landshark<br>\r\nHeight: 575ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant hourglass shaped humanoid hammerhead shark. Middle aged but still attractive looking. She is bald and has a large chip taken out of the side of her dorsal fin. For clothing, she wears a gray snow parka and a pair of boots as well as gloves that fit over her webbed hands. Zoe also wears a pair of spiked sunglasses that somehow fit on her abnormally shaped head.<br>\r\n\u2028Description: Normally Zoe would be carnivorous towards humans, if she knew you were a human. Zoe is blind and convinced that you\u2019re a fairy, she went senile when she was 30. You hate to be mistaken for the same species as your hated enemy Stella but you have to pretend to be a fairy or Zoe will eat you alive. For some reason her blindness hasn\u2019t effected her ability to snowboard. She's also the mother of Avery from Monster Shores according to UltimateNeo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Blair Stallion<br>\r\nSpecies: Pegasus<br>\r\nHeight: 675ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant and heavy set yellow anthro horse with golden wings on her back and long orange hair and mane.

She looks down on most other monsters and takes great pride in her species. Blair has a low opinion of humans and tends to speak down to you as if you were a child.

The minotaur giantess mainly comes up to the mountain for skiing. Mesa warned you that Comet used to have a human boyfriend but she caught him cheating on her with a salamander from Horrorville and as a result, she loathes humans to the point of squishing them on sight. Unfortunately for you, her ex-boyfriend looked a lot like you do and the resemblance fills her with great anger to the point of trying to kill you sooner than looking at you. Comet has a burning hatred of dragons and similar monsters because of the salamander that stole her boyfriend and gets along poorly with Elisa and Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Drew<br>\r\nSpecies: Frilled Shark<br>\r\nHeight: 800ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A 31 year old land shark with a serpentine lower body and the upper body of a shark woman with red eyes, serrated teeth and webbed fingers.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by Ultimate Neo. Drew is Zoe's niece and Avery's cousin. She's somewhat odd and comes off as a stalker but it's mainly because she's mute. She has a job as a jack-of-all-trades woman due to her cousin going crazy and her aunt going senile early. But she still speaks highly of them and is very friendly towards humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alexis<br>\r\nSpecies: Neko<br>\r\nHeight: 350ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A black furred werecat with white tips on her ears, paws and tail.

Like a number of Stephen's suitors, Shelby is obese, being fatter then Dinah. Shelby only has one arm, her other one having been eaten. She has no prosthetic arm, instead having a stump.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by the 12th Doctor. Shelby is a wannabe BBW model and another in Stephen's long line of suitors. She became attracted to him after watching him save a dronwing human at the beach. She plans to get much fatter to get his attention. Outside of trying to get Stephen, she likes to practice modeling and watch crappy horror movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tamera Croaker<br>\r\nSpecies: Werefrog<br>\r\nHeight: 900 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: Tamera has shiny purple skin, red hair in a ponytail, and green eyes. Like most frogs, she has a super long tongue, three webbed fingers, and three webbed toes. Due to a curse from Raven Eckerton, Tamera's breasts, belly, and butt are extremely large and full of water she can't get rid of.<br>\r\nDescription: An O.C. of the 12th Doctor. Tamera used to be extremely angry. She would always blow up at the slightest thing and attack others. This, unfortunately, got her on the bad side of Raven Eckerton. She snapped at Raven for bumping into her, and Raven put a curse on her. Now, every time she gets angry or attacks someone, her body bloats up with more water. Now she is trying to change, but finds that her temper is too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Maddie/Edith/Sarah Marlok<br>\r\nSpecies: Gorgon/Cerberus hybrid<br>\r\nHeight: 930 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: Due to being a Gorgon/Cerberus hybrid, these three have one body, but three heads. Their body is obese with orange scales. Sarah, the left head, has red, black, and yellow scales, yellow eyes, and king cobra snakes for hair. Edith, the middle head, has light brown scales, green eyes, and Egyptian cobras for hair. Maddie, the right head, has green scales, red eyes, and boa constrictors for hair. How they dress depends on who controls the body.<br>\r\nPersonality: Another OC of the 12th Doctor. These three women are a rarity: as the daughters of a gorgon and a Cerberus, the sisters are three heads on one body. Each head has it's own personality, though they all get along fairly well. The left head, named Sarah, suffers from horrible confidence and esteem issues. She is quick to apologize and feels useless at times. Edith, the middle head, is a musician, mostly favoring punk rock. She's loud and demanding. Maddie, the right head, is a flirt with a particular taste: she loves extremely fat woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Boarders- There are two monsters that rent out a couple of rooms underneath the lodge. Unfortunately, neither of them like each other and are always feuding. Azure mainly sends you down to check on them or settle whatever petty squabble they have going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Helga Cisco<br>\r\nSpecies: Troll<br>\r\nHeight: 500ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An hourglass shaped blue skinned troll with pointed ears, spikes running down her back and sharp fangs sticking out the sides of her mouth. Somewhat scrawny compared to other trolls and wears a pair of thin glasses.\u2028<br>\r\nDescription: Helga is the daughter of Fran (Your supervisor at Gravefield Beach in the Summer). Unlike her dimwitted mother, Helga is very intelligent and specializes in gadgetry. She has a workshop underneath the lodge where she builds all sorts of her inventions and has welcomed you to come in anytime. While Helga respects her mother, she is embarrassed at the low intelligence of their race and how she\u2019s not as strong as all the other trolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Helena Greer Krofft<br>\r\nSpecies: Weretiger<br>\r\nHeight: 875 ft.<br>\r\nStory: Monster <br>\r\nAppearance: Helena has a surprising resemblance to Marvel comics character Tigra. She has orange fur with black stripes and green eyes like Tigra, but she has long, silver hair in a ponytail and cat eye glasses. Helena is morbidly obese, to the point of needing a motorized wheelchair to move, and is still getting fatter.<br>\r\nPersonality: An OC of the 12th Doctor. Helena is a virologist (scientist who studies viruses) who is completely obsessed with the nebutori virus. She wants to understand what it is and how it works for infections and weight gain. But she has no desire to cure it. Rather, she wants to make a strain that is completely incurable. Her first attempt at this was tested on herself, and resulted in never ending weight gain. People often call her Tigra, due to her resemblance to the Marvel comics character. She loves that name and is proud of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Serena Ennick<br>\r\nSpecies: Orc<br>\r\nHeight: 800 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: Serena has green skin, black eyes, and brown hair in a buzz cut. She has two large, sharp tusks in her mouth. Unlike Helena, Serena is incredibly muscular and still getting bigger.<br>\r\nDescription: An O.C. of the 12th Doctor Serena is Helena's assistant, and is completely obsessed with her. She seems to practically worship Helena, constantly praising her and treating her like a queen or goddess. Some think Serena is just kissing up to Helena to get a better social standing, while others think Serena is relying on Helena to have an identity. During one of Helena's test, Serena was injected with a virus that caused muscle growth. She is still growing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lydia Kama<br>\r\nSpecies: Kamaitachi<br>\r\nHeight: 300ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant teal furred weasel girl with short black hair and pink ears. Very fat in the stomach, resulting in her wearing a black bikini and sorceress\u2019s cape. Has sharp sickle like claws for fingers and toes. You swear you\u2019ve seen those claws cut through steel. Lydia also mainly carries around a giant wand with a sphere at the end.\u2028<br>\r\nDescription: Lydia is a sorceress who lives in a lab underneath the lodge where she works on spells and potions that she sells. She\u2019s somewhat condescending when it comes to humans and hates Helga with a passion. Sort of a magic vs. science debate. You don\u2019t like visiting her lair because you heard Lydia keeps humans in cages for unknown purposes. Though this may just be a rumor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Raven Pandora Eckerton<br>\r\nSpecies: Werecat<br>\r\nHeight: 900 ft. <br>\r\nAppearance: Raven has long, silver hair, silver eyes, and silver fur. Raven's body is a serious hourglass shape, with huge breasts, a narrow waist, and a large butt. Usually wears clothing that is typical of a sorceress.<br>\r\nDescription: An O.C. of the 12th Doctor. Raven is a sorceress who is the very definition of vain. She is truly obsessed with her beauty, determined to be the most beautiful creature in the known universe. She believes that she'll become more powerful the more beautiful she is. Befitting of someone with her vanity, she used her black magic to make herself immortal and eternally young (somewhere in her mid 20's), with the side effect of her hair, fur, and eyes turning silver. Being called ugly or even average sends her into a rage. She also hates anyone she thinks is prettier than her. Her beauty has given her admirers, but her vanity and short temper means she has no friends or lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Misc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Fatima Knight<br>\r\nSpecies: Wraith<br>\r\nHeight: 450ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A pitch black ghost resembling a living shadow with a glowing light in the center of her chest and a pair of glowing white eyes shaped like glasses.\u2028<br>\r\nDescription: Fatima is the ghost of the last human they hired to work at Grimmsly Lodge and Elisa\u2019s previous partner. She was lost in a snowstorm and Azure, Elisa and Roxy were unable to find her in time. Fatima gets her revenge by haunting the lodge and playing mean spirited pranks on everybody. That woman is the winter equivalent of Stella because she enjoys tormenting you most of all and hates living humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Corey Argo<br>\r\nSpecies: Yeti<br>\r\nHeight: 800ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An hourglass shaped and light blue skinned yeti girl with white fur and long pink hair. For clothing, she mainly wears a black cape and red domino mask along with a black and white striped unitard.<br>\r\nDescription: Corey is one of the yetis that live in the area near the lodge. She's an inspector that comes to the lodge on a regular basis to make sure it's up to code. Despite her job, Corey hates skiers and snowboarders because of the racket they cause and because she lives at the bottom of the cliff where the lodge was build and would like nothing better than to see the Grimmsly Lodge destroyed or shut down. Although you don't know what she thinks of humans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Selene Howler<br>\r\nSpecies: Werewolf<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A fat gray furred werewolf girl with a reddish tint in her fur. Wears a tight sweater that hugs her entire body.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by InfiniteBull Selene is a cousin of your werewolf friend April from the beach. She lives in a cabin near the mountainside and is a sculptor who has surrounded her cabin with numerous ice sculptors. Unfortunately, unlike April, Selene is one of those werewolves that sees humans as food and even if she knows about you from April, it might not save you from being eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Karen Shade<br>\r\nSpecies: Aumbra<br>\r\nHeight: Varies, but usually stays around 900 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: Karen has no hair or obvious facial features beyond glowing green eyes. Meaning she lacks a nose and mouth. Her body resembles a living shadow, pitch black and transparent. She has a huge hourglass figure. She has no clothes, but has a Barbie Doll Anatomy.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by the 12th Doctor. Living in an old, decrepit ski lodge a mile away from Grimmsly Lodge, Karen is a cruel person. She loves stealing the life force of anyone stupid enough to cross her path. She prefers to do so slowly, enjoying the fear and torment her victims feel. If her target is injured, she pretends to be nice, luring them into a false sense of security. She has very limited shape-shifting abilities, but never uses them, preferring her true form. She is weakened by the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Umbra<br>\r\nSpecies: Boogeyman<br>\r\nHeight: Varies, but is usually 900 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: Umbra has pale blue skin, short black hair, blood red eyes, and sharp teeth. She has long claws for fingernails. She has a Glasgow Grin, a scar that goes from ear to ear, looking like a horrific smile. Her body depends on what the person or monster fears.<br>\r\nDescription: An O.C. of the 12th Doctor. Umbra is \"The Thing in the Closet\", \"The Monster Under the Bed\", and \"The Figure Just Out of the Corner of your Eye\". As the living embodiment of fear, she delights in terrorizing others, using their fears against them. In her world, she rules all, but in the normal world, her power depends on how much a person is afraid. If they aren't, she's powerless. She also cannot go out in the daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\nPlease keep this a fantasy. No mecha, mutate or human giantesses. Frankensteins exist in folklore so they don\u2019t count as mecha.<br>\r\nNo toilet stuff. I hate it.<br>\r\nTry not to end the story too soon.<br>\r\nKeep interaction with male monsters to a minimum.<br>\r\nAll monsters are giants at all times. Minimum is 300ft.<br>\r\nTry not to take anything sexual too far. I like my stories focused on plot instead.<br>\r\nCharacters from Monster Shores can appear because both stories take place in the same city. In fact it's encouraged.<br>\r\nThere are dinosaurs in the mountains that often give Stephen trouble but none of them are as big as the monsters. If anything they\u2019re canon fodder.<br>\r\nNo crossovers with Ryzanyes. In fact, I better not see that word mentioned anywhere in the story. They don't take place in the same universe.<br>\r\nIf you create a new character don't give them the same name as an existing character. It's lazy and it causes confusion.<br>\r\nPlease no Male Preds! I thought I didn't have to say it!<br>\r\nHave Fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the original Story, go here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores</a></td>",
