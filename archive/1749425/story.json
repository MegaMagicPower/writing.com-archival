            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking back at recent events I suppose that I have no-one to blame but me and my big mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my birthday I was now the grand old age of 21.  Myself and a few friends had decided to go to one of those hypnotist shows for a laugh.  Joe one of my mates had got the tickets.  He had gone a few weeks before and had spent most of the since talking about it.  Now here we where sitting in the pub next to the theater waiting for Joe and Amy (his girlfriend) to arrive.  There was Susan my on again off again girlfriend (more off than on at the moment).  Her best friend Jane.  Steven  one of my good friends, I had known Steven since school we had grown up together and had a habit of playing practical jokes on each other. Of course there was me my name is Pete aka the geek (well that's what most people call me).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know there is no way I can be hypnotized\u201d I said smugly.  \u201cWhy is that?\u201d asked Jane. \u201cToo strong willed\u201d I answered. \u201cThat's bull\u201d said Susan \u201cYou can get talked in to anything\u201d she went on to say.  \u201cCome on you two no fighting tonight\u201d. \u201cWe are out to celebrate Pete's birthday not fight\u201d said Steven.  \u201cEver the peace maker Steven said Jane.  \u201cYou know me\u201d he replied.  Just the Joe and Amy arrived \u201cHi guys who wants a drink\u201d asked Joe as he walks up to the booth we were sitting in. After a minute or two we had worked out what everyone wanted and me and Joe walked to the bar to get the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later we got back to the booth with the drinks (what can I say the pub was busy) I saw the others sitting there talking to another guy who looked familiar but I couldn\u2019t place him.  \u201cOh there you are \u201csaid Susan looking up.  \u201cThis is Bob\u201d she continued.  \u201cHi Bob \u201cI said looking at him.  \u201cI know this will sound strange but have we met before\u201d I asked him. \u201cDon't think so\u201d was his answer. \u201cStrange you look so familiar\u201d I told him it was at this point I looked round the table and everyone else had big smiles on their faces.  \u201cWhat is it\u201d What have I done now\u201d I asked. \u201cNothing \u201c Susan said this is Bob Powers otherwise known as Dr. Robert Powers the man we are going to see in a few hours time.  \u201cOh sorry but at least I recognized you from somewhere | just couldn\u2019t remember where\u201d I said to Bob apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too worry it happens a lot\u201d he replied. \u201cI was sitting in the next booth having a drink before the show and I couldn't help but overhear what you said before you went to the bar\u201d he said to me.  \u201cWhat was that got your attention\u201d I asked him. \u201cWell you said that you couldn't be hypnotized\u201d he replied.  \u201cYeah that's right I'm strong willed I said to him. \u201cI have heard that a lot over the years but one by one I have managed to put them all under\u201d came Bob's reply. \u201cI would like to propose a harmless little wager with you\u201d he went on to say with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cReally what might that be\u201d I asked.  \u201cSimple\u201d.  \u201cYou come backstage after the show and I will try to put you under\u201d.  \u201cIf I do it you will admit to everyone here that you can be hypnotized\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd buy us all a drink each\u201d shouted Steven. \u201cThat part you can work out yourselves\u201d said Bob.  \u201cWhat happens if you can't put me under\u201d I asked.  \u201cOh that's the best bit as far as your concerned\u201d.  \u201cI will give you \u00a3100 on the spot and give you all a free ticket to any show in the theater\u201d Bob went on to say .  \u201cSound like a win, win situation but how do we get backstage\u201d I asked \u201cNot too worry I will fix that\u201d Bob said.  \u201cAre we agreed then\u201c he asked. \u201cWhy the hell not\u201d was my answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Bob went about signing the back of all of our tickets with his name a word which he would let the theater know about so that we could get backstage after the show.  He sat with us for about another half hour and then left to start preparing for the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won't bore you with the details of how we passed the time until the show started or what show was like by now most people have seen one of these show or have a good idea of what its like. Myself and my friends enjoyed it a great deal and would make sure we told Bob that when we next saw him. So now after nearly three hours we headed to side of the stage to go backstage to meet up with Bob and get my easy \u00a3100.  As we got nearer we were stopped by one of the security staff.  We showed him our tickets and he took us through a few doors and told us to wait outside another door.  This turned out to be Bob's dressing room.  A few minutes later we were shown inside and there was Bob have a drink of water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi guys nice to see you again\u201d he said.  \u201cI will be with you in a minute\u201d.  \u201cJust make yourselves comfortable\u201d.  We all sat down and waited for Bob to finish what he was doing.  After a few minutes he  came over and sat down next to us.  \u201cSorry about that just sorting out tomorrow night its my last show here for a few weeks I need a little time off you know\u201d he said with a smile.  Now as to what happened next I only found out afterwards from the guys.  Bob asked to sit beside him and he said he was going to put me under the next thing I knew everything had gone black.  Susan told me that while I was under (ok so I lost the bet) that Bob turned to them and said \u201cSo does anyone have an idea of what we can do to prove to Pete that he was under\u201d.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jane ,Amy and Joe were busy talking to Bob's assistant and not really paying any attention to what Susan, Steven and Bob were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I don't mind a practical joke now and then myself but this could be dangerous if its not done right\" Bob said looking at the two of them. \"If you were to help us with this is there some sort of safety control you can put in place so that things don't go to far\" asked Susan looking right at Steven with a look that told him that she knew his reputation well. \"The human brain is good at doing that on its own\" Bob replied \"But what if I set it up so that one of you can put him under and the other can bring him out if they think that things are getting out of hand\" Bob continued. \"Sounds good to me what do you think Susan\" asked Steven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me\" was her reply. \"but who does what\". \"If I understand your relationships with peter then may I suggest that Steven can be the one with the trigger word to put him back under and Susan you can bring him back out\". \"As an extra safety measure all suggestions that Peter is given will wear off in one months time from tonight\" Said Bob. \"Its that or nothing\" he added \"Go for it\" the two conspirators said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half an hour later I was brought out from under my trance. \"I told you I could not be put under\" I said \"So you did\" said Bob, \"but just to make sure can you count your fingers for me\" he went on to say. \"Okay I don't know why you want me to do that\" I replied as I began to count. \"1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11\" what was all I could say. I counted again and once more came up with 11. I Turned to see Bob and the others smiling at me. \"\"What did you do to me.\" I asked Bob. \"Nothing really I just made you forget the number 5\" he said in reply. \"Can you fix please I give in you hypnotised me\" I said with a frown on my face. \"Easily just take a minute\" he said. Once he was done I counted my fingers again and only found ten this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It been fun guys and next time I am in town why don't we catch up but I need to go to my bed now after all it is 3 in the morning\" said Bob. \"I have a long journey ahead of me in the morning\" he continued. With that we said our goodbyes and turned to head home ourselves each taking one of Bob's cards as we left. I shared a taxi home with Susan who was find it hard to stop laughing at something which she refused to share with me. Even the driver was laughing. Susan stayed at mine that night I took the couch and she had the bed we decided to be friends for the moment and see where that would take us this time before restarting as boyfriend and girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that we went to sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have already had my shower she said its all yours.  With that she turned to the bedroom to change out of her pajamas. She still had some of her clothes here as she had yet to pick them up after the last time we had broken up maybe that was a good sign maybe not.  At the moment I wasn't bothered I went to get my shower and shave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour and half later we were walking round the town center in and out shops some times buying some thing sometimes not.  Man I had forgotten how much Susan liked to shop.  A short time later we decided to stop for lunch.  \u201cHey Pete we are near your work why don't we go there the  food's good\u201d asked Susan.  \u201cWhy not it will give me a chance to check what time I start at tonight I'm not sure\u201d I answered.  When we got to the bar we took a seat near the window.  Within a minute Susan brother John came over to us.  Yeah my Ex's brother was my boss oh the joy at least we were all on good terms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't tell me you two are back together again\u201d he asked with a big smile on his face. \u201cNo we were just doing some shopping in the town before my shift\u201d I replied.  \u201cSpeaking of which I need to check what time I start at tonight back soon\u201dI said as I made my way to the office.I came back to find the two of them laughing at something.  \u201cYour joking\u201d was all I heard John say as he then saw me coming. \u201cI start a five I said to Susan so I will need to go after this.\u201d Shame she said I was having fun.\u201d And with that we order our meal and had lunch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch I turned to leave, well I did only have a few hours before I would need to be back at the bar for work.  \u201cJohn said he would give  me home it we give us a chance to catch up\u201d Susan told me.  \u201cFair enough\u201d I said see you later and with that start the journey back to my flat before returning for work.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pete finished his drink and was about to order  another when Steven learned over to him and whispered something into his ear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Pete stopped moving towards the bar. \u201cPete  did you do what I asked you to when I called you this afternoon\u201d Steven asked him.  \u201cyes I did everything I was instructed to\u201d came his reply.  \u201cGood good now I have some more instructions for do you understand\u201d Steven went on to say.  \u201cYes I understand\u201d Pete replied.  \u201cVery well then you will follow Jenny and do what she says until I tell you otherwise\u201d Steven continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny came over.  \u201cAre sure John said that this was ok\u201d she asked.  \u201cYou can ask him if you want he is in the office\u201d Steven told her.  \u201cNo that\u2019s all right I don't need  to.  Come on Pete follow me she said turning towards Pete and lead him to the staff changing rooms in the back of the bar.  \u201cI'm still not sure if this is a good idea or not but hey they are paying me to do this so why not\u201d she told him. \u201cIts not as if you are going to complain about this well at least not at the moment\u201d she went on to say.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The bar had only just decided to have the staff keep their uniforms on the premisses so that they would always have a uniform to wear when they where on their shift. Jenny turned to Pete and said this way as she held open the door to the female changing rooms knowing  in advance that they would be the only two in the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrip down to your underwear\u201d she commanded him.  As Pete took off his shirt he revealed a cream bra.  Jenny look at the bra still a little shocked that he was wearing it even tho she had been told he would be.  For his part Pete did not remember putting it on when he got dressed after his second shower of the day. He continued to undress taking off his shoes and socks.  He finally  unfasten his belt and taken off his pants to show that he was wearing a pair of panties that matched the bra he was wearing, both items had come from the clothes that Susan was still to pick up from his flat.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow put these on\u201d Jenny told him as she handed him a pair of nude pantyhose to put on which he did with no resistance what so ever. \u201cNow this\u201d she continued handing him a knee length black skirt. She then went to her own locker and removed a few spare pairs of pantyhose that she kept there and placed them in the empty cups of the bra that Pete was wearing. Next she handed him a white silk shirt which he put on with no problems at all despite the buttons being on the wrong side. Then came the green waistcoat and the black bow tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit down\u201d she told Pete as she pulled out a chair for him.  Pete still under the instructions from Steven sat down with little delay. Jenny the proceeded to put make up on his face which she had taken again from her own locker.  She then handed Pete to black court shoes with a one inch heel and once more he put them on  with no resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying hard not to laugh at her co-worker she turned to him and said  \u201cFollow me\u201d leading him back towards Steven and the front of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out front Steven was also finding it hard not to laugh at his friend as he came towards him.  \u201cHere he/she it is\u201d said Jenny. \u201cI've got to get back to work\u201d  \u201cNow Pete this is your uniform for tonight you will not think it strange that you are the only man wearing it\u201d \u201cIt is a test run to see if the uniform is ok for everyone to wear\u201d \u201cFor tonight and tonight only unless I tell you different you will use the female changing rooms and locker 69 to change into your non work clothes after your shift\u201d \u201cWhen I count to 10 you will be your normal self again but remember everything I have told you it is true for you\u201d Steven told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete stood there for a minute blinking before saying \u201cSorry Steven can't chat with you any more I have to get to work.\u201d  \u201cNo problem I have to get going anyway see you at 12.30 at the end of your shift then we can hit the clubs\u201d was Steven's reply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat see you then\u201d said Pete as he went to get his pre shift briefing from John in the office where he joined all the staff male and female who were on duty that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.hospitality-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/waiter-uniform-restaurant.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hospitality-school.com/wp-con...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his place next to the guys who were wearing the old uniform with the black pants.  He had found it funny to start with that only him and the girls wore the unisex uniform but he had grown used to it no and it no-longer bothered him.  For some reason a lot of the staff were smiling as he walked in to the office, but no-one would tell him what the joke was,  The briefing lasted about ten minutes then he and everyone else headed out to start their shift.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For what should otherwise have been a normal night at work, Pete had the strangest feeling something was off. His coworkers, for one, seemed to be having an extraordinary evening of some sort. Any time he had needed to talk to any of them, they'd have a wry grin on their face or make a strange comment or two. At the same time, Pete didn't complain when one of his coworkers, Natalie, complimented him on his trial uniform. \"I never knew you had such great legs, Pete,\" she had said with what he thought was a pretty genuine smile. He just blushed and thanked her for the comment and went back to waiting tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customers, too, seemed to treat him a little differently tonight. One couple in particular seemed to not like him in the least bit. There was nothing he could say or do to placate them. It was like his very presence offended them for some reason. Either way, he traded tables with one of the guys and things seemed to settle down a bit. Working at a more formal bar did tend to attract some eccentric customers, so Pete knew that they probably just weren't going to be happy with him regardless. It never once crossed his mind, however, that it was due to his wearing what he now regarded as a unisex uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the uniform, Pete couldn't help but actually enjoy wearing it to some extent. The hose bunched a little bit from time to time, but otherwise he thought the silky feeling on his legs was actually quite pleasant. His skirt wasn't that bad either. The combination didn't strike Pete as strange in the least bit, and it crossed his mind that he might actually try to find something similar to wear outside of work sometime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kicker for the night, however, was a customer that was part of a group that came in towards the end of the evening. Pete was pleasantly surprised to see another guy wearing a unisex outfit like his. The only thing that looked strange about him was he had a rather feminine haircut and his nails were painted. Otherwise, his makeup, blouse, skirt, and heels were all something that Pete could see himself wearing at some point in the future. Pete complimented him on his outfit and asked him where he bought it from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly impressed by Pete's candor and service, the customer was extremely impressed by the bar and its staff in general. At the end of the night, he even requested to speak to the manager and left a glowing review of Pete. As for Pete, he was thrilled when the customer left him a $100 tip, \"To help him grow his wardrobe,\" the customer had said. Between that table and his previous customers for the night, Pete had easily topped his biggest night for tips up to that point. Pete's boss laughed at first when he recommended that all of the waiters where the unisex uniform, but he pulled himself together shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish to keep wearing that uniform every night, you'll get no complaints from me. I'll... ahem... ask the other guys if they want to trade theirs in as well, but I'll leave it up to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the time getting closer to 12:30 am, and the gang wanting to go to the clubs, Pete headed back into the female locker room to get changed out of his uniform for the night.</span></div></div>",

The main difference was this time there were more people in it. These were his female co-workers from the shift they had all used finished.
