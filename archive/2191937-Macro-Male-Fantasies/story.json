He appears human apart from the scarlet wings sticking out of his back and the spiny tail poking out above his rear. His eyes are yellow with slit pupils and he wears torn pants and a blue sleeveless shirt. He has a toned build and a cocky, arrogant attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his feet are a pair of boots that make his large thick feet notoriously smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper is a young dragonboy who is as one would expect, quite enormous in size...even when in his human form. Needless to say he loves using his size to terrorize and torment the helpless citizens of the kingdom...kidnap a few knights to make a meal out of...you know the usual dragon antics.</span></div></div>",

Their remarkable landmarks included the Lake of Tears and the large Mountains of Ofn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountains were a forbidden place to trek. This was due to the danger known as Viper the dragonboy. Knights would be abducted and their city would be attacked by the giant boy, traveling up the mountains would both lead to a quick death and a unwanted visit from Viper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, at the top of the mountains a loud echoed rang out. It was a distinctive sound, similar to that of a satisfied belch from a meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying against a large rock hill, Viper patted his abs as steam flowed out from his maw. The red haired boy whistle as he picked his  teeth with a tiny sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa you put up quite the fight little guy! Most of my snacks give up and get digested, but I feel ya squirming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper put his hands behind his head, he smirked as he caught whiffs of his hot b.o flowing off his pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the visit if I say so myself. Got to crush up some runts and see what knights old kingy hired now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon boy closed his eyes and hummed as he started slithering his tail. Soon the end lifted before him, coiled in the scaly appendage was a knight. The tiny groaned as he was squeezed and looked in fear at the yellow slits opening to peer at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here is our finale course of the meal! Your buddies were tasty so I'm just itching to have some dessert!\", Vipers sharp teeth grinned as he started bringing the knight closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper suddenly clutches his stomach and groaned. \"Eh damn...the runt's fighting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight was brought away from the dragonboy's face as he contorted his face, smoke started pouring from his lips. Viper suddenly opened his mouth and let out a earth shaking belch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BUURRGGGHHHHHPP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the loud belch came a stream of fire blasting out. The tiny looked up in shock as the massive wave of flames passed over. He could feel the waves of heat hitting, making the scaly skin heat up more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper sighed relived and patted his firm stomach. \"Damn runt, it's been awhile since I belched with my fire! Hope your warm in there \", the giant smirked as he brought the final tiny back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Viper plan to do?</span></div></div>",

The knight was unable to squirm free as the tail coiled around him was quite strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue extended like a slimy red carpet underneath the knight. Then the tail uncoiled and he landed on it with a moist <i>plop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue zipped back into the cavern, the sharp teeth passed overhead and underneath the quivering knight like cave formations themselves. With a sound like a drawbridge clanking shut, the teeth chomped down together...leaving Viper's victim in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot, wet, sticky and slimy darkness was all the knight knew. Then, the tongue began slapping him around the jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...you're even tastier than your buddies! I'm almost tempted to bite you in half!\" Viper darkly chuckled, hearing the puny screams of the knight in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper took his time cruelly tormenting the now hysterical knight in his mouth. Tasting him, teasingly swallowing spit that built up..keeping the runt guessing as to when his time would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Viper decided it was time. \"I've enjoyed messing with you and tasting you my little morsel..but your doom has arrived! Enjoy being digested in the scalding hot depths of my belly!\" Viper boomed with laughter before swallowing mightily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight squirmed and screamed as he was washed down with sticky spit...travelling down Viper's gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper moaned...content in the knowledge he'd devoured another foolish knight.</span></div></div>",

It'll take some time before the fools recruit more knights, so I'll just kick back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper stretched his toned body and large wings. The boy rubbed his stomach one last time before putting his arms behind his head and closing his eyes. The giant hummed as he once again caught the musk of his pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mountains of Ofn now had the echos of Viper's loud snores ringing out. The kingdom below could hear the boy's confirmation of sleep, and while many citizens were relieved at their moment of peace others had plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently trekking up was a group of five called the Umrica, a organization of assassins for hire. They were settled in numerous kingdoms and had heard of the issue Wyle faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't prepared though as they reached the top and were greeted by two giant boot soles crossed at the ankles. Viper was far larger then expected, looking bigger then any castle. The sleeping boy with a drop of drool hanging from his mouth made them wonder if this was actually the ferocious beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this was confirmed as they saw the numerous suits of armor. Some were melted while others had traces of blood and installed fear in the Assassins. Their leader cleared his throat as he pointed at Viper's sleeping face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright listen, we'll climb the body and use the wire to cut his throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne assassin looked terrified at the plan. \"B-but sir won't he feel us climbing? Surely we wil-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit your yapping fool! You may offer yourself to the beast now for your cowardice.\", the leader growled as he lectured his subordinate. \"Now then, let's finish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assassins soon split to go to each side of Viper. As they entered the shadow under his toned arms they were hit with the greasy b.o of the giant. There was visible steam coming out of the hot pits, formed from the sweat trailing down the humid pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to ignore the stench as they started climbing the torn shirt. They got closer to the pits and could the clothing dampened from the sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Assassin lost his grip and fell with a yell, he desperately grabbed onto a greasy pit hair to stop his fall. Good news he wasn't falling, bad news he was swung right into the sweaty and squishy armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper grumbled in his sleep, but luckily didn't wake up. The tiny found himself struggling as the other red hairs were matted to the pit so he couldn't climb them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

Nah, I was faking the whole time! Stupid runts!\" Viper cackled as his toned arms squeezed the assassins into his reeking underarms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the assassin group, being the most skilled, managed to escape with none other than the 'cowardly' man from earlier. They utilized grappling hooks to swing themselves out of the oncoming pit squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but how!? How did he know-?!\" The coward hysterically wailed as the duo crouched on a ledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft!

The dragon boy grinned widely as he got up and dropped his pits, not listening to the panicked yells being smooshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIMO!\", The booming voice echoed as Viper saw across his mountains stood his old friend with his arms crossed and waving his blue tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShimo opened his eye. \"Ah Viper, long time no see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon began running over, making the ground shake and humans fear if the mountain was about have a avalanche of rocks. The scene seemed to go in slow motion with Viper running with a happy grin and Shimo standing still while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Viper tackled Shimo to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah got you this time!\", Viper smirked as he pinned the blue dragon to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShimo chuckled before he wrapped his legs around Viper and flipped him over. The red dragon grunted as his hands were grapped. The blue dragon had a impish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...but you kept your guard down~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper huffed as he pushed his friend off. He soon grinned as he sat across from Shimo. \"So what's got you visiting, I thought you were traveling the globe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, but a friend's familiar musk hit my snout.\", the black haired giant coyly grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper smirked and flexed. \"You know it, I've got the mightiest stench of the Drake's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShimo chuckled and pulled up his shirt to reveal his abs, soon a b.o stench came off as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but let's not forget me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon.....</span></div></div>",

His hair is shaggy but neatly kept, as prince of Avalere he wore a red (his favorite color) outfit and black boots. But currently he wears collared shirts and jeans for the most part...just because he's displaced in another and more technologically advanced realm doesn't mean he'll dress like a commoner or a bum! On his feet he wears a pair of slip on shoes and black socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory: Prince Logan was/is the crown prince of a wealthy royal family in a magical realm called Avalere. He was a bit of a brat and to call him cruel and snobbish would be an understatement. Logan relished in his authority and looked down his nose as the peasants and lesser classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he was suddenly 'zapped' to another dimension...nobody really mourned the loss...even his parents the King and Queen! After all, his younger brother was much nicer and sweeter. He'd make a far better king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan suddenly found himself forced to adapt to a strange land with technology and the most horrifying of all...he'd have to get a JOB!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Logan wasn't without his advantages. He possessed a magic that allowed him to shrink others for his enjoyment. It would come quite in handy at 'persuading' some of these weirdo people! Or just having fun when he was bored or stressed by this turn of events.</span></div></div>",

Sneering at the unkempt commoner, he stomped out onto the sidewalk shouting: \"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got quite a few stares, but nobody was as shocked as the young prince himself.  What was this place? There were buildings that towered into the sky made of some unknown metal...taller than even his palace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens of people walking around talking into strange rectangles they held to their cheeks...or tapping at them in their hands. There were loud honking noises and strange 'horseless carriages' carrying people down the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all quite an overload for the 19 year old who hailed from a far less crowded and noisy and technologically advanced place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClamping his hands over his ears, he quickly rushed down the sidewalk..only to bump into someone. \"Oof! Watch where you're going!! Damn cosplayers...\" The man grumbled in reference to Logan's strange attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan scowled, he wouldn't be talked to like that by ANYONE...but he needed information. The man hmphed and wandered up to a apartment nearby...unaware Logan was following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had disrespected Logan, and he had chosen him as his source of information. When the man opened the front door, Logan made sure no one was looking, and shrank him on his doorstep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor individual looked around in confusion as a shadow engulfed him and he was brought to that cosplay brat's enormous face! Immediately, he began to scream..unable to understand what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan sneered, \"Listen up, peasant! Is anyone else here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man whimpered but didn't answer...Logan tightened his grip around him. \"I asked you a question!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My son....\" The man answered. Logan's eyes flashed with cruel joy, \"Excellent, I'll have leverage over you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan wandered inside and shut the front door behind him. A young teen looked up from the couch and his eyes widened, \"Who the hell are y-\" He never completed that sentence, as Logan shrank him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlucking the confused youth up into his hands, Logan sat down on the couch..now with his two prisoners in his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some questions for you specks! If you refuse to answer...I'll kill the one across from you.\" Logan brought the duo up to his narrowed eyes, \"And I'll make the other one watch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing them both on the coffee table in front of the couch, Logan unbuttoned his jacket and tossed it aside..leaving him in a pitstained white dress shirt...which he peeled away to reveal his slim muscled torso.</span></div></div>",

Luckily I've got a few of my many personal interrogators to squeeze the answers out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Logan plucked the father up getting a panicked yell and terrified look from the son. The prince licked his lips as he stretched his muscular arm over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large steamy landscape filled with sour musky odor was pouring out. Various brunette hairs were greasy and pasted to the squishy skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan chuckled as he began bringing the tiny to his pit. \"Ok runt, tell me now where am i?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince scoffed. \"I didn't ask you for pathetic squeaks, now let me show you what my interrogators think of bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny squirmed as he was quickly brought closer into the powerful musky odor of the pit. Logan pressed him into the squishy skin, the oniony steam was shoved onto him and up his nostrils.

The giant smirked as he lowered his arm and pressed his arms to his body to trap the father into the musk.

A curse had been put on them while their mother was carrying Sed, thankfully they weren't harmed but Sed was given the full blunt of the curse.

It was a like a new home for the knights to build and grow from in comradeship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one room Sed was on the landscape of a bed reading notes from his magic class. He had mastered fire and ice magic, but was still having issues with telepathy and sealing spells. The younger blond sighed as he concentrated but failed to conjure up any light energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why can't i do it!\",</i> Sed felt downtrodden at his failure to perform. \"Sin's so far in his training, if i don't catch up...what if he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the brotherly bond, Sed often had insecurities thinking he was holding Sin back. Magic was his strong suit due his size so he needed to be top in it. Shaking his head, Sed jogged over to the side of the bed making a ring of wind around him and floating down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground soon had light shaking as a presence outside the door. Sed smiled as he walked up to the door, sure enough it swung open and revealed his towering brother in his tall white and blue outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSin smiled as he walked in. \"Sed I'm back!\", walking in the older brother shook the floor beneath his large brown shoes. Sed tumbled from the force of his brother's steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Sin!\", however it seemed the older brother didn't here him as he didn't look down. Sed groaned as he knew what was coming. \"Oh brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his next step, Sin's heeled sole hung over before stomping down making Sed vanish beneath it. The tiny brother was somewhat lucky as instead of getting  smushed to the flat sole he got trapped between the treads of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSin took a seat at the desk in the room, putting his hands behind his head and throwing his large feet up. The sweaty smell of his lit leaked out as they stained his white top, and his body overall had a b.o ting from his training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the bed, Sin grinned as he saw the notes. \"He must've been studying i swear he does that more than sleep.\", the older brother hummed as he waited for his brother to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sed sighed as he felt cramped in the dread of his brother's footwear. After wiggling a bit, Sed managed to pop out using his wind to slow down his fall. He now stood before the heel that was bigger than him and looming above were the giant stompers crossed at the ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSed sighed as he walked around and saw the long way to his brother humming with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny brother decided to....</span></div></div>",

I'ma keep it\" stated Oliver as he places the tiny city into his shirt pocket trapping the tiny city in a place where it's pitch block. \"This is the end of the world\" shouted a citizen. \"We have disappointed the gods and now we must pay the price.\" stated an elderly man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the fliers were able to remain in contact with one another but have lost connection with the city. \"Captain what must we do now\" reported one of the fliers. \"Firstly we must indicate where we have landed for Lieutenant Jones to pick us up\" responded the Captain. \"Sir I'm unable to see where I'm at but the ground is very soft\" answered one of the fliers. \"I believe you are somewhere on this giant boy's body whaever you do don't move or else you will fall to your death, I think your on top of one of his pectorals so if you were to fall off you would fall to your demise. Do you understand me Franklin.\" Shouted Lieutenant Jones through the walkie talkies. \" I hear you loud and clear Lieutenant Jones\" respond Franklin. \"Lieutenant Jones I'm located in a orange forest which I believe is to be this boy's hair\" respond the Captain. \"Okay Cap going in\" stated Lieutenant Jones. \"No leave me for last and get the others.\" Stated the Captain. \"Lieutenant I'm trapped in a tight place and it seems to be pitch black and all I see are big moons..... Oh no I'm trapped in this giant's underwear\" shouted the flier as the Lieutenant chuckled to herself. \"Roger that, Hank\" chuckled the Lieutenant. \"Lastly I'm located ontop of this giant's shoe\" responded the last flier. \"Understood, George try not to slip off or else You will be crushed\" responded the Lieutenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver began adjusts his glasses once more and began walking causing his ass to rub against Hank and his pecs to bounce about making Franklin to start losing his balance. While Oliver is walking George is receiving the most hardship as the world began going very fast for him. <br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Jones hurry up and save the others!!\" Shouted the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?...</span></div></div>",

As Jeffery wonders around a massive shadow engulfs him. When he looked up he noticed that enormous figure of his best friend standing over him. \"Oh my gosh\" spoke Jeffery as he stumbles backward looking up at his best friend as if he was a monster right out of a horror movie. \"He's gigantic.... Wait no.....\" Jeffery thought. \"Oh crud I have been shrunken\" gasped Jeffery as he looks up at the gigantic figure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeffery where are you, I was wondering if I can borrow a towel to dry myself off with.\"<br>\r\nSpoke the titantic good as he rests a hand on his hip and the other by his head scratching it softly wondering where his buddy went and where the towels are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffery looked up at the wet muscular body of his best friend at first he never pay attention to him in this sort of way but due to being shrunk to the size of a mere ant it sorta caused a new found affection for him towards his best friend. \"Cameron's ....

The vessal quickly bounced over the waves in a desperate attempt to flee despite the captain's furious shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy chuckled as the boat made some distance. He could dive into HIS ocean, but he dis just wake up. Snapping his fingers, Andy started wiggling his webbed toes as he felt the sweat from the hot sun start to trail down his body. Now, just to wait.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat suddenly jerked as it was halted, the men were thrown to the deck. Loud sounds of crunching metal were blasting around them and boat continued to rock back and forth. Looking over the side, a deck mate yelled in horror as he saw not one but multiple Great White Sharks biting inti the boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aquatic predators strangely didn't continued tearing into the hull, rather they began pushing the boat back to Andy. The giant teen impishly grinned as he reached down and easily picked the boat up from the water, it almost fit entirely in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy gave a two finger salute to the many sharks gathered below. \"Thanks guys.\", the aquatic creatures then swam off from their giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharkboy looked at the boat with a mischievous glint in his eyes. \"I wasn't planning on crushing you runts intill later, but you straight up offered yourselfs. Guess you humans can't get enough of my salty feet crushin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BANG!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain's previous fearless look was now shattered as he pulled out a small pistol and fired at Andy's face. The giant blinked as he felt the faintest taps on his cheeks. After seeing the tiny gun, Andy licked his lips as he suddenly grabbed the squirming captain and set the boat down between his large soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew members immediately felt tears stinging their eyes as a strong salty stench covered them. It was like a mixture of sea salt and sweaty musk, with a added scent of cheese. They could still see the terrifying sight above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy suddenly opened his mouth to reveal his sharpened teeth. He smirked as he brought the tiny closer. \"Before I go on a stomping spree, I think having a snack will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the Captain knew, he was placed on a warm and slimy red surface. The white sharp soon closed and warm darkness consumed him. The tiny soon was sloshed around as Andy slid his tongue and human around his mouth. He then tilted his head back as he felt the squirming lump travel down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3,2,1....ah~\", Andy sighed and patted his stomach as the human reached the chamber known as his stomach, force to be disgusted into fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red eyes of the giant narrowed at the ship between his feet. A large smirk was plastered on as Andy began thinking of his fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext.....</span></div></div>",

You are currently working on the breakthrough of a lifetime, your entire life so far has been a build up to this moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have discovered that time travel is indeed possible, but you need to test the device you've built in order to present your findings without widespread mockery. Given that you are a bit of a loner and haven't exactly had time to keep in touch with anybody due to your work...you have no choice but to test it on yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where the story begins...in 2019 in a basement laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill grunted as he calibrated the Time Gate, as he had decided to call it. It was a large energy conductor that resembled something like a Star-Gate. It was a rough design and there were wires showing, but William didn't have the patience to wait any longer! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was working (he hoped) and ready for some field tests! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyping in his notes on his laptop, William put his thoughts to a Word document. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must admit I am equal parts nervous and excited. If this works, I'll be famous and EVERYTHING we thought we knew about time and space will be changed! What was once thought to be the realm of science fiction will be science FACT! If I do not make it back...or worse...this laptop will be stored in a lockbox in my room.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the laptop and taking a quick trip upstairs to store it in the aforementioned place, Will sighed. If he didn't make the return journey within a day, that would mean he would be stuck in the past or future FOREVER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was because William was very protective of his work, and had installed a self destruct countdown to begin as soon as he was transported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would also mean he sacrificed his only way home...but he was prideful and rather arrogant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he couldn't have the glory...then nobody else should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he input the date into the keypad, the young scientist had no idea how he would be yanked off his high horse...fate is cruel and ironic sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill activated the portal, crackling with energy, and stepped through into the blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the era he chose to visit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: The trip causes him to shrink! Unfortunate side effect, hehe)</span></div></div>",

Behind Will was a tall brown stretching into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this isn't my house..........MY TIME MACHINE WORKED!\", Will started dancing happy as he concluded that landing in this unfamiliar territory must mean the gate worked right?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking the other way around, Will's ecstatic face slowly morphed into that of shock. The reason, miles across from wear he was standing was a door. A door bigger then the empire state building!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is.....NO this must be a mistake not that I'm one to make mistakes. The data was exactly the same, why would I SHRINK!\", Will clenched his head as not only was he panicking about his shrinking but also that he, the smart and handsome scientist made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe existential crisis was halted as a strange vibration started swaying Will. He was confused, these patterns weren't like a earthquake, they were like that of....footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the gigantic door opened like that of a ominous portal. Stepping into the room was a young boy around the age of 13 or 14. He was wearing a white dress shirt with a black vest, black shorts and long dark socks with brown dress shoes. The giant boy had short blond hair and a frown on his face as he pulled off his gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear...these basterds must have had a swing of scotch if that was their so-called job proposition.\", the giant scoffed as he started walking towards Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill felt the ground shake more as the shoe's soles stomped the ground. The boy's blue eyes suddenly narrowed at the tiny speck a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell, summer just arrived and bugs are already plaguing my office!\", The giant boy started stomping closer, throwing Will into the carpet from the force of his stomps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill gasped as looking up, the giant looked at him in disgust and lifted his large foot over the tiny scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay where you are pest! It will only take a second to crush you.\", the boy's disgusted look was blocked as he started stomping his dress shoe down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist snapped out of his stare before scrambling away as the giant stopped his previous spot. As the foot swiveled, the giant noticed the lack a crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to see Will fleeing, the boy growled and lifted his foot again. \"I'm going to grind you to dust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looked up to the approaching sole before yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT I'M NOT A BUG!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm NOT a bug! I'm a person!\" Will screamed up at the youth. The boy's eyes widened and locked once more on to Will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened so fast that William's mind could barely process it, the mountainous boy got down on his hands and knees...like an avalanche occurring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy squinted at Will before bringing up a colossal finger and prodding at the 'bug'. \"Ouch!\" Will yelped. The boy's eyes widened once more before he narrowed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're obviously capable of speaking...somehow. But if you ARE a person then I demand to know WHY you are in MY office!\" The boy demanded authoritatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam blurted it all out at once, somehow making it sound a lot LESS crazy than he thought it would. However, the boy's reaction was surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're telling me you are from the future...? And your meddling in things beyond your control caused you to shrink and end up in MY office of all places.\" The boy had a rather accusatory tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...I know it sounds insane-\" William started to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds so insane I should call the local lunatic asylum and see if they have room for you!

So far I've received nothing but moronic business offers and pitiful commoners asking for loans. However, I believe you can be of use to me in that regard.\" The boy grinned deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? But I have to get home!\" Will shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, why should I care about YOUR needs? You are an insect, below even the most wretched serf! As far as I'm concerned I am doing you a great service by not smashing your pitiful existence under my heel!\" The boy sneered cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will build this machine for me...HERE. You will make sure it works PERFECTLY, and we shall reveal it to the world and I shall lay claim to the greatest achievement in business history!\" The boy bellowed in a haughty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was at a loss for words. Not only would he most likely NEVER get home due to his arrogant self destruct mechanism counting down. But he would have to scrape and dig for some way to build it in a vastly less developed time period!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! I can't do that! I HAVE to get home!\" Will shouted his refusal with a stomp of his puny foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youth snatched him up in an instant and stood back up with the puny man in his fist. \"Refusing me? I never was one to take the word 'no' very well.\" Stomping around to his desk, William saw the nameplate read: 'Mr. Oliver'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, is that your name..? Oliver?\" Will tried to smooth talk the giant boy, hoping he hadn't just screwed himself. But Oliver squeezed him hard in his fist. \"Quiet. That may be my name, but only humans get to refer to me like that. You shall refer to me as...\" Oliver dumped Will onto the desk's surface and flopped himself down in his comfortable chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master.\" Oliver grinned demonically and two 'clunk' sounds were heard beneath the desk.

The coughing amused him as he wiggled his large toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm you seem out of sorts, oh I see are my feet too smelly for you? I've been rushing between meetings and my socks tend to heat up a tad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue eyes grew malicious as he suddenly brought his sweaty sole down.

Will found himself sinking into the soft and grimy sole, becoming more heated as the chessy sole consumed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insect, I don't appreciate back talk. Your lucky I have use for you as such backtalk would guarantee a spot beneath my shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver spat the words with venom in his voice as he lifted his sole, Will was now stuck like gum as he had a mold in the plump sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll repeat myself, kiss my sole NOW.\", Oliver's voice carried a true voice of authority as he looked at Will like a chef to horrible cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other choice Will pressed his lips to the sole and kissed the squishy sole. The grimy sweat and chessy funk attacked his taste buds, but he dare not gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver hummed and nodded his head. \"So you aren't stupid. Let this be a learning experience pest, while your under me I expect you to treat my feet as your rulers. Now....what is my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill grunted as he pulled his head from the mold. \"...Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant smirked as flexed his sole while using his other foot to peel him out of his chessy prison. Will yelped as he fell to the desk below. Oliver leaned his chin into his palm as he sneered at Will once again in his sole's shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! I hope you keep this talk in mind insect. Because expect to be under my lads a good amount. You were much more satisfying to squash then a ordinary bug.

Thankfully his pet bug was doing good in releasing tension build up as well as his feet's build up odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill forced down a cough as he inhaled the think stench, clouding his nose with the cheddary funk.

It was bitter and sour, but he forced himself to swallow it...as much as it burned like acid down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver chuckled as he relaxed back, enjoying the feeling of superiority over the miniscule future-man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are certainly going to be less hum-drum around here. I have plans for you, tiny one...\" Oliver said ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime soon passed and Will's stomach felt full to bursting with nothing but the Victorian brat's toe jam. Upon inspecting his toes Oliver nodded. \"You did well...for a starting effort. I shall expect you will improve as I certainly shall have you doing this sort of thing regularly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill could only groan at the thought of this being a regular occurrence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Oliver put his shoes and still damp stockings back on. \"Seeing as you work for me now, I shall need a necessary starting point to gauge your skills...other than being a groveling wretch who eats my toe filth.\" Oliver smirked. </span></div></div>",

The giant snorted in amusement as Will was knocked down from his simple tapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that your under my power I have a task for someone like you. Your a scientist you said?\", Oliver raised an eyebrow and getting a quick nod out of Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then if you managed to come here from the future then you'll have no problem creating a mechanism that can put my foes...in your shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill gulped. \"Y-you mean..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver smirked. \"Yes, insect I order you to create a device to shrink others down to your size. Better yet, maybe even smaller. I crushed other's ambitions numerous times, but I believe I could reinforce that by putting them beneath me in their place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill sweated, while a shrinking ray was possible it was giving it to Oliver that scared him.

I'm already eager to have the basterds cowering in my shadow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe victorian boy smirked as Will struggled draw the designs.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a fall evening in the big city of London, people were conducting their business rather it be simply shopping or full blown corporations. In one mansion a young boy was trying to deal with his business plans, quite a stressful activity but he had people beneath him to entertain the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver scrunched his eyebrows as he looked over the various papers, his dress shoes and socks sat besides his seat as both of his large feet were propped up on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one looked closely at the boy's sweaty soles then they would find a small speck. This speck was known as Will, a scientist who once thought he could be on the top of the world with his time travel discovery. But now, he was an inch tall stuck in the past serving as the pet/servant of a Victorian brat. Oliver despite his young age, was not a merciful boy. Will had been given two choices, be the boy's servant or get crushed beneath the boy's fancy shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug why haven't you moved up! My heels have been pampered enough.\", Oliver scoffed as he lifted up his foot and brought it down to shake up the desk and Will. \"Hurry up or you'll spent an evening getting squished on my daily stroll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, of course!\u201d Will squeaked as he scampered up to the center of the wide sole. The stink of cheesy vinegar got more potent the higher up he went. Will\u2019s duties were not only to be Oliver\u2019s foot masseuse, no, he had an extremely important and EXTREMELY difficult task when he wasn\u2019t pampering the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that Oliver was well aware he was from the future, Oliver was not only curious about what the future held...but about the tech that rendered Will so small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver acted like he was asking for a new toy to put others \u2018beneath him\u2019. Business rivals, embezzlers who were stealing money from the boy\u2019s company..they all had a big target on them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Will\u2019s genius allowed him to know full well a shrinking device was possible. UNfortunately...this time period didn\u2019t exactly have an abundance of resources that his time had. You couldn\u2019t just order parts or wires and fuses online here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill sighed, he had no other choice, the brat had expected the device to be done in record time, but some things were just not realistic. So, as he rubbed the mushy flesh of Oliver\u2019s ball...he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver wouldn\u2019t be TOO upset at him..asking for help with resources...would he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...master?\u201d Will squeaked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simply grunt as his answer as Oliver flipped through his papers. Will gulped before deciding now or never. \"I wanted...to talk about the shrinking device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I trust you'll be ready to construct it soon?\", Oliver hummed as his eyes scanned his paper, feeling the tiny hands push into his plump sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill would take a deep breath had it not been for the potent fumes in front of him. \"I can built it yes! But i just needed to ask if i...could have help getting the parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully rather than an angry shout, Oliver chuckled as he wiggled his toes. \"Insect i can purchase whatever necessary and have it here by dusk. Just tell me what's needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so far so good, all I need now is to convince him to let me have some extra time!\", Will felt giddy as this was going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sounds great i should have it done by next week no problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver narrowed his eyes, suddenly Will yelped as the foot arched forward. The next thing the scientist knew he was being squished against the desk by Oliver's cheesy soft feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said i can get you whatever necessary, that doesn't mean I'm going to let you slack off. I said I wanted this device by friday and i intend to have it by then. Let this be a lesson insect, don't push your luck with your master!\", Oliver scoffed as he pressed his large foot onto Will, making sure to squash him into the ball of his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up his foot so it loomed over again, Oliver smirked. \"Now get back to pampering my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill coughed from the sudden decompression of his lungs, as well as having been forced to inhale the rancid smell of this giant boy\u2019s foot. Oliver enjoyed hearing those pitiful hacks and wheezes as Will recovered from his stomp. As well as knowing his foot odor had a part to play in your little \u2018breathing issue\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m waitiiing~!\u201d Oliver mockingly sang, flexing his bulbous toes up above him and on his other foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes...of course, master\u2026\u201d Will whimpered as he climbed up to where Oliver\u2019s ball and toes met. The tiny\u2019s nose tingled, as usual when he were dealing with these well formed toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an effort to appease the giant, he planted a small kiss on the pad of Oliver\u2019s gargantuan big toe. Oliver chuckled and licked his lips, \u201cYou\u2019re too kind, but it will take more than a mere kiss to make me think of you as anything other than a bug.\u201d The gigantic youth leaned forward, setting his papers down for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow of the colossal lad fell over Will and he looked up to see his enormous face grinning down sinisterly. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a USEFUL bug, but still a bug.\u201d Oliver boomed down with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill shivered as the giant brat loomed over, he once again kissed the toe bigger then half his body. He licked just to hopefully appease Oliver more, cringing as he tasted the vinegary sweat coating the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver placed his chin in his palm chuckling at his tiny servant's worship. \"Yes that's right, give my feet the care they deserve. It seems your are SLIGHTLY above a bug, but only because the insects I find aren't intelligent enough to try and please me. But still, i can break you just like the bugs that cross me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear hit Will at the cruel yet childish voice degrading him. Oliver was keeping him alive only because he amused the brat and could benefit him with his knowledge.</span></div></div>",

Afraid I'll crush you and grind you to dust beneath my heel?\", Oliver smirked as he licked his lips. \"Don't worry, keep kissing my feet like the other basterds beneath me and i won't have your final sight be my shoe's sole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver suddenly spread his toes, wiggling them and hitting Will with an even stronger cheese odor. The toe gaps of the giant had a melted gunky lint smeared in the center and walls. The brat reached down surprisingly gently patted Will's head, however this was yet another mocking manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not clean out my toes for me little bug? Since you seem much more enthusiastic about serving my feet today.\", Oliver chuckled evilly as he leaned back into his seat, crossing his arms as he peered in between his toes at the tiny Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill suppressed the urge to vomit at the sight and intense stink that festered before him. Will knew if he threw up Oliver might stomp him again...much harder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill knew full well that by 'cleaning' Oliver meant licking up that jam. So with a heavy heart, Oliver steadied himself and leaned in to the first crevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver narrowed his eyes and wore a conceited smirk as Will took his first major lick. A big glop of gunk was pulled into his mouth and Will's stomach lurched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver noticed the runt struggling and gleefully decided to make it worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swallow.\" Oliver commanded, putting Will on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill's eyes bulged as the revolting gunk sat in his mouth, he could feel the cruel eyes of Oliver locked on him. Forcing down his gag, Will swallowed the gunk feeling it burn both his mouth and throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver laughed as his servant down the gunk, trying to hide his disgust. \"Ah i hope you enjoyed it, your so use to the fumes of my cheese i figured it be fair only to have some of it raw! Now then, hopefully your not full because I have so much more for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny gagged as he still tasted the gunk, bending down Will tried to cheat his way out of eating another clump by kissing the chessy gunk. However, Oliver coughed getting his attention and looking up Will saw the brat with a raised eyebrow and sneering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While kissing my feet is kind of you bug I specifically told you to eat my noble gunk. Need i crush another lesson into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically shaking his head, Will climbed into the toe gap and once again ran his tongue across the warm crevice to lick up more gunk. Oliver chuckled as he watched the bug feast upon the gunk. Flexing his toes, Oliver fanned out the smell of his odorous toes to ensnare Will in his chessy power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes and several mouthfuls of toejam there came a knock at Oliver\u2019s office door. \u201cCome in.\u201d Oliver called simply, his attention still on Will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn came the Colewood manor butler, a tall lanky older gentleman in the traditional butler\u2019s uniform. The butler tried to hide the distaste that might\u2019ve shown on his face upon witnessing the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might\u2019ve came as a surprise for anyone else, but Oliver\u2019s \u2018bug\u2019 had been shown to the house staff so they would be careful not to squash him. Also so they could keep tabs on him to make sure Will wasn\u2019t \u2018slacking off\u2019 as Oliver put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, one never got used to that smell or seeing such a vulgar display as a tiny eating a giant boy\u2019s toejam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster Colewood, I have reviewed the records and I believe I have tracked down the person responsible for the missing funds.\u201d Higguns the butler drawled as he approached the desk and handed Oliver a document.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver nodded and eagerly took it, casually flexing his toes in excitement...knowing once this bug finished the device...he\u2019d have a second bug to torment...for awhile at least.<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be all, Higguns.\u201d Oliver waved the butler away, causing the servant to bow and depart, closing the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was suddenly jolted as Oliver lifted the foot he was on top of. The foot was crossed over the other one casually, causing Will to have to grip the side of Oliver\u2019s pinky toe to prevent falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam wondered if his master had forgotten he was in here. Oliver however, opened the document and scowled. \u201cAs if I didn\u2019t already know who it was. Now I just have evidence.\u201d Oliver gained a practically demonic smile as he looked back up at his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I suppose you may stop now.\u201d Oliver reached forward and plucked Will out of the final crevice on the right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to save some of my cheese for my soon to be victim, don\u2019t I?\u201d Oliver said darkly as he dangled Will before his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, of course master.\u201d Will chirped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver pulled his feet off the desk and thumped them down onto the carpeted floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should provide me with a list of the resources you require so I may order them and have them shipped here.\u201d Oliver boomed as he deposited Will on the desk\u2019s surface which smelled of feet now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd remember...you have until Friday. Today is Monday, I believe you have more than enough time. Tch, the gall of you! Asking for extra time\u2026\u201d Oliver scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Will could attempt and let out a pathetic reply, he was knocked down to the desk as Oliver slammed a paper and pen. \"Start writing, i want to send this out before the hour's over.\"</span></div></div>",

Reaching down, the brat picked up his damp socks in his shoes. Since he's had Will, Oliver began to reuse his socks as he wanted to let his feet back in the most potent of scents. What's having a tiny servent if you can't give them the full potential of foot smells?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the socks over his feet, Oliver sighed as the damp fabric stretched over his large feet. Wiggling his plump toes in the socks Oliver then slipped on his dress shoes and tapped them to feel the damp fabric let out squelches from his sweaty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill panted as he's arms got sore from having to use the giant pen, but alas he soon wrote down the essential parts needed to construct the shrink ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-master this is all!\", Will said dropping the pen and letting his burning arms hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver picked up the paper, after briefly scanning over it he hummed and folded it in half. \"Indeed, I'll send for these to be delivered at once. Consider this your break bug, I expect this to be finished by Friday so I won't have you be distracted by pampering me.\", the boy sneered as he headed for the door. \"Once I have the device in my hands, I will crush more than that fool's dreams!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked off to hand the list to a servant, Oliver took another look at the paper Higguns gave him. On the paper detailed the reports of one of Oliver's brokers, while he was supposed to only be buying certain goods there was more money taken out then needed for the purchase. Of course the blond boy could just kick the man to the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he already had it planned out, not only would he shrink the worm in his company. He would set an example to everyone else on what happens to those who cross him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colewood manor began to bustle with activity for the next few days. Not only were the servants working to prepare the house for a board meeting of Oliver's company workers, but Will was using every bit of his high I.Q to build the shrinking device. Spending every hour awake constructing the ray gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver did show some care for Will, demanding that he go to sleep at a curfew. The lord spent his evenings watching with curiosity as Will built the machine, all while longing for a foot rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all the days that Will worked on the device, Oliver refused to bathe and only took his shoes off to go to bed. As for his socks, he still didn\u2019t change them, but he certainly didn\u2019t peel them off his worsening feet in all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Thursday at noon, Oliver was dozing off at his desk when a bright lime green light startled him. The light stopped and where Will had been standing on the carpet doing his work, there now stood a young adult male. The man was holding what appeared to be a toy \u2018ray gun\u2019 you\u2019d find at a cheap store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver blinked as the man said with a voice that was Will\u2019s only...far less squeaky. \u201cWell, that worked.\u201d Will shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver frowned, \u201cFirst of all...so that\u2019s what you look like at normal size. Second, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill paled and appeared rather nervous, \u201cOh um...I\u2019m sorry master...I had to test it on something organic and y\u2019know. I wasn\u2019t going to test it on you out of courtesy...and I didn\u2019t want to make you mad...but also didn\u2019t want to risk it not working at the last moment...\u201d Will trailed off sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at normal size, Will knew who was boss obviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver smugly smiled, holding out his hand. \"I understand now why not show me how this works so that we can put you back in your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill nodded and set the ray gun in Oliver's palm. Even if he was grown again, the scientist was still trapped in the past and surrounded by multiple servants that would surely keep him here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The green button grows organic creatures, the blue one shrinks them down. If their held down for more than a sec then they'll continue to grow or shrink their target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hummed before pointing the device at Will, pressing the blue button a flash of light surrounded the older man. As he began to dwindle down in size, Will climbed onto Oliver's desk and after a few seconds he was back to his inch tall form<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver chuckled as he looked from the ray gun to Will. \"Excellent work bug! Now I can put any of the insufferable bastards beneath me, show them their place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill nervously smiled and nodded. He was shaken up by the fact that he gave a merciless boy a size ray, but it was this or being crushed. Oliver smirked as he suddenly pulled out a pocketwatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time as well, the meeting is in half an hour. Soon I'll have two ants pampering my feet soon, though I intend to not let the new one prove it's usefulness like you.\"</span></div></div>",

Lifting up his shoe, the boy took a sniff out of the warm insole. Oliver licked his lips as he reached down and plucked up Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems my cheese has baked quite nicely. Only fitting i welcome your new bug friend with the ripest of scents.\", Oliver smirked as he suddenly dangled Will over the opening to his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill felt green in the face as the odorous fumes blasted him, the cheddary musk was 3x as strong now with the unbathed feet. Oliver chuckled above him. \"You will be attending the meeting with me, and I wouldn't want you to stay cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of the tiny, Will was dropped into the shoe soon landing and making a splash of sweat from the wet insole. The cave of the shoe was filled with the potent odor of vinegary cheese and made Will feel close to vomiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's booming chuckles echoed in the shoe and signaled a terrifying sight. The socked toes began to enter the shoe, Will tried to crawl away but found the toes pushing him face first into the sweaty insole. Soon Oliver pushed his foot all the way in, pulling Will under him to where he was getting squished into the ball of the brat's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver sighed and enjoyed the feeling of the bug under him. The wealthy brat knew this would be the first of many insignificant worms he\u2019d be walking all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young oil tycoon made his way confidently to the meeting room. He was of course the youngest businessman in recorded history, and he knew that irked some of his business rivals AND employees to no end. This brought him great joy to get under their skin and make them feel inferior...as they should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with his newly acquired power, they\u2019d be more insignificant to him than they could ever have dreamed. The brat entered the meeting room, a snack table was at the side of the room along with refreshments and all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the center of the room was a long table of glossy wood, along all sides of the table were chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the head of the table was the comfiest and most plush one reserved for the boss: Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy strode into the room with an air of confidence only someone who was completely in charge could emit. But confidence wasn\u2019t the only thing he was emitting...after days of not bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heads of each division of the many branches of Colewood Industries were all here. As Oliver scanned the \u2018guests\u2019 he saw the broker: Karl Ashford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver had looked into him recently, looking for weaknesses he could exploit and perhaps family he could cruelly use against him. Indeed, Ashford apparently had a wife and son who JUST so CONVENIENTLY...bought a nice home for the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver had made plans for them as well...to break his prey\u2019s spirit even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lad felt Will squirm underfoot and smirked, feeling his stocking squelch out sweaty moisture as he took his seat at the head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone is here? Good.\u201d Oliver said as he looked over the crowded table. \u201cI suspect you all know why you\u2019re here? \u2026.The snake in our garden.\u201d Oliver said, his eyes lingering on Ashford for a few seconds but no noticeably longer than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d One of the department heads spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver sighed, \u201cI mean...one of you has been embezzling funds.\u201d <br>\r\nThe room went into an uproar of gasps and attempts to shift blame...that is before Oliver slammed his palm down on the table to silence everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver noticed Ashford was starting to look nervous and sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy licked his lips, \u201cThe bastard hasn\u2019t experienced true heat...pressure..or sweat. He will\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRest assured I already have found out which one of you it is.\u201d Oliver pushed his chair back and stood up...beginning to circle the table like some sort of humanoid shark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he walked behind each of therm and continued to talk. \u201cSpending company money, meant to be utilized for company affair..MY money. So I am seeing fit to deal with them in a very harsh way.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you notified Scotland Yard?\u201d One of the men at the table asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver gave a dark chuckle, \u201cAbsolutely not. This is to be dealt with inside the company...by me...personally.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver felt himself swell with a feeling of absolute power as he saw Ashford was beginning to shake fearfully and whimper a bit.  Oliver finally stopped behind Karl Ashford and pulled out the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a gun?!\u201d One of the employees shrieked as everyone rose from their seats slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl turned around and saw the cruel, yet amused look, Oliver was giving him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tried...that\u2019s the important thing...right?\u201d Oliver asked mockingly...and held down the blue button. Everyone yelped and backed away as the blue light enveloped Ashford...until he was a mere 1cm tall and fell into Oliver\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was in shock, wandering wherein the world Ashford suddenly vanished to only to find Oliver sneering down at a speck in his Hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oliver strolled around the table, murmurs began to encircle the room all confused on what just transpired. Everyone went silent as Oliver sat down and held the speck before his cruel eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah look at that, a true leech. Sucking the blood out of my company, though in this case you thought i wouldn't notice my funds being used properly. Honestly even the post pettiest of thieves are smart enough not to try such an idiotic tactic!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Colewood...is that speck..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling and closing his eyes, Oliver put Ashford in his vest pocket. The boy smirked as he looked up at the men and began to step on his heels to pull his feet off. \"Ah so you figured it out. Well I'll confirm that hunch, yes the pathetic gnat was Mr.Ashford.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room soon became filled with uproars of shocked voices, some wondering how it's possible with others trying to deny something like that is impossible. Oliver smugly grinned as the men all yelled like chickens, he soon began to pull off his socks for another display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's attention was drawn as Oliver suddenly thumped the table again, however rather then smacking with his palm, Oliver planted both of his large and sweaty bare feet up on the table. Aside from the smell being attention grabbing, the sight of another small speck confirmed that indeed Oliver had the capabilities of changing someone's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, Oliver put the panting Will in front of his heel. The Victorian brat crossed his arms and smirked. Spreading his feet to look directly at Will, Oliver spoke in an authoritative voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being soaked in sweat and still heated up from getting squashed by Oliver's rank foor, Will quickly got up and rushed to the heel and began to rub. Oliver looked up at the table, seeing men looking at his feet in awe or fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bug here is known as Will, however addressing him as bug is important as it's one way to remind him of his place. I make him give me foot service and he is the one who built this amazing contraption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver suddenly brought his foot down, reminiscent of a few days ago. The blond boy smirked as the men gasped. \"Of course I have ways of dealing with bugs. I've spent my career crushing those who tried to cheat me of my business. Now with this i can ensure none of the leeches go uncrushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing up the gun, Oliver licked his lips as he twirled the device. \"You get my point gentlemen, it would be a shame if i had to use this on my more reliable members\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room once again became filled with voices, this time agreement with Oliver's point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver smirked, the commotion died down as he raised his hand. \u201cGood. You will speak nothing of this meeting and what you have heard here. If anyone inquires upon the..disappearance of Mr. Ashford...you will claim you have no idea where he could be. Am I clear, gentlemen?\u201d Oliver gave the gun another twirl, and everyone chorused: \u201cOf course, sir!\u201d <br>\r\nOliver chuckled, \u201cVery good, this meeting is over then. You can find your own way out.\u201d The lad leaned back in his chair as he flexed his bulbous toes with a squelch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businessmen hurried out of the meeting, some casting looks back at the horrendous soles and feeling pity for poor Karl Ashford.</span></div></div>",

Dangling him before his cold eyes, Oliver licked his lips as he took in the man\u2019s sorry state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor thing was hysterical, wailing and sobbing in a squeaky voice much like a bug that needed a good squish! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh do pull yourself together, be a man...well...you aren\u2019t really a man anymore now are you?\u201d Oliver\u2019s voice boomed mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m so sorry! Please-!\u201d The puny man was pleading pitifully. Will tried to tune it out, he couldn\u2019t let any pity for the poor man cloud his judgement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the man had done this to himself pretty much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver scoffed, \u201cBegging already? You truly are a miserable little parasite.\u201d The colossal lad narrowed his eyes menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wailed, he was still pretty much in a hysterical state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought you could outsmart me..steal from me...you truly are a miserable leech on my company.\u201d Oliver sneered. \u201cYou can stop squeaking at me, I care not for the wails of sub-human scum who I could very well crush with even my smallest toe.\u201d Oliver\u2019s verbal lashes were only making the man feel even more horrible, and sob more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was kneading Oliver\u2019s arch when he heard his master\u2019s booming last taunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...might as well at least TRY to keep being useful.\u201d Will thought before speaking up: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm..master...if he\u2019s scum, then perhaps he should experience the filth you\u2019ve been building up between your gargantuan toes these past days? No baths and whatnot\u2026\u201d Will suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver hummed lightly squishing Will to the table before raising his foot all the way up. \"Ah yes, i have built up quite an amount. Only fair i give the insect his welcoming present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing Ashford on top of his finger, Oliver smirked as he opened and wiggled his toes. He could feel the gunk getting mashed up and more melted, the bug began to wail louder and more panicked as he saw where Oliver was beginning to bring the finger holding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshford was soon thrown off of the massive finger and yelled as he was launched through the air. The thick stench filling the air began to thicken and the fall was soon cushioned as the cm tall man fell into the hot cheese gunk. Looking up, Ashford saw the giant face of Oliver looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips and scoffing, Oliver began to close his toes. \"Pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver smirked as he barely felt the tiny body between his plump toes, feeling more flooded with the gunk flooding around Ashford and subjecting him to a cheesy doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say your not even a leech. Goodness sake your not even a gnat, your just worthless. Drowning you in my foot filth is only the start i will slowly break you until you beg for death. I will relish when i eventually crush you into paste, smearing you under my shoe like flattened ants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill who was climbing and rubbing suddenly was snatched up in a fist and brought before Oliver's smug face. The blond licked his lips as he looked back and forth from Will to his wiggling toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bug is at least useful and can give me the most excellent contraptions. You on the other hand are only meant to be my entertainment, and receive the fate of all bugs i find invading my office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 1cm man was struggling like he was lost at sea...and in a way he was. It was not a sea of saltwater however, but a sea of built up sludge between a bratty young businessman\u2019s toes! Ashford at least took some comfort in the knowledge that his family was secure in their financial future...thanks to the money he took for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill couldn\u2019t help but blush as he heard how he was \u2018useful\u2019 to his master. It was similar to a less severe form of stockholm syndrome Will reckoned. Like those who fell in love with their kidnappers, Will felt a strange sense of loyalty to Oliver now. The boy could\u2019ve crushed him underfoot but he didn\u2019t, in fact he allowed him to serve him with his talents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill reasoned that it was more out of fear of the boy than anything else..but he wasn\u2019t so sure of anything anymore after his colossal failure landed him in this time period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Oliver was reading Ashford\u2019s thoughts, the young lad smirked confidently and decided to take that \u2018comfort\u2019 away from the pest. By the time Ashford had arrived at the meeting, his family was already being booted out of their lovely home accrued by HIS money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know above all else the reason you acted like a parasite to my wealth is due to your family right?\", Ashford froze in shock as the booming cruel voice boomed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While some may consider it a noble act I consider it disrespectful to me, so as we speak my money is being secured back to me. Which of course means all of the luxuries you bought being foreclosed! What's more, since you're nowhere to be found the assumption will be that you abandoned your family not wanting to be caught for your crimes.\", Oliver hummed as he taunted the pathetic creature being squashed in his filthy toes. He could picture it now, Ashford's wife and child growing hate for the puny man who seemingly abandoned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows my father was quite shit as well, maybe your brat will be like me when he grows?\", Oliver smugly grinned as he rubbed his gunky toes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he really is pathetic.\", Will stuttered out from the fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver rose an eyebrow amused. \"Yes, you know you are worthless when another bug degrades you. Now let's not leave you without work shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brat licked his lips as he set Will down in front of his other foot. All it took was a simple wiggle of Oliver's toes to sent him the order to start rubbing. The giant sighed as he felt the tiny hands start to rub his sweaty and chessy sole, all while he tortured Ashford in his gunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say this device you created is already proving its usefulness.\u201d Oliver mused as he enjoyed his foot rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it, master\u2026\u201d Will said from behind the huge foot. Oliver smirked at the reply, Will had figured out quickly how things worked around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know...I do believe you deserve a reward.\u201d Oliver said casually. Will nearly stopped the rub he was so shocked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really, sir?\u201d Will asked in disbelief. Oliver nodded and picked up the size ray, moving his foot out of the way for the moment. He hit the \u2018grow\u2019 button and increased Will\u2019s size to that of a small figurine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill could hardly believe it, but remembered his manners and kneeled. \u201cThank you master!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver nodded, \u201cThis is for my benefit too, however.\u201d Oliver gained a cruel smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow your foot massages shall be better..and you can reach more of my noble feet without climbing.\u201d Oliver flexed his toes in Will\u2019s face, chuckling at the tiny\u2019s wrinkling nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver leaned forward and spread the toes on his other foot, revealing the miniscule parasite Ashford close to submerged in his jam. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want this pest to drown in my toe slime already, now would I?\u201d Oliver chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching Ashford between two fingers, Oliver brought out a big wad of toe jam along with the 1cm man. He held the sticky glob to Will, \u201cSmell it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill obliged and felt his nostrils burn significantly less but still strongly as he leaned forward and inhaled the gunky fumes from the jam. Oliver smirked as he saw his tiny servent green in the face. \"How is it dear insect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down any regurgitation, Will put on shaky smile. \"It's very...strong master, much like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver hummed as he brought the wad of gunk to his eyes. The blond boy narrowed his eyes as he spotted the micro Ashford in his toe jam. Licking his lips, Oliver brought the gunk back down to will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here i think my bug should have a snack as well, just be careful to not consume the runt. Not that he be much of a snack.\" Oliver smirked dropping the gunk into Will's cupped palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figurine sized man held back a sigh as he held the warm gunk in his hands, spotting Ashford pathetically squirming. Will might've already had a lunch of the foul gunk but he still wasn't used to it not to mention he had to be careful not to eat Ashford. Sliding the wad into his mouth, Will began to slowly break down the gunk and swallow the funky jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle bits broke off from the wad and were swallowed down, burning Will's throat. After sucking on the jam for a good minute, Will felt the tiny body of Ashford sloshing around his mouth.</span></div></div>",

He had his feet up on his desk though looking closely one could see under the heel of his shoe was the tiny scientist he recently came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill groaned as the weight of the foot squished him and made him feel on the brink of getting crushed. He had made the mistake of requesting a certain amount of time for his construction of the shrinking device. That earned him the duty of footrest for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver smirked as he used the tiny human like a footrest. \"I must say your not that amazing of a footrest insect. Had i not have you building that device I'd waste no time snuffing you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill felt dread fill him at the cruel taunt, afraid any second he'd be a splat under the dress shoe of the Victorian boy. Still, with a chuckle Oliver rose his foot off of the tiny and leaned forward onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you'll finish the device before the end of the month correct? I'd hate to keep the scum of my company walking free.\", Oliver asked narrowing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes master I'll have it in no time!\", Will shouted standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver chuckled darkly. \"Good that's what i want to hear. But, i still think i need to teach you in demanding time from your lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the giant do?</span></div></div>",

It made him feel so insignificant whenever he saw them, no doubt that would've delighted the cruel boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress shoe was placed on the desk's surface, insides still emitting steam. Oliver leaned his face down, wearing a smugly satisfied grin as he gave the footwear a small sniff. \"Mmm..I have worked up quite the cheese if I do say so myself.\" The posh boy boasted, before plucking Will up and dangling him over the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be my insole for the rest of the day.

The scientist couldn't even yell as the large toes pinned him to the insole with a splash of the sweat gathered from baking in the shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheddary odor was shoved into Will's nostrils as the big toe alone smooshed him down. The toe gunk had melted from the heat and was emitting their killer fumes through the sock fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver smirked as he finally put his heel into his shoe. Wiggling his gunky toes, the blond boy felt them easily squash Will, filling his ego even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my toes will teach my insect discipline.\", Wiggling his toes once more, Oliver stood up and chuckled as he felt Will sink into his sweaty toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill felt panicked as the pressure of the giant fuming toes suddenly increased, squirming pathetically against the odorous digits. Oliver sneered. \"Oh you don't care for my toes? Well than why not try cushioning here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending his toes, Oliver tilted his foot up to sent Wil sliding down the sweaty insole. After moving a few inches, Oliver stomped his foot down now consuming Will in the plump flesh under the ball of his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver sighed as he walked and squashed the tiny under each step. \"Ah much better. My noble feet are quite soft insect so you'll most likely not be crushed to an insignificant stain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to walk out of his office, Oliver sneered down at his dress shoes. \"I hope you learn your lesson from this, next time you back talk to your master I'll consider making my socks your bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was no where better, sure the cheddary odor was a tiny bit less intense but now he was being consumed by the plump sole of Oliver. With each step he felt weightless before the sole squelched it's cheesy sweat and squished him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver strolled down the halls with a grin, different from his usual scowl or smirk. Passing butlers and maids made sure to show their respect, but they all picked up on the more instense steps he was taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Oliver reached a large ballroom, usually empty and only filled with activity when their were parties. Standing by the walls was an elderly lady using a cane to support herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms.Anne I'm ready for my lesson.\", Oliver said pressing down on his foot and sliding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady chuckled as she pushed up ger glasses. \"My Oliver your more eager than usual! Now then, today we will be focusing on the waltz....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver nodded and kept a calm face as he began to move his body as instructed. The boy smirked internally as with each step he felt his sole stomp down on his tiny human. Truth be told his foot did feel more comfy with the puny man being squished into his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver wasn't always fond of dancing, but while simultaneously putting his bug beneath him. He grew an appreciation for the art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
