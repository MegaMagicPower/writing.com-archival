Bigger than being exclusive. Bigger than living in the same city together. Bigger than living with Zack's Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice Carlyle and Zack Tyler, two young but ambitious lovers, were about to move in together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about to move in together, and they were ready to cross the country to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEast Coast natives at heart, neither Zack nor Alice had ever dreamt of going so far west. Settling squarely in the middle of the country, the titular couple had managed to make a decent start at carving out a little life for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's hard work at the Hammond chain of hotels had netted him a cozy promotion into a covetous management position. He had been working there ever since he had gotten out of high school, impressing coworkers and superiors alike with his surprising work ethic. While he certainly isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, Zack's ability to buckle down and deliver results is impressive enough to merit sending him to help develop the Abercrombie branch of the Hammond Hotel chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alice has landed a promising scholarship at Abercrombie State University. After spending two years in a Community college back in Daven's Port, Alice has earned herself a very rare opportunity to make it big in the fashion world. She was the one most hesitant about the move, but knowing that Zack will be making enough for them to live off-campus together while she devotes herself full-time to studies certainly makes it easier. Plus, getting out from under her mother's thumb is certainly a plus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the perks of being (and being involved with) a company man, Zack and Alice were afforded one week all-expenses paid at the luxurious (but somewhat lacking!) Hammond Hotel while the finer things with their apartment were ironed out. It was a show of good faith, and one that they were both very happy to recieve, but it was definitely nice to have finally settled in the place they'd be calling home for the forseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a <i>big</i> apartment by any means, but it was certainly nice. Nicer than either of them had been used to. Alice had spent every year since she was fifteen crammed into a dorm room, and Zack had been sharing his brownstone apartment with his mother and four other siblings since... well, birth. All this extra elbow room was definitely something that would take some getting used to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, there was a kitchen suite, a back porch that overlooked the city, there was even a spare bedroom to do with what they saw fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So</i> nice, especially for being so young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just had to be careful. Living alone, by themselves, without either of their respectively shrewish mothers to constantly impose themselves on their lives... it was scary! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they could do it, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving together, here in Abercrombie... it might be easier than they thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm steam filled the bathroom as the shower hissed loudly overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice brought her head underneath the nozzle, letting the shampoo rinse out of her long blonde hair. She ran her fingers through it, scrubbing and scratching until the residual soap had bubbled and died underneath the constant current of steaming water. Extending a hand blindly, her bright blue eyes closed <i>just</i> in case, Alice turned off the water to the shower and felt for her towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending one long ivory leg, Alice stepped out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the shower to drown it out, the sound of the sink echoed off the tiles of their new bathroom walls. Zack stood leaned over the sink, still dressed in his pajamas. He was shaving, clearing away the poofy white beard of cream he had spread over his neck and chin. He smiled beneath the opening he had left for his mouth, cutting his eyes at her reflection in the foggy mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Alice said with a smile of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been living together for two weeks now, and the novelty of seeing each other in various states of undress had yet to wear off. This hadn't been the <i>first</i> time that they had inadvertantly intruded on one another's morning routine, but it was beginning to become a welcome installment to their day to day lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course they had been seeing each other naked for quite a while now\u2014it must have had something to do with the fact that they were <i>living</i> together that made it so special, they both thought as Alice wrapped her arms around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the picture-perfect couple; and the mirror agreed, as it framed the two together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scooch over, I need the mirror.\" Alice said with a playful bump of her hip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done, almost done...\"</span></div></div>",

His sweet new promotion meant that he finally had enough money (and a good enough reason) to move out of his mom's house back home. The move had been a big step for him, not to mention a big step for his relationship with Alice,  but after two weeks in his new life, Zack was finally beginning to feel like his old self again... maybe even better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shed his baggy white t-shirt and flannel pajama pants, exposing the lithe figure beneath. He wasn't exactly athletic, but he had a natural muscle tone and firmness to his figure. Most guys, after being in a relationship for so long, might have let their guard down. Started to bulk up a little, and not in a good way. But not him\u2014at least, not yet anyway. And not if he had anything to say about it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stretched appreciatively, his lean figure silhouetted by the morning sun as it flittered through the drapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaid out on top of the comforter, Zack had selected his clothes for the day...</span></div></div>",

But then again, this was inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ri-\" Zack started before trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick Fuller.\" Zack said before looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see her face but man he could <i>feel</i> it contorting into a face of disappointment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Alice asked, \"You have a lot of great and wonderful friends to choose from and you chose to hang out with Rooker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we haven't talked in a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for a <i>very</i> good reason!\" Alice snapped, \"Don't tell me you actually sought him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He called <i>me</i>, alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much does he need this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A whopping zero dollars and zero cents!\" Zack sarcastically replied, \"News flash, he just wants to hang out at some pizza place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he wants you to do something illegal.\" Alice said furiously, \"He probably wants you to help him rob that very pizza place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you <i>stop</i> it with the judging shit?!\" Zack shouted, his voice nearly cracking. \"Why do you keep insisting that he's some Seth Gecko wannabe that's trying to get me into robbing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because <i>he already tried roping you in</i>.\" Alice's tone was filled to the brim with tranquil fury. Calm and collected, but stilled stuffed with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I rejected him flat.\" Zack said, much calmer than he initially was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were both calm enough to lay on the bed, holding hands as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a wonderful man, Zack.\" Alice said as she finally broke the ice, \"Your heart is huge, and I'm scared Rooker's gonna try and take advantage of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me.\" He said warmly, \"I can take care of myself. I know you don't understand but, but he's been in my life too much for me to just ignore him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But was he involved in a good way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he actually was, back when we both worked in that shit job at Spencer's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice couldn't help but widen her eyes in shock and turn her head towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worked at a <i>Spencer's</i>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. I'm sure you'll understand when I say I don't like talking about it.\" Zack replied darkly, \"But of all the bad things I've dealt with at that job, Rick was not one of them. He was one of the main reasons I stayed at that place for more than a month. I mean Piper and Dakota were great friends, but I couldn't hang out with them while I was working and, well, Rick filled in that void.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice then put a tender onto Zack's softened face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that he means a lot to you. But please, don't let that cloud your judgment. I know you don't want to hear it but he might be playing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"ll be fine.\" He assured her, \"Besides, even if he did want to rob something, I don't think even he'd do something like rob the very store we're eating at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this place we're in right now?\" Rooker whispered as he sat down at a booth, \"I'm planning on hitting it next weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRooker didn't even wait for Zack to sit down in his fucking seat and he was already talking about pulling a score. Zack gave him a nice plain stare before taking his hand off the booth chair and immediately heading for the exit. Just before he opened the doors, Rooker grabbed his shoulder, only for Zack to violently turn to face him, feeling tempted to push him to the ground. Rooker took a little step backwards, straightening his red suit a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Zack replied calmly, \"Not interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't ev-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's going to get-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, <i>no</i>, <b><i>no</i></b>, <b><i>SHUT UP!</i></b>\" Zack yelled, causing almost everyone to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack blushed heavily before glaring back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really thought you just wanted to have a chat.\" Zack said, mentally kicking himself in the head for being so naive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do! It's called a conversation!\" Rooker explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is called a recruitment.\" Zack hissed quitely, \"You lost one of your crew and now you're looking for a replacement at the last minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually uh,\" Rooker replied sheepishly, \"I don't have a full crew ye-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You don't have a full crew for a job you plan on pulling next week...\" Zack said before audibly gasping like a fish out of water, \"Well now I <i>definitely</i> want nothing to do with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRooker then grabbed Zack's shoulder again and almost slammed him against one of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten minutes. All I'm asking for is ten minutes of your time.\" Rooker panted before glancing towards the buffet line, \"Besides, they got some killer food here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack gently shoved Rooker off before contemplating. What he was offering was nothing short of trouble. Trouble with a prize that he no longer needed at this point. But then again, Rooker <i>was</i> more fair than people gave him credit for. If you didn't want in on something shady, he'd pretty much leave you alone for a while. Granted, as soon as he had <i>another</i> scheme cooked up he'd pester you again, but then, you only had to firmly reject him in order to get him off your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, you got <i>ten minutes</i>.\" Zack said before walking back to the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down, Zack finally started taking note of his surroundings. It was a rather nice looking establishment called \"Pepper's Pizza\", sort of a family get together type of all you can eat buffet. From what he could see, they certainly had a lot of variety when it came to the Pizza department. The place also had a good selection of drinks, granted they were all Coke products but hey, that meant they had Mellow Yellow in the mix and that was always a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then looked at the booth he was in and observed that there was already quite a number of finished plates on the table. Not that there was any left over crust or anything, oh no, but there was a lot of sauce stains that indicated there was once food on them. Just then Rooker came back with two plates. Both with only a slice of Cheese Pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, here's the setup.\" Rooker began once he chomped a bit off his slice, \"Every Saturday, rich man John Jacobi comes here with his literal large family for a weekly get together. And I mean big ass large family! Mostly made of females, with a few men in there as well. They all gorge themselves, mom tries to make the daughters act more like her, the little kids go off to play in the arcade over there, the older kids stay behind and inhale cheese bread, and the Jacobi parents passionately embrace each other like it's a lifetime romance of the week. Essentially, what a modern family does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for the lifetime movie part.\" Zack quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah but, anyway, here's where it gets interesting. Jacobi's oldest daughter Melanie recently got hospitalized and no, it wasn't due to a heart attack. She was apparently driving from her home to her parent's mansion before accidentally swerving into a tree. She's not dead, but the whole thing's still fresh in Jacobi's mind like an open wound. He's the kind of person who sort of becomes soft when reminded of past tragedies. Meaning he probably wouldn't resist if say, a robber were to threaten to put lead into a hostage's stomach if he doesn't give away his money right then and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one'll get hurt huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a twinkle was in Rooker's eyes as his mouth formed into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Not a single person will get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Zack saw a woman approaching their table. A woman of the...<i>expansive</i> kind. Hell even that was somewhat too soft a term to describe just how large she was. She was definitely reaching 400 lbs. It was a shock to absolutely no one that she came over here with two full plates of pizza, pasta, and cheese bread, though interestingly she also a cup of ranch dressing as well. Once the plates were down, the massive gal squeezed right in next to Rooker who was probably regretting the fact that he entered the booth first. And then, it finally in Zack's mind. No one'll get hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Rooker's 'hostage'.\" Zack said, stretching out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gave a devilish grin as she shook his hand with a pretty strong grip. Once the handshake was done with, Zack had to flex his hand a little just to see if it was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet Martha, Zack.\" Rooker said, \"She's an old friend of mine and she's the one who alerted me of Jacobi's family tradition. She also happens to bear just the slightest resemblance to Jacobi's recently hospitalized daughter but that <i>must</i> be a coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to imagine I know but I eat here very often.\" Martha snarked, \"One day Rooker came to me, trying to find quick money to make and I suddenly remembered that there was a loaded family man who'd never put his money before his children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Zack said, \"We just walk in disguised and 'kidnap' Martha over here, then we guilt Jacobi and possibly his whole family into loading our pockets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly.\" Rooker admitted, \"I mean, we wouldn't want to miss out on all the other wallets in this fine establishment now and we certainly wouldn't dare ignore the cash register that'll no doubt extremely loaded that night, would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many more guys are you gonna get, assuming I join that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more.\" Rooker said, \"That'll be enough to have this place under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked down at his now empty plate before being nudged by Rooker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you Zack.\" Rooker said reassuringly, \"The only pain that'll be delivered here is a few bruises that'll easily heal. Not to mention how much you'll make off of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack just quietly stared as his plate in thought. He promised Alice he wouldn't get into this. Zack then finally looked up at Rooker. He made his choice. </span></div></div>",

With a face like his, Zack didn't have to say a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what your answer is.\" He said, nibbling on his pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Alice means a lot to me, more than any other person I've dated.\" Zack said, \"I told her I wouldn't get roped into your shit.

I certainly don't need to steal it from others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRooker picked at his slice for a while, carefully avoiding Zack's eyes. He was so sure he had Zack hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" He finally said, \"At the very least, you got a decent slice of pizza out of this, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing the cheese pizza, Zack couldn't help but agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'pretty good.\" He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try the super meat pizza.\" Martha said, adding that with a downright lustful \"Mhhm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet. Well, I better get going.\" Zack said, \"I don't want Alice to worry about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Rooker said, \"And uh, you'll keep this between us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. I hope you do well, Rooker.\" He said, exiting the booth, \"Hell, maybe we can meet up again sometime...Without you trying to recruit me into anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRooker laughed but it was obviously forced. Even Martha looked concerned for him at this point. Zack gave Rooker a final glance before saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya later Rooker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Zack had left the restaurant, triumphant as hell. He had faced temptation upfront and never even thought of yielding. And people said he had no self control. Walking to the parking lot, Zack couldn't have made a bigger grin than the one he wore right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...How was it?\" Alice asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zack was gone, Alice did nothing but worry. She worried about Rooker trying to weasel Zack into a scheme, she worried about Zack saying yes, worst of all she worried about him declining and Rooker not taking no for an answer. Thankfully, Zack entering their home meant the third possibility was out (...Well, it made it less likely at least). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right.\" Zack said solemnly, \"He wanted me to rob a joint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stared into the distance. <i>Of course he did</i>, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I turned him down flat.\" Zack said, giving her a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice glared at him for a while, trying to look for any clues that he lied. When she couldn't find any, she smiled as well before giving Zack a great big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of you, hon.\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking should be.\" Zack snarked, before getting a pillow to the face.</span></div></div>",

Packing everything up, securing the apartment, having to deal with their respectively overbearing mothers voicing their <i>constant</i> disapproval of the idea, sometimes it all got to be a little much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure he and Alice had been having fun these past few weeks, just sort of settling in and getting to know the city together. While that was all well and good, he had been looking forward to this day for what seemed like a really long time by now. Alice would be out all day, and he wouldn't be starting at the hotel for another few nights. That meant he had all day to do whatever he wanted\u2014and all an overworked guy like Zack wanted was a day to lay around the apartment like a lazy bum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sweetie, I'm heading out.\" Alice leaned over the couch and gave Zack a quick peck on the lips, \"You're <i>sure</i> you don't want to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah babe, I'll be alright.\" Zack put up a tough front, smiling boyishly as his girlfriend straightened up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... if you need me, you know you can\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cText you.

I can feed and take care of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it just... it'll be so weird being apart.\" Alice said sentimentally, \"I mean, we've spent the past few weeks together every minute and it's been so great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it had been! Don't misunderstand, Zack was more than happy to spend every minute he could with Alice! But when given the option, it was important that he get some time to... y'know, be himself. By himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Zack sat up and gave his girlfriend a longer, more intimate kiss, \"But I'll be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovebirds gave their final, wet, open-mouthed goodbyes for another minute or so before Alice checked the time. Smiling awkwardly, she shuffled out the door. And while he wasn't particularly proud to admit it, Zack eagerly shut the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally\u2014a chance to be free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm Cass Morgan, and this is your Morning News.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so... maybe he'd forgotten how to be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been so long since Zack actually had some time <i>alone</i> that he'd... well, forgotten, exactly, how to be alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was funny because, as the youngest in a family of five in a crowded apartment, he'd always wished that he could be alone for just one second. And then, when he started dating Alice, she moved in not long after. And with his work and his friends, Zack had slowly just let it pile up! And now that he was alone, all by himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly did people who didn't have a full-time job and a girlfriend <i>do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always XBox\u2014he had fought so hard to keep that damn thing, and it was one of the first things he'd plugged up to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe his friends were on? It was pretty early, and most of them were bums. He could go for a round of Call of Duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he <i>was</i> pretty hungry. Maybe he could grab a bite? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, both of those involved moving. And on a lazy day, moving was pretty much the <i>last</i> thing he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always TV. He missed TV.</span></div></div>",

Once upon a time, the ensemble had been the uniform that Zack had worn while he was rising up the ranks in the Hammond Hotel Chain. After several weeks of careful tailoring and refitting, however, they were now Alice's classiest clothes. Making the adjustments to menswear to make them fit her hadn't been easy (though it did help that the uniform had been made for Zack when he'd been fatter than he was now). However, it was effort that Alice thought would be worth it, considering today's interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had already gotten into Abercrombie University, one of the most prestigious universities around. At the head of Abercrombie's Fashion Studies Program was one Professor Sheila Taylor. Professor Taylor was regarded as a perfectionist, someone who would fail any student she didn't feel was putting in the kind of effort that a truly modern designer needed. But those students who managed to pass her courses tended to have a leg up in the cutthroat fashion industry. Many dresses and suits that the rich and famous wore to award ceremonies, parties, and other events had been designed by students of Professor Taylor. That wasn't even mentioning that Sheila Taylor's clothing had been worn by two different first ladies and the Prime Minister of another country!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence, these days one had to interview Professor Taylor before she would admit a potential student into her classes. Alice hoped that showing off some clothing that she had already worked on would earn her some respect in the Professor's eyes. Not a lot, maybe, but enough to make it into the class. And that was something that Alice desperately wanted. Thinking about it now was already starting to cause her anxiety to flare up again, though she did her best to quash the nervous thoughts. She'd been working on these clothes for three weeks now! She'd taken accurate measurements of herself, she'd been precise in the alterations she had made, she had done everything perfectly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anxiety wasn't entirely gone, though. Sure, she could tell herself that she was an expert tailor, but there was only one way to know for sure. Taking a few minutes to build up her courage, she donned her underwear and then picked up the pants that, until a moment ago, she was sure would fit her. Now, she wasn't so sure. Had she done everything right? Had her measurements really been accurate? Her alterations precise enough? Alice took a deep breath to calm herself and slowly began to put the pants on.</span></div></div>",

Then, she went and stood in front of the full-length mirror she'd had installed in the room (a housewarming gift that had been the collective purchase of several of her friends from her old school).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything fit perfectly. The pants hugged her legs without being too tight, her shirt and vest were neither hanging loosely off of her nor were they uncomfortably tight, and she'd even managed to get that double-Windsor knot that Zack had shown her just right. The shocked look on Alice's face gave way to a smile as she began to strike a few poses in front of the mirror.

After all, she hadn't quite managed to slim herself down back to her pre-Buttercombe body. A part of her mind said that the butt in the mirror was still too big. A different part said that it looked good. It was okay to think that about herself, right? After a moment, Alice decided that it was the pants that really made it look great. The pants that she'd managed to alter perfectly!

No matter how hard she tugged at the waistband of her pants, they just seemed to refuse to work with her. Finally, she took in a deep breath and sucked in her gut. The button went into the button hole with no problem. As soon as she let her breath out, though, she felt a tightness in her waistline that she hadn't felt since her Buttercombe days. How had this happened? She'd been doing everything right! She'd been regularly exercising and eating healthy! Hadn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then remembered how she had been spending the last three weeks. She'd been so engrossed in working on the clothes that she'd neglected her regular morning run on some days. A bowl still half-full of candy caught her eye too. But she'd needed that candy! Snacking while tailoring at Buttercombe had been part of her creative process, had led to some of her best work! She'd spent the first week of this project just staring at the clothes, unsure of what to do, until she'd bought some generic chocolates at a store as an impulse purchase. Getting back to the tailoring process that had worked for her in Buttercombe was what had led to her finishing this project. What else had she been supposed to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Alice shook her head. It was too late to take back what she'd done in the past. What was done was done. The nervous teenage Alice Carlyle might have spent the rest of the day a nervous sobbing wreck, but she was mature adult Alice Carlyle! She dealt with her problems head on! And so she picked up her dress shirt and vest and tried them on with only a little nervous hesitation. And surprise of surprises, they fit just fine! Which meant that any weight she might have inadvertently gained while working on her project had probably been added to her hips and butt. Figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tied the red tie into a Double-Windsor knot that Zack had shown her the night before, and slipped on the loafers. Alice then looked at herself in the mirror. The young woman who was staring back at her was slightly grimacing due to being stuffed into a pair of pants just a little too small for her. Other than that, she did look presentable.

But the pants seemed to stop midway up her thighs and wouldn't go any higher no matter how much she shimmied, tugged, and pulled at them. What had happened? How did everything go so wrong? Had she taken the wrong measurements? Used the wrong materials? Gained some weight? She had snacked an awful lot while tailoring the clothes during the past few weeks, weeks that she now saw had been completely wasted. Why had she chosen so difficult a task? Why had she devoted so much time to a failed endeavor that she'd neglected the exercise and diet that she'd been on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot tears ran down Alice's face. This just wasn't fair! She'd put everything she had into making this outfit work! All that effort for nothing! She dropped the pants to the ground, and flopped onto the bed, ignoring the fact that she'd be wrinkling the rest of the outfit. What did it matter? They probably didn't fit too! Alice spent the next few minutes just lying on the bed, feeling sorry for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great effort, she wrenched her mind out of the mental freefall she had found herself in. So the suit that she had been tailoring was a bust. Yes, it was a shame, but she couldn't just lie down here and give up! That's what the old Alice, the nervous wreck she'd been before going to Buttercombe would have done. Sure, the boarding school <b>had</b> done a number on her waistline, but she'd also met a lot of friends there who had helped teach her how to become a stronger and better person. If she wanted to continue to be the kind of woman that they'd helped shape her into, she was going to have to move on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still some perfectly good clothes in her wardrobe, after all, that she <b>knew</b> would fit her. None of them were as classy as the vest-and-dress pants combination that she'd been planning on wearing, but she'd still look professional-ish enough if she picked the right top and bottom. And if she had enough time, she might even be able to swing by a store on the way to the interview and snag some formal wear (if it was in her price range, that is).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice tilted her head and looked at the clock sitting on the bedside table.</span></div></div>",

Way to formal, gotta go; this was just a simple meet-up with an old friend that was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the skirt over her hips Alice reminisced about her days back at Buttercombe and all the people she had met there; some for the best, others for the worst, like any traditional high-school upbringing really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButtoning up her top Alice then thought back to her friends; Samantha her punk bestie, Mel her \u201cbig sister\u201d as long as Alice\u2019s real big sister was not around, Ronnie the R.A. with a heart of gold and a whiz in the kitchen, Arisa the genius she had got to know well in her second year; good times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if they were meeting her at a simple coffee shop in town, perhaps they lived in Abercrombie? She might be able to keep closer in touch with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice excited her apartment, locked the door and headed out; the sun was beating down brightly, but not enough to make her uncomfortably hot, and the plants were still in full bloom; not a bad day for a meet-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice began her walk to the boulevard though, she could not help but notice the town\u2019s rather high obese population. It was extraordinary, like she was back at Buttercombe or something. Everywhere she looked there was a boulder-like belly, a hug gelatinous backside or a huge bustline supported by a large potbelly. Alice hoped it wasn\u2019t something to do with the food around here; after all that dieting down from her formally pudgy build it would be awful to slide back simply because she was going to a college in a town with a high chance of its occupants getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the small coffee shop, Alice took a moment to look around; no sign of her old friend, the blonde woman must have been early. Deciding not to look like she was simply loitering about Alice went inside and decided to order a simple drink while she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d came the cheery greeting from the barrister behind the counter, waving an arm joyously as Alice approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hi\u201d Alice replied with a bit of a jump, not expecting such an overenthusiastic server. The barrister looked like she really shouldn\u2019t have been behind the counter; she was practically squeezed into it! She had long thin braided hair rolling over one shoulder, a round face with a sweet smile, big fluffy cheeks and a massive belly that was so large that the topmost roll was actually sitting on the counter while the woman\u2019s backside jutted out so far back it HAD to be touching the back of the serving station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Clara, your barrister today. What can I get you?\u201d the woman cheerily asked, taking up a pen and notepad while snapping Alice out of her daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a coffee\u201d Alice replied, trying not to look too startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like a small, a medium or a large?\u201d Clara asked, bouncing almost at the word large; as if making a cheeky joke about her own girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a sm...actually a medium\u201d Alice changed her mind, she shouldn\u2019t get a large that was for sure, but a medium wouldn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwsome! One medium coming up!\u201d the dark skinned barrister squeaked as she tried to manoeuvre her way over to the dispensers a little further down. This took several attempts, mostly as her belly and butt seemed to have jammed her in place and it took several grunts and squishy wiggles to unstick herself. Pouring the coffee with a seemingly well practiced hand, Clara handed the piping hot drink to Alice who presented the overfed woman with the payment. \u201cSorry about the delay, I swear they moved the counter recently, I keep getting stuck\u201d Clara tried to hand-wave with a smile, the free hand trying to slosh her belly back into place as she resumed her previous position behind the front of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice raised an eyebrow, firstly at the clueless barrister, who did not seem to know just how big she was, and secondly at her drink; she did order a medium, it said on the cup, but it really looked like a large. God was this what a medium gets you around here? Alice mentally jotted down to make sure she always got smalls of everything in this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the outside chairs, Alice settled herself down and began to sip her coffee; it may have been way too much for her to finish, but it sure tasted good. As Alice began to lose herself in her drink and absentmindedly scanning her surroundings a voice snapped her back to the original reason she came all the way out to the coffee shop anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Alice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Alice saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arisa Spencer and Alice had been in the same year, but neither had talked to each other until their second year. Back then Alice was chubbing up pretty fast and her mother as always on her case about it (worrying both her daughters were becoming obese blobs); it was during that time that Arisa had to be put on a special service due to her own vast weight and could no longer perform Physical Education classes and was reduced to note-taker. This had brought them into conflict as Alice could not bear her mother haggling her anymore and wanted Arisa to fudge her weight on the notes; but Arisa was far too much of a goody-goody and couldn\u2019t morally agree to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had led to Alice and a second girl, Molly Harrington, to attempt to distract Arisa with food, hoping her note-taking skill would deteriorate and both girls would get off scot free. Alice however eventually caved and told Arisa the whole thing, which she took surprisingly well and the pair remained firm but odd friends ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were actually quite similar. Both wanted to ace all their grades, were about the same height and had been originally quite poor at socializing; so they got along like two peas in a pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice saw though as her old friend approached, while Alice had managed to drop her high-school pounds, Arisa had done anything but that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArisa had arrived to Buttercombe academy already weighing in at a very hefty 280 pounds, so she certainly had a leg up on other girls as everyone began to put on weight at the pampering academy. So when girls in Arisa and Alice\u2019s year were approaching Arisa\u2019s entry level weight, the big dark-haired girl was miles ahead of them, leading the pack in how to be very very fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArisa was actually rolling up to Alice on a mobility scooter, something she very evidently needed. The massive woman was dressed in a flowing skirt and an obviously tailor-made but very stylish pink top that exposed one shoulder. Her legs were spread wide not only because of the machine she was riding, but because her obstructively large belly was drooping between them, forcing her bronze-colored legs apart. Speaking of which, Arisa legs were huge, each thigh looked like a massive bronze barrel attached to a slightly smaller one below it. Even Arisa\u2019s feet were incredibly fat; easily visible in sandals due to the warm weather, her plump digits looked swollen her toes barely wriggling they had fattened up so much. High above Arisa\u2019s breasts sat ontop of her belly like a pair of mountains rising from a planet, kept perky by what must have been an industrial strength bra. Arisa arms, fully exposed by her cool top, looked like they were being engulfed; her upper arm-fat slowly swallowing her lower arm. Her sausage-like fingers wrapped diligently around the handlebars of her scooter. Lastly was Arisa\u2019s face; she had always had a very fat face, but now it was almost a parody of one. Arisa\u2019s cheeks dominated her visage so much that her lips looked a bit puckered; while her chin had a pair of friends, each trying to edge further down her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to see you! Come over her and give us a hug!\u201d Arisa beamed, her voice, despite the many engulfing layers of lard, still squeaky and high-pitched. Getting up and giving her gigantic friend an extremely squishy hug, Alice was quite taken aback; she probably shouldn\u2019t have been, Arisa was so very large last time they saw each other during graduation that this really was the only logical step, she couldn\u2019t have suddenly dropped 500 pounds in just a few months after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Mmmph*It\u2019s great to see you again, how have you been?\u201d Alice asked, trying to ignore the almost literal elephant in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I am actually studying business further; mom said I need just a few more qualifications before I become her understudy and then eventually take over Boonliang Corp\u201d Arisa demonstrated this by making a demonstration of small between her fat thumb and forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! Sounds like you are moving up in the world\u201d Alice congratulated, \u201cwhere are you studying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here!\u201d Arisa beamed, throwing (as best she could) her arms up, \u201cSurprise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, are you serious!\u201d Alice cheered back rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally, I got an apartment close to the college and everything, in fact I managed to stay with another Buttercombe girl, remember Marissa?\u201d Arisa seemed absolutely ecstatic, although, most things did that to her. Marissa though, Alice did not know her personally, but had known her twin sister Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Marissa Dupont? I knew her sister...\u201d Alice explained, hoping to not put a damper on Arisa\u2019s story by not knowing one of the massive Thai woman\u2019s friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, well she is like Anna but more party and less study\u201d Arisa laughed before continuing, \u201cwe both got an apartment together; she is already settling in really well, hell she is already dating a local football player\u201d. Alice was not surprised by this, from what she had heard of Marissa, she was a stereotypical blonde party-girl slash cheerleader type, so dating a big hunky football player seemed par for the course. \u201cShe is so cute though, it\u2019s adorable seeing them together...\u201d Arisa continued as Alice almost choked on her coffee, she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Marissa was...?\u201d Alice began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know right? Well, I didn\u2019t know until I caught them making out on my coffee table\u201d Arisa laughed, \u201canyway her name is Kennedy, she is like She-Hulk\u2019s less green sister but girlier than you can imagine; she is so adorable, took me clothes shopping even, not that they make anything in my size on the high street but bless her for trying\u201d Arisa emphasized this by patting the monstrous sea of fat in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh....huh\u201d Alice confirmed as the obese barrister suddenly appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Can I get you anything?\u201d she asked, her smile beaming out of her face like a ray of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get fifteen muffins Clara? Five blueberry, five chocolate and five raspberry?\u201d Arisa asked, holing out her credit card and scanning it to pay for her treats. \u201cI just need a snack for the road\u201d Arisa joked to the bubbly barrister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, oh how I wish I could snack like that\u201d Clara replied with a giggle before turning her massive butt around to head back inside, \u201cB-r-b guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I am already getting to know people around here! I am settling; this is so exciting!\u201d Arisa squealed, wiggling her dark-brown arms around. \u201cYou totally should come around ours so time for a house-warming; are you rooming alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I am living with Zack, my...boyfriend\u201d Alice sheepishly explained as Arisa put her hands to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoyfriend! You gotta tell me everything! What does he do? Where did you meet? Is he cute? Does he have a brother?\u201d Arisa shot all this out very quickly leaving Alice laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! This is just like old times, I missed this\u201d Alice remarked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know me to; now, I have been rambling on about myself for ages, you spill everything.now.\u201d Arisa stated, pointing a flabby finger down at the table, hoping to hear everything that had gone on with her friend since they graduated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So Alice had never exactly been the \"active\" type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't to say that Alice was exactly \"lazy\", she just wasn't really the type to go out to the gym. When she lived in Daven's Port, she had made it a habit to go for jogs around the neighborhood in the mornings in addition to being much more careful about what she ate. She had come a long way from the big-bellied blimp that she had felt like (and in all honesty, had been) in high school, but she couldn't help but feel a little antsy about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving with Zack had been wonderful, and even the less than stellar parts had been at least fun. But living in the Hammond for a few weeks while things settled out with their apartment hadn't exactly lent her any favors. She had felt herself slipping back into that Buttercombe mentality\u2014lay back, enjoy yourself, who cares if that food's a little fatty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she wasn't having it. That was the <i>old</i> Alice. The one that she had left back at Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, she hadn't exactly done herself any favors. While Zack promised it wasn't noticeable, she'd put on about ten pounds since this whole moving business started. The luxurious food that the Hammond had to offer, combined with Zack's lucrative employee discount had made provided quite the temptation; to say nothing of the full spa on the pool floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it was time to make a change. Start developing some healthy habits. Again. Re-developing healthy habits. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat better place to (re-)develop those habits than the gym?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFit Life was a nice enough place, after all. It was only one of, like, three gyms in town and the other two were on the east side, closer to downtown where Zack worked. Their website said that they tried to cater to a friendly atmosphere, and Alice figured that gymtimidation was the last thing someone trying to keep her figure needed.  It was relatively close, close to campus, and seemed pretty approachable, so why not give it a shot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in her tank top, one loose enough to more or less hide her prominent bust and long enough to dangle behind her heart-shaped hips, Alice put on her trainers and made the drive over. It was a smaller place than she expected, taking up two spots in what Alice assumed was a strip mall. It was nestled next to a nail salon and a frozen yogurt shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, welcome to Fit Life!\" came the sweet slight drawl of the receptionist behind the counter, \"Do you have your membership card with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice shrunk into herself habitually, twiddling her fingers over her gym bag. She steeled herself. New Alice, remember? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't, actually. My boyfriend and I just moved here, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that's no problem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist, her name tag said Marianne, held up her hands in a vague sense of welcoming excitement. She was a bit taller than Alice, and had her long dark hair up in a cute little 'do. Marianne had prominent features, maybe she was Italian? But judging by her perfect nails, her plush figure and wide hips, Alice didn't exactly see her as the \"active\" type. Not that she had much room to talk, mind you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get you all set up with our free 30-day trial period. After that it's ten dollars a month for our basic package.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen dollars a month for a gym membership? That didn't sound too bad. Not that Alice was exactly the expert on how much she should be paying to come to a place and use their equipment. But ten dollars\u2014that  wasn't bad at all. She might even be able to convince Zack to let her use his debit card...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound too bad.\" Alice smiled, feeling at ease, \"Just ten dollars a month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ten dollars a month.\" Marianne affirmed with a smile as she slid Alice some paperwork, \"We try not to be too... I guess you'd call it clingy? Don't want to scare anyone off, y'know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice laughed, albeit somewhat weakly (as she was quite scare-offable!) and signed her life away. The contract wasn't anything too intense, and there was no commitment. If Alice canceled, she'd have to pay for the next month, but there were no other cancellation fees. A low pressure environment was just what someone like Alice needed, especially since these little trips to the gym would be coming between (what she expected to be) very stressful courses at ASU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well you're all set up!\" Marianne said with a smile as she slid the paperwork back behind the counter, \"The ladies' locker room is down that hall, to the left. The weight room is to the right of <i>this</i> room, and any of the machines are up for personal use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Alice offered a smile as she grabbed her gym bag off the ground, \"Is there anything else I should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Marianne bit her bottom lip as she rifled through stray flyers and sheets of paper on her end of the desk...</span></div></div>",

All the packing, the <i>un</i>packing, hauling everything in a uhaul, spending hours crammed in a tiny vehicle; that didn't even begin to describe all their running around once they got here. No matter how much she moved around in her young life, Alice would still never get over how <i>exhausting</i> it all was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a lot of fun spending so much time with Zack, but she was more than a little grateful that she would be having this day for herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, I'm heading out.\" Zack said as he grabbed his keys, leaning over to give Alice a quick smooch, \"You gonna be alright while I'm gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, in her too-big t-shirt and floppy pajama bottoms, her long blonde hair pulled back and her little feet bare, looked pretty much the picture of comfort. She stood with her hands behind her back, seeing Zack off at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...\" Alice said with an innocent rocking on the balls of her feet, a small spreading across her face, \"I think I'll manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't manage <i>too</i> well without me.\" Zack said with a little hug, \"We moved across the country together\u2014the last thing I want is for you to realize you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to perform at or near expectations.\" Alice said with a giggle, \"But not exceed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, just to make me feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovebirds shared a more intimate kiss than before, with Alice wrapping her arms around Zack's waist. As they stood there in the door, Zack allowed it to close slightly before they parted, a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be weird being apart for the first time in...\" his blue eyes looked to the side, \"God, feels like forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will...\" Alice answered, her smile more girlish. He wasn't usually this clingy! It was kinda cute! \"But you're gonna be late for work, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\" he checked his phone, \"Have fun while I'm gone, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice waited until the door was shut. She counted the footsteps with a growing excitement, waiting until Zack was <i>just</i> out of earshot to practically launch herself onto the couch! She landed with such force that she bounced on the springs, her feet kicked up as she lay splayed out on the couch\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a little She-time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuugh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice lulled her head back on the couch. She-time was hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly was there to <i>do</i> that she couldn't do from the comfort of her own bed? She didn't want to do school stuff, even if she kinda needed to. Alice had spent alternating hours cooped up in moving trucks or crammed in a tiny hotel room for the past few weeks. Now that she and Zack finally had her own place, and this would be one of her last chances to get in some time as a lazy millenial before school started, it was important... no, it was damn near necessary for her to find something that she would enjoy doing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack had his XBox plugged up and running. But Alice wasn't really one of those... gamer girls. Video games were confusing. And besides, Zack might get mad if she accidentally messed something up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always the internet. That was a sure-fire way to waste the day away, even if it didn't sound particularly productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had the TV on, but it was just on the news. Maybe she could find something that she wanted to watch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, maybe breakfast? It was a little late, but surely <i>somewhere</i> had some food to snack on...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do...?</span></div></div>",

And at the worst possible time too; Alice had already missed the opening score of her favorite daytime talk show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hi everyone, I'm Marni Blake and <b>thiiiiis</b>\u2014\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"IS THE MARNI BLAKE SHOW!\"</i> the crowd roared<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so sue her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prissy little white girl who went to a ritzy all-girl's academy and wanted to grow up to do fashion liked to watch the Marni Blake Show. There <i>were</i> worse things in life, y'know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody, repeat: <i>nobody</i> knew about her secret daytime tv indulgence. Nobody except her sister (who got her hooked on it in the first place!) Zack's brother Darren (a fellow fan and Marni Maniac) and her mother (a more reluctant fan there never had been). She had never had the guts to admit to Zack that she liked to watch the Marni Blake Show, for fear of judgment. They were a couple, yeah, and they'd been together for a long time now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could she ever admit to him that she liked to watch one of the trashiest, dumbest, who's-the-baby-daddy show out there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been so long since she'd seen it, it was a more welcome experience than most to see her hostess on stage, plopped and wedged tightly into her signature seat. Marni Blake was a fat little woman, with a head of curly brown hair and more chins than inches. She was so big, and so short, that Alice often wondered how it was possible for a woman so <i>round</i> to waddle across stage like she did. Back when Alice was going through her unmentionable <i>chubby phase</i> it did her a lot of good to see Marni constantly staying so upbeat about her size\u2014even now that she was still <i>mostly</i> skinny, Alice appreciated Marni's confidence in her <i>unique</i> figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright everyone, we've got a big big <b>BIG</b> show tonight\u2014\"</i> Marni held up her hands and spread her chubby fingers out as her eyes went wide, <i>\"We've got Tyrone, who doesn't believe that he's the father of Rebecca's baby...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd booed, with Alice signaling her own disapproval by giving the screen a thumb's-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But first, I promised you guys a <b>BIG</b> show, and intend to deliver!\"</i> Marni crinkled her face as the crowd roared, <i>\"So without further adieu, ladies and gents, let's bring out my first guest...\"</i></span></div></div>",

They switched to the camera that led off-stage to the dressing rooms, choosing to introduce the day's guest from the backside first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's eyebrows rose involuntarily at the silhouette that eclipsed the lighting. Marni hadn't been kidding when she said that she had a big show in store for her audience today; if only Alice could have known just <i>how</i> big, she might have braced herself. The woman walking onstage may as well have been two or three guests, all wrapped up into one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd like you to welcome today's guest,\"</i> the image flipped to camera one, panned out across the stage, <i>\"A woman who needs no introduction; Dr. Brittany Huan!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the audience roared with applause, the addressed doctor raised an appreciative hand as she lumbered onto the stage. Her arm was thicker around than most women's calves, packed into a white lab coat so tightly that even Alice could make out the definitive crease where her upper arm folded over her elbow\u2014even the slight polite wave she gave the crowd sent it all shaking. This woman was enormous, probably one of the biggest women that Alice had ever seen in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Huan walked slowly, her pace hampered greatly by her immense bulk. Her great belly bobbed and swayed as it led the way for her, her fat legs spreading wide as she took slow, awkward steps onto the stage. She turned and smiled to the crowd, her fat face creasing with appreciation of the warm welcome that they had given to one of Marni's girthiest guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt in anticipation of her arrival, Marni had a loveseat ready for Dr. Huan. Alice doubted that even the heavy hostess' generous seating arrangements would have contained the double-wide doctor's derriere. Dr. Huan sat next to Marni, filling most of her seat with relative ease. Her huge stomach hung forward, causing her legs spread and fill whatever space on the couch she hadn't already, and spread generously towards the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Huan gave another wave, her great arms wobbling, as Marni clapped her fat little hands excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice recognized her, vaguely, as the scientist whose face had been making rounds lately throughout social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, this was the first time Alice could recall actually <i>seeing</i> her. That sure was an awfully positive response for a crowd who, Alice doubted, was very versed in her particular field...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Welcome, welcome, welcome Dr. Huan!\"</i> Marni gushed with a particular enthusiasm, <i>\"You have <u>no</u> idea how happy we are to have you here today!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The pleasure's all mine!\"</i> the fat woman chuckled, her vast body wobbling shortly, <i>\"Big fan of the show.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh stop...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though her viewing habits had slipped lately, Alice could still tell that this Dr. Huan woman being on the show was a pretty big deal. Their usual fare of \"special guests\" were reserved for shock value. Men and women with weird piercings, overly tattooed individuals, and those who had undergone severe body modification. While Dr. Huan's weight <i>was</i> shocking enough to have value, Marni seemed to be playing her completely straight. Whatever Dr. Huan had done to get on the Marni Blake Show, it definitely wasn't because of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"For those of you who don't know, Dr. Huan here is one of the most revolutionary minds of our (your? our? I'm gonna say our!) generation.\"</i> Marni leaned forward into her vast belly, reaching onto her knee and spreading one chubby white hand along its surface, <i>\"Dr. Huan has made national news concerning her most recent breakthroughs, and for <u>some reason</u> she agreed to do my show.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother appreciative round of applause from the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please Marni, call me Brittany\u2014\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eee! I can call her Brittany!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"\u2014And you know, I wasn't kidding when I said I was a big fan. I've been watching for... well, since the beginning I guess.\"</i> Dr. Huan said with a head motion that caused her vast second chin to bunch against her cheek, <i>\"But I'll admit, it wasn't <u>just</u> because I wanted an excuse to meet you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The <u>real</u> reason (well, the <u>other</u> reason) I wanted to come on stage with you today was because I needed the perfect venue to give everyone a first-hand look my research!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd seemed to purr with approval and interest. Even from her living room, the bumming blonde had gone from laying splayed out on the couch to sitting right at it's edge. She hadn't even heard of this woman until a few seconds ago, and she was already on pins and needles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Most of you all,\"</i> Dr. Huan turned to the crowd, <i>\"Have probably seen me on Facebook. Buzzfeed, Youtube... on the internet, any part of the internet, for my <u>controversial</u> theories about body mass. Weight\u2014in the sense of <u>fat</u>.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Dr. Huan took a moment to acknowledge the elephant in the room\u2014meaning, her. Or rather, her distractingly high weight. With two meaty hands, she grabbed the forefront of her vast double-belly by the middle roll and gave it a punctuating, if slight, shake. The vast doughy sea of her belly shook accordingly, even as she let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And you know, it gets pretty old, hearing all the negative remarks that people have to say about what I, and by extension my research team at ASU and the Yeng Company, are claiming.\"</i> Dr. Huan folded her fat hands on top of her still-jiggling stomach, settling its tempo, <i>\"We're all working really hard at proving what we've been researching and... you know, it's all just theories and suppositions that <u>we're</u> pretty sure are true, by this point, but it's really hard to make other people believe us\u2014and what we're claiming\u2014without any evidence.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, you know, I'm a big supporter and I'm more than happy to help in any way I can.\"</i> Marni added quickly, <i>\"You know, besides liking all your posts on Facebook.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gave a collectively appreciative chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know, I'm so happy you said that? I really am.\"</i> Dr. Huan said with a smile, <i>\"Because I brought a sample! A little... sneak peek, as it were, into what the good people at Yeng are paying us to do.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Really?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And I was hopiiiing... you'd be down for a little science project Marni.\"</i> Dr. Huan punctuated her point with a dazzling smile, her cheeks dimpling twice over as joy overcame her fat face, <i>\"Do you... want to try it out?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni turned towards the crowd, clearly caught off-guard by Dr. Huan's odd request. There was a slight pause before someone in the audience urged her from off-screen, and the rest slowly began to chime in. Before long the entire crowd was chanting 'do it, do it!' Even Alice had to admit, she was really curious to see where this was going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well... alright!\"</i> Marni chuckled nervously, <i>\"What do i have to do?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Huan and the audience were delighted\u2014the excitement was palpable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it cut to a commercial break; Alice would have to wait a whole two to five minute before she finally got to see what was so interesting about this Dr. Huan woman! Well, before she got to see whatever cool experiment she was going to have Marni help her with. Alice didn't have much of a head for science. Even if she googled Dr. Huan, she probably wouldn't have followed the <i>summary</i> of her work, let alone the finer details. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what did she say that she specialized in? The study of... body mass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Alice worked up the energy to whip out her phone, the commercial break ended. Tossing her phone back onto the couch (even ignoring a text from Zack!) Alice reglued her eyes to the screen. As soon as the opening cinematic ended, the camera was focused back on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Dr. Huan, and then there was Marni...</span></div></div>",

It took a few moments to even process that what Marni had adorned over the commercial break was some kind of jumpsuit. Quickly, Alice's clothing keen eyes noticed the main material was some sort of polyester that hug close to the show host's large standing frame. A bit too closely for the young fashionista's tastes. In fact, the more Alice observed the cut of the outfit the more she found wrong with it! The neck line ran high enough to emphasize's Marni's bulging double chin, and the full length legs and sleeves were bunched up at the ankles and wrists as if tailored for someone quite a few inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe studio audience was certainly captivated, but the relatively quiet reaction betrayed that they were awaiting further explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Welcome back folks! Normally I'd have some sort of smooth segue for you, but I'm just as lost as my fans here. Dr Hu... Britney, care to give us all some details as to my attire?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well Marni, I'll let the dress speak for itself for just a moment longer... let the suspense build up. Mind giving us a full tour of what you've donned for us today?\"</i> The still seat bound doctor signaled the host to give the crowd a quick spin. Despite Marni's confusion and curiosity, she kept her professionalism and quickly obeyed Britney's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a good deal smaller than her giant guest, Marni's slow rotation was not just showmanship. It took some time and effort for her to complete a full 360 degree spin. The camera crew took advantage of this to show a close up of several angles to both the television broadcast and the large display monitors to either side of the stage. Still confused coos of excited starting emanating from the crowd, and Alice was soon joining in with them. As Marni started turning everyone could see there was much more to this garb than met the eye. It only took a bit of motion for Alice to pick up on what was fundamentally different that she had missed before. Marni looked... blocky somehow! On the host's chest, stomach, biceps, and outer legs were angular lines that betrayed something lying beneath the fabric. Most conspicuous of all, there was a large pack strapped to her back with two large cylinders conjoined by a computer with a fancy looking display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"While I've always fancied about modeling, this isn't exactly what I had in mind doctor! Obviously there's more to this get up than your average jogging suit smuggling some plastic plates and what appears to be a very expensive science experiment. Tell us a bit about all of this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Absolutely Marni! Make your way over here and we'll get started.\"</i> The rotund researcher patted the arm of the love seat and continued. <i>\"As you all are certainly aware my research deals with facing the challenges associated with obesity. Now unlike other doctors featured on daytime television programs, I'm not going to try to sell some fad diet or sketchy pill and then walk away with my cut. I'm a real doctor working with real science looking for real solutions.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney yielded to the brief applause from the crowd as Marni waited patiently next to her. Alice leaned forward, even more captivated by the doctor's words. As an alumnist of the prestigious Buttercombe Academy, she was quite familiar with women of (much!) larger size. In fact for a few years Alice herself had succumbed to the temptations and wore her fair share of extra pounds before shedding them in favor of more trendy and fashion forward clothes. They just weren't available in the sizes she had reached by the end of her sophomore year! Some of her classmates didn't quite share the same priorities though. By the time they walked for graduation, the majority of her friends and acquaintances had sailed north of the 300 pound mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresent day Alice slipped out of her mental sidetrack as Dr. Huan continued talking. <i>\"Well Marni, everyone in the crowd, and everyone watching at home; today I'd like to share with you one of my latest and greatest breakthroughs! I'd like to first mention that this was only made possible by the generous funding from the lovely people at Yeng Inc.I truly can't thank this company enough and I am so glad they share my vision. Marni, what you're wear today is an early prototype of Yeng-Huan Suspensor technology!\"</i> The crowd let out a wild reaction, led by those in the crowd that could guess at what the name hinted at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Britney, with a big sponsor and a big name like that, you have my full attention. Now, what have I signed myself up for here, exactly?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll show you, turn your back to me.\"</i> Marni promptly did. The massive doctor leaned forward and deftly tapped at the screen on Marni's back a couple times, causing the backpack to begin lowly humming.<i>\"Well Marni, tell me what how you... </i> feel<i>.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd held it's breath. Alice was practically biting her nails in anticipation. Marni looked confused for a moment, then took a step forward and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Folks, I want to give you a full disclaimer here. I promise there is no gimmick here, no strings holding me from above, just this... suit.\"</i> She took a few more amazingly long steps forward. A few gasps came from the crowd as they started to piece what this amazing suit could do. Alice cocked eyebrows on the brink of realization. Suddenly, the host smirked and exclaimed in her best hot-shot voice <i>\"Watch this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she jumped straight up. And not just a small hop you'd expect from a woman of her girth. She reached a clear two feet off the ground, possibly higher. She landed in a small stutter, not quite used to handling her newfound mobility, and crowd burst out in amazement. Marni gracefully spun around, putting to shame the first rotation she had made to display the attire. Going an extra half revolution, Marni stopped to face one Dr. Britney Huan, who was grinning like a mother watching her daughter walk for the first time. Marni spoke up, <i>\"Dr. Britney Huan, I am absolutely astounded that you gave me the privilege to wear and show such an amazing technology. I mean this in the best way possible; just what have you done here!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you for your kind words Marni, it means a lot. As you can no doubt tell, and as most of the crowd seems to have figured out, the Yeng-Huan Suspensor technology in this suit does just that! It suspends the mass of the wearer to essentially counter-act gravity. Of course, this is a very early version of the tech, so I can't quite share all of its secrets. But as you can see it's stable enough for its public debut. Right now I have it calibrated to effectively halve your weight. Now I know a woman doesn't simply give her weight away, but I'm guessing at your size you're feeling quite the difference right now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Britney's speech Marni was busy playing around with her new freedom. She tried bouncing on the balls of her feet, swinging from side to side, and even a few more small hops. Every movement she made seemed so much easier than just five minutes ago. <i>\"Oh Britney, this is just beyond description! I haven't felt this light in years! Even before my days on the radio I don't think I could move around this easily! But tell me, there's got to be a catch. Is my bone structure gonna disappear if I do this too long?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nothing that we know of yet. The main problem right now... \"</i> Marni was busy going for another high jump when an indicator light on the top of the pack flashed red and Marni's jump only cleared the few inches one would normally expect <i>\"...is that the power consumption is extremely high and thus one full charge will only last a few minutes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well if that's all there is to worry about for now, then sign me up! As someone of significant size, I definitely understand how much easier this Yeng-Huan Suspensor tech would make life easier, and much more fun! Not to mention the kinds of applications this technology could have across all areas of industry and entertainment. Just wow. Again, Dr. Huan, I'm humbled and grateful that you chose to showcase your world changing technology here exclusively on the Marni Blake show. I can't wait to see where you take this one, and what other surprises you'll have in store for us in the years to come!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thanks for having me Marni, it was my pleasure and I'll definitely let you know if I cook up anything else in the future!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild as Marni struggled to do her transition over them, <i>\"We'll be right back after these short messages!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice blinked. Knowing she wouldn't find anything else at 11:30am to top a spectacle like that, she clicked the TV off. <i>Amazing. Anti-gravity clothes... what a time to be alive</i>. The curvy young gal sat back on the couch and pondered the clip she had just seen. She briefly questioned if it was real, but quickly dismissed the notion. The Marni Blake show was known for wild, wacky, and sometimes trashy segments, but that previous segment seemed impossible to have faked. The light-footed performance from Marni, the genuine reactions from the crowd, and of course the real deal Dr. Huan. Something about this technology had Alice very excited. She couldn't stop thinking about that outfit and what it did. In fact, she found herself fixating again and again on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just how <i>ugly</i> that outfit was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, that was a silly thing to be so concerned with when the outfit in question was capable of allowing huge leaps and bounds in the air, effectively \"halving\" (to use Dr. Huan's phrasing) Marni's weight. With just a single jump, the roly-poly hostess was sent nearly two feet off the ground, and her slow and awkward gait was replaced with the pep of a stepper more than half her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely it <i>had</i> to have been staged. There was no way that an ugly, blocky sweat suit allowed for a woman of Marni's size to jump and spin and twirl like that. It just couldn't be done\u2014Marni had to have weighed almost three hundred pounds on a pretty teensy-weensy frame. As much as Alice loved the show, she had an awful hard time believing that this was a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she played it back and forth, back and forth, Alice wasn't becoming so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Huan tapped on the computer display and slowly, ever so slowly, Marni just seemed to... rise slightly! It was most noticeable in her belly, which slowly rose from resting heavily on her meaty thighs to swelling outwards; completely supported by the suit! Alice watched it over and over again, looking for wires or... or something but there was nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where was stuff like this when <u>I</u> was fat?</i> Alice thought bitterly, if only for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't begin to count the time she'd gotten winded just walking to and from her various classes at Buttercombe. She had been such a blimp back then, with none of the bouyancy. Big belly, big hips, big <i>ass</i>, all weighing her down; getting her caught in things and popping all of her painstakingly tailored clothes. Alice thought, if just for a moment, what her high school life might have been like if she had one of those Yeng-Huan thingies during her peak weights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, but I would never have been caught dead wearing that thing.\" Alice dismissed the idea with a distasteful curl of her nostril, \"It would have been fashion suicide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Even if she had been a total cow back then (and she was!) Alice could never have brought herself to wearing something so ugly. Those blocky sleeves, that gross chest-piece, and those horribly flaring frumpy pants... ugh! She'd have looked twenty pounds heavier in that thing if she put it on right now! And not to mention that godawful drab gray color; there had to be something more stylish or sleek that doctor could have made them. At least a cuter color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf <i>Alice</i> had designed that suit, it would have been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf <i>she</i> had designed that suit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack called out into the apartment, loosening his Hammond-red tie and unbuttoning his sport coat. They had given him an awfully warm welcoming dinner at the hotel; he couldn't possibly have said no, especially when so many of them brought their own dishes from home. He might have made a bit of a pig of himself, but who could say no to a good old fashioned apple pie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al?\" Zack looked around, only to find the apartment empty, \"You home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the sensation of fullness in his stomach, Zack ventured deeper into the apartment. The living room TV was still on, so Alice wasn't <i>gone</i> gone. Maybe she'd stepped out for a bite to eat or something? It wasn't like he could blame her after all\u2014he <i>was</i> pretty late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was when he noticed that the light in the spare bedroom was on, and the unmistakable sound of Hillary Heart was crackling through the tell-tale sound of that old speaker that Alice liked to listen to when she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe?\" Zack knocked on the door with his finger, \"You in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Alice's little office chair rolling against the hardwood floors, along with a muting of the stereo, signaled that he had been heard. Within seconds Alice whipped open the bedroom door, her long blonde hair a frizzled mess. She was still dressed in her pajamas from that morning, so he knew she hadn't been anywhere; she couldn't have been. Zack recognized that look in Alice's eyes\u2014he only saw it when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie!\" she said with a big, scarily energetic grin on her face, \"You will never <i>guess</i> what I saw on TV today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she told him! She ushered him inside the spare bedroom that was currently Alice's de facto studio for all her latest projects. He sat down on the futon that they kept in the sofa position while she rolled around in her office chair, from her desk to the easel papers that she'd tacked on the wall. And she told him everything\u2014that she was watching Marni, that there was this weird doctor, that this weird doctor was really <i>really</i> fat, how she had this suit, this <i>thing</i> that made Marni float! Then she went back and explained that Marni was kinda heavy and then she went back and reiterated that, yes, she watched <i>that</i> Marni Blake Show. And then she reminded Zack that holy crap, <i>this Dr. Huan chick had a suit that made people float!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was sooooo ugly!\" Alice ran her hand through her long hair as she whipped out her sketches, the loose papers crackling as she handed them over, \"So I thought... you know, why should it have to be ugly? Who's gonna wanna wear it if it makes them look like a floating slab of concrete, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yoou...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack flipped through the sketches. His girlfriend wasn't a bad artist\u2014she couldn't be, if she wanted to conceptualize her work. Alice had drawn a myriad of different designs originated from her rough sketch of what (he guessed) was her memory of Marni's outfit. On the right there was the original, with a rather accurate portrayal of the heavyset hostess if her advertisements were any indication of her current weight, and with every progressive design Alice took the outfit and made it... different. Better! Much, much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are these weird... things?\" Zack pointed to the model's arm, \"These things all on her body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Alice snatched the paper back and started circling with her finger, \"But Dr. Huan made it seem like they were pretty important. I think they're whatever makes the suit do the... the floaty thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Zack said with a smile, \"The floaty thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it recorded, Zack!\" Alice huffed, \"I swear, I'm not making this up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I believe you.\" Zack said with a hint of condescension, \"But it's really late babe. Remember? I've gotta start going to work early in the mornings now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! You don't believe me.\" Alice swiveled around in her chair, \"You think I'm dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're dumb.\" Zack rolled his eyes and turned his girlfriend around on the chair, \"I think you're <i>probably</i> pretty hungry though. And then you're gonna be <i>sleepy</i> and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a telltale grumbling from Alice's stomach. It was true\u2014she hadn't eaten anything since Zack left that morning. She had just been so <i>absorbed</i> in her work that... she had forgotten to eat again. As the realization hit her, Alice's face grew a bright shade of red. Zack gave her a knowing glance, which caused her to shrink slightly as her newfound candor disappeared in favor of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, okay... you win...\" Alice said sheepishly, \"You're right. I <i>am</i> a little hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... do you like them?\" Alice looked up at her boyfriend pleadingly, \"I mean... they look good, right? You'd wear them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as Zack allowed Alice to process just what she had asked of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean, i-if you were a girl!\" Alice backpedaled, \"A-And you were, um... and you were kinda big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would totally wear them if I were a girl and I were big.\" Zack gave Alice an appreciative kiss on the forehead, \"Now come on, before you work yourself back up again. We'll talk about it more in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Alice took one last look at her designs, \"In the morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's... six-thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice jumped. \"Oh! Hey, sleepyhead! I'm just... making some eggs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach blinked his tired eyes, trying not to look <i>too</i> skeptical. His girlfriend was many things, but a cook she was not. Time and again Alice had insisted - and proven, on occasion - that she was not to be trusted in front of the <i>microwave</i>, never mind a stove. Yet here she was, blond hair waving wildly as she turned back to the oven, her entire focus concentrated on the slowly burning eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you'd be asleep,\" Zack muttered, picking at his boxers as he sat down at the old faux-wood table. Alice seemed anything but asleep - in fact, she was already dressed, her sky-blue blouse paired with a well-pressed white skirt. \"Isn't it your day off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but you know what they say... second day is always the hardest! Thought I'd help you out,\" she chuckled unconvincingly. \"Uh, do... do you think these are done?\" Alice used four hot pads to grip the handle of the pan, biting her lip as she revealed the stringy eggs inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Zack insisted,  grimacing as merrily as he could as Alice presented him with a plate of eggs and a glass of milk. He forked a clump, sticking them in his mouth - like eating rubber seasoned with sooty onion. He took an immediate swig of milk. \"Definitely better than last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice beamed, watching nervously as Zack shoveled down the brownish-yellow eggs. He didn't gag once. Giving her a quick thumbs-up, he excused himself to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the soft hiss of the shower from the bedroom, Alice hastily pulled her newest design out of a currently-empty kitchen drawer. It was rough - real rough. Like, drawn-while-she-was-cooking-eggs rough. But it would have to do. She pulled out a pencil for a few last-minute touch ups until she heard the shower stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack walked into the kitchen, looking snazzy in his white button-up and slacks. \"Cya later Al,\" Zack said, smoothing his white button-up nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, hun,\" Alice replied, pulling him in for a quick kiss. Zack left the house with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick fifteen-minute make-up check later, Alice climbed into her old silver impala. Setting the manila folder in the passenger seat, she took a deep breath. It was her day off, right? And a two-hour drive wasn't <i>that</i> far away. And who knew? This could be life-changing! She could meet <i>Marni Blake! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice took a deep breath, clutching the steering wheel tightly.

No, I don't know her name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause; Alice took this moment to stretch up on her tippy-toes anxiously.

The aspiring designer was walking on Cloud 9, her head filled with puffy thoughts about her accomplishment here today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she was, just coming off of an obsessive all-nighter, about to meet one of the most prolific scientific minds of her time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause <i>fashion</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hardly believe it; she may as well have still been dreaming! This was a huge opportunity for her, and the head scientist - this Dr. Huan woman - had agreed to see her and look at her designs! <i>No one</i> had ever taken her dreams seriously when she was little, barring perhaps her sister, and look at her now! About to talk to one of the smartest people on the planet and criticize her fashion skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife goals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was so entranced by all the possibilities that were in play, she barely noticed when she bumped into an intern or scientist here and there; letting out half-thought excuse-mes or too-little-too-late sorrys. Alice stumbled and fumbled her way until she reached the office that the secretary had described; the one at the end of the hall on her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">DR. BRITTANY HUAN<br>\r\nHEAD OF DEPARTMENT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe supposed this was the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath to steel herself, Alice hugged the manila folder of her sketches tight against her body. She paused, closed her eyes, and attempted to center herself. Her heart was pounding in her chest; she could feel it against her drawings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look at the nameplate on the door, Alice extended an arm, and twisted the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the office was messy. Papers strewn about, pieces of lab equipment placed haphazardly on this surface or that table. But it was a big room, justifiably so given the size of its sole occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the desk against the back wall, Alice quickly recognized Dr. Huan. The immense Asian woman stood out like a sore thumb, Alice would have been able to pick her out of a crowd even if she <i>hadn't</i> just seen her on Marni Blake. Dr. Huan was so corpulent, so big in her belly especially, that she required a C-shaped desk to wrap around her vastness, rather than be forced to reach past her own girth in order to be productive. Her vast gut poured outwards readily, resting on the surface in front of her just ever so slightly, while the rest of her filled the remaining space accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, judging by all the takeout boxes, Alice had interrupted her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her best game face, Alice smiled eagerly and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Huan needed only to hear the door shut, instantly recognizing Alice as her potential client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked the blonde bombshell up and down, her swaddling chins flexing as they swelled against her neck, and said...</span></div></div>",

Wait a minute, aren't you Mel's little sister?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded reluctantly, not happy to be \u201cMel's little sister\u201c again. Here she wanted to make a name for herself and she was again reduced to a footnote in her older sister's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, it is you! Yes, I see the family resemblance.\u201c And Brittany gave her a piercing stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah...\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I remember you from Buttercombe, too. But why are you so thin, girl? You used to look much healthier\u2026 What happened?

For my old friends, I'm just Brittany, OK?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but I am here on business, you see, Brittany...\u201c Alice sat down on the edge of the visitors' chair, ready to spring up again, and placed her folder on a rare empty space on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, but that can wait. Or are you in a hurry?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice truthfully admitted that no, she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let's have lunch first, business can wait, right?\u201c Brittany looked around the empty boxes. \u201cWell, there's not much left, but have a bite of this china,\u201c and a family-sized container landed in front of Alice. \u201cAnd then we can split the cheesecake. You like cheesecake, right? Everyone likes cheesecake. So, how's Mel doing these days?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, she moved to her aunt Rhonda and last I heard from her, she had a grand time there, much better than while she stayed with our mother...\u201c Alice took a breath to continue but Brittany butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I recall when I first met Mel \u2013 back then she was a skinny freshman, almost as scrawny as you \u2013 she mentioned your mother being a total b...\u201c and Brittany reminisced about the good old times, bringing up one funny episode, then another\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talked and talked, Alice tried to put in a word or two but soon she resigned herself to nods and grunts of agreement. To cover her unease, she dug in. As much as she tried to limit her consumption these days, fond memories of Buttercombe (and the exquisite taste of her lunch) made her forget diets and restraint. She could afford it to eat like this for once, right? Sooner than she expected, her fork scraped the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 and then me and Mel and Lexi... Ah, see? I knew you'd be hungry. I'll order us some pizzas, too,\u201d and Brittany reached for the landline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I've had enough, that's all right...\u201d Alice's hand slid over her stuffed tummy. She knew this pleasant feeling all too well and tried hard to avoid any more overeating nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to thank me.

She had never been a very outgoing person, stemming from her days back at Buttercombe Academy to even now. Despite her forthright in coming, making the drive and staying up all night sketching and even <i>getting</i> into Dr. Huan\u2019s\u2014Brittany\u2019s\u2014office, Alice still felt her knees shake beneath her. Her legs quivered with trepidation, and her entire body seemed to tremble at the mountain of a woman before her. What if she didn\u2019t like her ideas? What if she thought they were dumb? What if this whole visit which, for the most part, had been very nice so far, turned sour as soon as she opened her stupid mouth? Oh, Alice could barely bear the thought\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>also</i> in the sense that, as much as Alice liked to think that she could control her appetite around food, she was still very much the squishy little girl from back in high school. Dietary duties could still easily slip onto her back burner if she didn\u2019t watch herself. And around old friends, surrounded by food and knocking at the knees in anticipation of showing this enormous alum a \u201cbetter\u201d version of the thing she\u2019d spent her career on? It made her feel better to have something to snack on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she let Brittany talk. And talk. And talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then when the pizza got there, they talked. And talked. And ate. And talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was like an expanding feedback, somehow managing to stuff more and more into her mouth without ever skipping a beat! How she <i>became</i> such a size was clearly no mystery, given the amount of food she was comfortable handling, but it was so easy for poor Alice to get lost in it all! There had been so many boxes at the start, and Alice had had so much to say! But then the boxes dwindled, and her mind grew foggy. Her distended tummy aching against the waistband of her pants, something that she hadn\u2019t felt in <i>years</i>, was enough to make Alice forget just why she was even there for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d Dr. Huan exclaimed with a pat at the top of her belly, \u201cWell\u2026 that was nice, catching up, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d Alice whimpered, \u201cI, uh\u2026 I never knew my sister had such a wild streak\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe either, \u2018til then.\u201d Dr. Huan wrinkled her fat, flat face raunchily, \u201c<i>But</i> as much as I\u2019d love to stay here all night and tell you embarassing stories\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh!\u201d Alice jumped up.

I\u2019ve got plenty more where those came from, and it\u2019s always nice to have someone to eat lunch with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stood uneasily on her feet. Whoof, how much had she eaten? Her belly felt like it was filled with rocks\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 I actually wanted to talk to you\u2026 I <i>came</i> here to talk to you about this, actually\u2026\u201d Alice stuttered nervously, \u201cI saw your appearance on the Marni Blake Show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you did!\u201d Brittany\u2019s face lit up, her sauce-dotted smile stretching across the acreage of her face, \u201cSo you caught my little expose with Marni, huh?

I introduce world-changing technology, and they lambast me. What kind of world, right? Figures you\u2019d come around at a time like this! I could really use the ego-boost!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right.\u201d Alice smiled awkwardly, \u201cIt\u2019s, um\u2026 I stayed up all night, actually\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThinking about it? Aww shucks. That\u2019s a little much, but I can\u2019t say I blame you. This tech\u2019s pretty amazing. I can\u2019t tell you <i>how</i> many nights I\u2019ve stayed up all night thinking about it myself! And now I\u2019ve got Miss Marni all worked up about it too, so hopefully we\u2019ll all be able to see some results soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>That\u2019s</i>\u2026 uh\u2026 what I wanted to talk to you about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re exactly in the right <i>market</i> for suspensors anymore.\u201d Brittany said with a giggle that sent her fat body quaking, \u201cI don\u2019t think you have nearly as much trouble getting around as someone like me or Marni do\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-They\u2019re really ugly!\u201d Alice spat out, her frustration peaking, \u201cI, uh\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re right.\u201d Brittany conceded, nodding morosely as her chins caught against her chest, \u201cThey\u2019re pretty stupid looking. But, I mean, it\u2019s still in the basic stages of design. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re ready to mass produce these things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small moment of silence between the two of them. Alice was really just hoping that Dr. Huan didn\u2019t think she was insulting her. Or insinuating that she could do her job better than her. Or anything remotely like that. Because she wasn\u2019t! Honest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless it was designing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Alice was definitely saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually drew up these sketches for you.\u201d Alice said sheepishly, bringing out the crinkled manila folder and laying them on the desk, \u201cI saw your show and\u2026 and I thought it was so cool!

It <i>is</i> more expensive but I suppose you suspensor technology won't be exactly cheap either. With that in mind I went a bit overboard with the more advanced designs. If you pay a fortune for it, it should look like it, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Brittany barked a short laugh, \u201cA clever idea. There's one thing I still don't get, though,\u201d the giant woman leaned forward heavily to tap at a sketch, \u201cWhat are all those lines crisscrossing this drawing? And a couple others too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, obviously I haven't tried these clothes on yet so I'm just speculating. But I expect it would be best to have some kind of in-built structural support. It would make the clothes more durable and maybe even more comfortable for the wearer than when all that weight is carried just by the cloth itself. You could have the support either overt or hidden, depending on taste. In fact,\u201d Alice was on a roll, \u201cin fact you could have two basic production lines, let's call them 'techno' and 'chic' based on whether they're visible or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, I see.

I <i>am</i> offering you a full-time job with all the bells and whistles. The position of a Yeng-Huan chief designer.

She turned down the music, pouting. \"You <i>scared </i>me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe,\" Zack smiled, \"I couldn't help it. Your dancing was mesmerizing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice blushed, pushing him away playfully. \"Uhg, perv! How long were you standing there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perv,\" she said with a kiss. \"So hey. You will <i>never</i> guess what happened today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked suspiciously at her toothy grin. \"Netflix is getting Disney movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, nope,\" Alice giggled. \"I <i>wish</i> though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. They announced the new bachelor, and he's way hotter than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice bit her lip playfully. \"Impossible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice struck a pose. \"I got..... a job!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack blinked. \"A job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>designing</i> job!\" Alice squealed. It was a <i>fashion designing</i> job, for a leading applied health science lab headed by Alice's sister's old classmate which produced amazing, yet ugly, gravity-defying overalls. Zack listened carefully as Alice told a haphazard account of what had gone on that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing, Al,\" he said, kissing her on the forehead. \"Holy crap. That's just - y'know, wow. Out of nowhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Alice clasped his hands and bounced. \"I can't believe it. It's like a dream come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack chuckled a little. \"Yea, wow. So like, what are the hours? Your classes are just about to start up. You scheduled a lot of classes, I thought you wanted to focus on school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the great thing! Brittney even said I could work around my classes and still get full-time pay. And <i>benefits!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to take all of that on? I told you, my job makes enough for both of us right now. You really don't need to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Alice retorted defensively. \"But I <i>want </i>to. This is the chance of a lifetime. I-if I play this right, it could turn into a <i>career</i>! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's amazing,\" Zack crooned. He wrapped her up in a big hug. \"Sorry, this is just so sudden. What are the details? What are your responsibilities? What's the pay? You didn't sign anything, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-well, yea, I did actually,\" Alice crossed her arms. \"We went over the whole thing, and I agreed. I'll be making more money than you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Zack blinked. \"Alice, really? This is a big decision that's going to effect both of us. You didn't even call me first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice huffed. \"I-I'm sorry, I just was so excited. This is my dream!\" Alice was becoming teary. \"I-I just thought you'd bee m-more excited for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am! I am,\" Zack assured her. \"It's just... not what I was expecting when I came home from work today. It'll be alright.\" Zack sniffed the air. \"By the way, I think your hamburger helper is burning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Alice snapped to the stove. \"D-damn! Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed. \"It's alright babe. It'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

Am I right in\u2026 in the Clothing Design and Construction Department?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBare walls and especially the bare floor made this a pretty legitimate question. Alice's voice echoed in a huge empty room devoid of any features. Only the far wall had its monotony broken by another door. A door that just screeched as it partly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? And who are you?\u201d a disembodied voice asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, well\u2026 t- the receptionist sent me here...\u201d Alice stuttered. \u201cTo CDCD?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you an intern or what?\u201d The door finally opened in full to reveal a large elderly woman, not very pleased by this intrusion into her realm. \u201cWhat's yer name anyway, girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA- Alice Carlyle. T- They should have told you...\u201d no matter how many times poor Alice told herself she shouldn't be intimidated by a gruff tone and attitude, she still hadn't gotten over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat they did. So that's you? Such a chit of a girl\u2026 Well, better than nothing, I suppose. Anyway, name's Rita. Rita Sawyer, boss.\u201d And she made a welcoming gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP- Pleased to meet you,\u201d Alice was slowly calming down now that the woman recognised her as her boss\u2026 sort of. She made a couple hesitant steps towards the door. \u201cIs there anyone else in here? Are you alone?\u201d Coming closer she saw that the ancient dragoness is actually a good half-head smaller than her, although she more than compensated for that in tonnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Rita barked a laugh. \u201cHome alone. I think they focused so much on their thingamajigs they forgot they would need a seamstress too. They hired me just two weeks ago and nobody told me what exactly I'm supposed to do here. Well, at least the vending machines here are dirt cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Alice had to admit to herself that she'd imagined something more glamorous to go with the title \u201cchief designer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were added as an afterthought and this is the result. A big pile of\u2026 nothing. I hope you'll change all that, 'specially since I heard you're chums with the big boss. But for now\u2026 I'll show you around. This was probably planned as the main workroom. Here's our corridor,\u201d she squeezed to let Alice through, \u201cthere's the bathroom on the left and kitchen on the right \u2013 I sorta squatted that for myself, hope you don't mind \u2013 and a couple offices further on, the door opposite us leads to the farthest and largest of them all. That one should probably be yours now, boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Alice looked around. \u201cAnd where do you sew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I told you, in the kitchen, here,\u201d and Rita pulled her to an open door. \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least here it looked lived-in a little. In fact, Rita made one little corner of a large corporate kitchen into a home away from home, including a flower on the table and a photo of some kids (her grandchildren?) on the wall.  The best place, though, was reserved for a big old sewing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, sit down and have a donut. Or three, I oughtta be cutting down on them.\u201d Alice was pushed into a chair and a half-eaten box was thrust in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I really shouldn't,\u201d Alice still felt remorse for the huge lunch she'd consumed with Brittany. But just as soon as she finished the sentence, she took a first bite. \u201cAnd this is where you do all the sewing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, boss. And it's been a right pain the\u2026 Oh, beg your pardon. Let me just say I hope you'll have some ideas what to do with the material. I'm a pretty good seamstress if I say so myself but these new-fangled inventions leave me stumped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's what I'm supposed to be doing here. In fact I already made a couple sketches,\u201d Alice  licked her fingers clean and reached for her file...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pleased with herself Alice put away the empty donut box and started nibbling on a croissant while she watched her creation taking shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, it was a first for her and it felt great. She'd always had to bring her ideas to fruition on her own, never before did she have people carrying out her instructions while she could just watch and relax\u2026 and criticise. \u201cUh, you slipped a little here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, sorry. But you said this is just an experimental version to catch all the bugs, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's right,\u201d Alice relented, though she still wasn't very happy about it. When it came to sewing she was a perfectionist. \u201cTell you what, finish this part, then I'l test the dress and we'll head somewhere for lunch. Sounds good?\u201d Alice saw no reason why she couldn't make the prototype fit herself. After all, it wasn't as if she had Brittany's sizes on hand, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she had to admit she was looking forward to testing the radical innovation. When Rita finished, she scooped the white and blue dress and ran away to the bathroom. There she stripped down to her underwear and gingerly pulled on the fabric. She yelped as here and there, cold metallic suspensors touched her sensitive skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trepidation she switched on the wrist display (much more convenient than the cumbersome laptop on the back that Marni had worn in her show!) and dialled her weight back to zero. Then she jumped just as she'd seen Marni do on TV. And she took to the air!<br>\r\nIt was a wonderful feeling\u2026 until Alice realised she was not coming back. She was floating helplessly in mid-air, even waving her hands frantically didn't do much. She was on the brink of calling for help when she remembered that all she needed to do was increase her weight again. She slid the gauge back to twenty pounds and slowly glided back to earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at twenty pounds she felt light as a feather. Alice pirouetted a couple times just because she could and then her professionalism returned \u2013 she ran her fingers over the dress to make sure she hadn't popped any stitches, straightened the cloth, had a look into the mirror and was about to open the door when the sudden roar of an engine nearby stopped her in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, who're you supposed to be, lad?\u201d she heard Rita shout at someone in the front room. This gave Alice a bit more confidence and she tiptoed down the corridor. Peering over Rita's shoulder she could see a forklift carrying several cardboard boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver looked around doubtfully. \u201cIs this the, uh, Construction Department?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah,\u201d stuttered Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Clothing Design</i> and Construction Department,\u201d Rita corrected him coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d he grinned, unfazed. \u201cI'm to deliver and furnish an office for a, uh...\u201d he searched through his pockets. \u201cMs. Alice Carlyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be me,\u201d Alice nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me the way to your office, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, straight ahead, I suppose. The last door, straight ahead. It's open,\u201d and Alice stepped aside to let the forklift through. \u201cI'll show you where you can put them...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going for lunch, boss,\u201c the old seamstress gave the forklift a bored look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eOK, I'll join you later,\u201d for Alice this was utterly new. Not only she had her own office but she could oversee its furnishings! She followed the machine inside and started instructing. \u201cPut the desk  next to that window\u2026 Uh, no, no, better put it here, opposite the door...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later she had a real office, a large desk and a plush swivel chair in the middle, flanked by a couple office cabinets and even her own bar and a fridge \u2013 sadly they were empty so far but the worker assured Alice she was signed up for a \u201cfull room service,\u201d whatever that meant. \u201cI'm finished in here, Ms. Carlyle. Tomorrow the IT guys will plug in your desktop and you'll be set to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sign here, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Alice waited for the forklift to clear the hallway and then closed the door to admire once more a little plaque on the door announcing to everyone coming her way that this was the office of<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">ALICE CARLYLE<br>\r\nCHIEF DESIGNER<br>\r\nHEAD OF DEPARTMENT</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little heart fluttered with joy but her tummy had other ideas.

She tried to stop and found out it was much more difficult right now - while weighing next to nothing her inertia hasn't changed. In the end she had to \u201canchor\u201d herself to a handy doorknob. She wiped some imaginary sweat from her brows and had a look around. Luckily the hallway seemed empty though she thought she'd heard a someone snicker just as she was braking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then another cellphone ring reminded her of her priorities. Alice rummaged in her purse for a bit, finally picking it up. It was Brittany Huan, who else. Though she half expected it, she had to take a deep breath to calm herself first. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Alice!\u201d her old schoolmate and new colleague sounded extra chipper, \u201chow's my favorite designer today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, fine, thanks. And you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. Glad to hear it. Listen, I'd like to have a look at your work again and I need to get something off my chest and\u2026 I might have a request as well soooo... Would you be interested in a working lunch with me? Right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, actually, I was just on the way to eat anyway...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful! Just come to my office, you know the way, right? I'll be waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned around and sprinted back to the elevator, nearly knocking down some interns. She still couldn't get used to the suspensors. Or rather to the fact that she needed the barest minimum of effort to get going and that a couple normal steps catapulted her forward at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother burst of speed took her along the management floor corridor and right through the door. She stopped only at the crescent-shaped table laden with delicacies, making her boss's giant belly quiver. Alice sheepishly smiled, Dr. Huan frowned, her chins wobbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo- so- sorry. I've got the experimental dress on and it's- it is so hard to more properly in it,\u201d Alice hastily apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's nothing,\u201d Brittany's frown quickly disappeared, replaced with a smile wider than ever before. \u201cIt took me some time to learn, too. Trust me. The trick is to expend the least amount of energy possible. So this is your first creation? Really? I would've thought it a model from Paris. Or at least New York. Could you turn around for me, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Alice nodded and smoothed her dress, a little ruffled by her recent adventures. As she ran her hands down the middle, she noticed a little discrepancy. Was it showing the tiniest little bulge? Where did it come from? But there was no time to deal with it now. She fluffed the dress around again and with the tiniest push of her toe she made a little pirouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. It looks so much better than our previous models. You work so fast, Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's not just me, Ms. Sawyer did the actual sewing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, of course. But the actual design is yours? All yours?\u201d Alice nodded. \u201cWow. I'm officially impressed. Now, please take a seat and dig in. I ordered Italian. You like lasagnas? You do, everyone does, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, exactly. Everyone must love lasagnas.\u201d And she eagerly proceeded to prove her statement \u2013 and satisfy her growling stomach. It took her several bites to realise that Brittany wasn't eating. Her mouth full of the fatty goodness, Alice quizzically raised her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, see...\u201d Brittany hesitated a little then went on. \u201cLook, Ally, I was going to start with a lengthy introduction, but seeing the dedication with which you've started, I'll cut to the chase right away. I have a special project for you in mind. That is, I'm having an investors' meeting in a couple days and I do need to show some tangible, marketable results. Would you be able to make a dress like this for me as well in, say, two days' time?\u201d Seeing her guest's hesitation, she added, \u201cDon't worry. There'll be a fat bonus for you, if you do. And for, uh, Ms. Soller as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, well...\u201d Alice hastily swallowed to give a proper answer. \u201cIt <i>could</i> be done. I mean\u2026 I do have the preliminary designs I've shown you last time. Those would actually fit you better, much better than what I'm wearing at the moment, since those models are better suited for, eh, your body type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust say obese, don't be afraid of the word,\u201d and Brittany laughed, making her fat shake, \u201cI'm actually proud of my size. It takes effort, you see? But anyway, I trust you'll make it look good, no need to convince me on this account. The big question is, will you have it in two days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice withdrew into herself, frantically counting and estimating. She did have some experience and Ms. Sawyer seemed like a competent seamstress\u2026 \u201cYes, it could be done provided we took your measurements right after lunch. However, that is usually not recommended since your stomach would be distended from, eh, lunch. So...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't worry about that!\u201d as Brittany slapped her gut the whole table rocked a little. \u201cMy little tummy is stuffed 24/7 so it's right and proper to measure it after a proper meal. So we've got a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d and Alice shook the offered hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! Well, that's settled. And now dig in, Ally, enjoy!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It could be her dress, that is its suspensors that she tweaked to near zero (to 0,5 lb, to be exact) to help her get up after their lunch and later forgot to dial it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr it could be her lunch. Those lasagnas would normally feed both her and Zack, nowadays. She'd  eaten them all and it hadn't ended there. Oh no, Dr. Huan had a hankering for Chinese and Alice hadn't dared say no to her\u2026 And then there was cheesecake for dessert, cheesecake! Alice's weakness, how could she refuse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was Alice had overeaten just like in the bad old Buttercombe days\u2026 except in many ways they were <i>good old days</i>. Even this stuffed feeling was actually pleasant, as soon as the worst was over. And as she was getting used to suspensors, it actually felt quite nice not to have to haul her heavy load on her poor feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover, not long ago she would have been a lot more worried about putting on pounds again after such a binge. But here in Abercrombie she felt strangely exotic, foreign even with her narrow waist and slim hips (though both may have gotten just a little bit wider lately). So she wouldn't feel out of place if she put on a couple pounds, no need to worry on that account...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>did </i>consider it unfair, though, that now she had to trudge all the way back through the hallways while Brittany just lowered the back of her custom-made armchair to have a nap. Perhaps, just perhaps\u2026 Alice peered into her department kitchenette to see it was completely empty. No Rita there. Perhaps there was still time for her nap, too, before they launched into the big project? She skipped to her office, locked the door and plopped into her sinfully comfortable swivel chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was awakened by a nagging feeling she ought to be doing something. But what was it? Oh, right, the Special Project Huan! She flew out of the chair - literally flying since she forgot about the suspensor setting \u2013 and crashed with her door. A look at the clock newly mounted on her wall told her it was already past 3 p.m. She quickly unlocked and rushed down the corridor. \u201cRita? Uh, Ms. Sawyer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned into the kitchenette, this time getting exactly the right impulse by touching the floor gently with her little toe. She gently slid onto a chair. \u201cUh, Ms. Sawyer, we've been assigned a special project to complete. That is, we need to produce another prototype dress, this time for Dr. Huan. From scratch, not just altering a finished dress like the one I'm wearing right now. Will we be able to do it in a couple days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by 'couple days?'\u201d The old seamstress didn't seem enthused by the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeeell, it needs to be ready the day after tomorrow, for an evening gala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, boss. Can't be done. Not in two days. Never.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's lower lip trembled. Not long ago she would have burst into tears. In fact, she was close to tears right now too. But this was the new, improved Alice, a go-getting fashionista! She frowned a little, trying to look decisive and determined\u2026 and a little threatening, too, which wasn't easy since the target of her 'wrath' outweighed her three times. \u201cLook, it is vital for the future of our company that the dress be ready on time. And since we have no other immediate job on hand, you can hardly claim to be overworked. And\u2026 and Dr. Huan promised a fat bonus for both of us if we pull it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, you should've started with that last bit, boss,\u201d Rita said a bit reproachfully. \u201cIn that case\u2026 huh. So what's it supposed to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn evening gown for Dr. Huan. For her meeting with investors.\u201d Alice repeated patiently, \u201cTo convince them we mean business and we're worth putting their money in. So you see how important it is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Rita waved it away, \u201cthe magic word is 'bonus,' boss. Remember it the next time. So a whole new dress \u2013 more of a tent, really \u2013 in just two days. Huh. We might have to work 'till 7 or 8\u2026 It can be done but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Alice tried to look her subordinate down like a good manager. \u201cThat's what I wanted to hear.\u201d She pulled out her phone. \u201cBrittany? Are you ready to have your measurements taken?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've reached Brittany Huan, please leave a message.\u201d Click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated but plowed on. \u201cErr\u2026 Hello, Brittany? This is Alice, Alice Carlyle. Erm, we need you in CDCD for the fitting? You know, for the project we talked about? Just about, eh, an hour ago? Please let me know ASAP, thanks.\u201d And she hung up the phone, biting her lip. \u201cListen, I just had an idea. Brittany showed up in Marni Show in a suspensor outfit that had to be made here. So you should have her measurements already, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good thinking, boss, but no. That was before my time. They must've produced it in Experimental, all by themselves. In fact I suspect that Clothing Design was a result of that first attempt. But since they didn't have anything better they just showed that fashion disaster on TV. Do you really think I'd ever produce anything so hideous? I'm offended, truly I am.\u201d Rita glowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Alice sighed. \u201cIn that case\u2026 Perhaps we ought to wake her up since we have so little time and need to start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, no! I'm not going to be the one waking up the big boss! That's far above my paygrade! That's what you're paid for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, big boss? What actually is Brittany's position in this outfit? She's not the general manager, or is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Rita Sawyer grew contrite, \u201csorry, just some gossip I overheard in the cafeteria. Listen, it's best you forget I said something. I'm just a stupid seamstress, what do I know about big business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally all this just piqued Alice's interest. Perhaps it was intended to. \u201cDo go on. I'm interested. Please,\u201d she added as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 you're right that we have other bosses, managers ekcetra. But Dr. Huan \u2013 well, the name says it all. She's an heir to the Huan half of our company plus a good friend of people at Yeng and Boonliang-Spencer, our other major investors. And the talk of the cafeteria is, this whole suspensor thingy is her idea, her baby and she cobbled the consortium together herself. But she didn't care for all the tedium of everyday management so she's just a department head just like you, boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Alice nodded thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, back to our problem. Are you going to wake our biggest boss or should we wait? And lose our bonuses when we don't make it in time?\u201d Rita needled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, OK, I'm going. No need to tell me twice,\u201d Alice sighed and glided back along the corridors to Brittany's office. She was a little apprehensive too, though she rationalised she had nothing to fear. After all, Brittany herself said she wanted them to start on her evening dress right away, right? So there was no reason to worry, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that Alice knocked on her door with no little trepidation, only to by greeted by: \u201cYeah? Come in...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice sounded a little sleepy but it meant Brittany was fully awake again. Alice opened the door and peeked inside. \u201cErr, hi? You said you wanted us to take your measurements after lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sure,\u201d the big Chinese American girl stretched, yawned, and pressed several buttons. \u201cShirly, I'll be in the Clothing Department. If anything urgent turns up, let me know, otherwise I'm gone for the day, all right?\u201d Not waiting for an answer she sprang  from her chair, evidently helped by suspensors, and turned to Alice. \u201cLet's get going. No time to waste!\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Rita measure Brittany was educational. Sure, Alice used to be big, too, but never<i> this</i> big. Stripped to her underwear, Dr. Huan seemed even bigger than before. She was huge, immense, titanic. In front the vast orb of flesh that made her belly shivered whenever the seamstress touched it, propped by all the food inside to hover just above her knees. At the back the shelf of her backside jiggled in harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was equally big elsewhere, too. True, her gut and butt made up most of her weight but fat found its way to other places too. Brittany's breasts were well beyond D-cups, her thighs resembled tree trunks, spread apart to bear all her weight, arms were wider than Alice's thighs. Even her face, with bulging cheeks and a selection of chins, was a study in curves, there wasn't a single straight line on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body of Dr. Brittany Huan was a testament of unbridled gluttony. And laziness too, as soon as Rita finished her work, she collapsed on a chair, making it creak dangerously. \u201cUgh, that was a workout! Is there anything to eat here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she munched on Rita's doughnuts while she discussed her future attire with Alice. When they were mostly done, Brittany treated her to a sumptuous dinner in the town's best, or at least most expensive restaurant, gushing all the time how her new dress should look like, airy, light, loose, fluffy and cute, yet serious and conservative. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverstuffed Alice drove home where she absent-mindedly hugged Zack and spent the entire night drawing (and tearing) new drafts. It was by no means easy. At first she was simply too full to come up with anything good and later she was getting sleepy. She drank plenty Coke and coffee by mugs to keep herself awake, ate several bags of chips and plenty of chocolate plus a midnight snack to keep her energy levels up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she gave up on high couture and designed a simple flowing business suit in burgundy. Drawing from her own fat girl experience, she added plenty more braces and reinforcements. The dress would be heavy even without suspensors but that's what what they were there for. If they were lifting hundreds of Brittany's pounds, a dozen more for the outfit wouldn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice somehow made it to work in the morning, moving like an automaton she passed her draft on to Rita, took the bus to ASU and then passed out at a lecture, still in her experimental dress that she hadn't taken off all night. Refreshed after several hours of sleep and school lunch, she returned to find her seamstress in full swing and a plump, bespectacled geek impatiently waiting for her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I'm Rene Zerbst, from IT. You could've told me you won't be here in the morning. I've been waiting here two hours already and missed lunch,\u201d he whined, although empty donut boxes around hinted he didn't go hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was getting ready to apologise but then she thought twice about it.<i> If I'm the boss of Clothing Design I should behave like one. I ought to remember I'm no longer a timid little mouse.</i> She gave him an icy glare instead. \u201cI WAS here in the morning, at 9. Where were you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Well- I- I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind that. Why are you here? What's the problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr, I brought and installed your data terminal, Ms. Carlyle. Everything's ready, I just need you to log in and confirm it works. And yeah, to brief you on our security protocols and such,\u201d he shrugged sheepishly. \u201cEveryone has to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Well then, why don't you start right away?\u201d Alice gestured to her office and walked to the door, searching for her keys. \u201cWill I be able to log on external sites?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, you can access Facebook with no problem, don't worry,\u201d Rene rattled out, apparently used to answering this question often. \u201cIn fact, browsing the net is much safer here since we use state-of-the-art filters and...\u201d and he launched into a lengthy lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice understood every fifth word of it (typically \u201cis,\u201d \u201cthe\u201d or \u201cand\u201d) but she let him speak, finding her way around in the meantime. She let him explain the intricacies of company intranet, lounging in her new, comfortable swivel chair, let him help her with finding her Facebook page. When Rene finally left, leaving his number \u201cin case you needed my help with anything,\u201d she kept idly browsing Facebook when her eyes were drawn to a blinking green light that hadn't been there the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down below her desk she found out her fridge had been plugged in and fully stocked. And when she scooted her chair over to the bar, she discovered it full of snacks, too. \u201cSo this is the full room service they mentioned yesterday,\u201d Alice mused, opening a bag of chips.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Actually I expected something a little more\u2026 daring, but it'll do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you said you were going to an investors' meeting,\u201d Alice protested meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I should've been more specific, sorry,\u201d the humongous scientist smiled to mitigate the impact of her first words. \u201cYes, it's an investors' meeting but some of those old lechers like a good look down my cleavage. Well, never mind that. This is good and we'll come up with a more revealing version next time, eh? Anyway, gotta run. See ya tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the up-and-coming fashionista arrived at work the next day Brittany was already waiting for her in the Clothing Department kitchen, munching on Rita's doughnuts. Beaming, she waved away Alice's stuttered apologies. \u201cOh, nobody says you have to be here every day at nine. That's what part time means, right? Plus you're a department head just like me so no need to apologise. We're buddies, right? And your buddy tells you, enjoy your privileges to the fullest, y'hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, OK\u2026\u201d As Alice searched for a safer topic she noticed Brittany was again wearing her old baggy suspensor jumpsuit. \u201cErr, how did it go yesterday? Is anything wrong with my- I mean, with the suit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, no, no, no! Quite the opposite! It was a huge success. A tremendous success! In fact, we're bankrolled for at least two more years of R&amp;D, thanks to the two of us!\u201d and Brittany high-fived Alice. \u201cFrankly, I wouldn't have hired you if you weren't Mel's little sister. And that would've been a tremendous mistake! You're just a genius! Just as much a genius in your field as I'm in mine,\u201d she swayed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was getting ready to protest but when she looked at her she noticed black bags under Brittany's eyes. Combined with her sway, the unfocused way she spoke, repeating words and whole phrases... \u201cHave you slept at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTonight? Nah, who needs sleep?\u201d Brittany yawned, immediately contradicting her words. \u201cThe negotia-tie-tions ended late and then we went to celebrate and then I had a snack and a late dinner and another snack and\u2026 Anyway, that seamstress of yours needs to let my business suit out a little. And resew the torn-out zipper. And you could pick a stretchier material? And I'm going to hit the bed now...\u201d she yawned again and started pulling herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, one more thing. Expect first clients some time tomorrow. A couple investors have shown interest in my suit and are willing to pay premium for the chance to have their own. And who am I to refuse their money, eh? Obviously it would have to be scaled down but your genius should have no trouble with that, right?\u201d she winked, getting ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened by Brittany's praise, Alice picked up courage to say: \u201cWait a minute, how many clients and how soon? We're going to need more workers. Rita can't always do it all alone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure, sure. Just tell the HR I okayed it. Hire whoever you want, as many underlings as you need. Your contribution is worth it!\u201d Brittany laughed. \u201cThe more investors \u2013 and their wives \u2013 wear your creations, the happier they'll be. In fact, is there anything else I could get you to help you with your work? Anything at all? Just say it.\u201d She added, seeing Alice hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, perhaps we could subscribe to some fashion magazines? I mean, I try to follow newest trends on the net but that's always a little late and a little\u2026 little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure! Just list whatever you need in the Company Procurement Form and they'll take care of the rest. Rita can show you how. I suppose she's been using it already, to get cloth and such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, thank you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I expect you for lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a part-timer, Alice came to work in mid-morning three times a week, parked her bottom in her boss chair, browsed fashion magazines and websites, snacking on the neverending supply of goodies from her fridge and bar. When she came across an idea she liked, an outfit she wanted to have, she put it aside for later because at midday she was expected for lunch with Brittany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a filling lunch and a power nap she pulled out her drawing pad, looked at her inspiration and spent the afternoon sketching her concepts and adapting clothes to fit well with suspensors inside. When she was satisfied with her design she passed the draft to Rita and her two new hires and a day later she wore the resulting creation to make sure everything fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it always did, Alice put it on for her next lunch with Brittany and, more often than not, ended up altering the design to fit her behemoth of a friend too. Her minions then sewed it for her and one or two other 'premium customers' as well and everyone was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was happy to have someone of her age (more or less) to chat with and a steady stream of new, fashionable clothes to wear that made her feel weightless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was happy that with two underlings she could now spend the whole day with her feet up, bossing them while eating doughnuts. To make sure her job stayed that way the wily old seamstress did everything to make Alice happy, mainly kept altering the basic design to make sure each new outfit fit her boss's figure perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice never noticed. She was happy to get a new dress every week for the first time in her life, sometimes even two dresses a week, to have her hobby as a well-paid job, which she would leave every day early enough to treat Zack to a lavish dinner in a trendy restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus weeks passed by and her wardrobe kept expanding as fast as her bank account. Plus since Alice spent 24/7 levitating on suspensors while eating ever larger snacks, lunches and dinners, other her assets started expanding too.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zack and Alice snuggled together on a sofa  and chatted, a jungle document on TV providing an ambient background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and guess what, Zackie? Brittany promised me another raise from January so I was thinking about getting a car? For myself?\u201d Alice turned to her boyfriend while her hand cast about for more chips in the huge bowl sitting on both their laps. \u201cOh, we're out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Zack licked his lips. \u201cOK, I'll bring some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, don't get up! I'll fetch some tortilla chips. You don't know where I put them, right? And besides,\u201d she dialled her weight back to 0, \u201cit's so much easier for me. I'll just glide to the pantry and get them. And maybe some dips too?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, Zack's eyes followed her receding back. The stretch pants she wore today were a great hit among her VIP clients (\u201cThey're nothing special, just stretch pants with suspensors,\u201d Alice shrugged modestly when she showed them off) and now he admired how his girlfriend was filling them. In fact, wasn't she filling them rather more than usual? <i>Nah, must be a trick of light.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Zack was now alert and when Alice came back with her haul, he watched her. He watched as she bent forward to put the dips on the coffee table and her belly bunched up in several thick rolls, he watched her buttocks jiggle as she turned her back to him before sitting down. Somehow she managed to put on two dozen pounds without him noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack knew Alice had her plate full \u2013 lectures were in full swing, she had plenty of papers to submit that she worked on long into the night. Add to it all her work for Yeng-Huan\u2026 No wonder Alice filled her plates full literally as well, she needed all the energy she could get. Now she took a handful of chips, dipped them in chili sauce and stuffed her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should I say something?</i> Truth be told, Zack had quite enjoyed Alice's old body. He met her at her heaviest, barely waddling around, red in face after moving a couple dozen steps. And yet she was a rolling butterball of cuteness and he'd really enjoyed fondling her plush curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand Zack knew she'd been unhappy with her weight and clumsiness, he knew how hard Alice had worked to slim down, he knew how proud she was of her (no longer current) size when all that suffering finally bore fruit. And he knew how disappointed she would be to find out it was all lost again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the <i>other </i>other hand, he would be one to talk. Abercrombie was a place strangely welcoming to excess and his snacks with coworkers were getting to be the size of meals and meals at the Hammond Hotel\u2026 suffice it to say that while he hadn't weighed himself for ages, his daily struggle to button his pants meant Zack must have put on a dozen pounds minimum too. Wouldn't it be hypocritical to call her out for his own sin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d she smiled at his absent-minded expression, \u201cabout the car\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed she was getting a hint of a second chin again. \u201cHuh? Oh, right, the car.\u201d <i>Should I tell her or not?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or perhaps I should say it\u2019s on the same level, as this creation came out of the explosion of knowledge that project provided for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo a few months ago you,\u201d she said this to Marni directly, \u201chad agreed to have your genes examined, yes?\u201d When Marni didn\u2019t reply right away Dr. Huan prompted \u201cIt was part of your physical earlier this year. Your doctor took a swab of your mouth to get a DNA sample.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! I forgot all about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well that swab was passed along to Yeng-Huan\u2019s laboratories, where we broke down your DNA to the chromosomal level, finding out all about Ms. Marni Blake and what makes her tick. Not only could we see how your ancestors have influenced your development, but we were also able to look ahead and project the path of health and well-being you were going down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the audience for this next bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been told that health is a simple equation of keeping your weight down and getting a little exercise now and then. But human physiology is so much more complicated than that. I wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that there are as many paths to health as there are people alive. Each person\u2019s body is unique \u2013 with the possible exception of twins, triplets, etc. \u2013 and to find the best possible system of diet and activity for each person we need to start at the foundation: your genes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr so we thought, when we started this project. Years ago, as I was finishing up in university, I published a paper on the importance of examining every patient at the genetic level, that the next revolution of medicine would not come from the macro level but the micro. But even I didn\u2019t realize the full potential that cracking the genome would open up for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we mapped your genes,\u201d she turned back to Marni, \u201cwe found you have a propensity for gaining weight-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could have told you that,\u201d Marni joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-but that you also have a natural defense against many of the issues that come with obesity. There\u2019s no record of diabetes or heart conditions in your family\u2019s history, and your blood pressure is well within normal range. The only potential red flags we found were high cholesterol and a less-than-healthy gall bladder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni blushed a little, but Dr. Huan rushed to get to the next point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut both of these are easily treatable through modern medicine. There are prescription drugs for those problems, but they are mass-produced and bring with them a host of their own risks and issues. A year ago the best we could do would be to say \u2018Take these and hope things don\u2019t go wrong.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s comforting!\u201d Marni said, letting out a hoarse laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this is today. Now. And Yeng-Huan has an evolutionary leap for medicine: a pill personally tailored to your genetic disposition, to treat your problems \u2013 current and future. That pill you are holding is the Marni Blake wonder drug, created for you and you alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one pill?\u201d Marni said, sensing Dr. Huan was getting carried away with her spiel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one. Your genes will never change over the course of your life \u2013 barring any nuclear warfare, I should say \u2013 and so your needs won\u2019t either. That one pill will handle every issue you might have or acquire going forward, providing you a healthy future for the rest of your life despite your size now or where it might go in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere it might go...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Huan chuckled, her belly bouncing up and down in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should attest to the drug\u2019s efficacy before I ask you to take it.\u201d She turned back to the audience, playing directly to the camera. \u201cI have never been a thin woman. You probably won\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re looking at me right now. But I\u2019ve never been this big. When I first signed on to do research for the Yeng Corporation, I was close to 400 pounds. Morbidly obese by any standards, and months of long nights and take-out food and no time to hit the gym sent my weight climbing up and up. When we made our breakthrough with the project \u2013 we\u2019re calling it the GS-217, but I\u2019m sure marketing will come up with a better name \u2013 I was closer to 500 pounds than 400.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter enough testing and trials we determined the drug was safe for human consumption, and though some might question the ethics of the decision I volunteered myself to be the first human test subject. I took my pill over a year ago, close to a year and a half, and in that time my stats have all entered the range of perfect health. Blood pressure, cholesterol, my immune system, musculature, kidneys, liver, everything! All perfect. Even the issues that had been bothering me like the joint pain in my knees and ankles is gone. I can walk up a couple flights of stairs and only get mildly winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough I\u2019m not exactly racing up the stairs, as you can imagine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter from the audience, but it was obvious there was a lot of shock and disbelief among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd since taking the drug my weight had continued to go up. Today I am here before you weighing over 630 pounds. 638 to be precise. And yet when I received a physical for my insurance last month my doctor, despite all logic and preconceptions about health, gave me a clean bill. He said I was the healthiest patient he had examined all week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smattering of applause. The audience was coming around to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny problem I might have had down the road has now been taken care of today, now. It\u2019s almost as if my own genes have been rewritten to give me perfect health regardless of how much more I grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Marni,\u201d she turned back to the host. \u201cI want to ask you a question, just one fat girl to another: when you no longer have to struggle to walk half a mile, when getting yourself out of bed is not the Herculean task it once was, when your doctor isn\u2019t tsk-tsking or lecturing you about your life choices, don\u2019t you think you might expect a few more pounds to find their way to that plump little body of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been getting by on salads and rice cakes until now. But I see your point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up the pill again, looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there have been successful human trials? I\u2019m not going to be some lab monkey who might grow another head or a third arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe FDA approved it for human testing last year, so if you\u2019re interested,\u201d Dr. Huan reached into her lab coat and pulled out a small stack of papers, \u201call you have to do is sign on the last page, and you can take the pill right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnprompted, a few people in the audience cheered and clapped, urging Marni on. At home in her living room, Alice was getting excited herself. She wasn\u2019t fat anymore, but the memories of her mother\u2019s judgment and society\u2019s scorn in general put her on the side of Dr. Huan. How great would it be if fat people didn\u2019t have to tolerate being chided or ridiculed anymore? How great would it be for people like her sister Mel to not have others criticize them for their lifestyle (not that Mel had any sense of shame or remorse for who she was)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni turned to the audience. She didn\u2019t look hesitant, but she looked like she wanted the encouragement of others before taking the plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudience-wide applause now, with a few cries of \u2018Do it!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni took the papers from Dr. Huan, found the last page, and signed it. Then, with a little flourish for the cameras, she took out the yellow gel cap, held it up to her mouth, and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplause. Even Alice felt like whooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long until it works?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe changes will be gradual at first, and then snowball. Within a month you should feel completely remade head to toe. And we\u2019ll do some check-ups on you at the Yeng-Huan facilities to chart your progress, so you can see how things are going. Congratulations! This is the start of a new life for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already feel wonderful. Let\u2019s hope this drug is everything you say it is, doc.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of the next few weeks, Alice found herself watching a lot more television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really a TV sort of girl. She never had been. Growing up with a restrictive mother and being sent off to a private school without cable helped, but it was more of a natural disinterest. Alice would have much rather have been reading or sewing or (coinciding with her mastery of her sister's old laptop) watching much more condensed methods of entertainment on Youtube. Alice had never really been \"into\" the whole vegging out on the couch and watching TV thing. It just seemed a little lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, there were new episodes of Marni Blake every weeknight at 4, and Alice had tasted blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat story she did with Dr. Huan was just so... so <i>fascinating!</i> Much more so than her usual fare of baby daddies and home drama. Despite her secret want for the intellectual wastelanders that usually frequented Marni's show, Alice couldn't help but find herself stimulated by that black sheep of a story. Marni hadn't done anything like it since, but it had been just enough to reinvigorate the part of Alice that used to rush home after classes and plop down on the couch in time to watch like she'd been doing it her whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer classes ended at three thirty on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the Marni Blake Show didn't start until four. That gave her thirty minutes to rush home, find the remote, and barnacle herself to her sofa for the better part of an hour until Zack got home and she could flick the TV off like she hadn't ever used it. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, when Alice's classes weren't over until five but she had a break at four, she'd watch it in the student life center and read the subtitles. Oh, sure, she'd have her laptop in front of her so it looked like she was doing something, but that was just to make sure nobody suspected her of watching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice would have been lying if she said she wasn't scoping out the effects Dr. Huan's wonder drug. The story had been so strange and unique, almost like she'd dreamt it up. Marni had taken this pill and then, poof, it was over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut over the course of the following weeks, Alice had noticed some distinctive changes in the already heavyset hostess. They were nothing major, at first. After the first few days, Marni's slow waddling on stage became more brisk, her skin looked a little clearer, and she didn't quite seem so out of breath. She was still sitting in her chair most of the time, but she seemed to have a much easier time navigating her self. To the untrained eye, it would have appeared as if those were signs that Marni was losing weight. But to a more seasoned viewer, like Alice, it was actually just the opposite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, comparatively fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out really small. Marni's clothes looked tighter at first. That was all. And Alice had been there, been about that size at one point in her life. It was hard to find clothes that <i>didn't</i> look tight when you were a real butterball! But soon it became obvious that Marni was actually outgrowing her wardrobe. As early as a week after the Yeng Huan interview, Marni's outfits were showing much more skin than normal around the belly. Her gut was causing the hems of her shirts and blouses to ride up ever so slightly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then not ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a week, Marni was debuting new clothes. She also seemed stronger. She didn't pant as heavily whenever she rose from her chair (which, even then, wasn't often) and her voice was clearer. Not only that, her complexion had cleared up. Not that it was bad before, but she wasn't sweating as much. Her cheeks didn't get quite so blotchy with exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe positive response of having Dr. Huan on the show must have prompted Marni to open up her guests beyond the typical baby daddy drama, because there was a lot more variety of talent making appearances. Sitting beside her, talking about various products or goods they provided. Most of them, surprisingly enough for Marni purists, were chefs looking to catch a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all started when Marni interviewed this couple--it was part of her \"what's weird in bed?\" week, if Alice remembered correctly--that talked about mixing food with sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I tell him all the time that he needs to stop. That I can't control myself anymore.\"</i> said the four hundred pound housewife, sitting comfortably in the Marni-sized seat beside her <i>\"I'm gaining so much weight just being with him, but I can't stop myself from eating his amazing cooking!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is your cooking <u>that</u> good?\"</i> Marni had asked with a mischevious little twinkle in her hoggish eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It is.\"</i> said the man, no older than thirty, with a slight shrug, <i>\"I mean, I could <u>show</u> you if you don't believe me... I brought a sample plate. You know, to help make my case...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had brought out this whole chocolate cake, just for Marni. She began hesitantly at first but after finding that, apparently, his cooking really was <i>that</i> good, she steamed through the entire cake for a full minute, and was nearing completion by the time the commercial break was over. All while his girlfriend watched, helplessly, as another woman devoured her cake. Her mouth watered, her lips smacking as she panted wantingly as Marni ate, ate, ate herself into contentedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the segment, Marni's belly was full enough to show a sliver of skin between her pants and her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay girl, <u>you</u> need to loosen up.\"</i> Marni burped into her hand, <i>\"Cause if I had a man who could cook like this, and wanted to feed me this delicious food, I wouldn't have a thing to complain about.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was just a snowball effect. Audiences liked seeing Marni eat. Marni liked to eat. And once the studio said that it was okay for her to do it on stage (there was never any rule against it, apparently) Marni just took to her new gimmick like a fish to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmphm... today we have... mmm...\"</i> Marni announced not long after, snacking on some off-brand cookies, <i>\"Jim and Lyla who....mm! These are good... who think that... mm... what... what do they think again?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ladies and gentlemen please welcome Marcia Mathers, a <u>very</u> esteemed guest you may recognize from Munching with Marcia, which aired just a few hours ago on this station.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the results of all this eating, which slowly grew more and more unencumbered, were that Marni was expanding at a phenomenal rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer hindered by her failing health and unwilling to stand up to her expanding appetite, Marni soon found herself eating every moment she was on the air. From what Alice would see over the coming weeks, there was soon never an episode following the Yeng Huan interview where Marni didn't have <i>something</i> to snack on. Cookies, brownies, sandwiches, chips, anything and (seemingly) everything was fair game for Marni's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably she started to grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Today we have...hrph... a tailor who specializes in...mrg...c'mon... women's clothes of...mmph! <u>particular</u> sizes...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ladies and gents, please welcome Wilhelm vonStrucker, the strongest man alive! Say Willy, you uh... you think you're uh, up to lifting lil ol' <u>me</u>, handsome?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nand grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"MMmrmpmghm... ohmigawd...munch munch... are we on?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nand <b>grow</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before Alice's eyes, Marni seemed to be expanding almost by the day. With her constantly increasing intake, her fat hands nearly always shoveling something into her greedy mouth, everyone's favorite plus-sized tv personality started getting plumper and plumper with every airing. Her belly hung lower, her ass sat wider, and more and more each day her breasts formed a more adequate shelf that sloped in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Alice's untrained eye, Marni must have gained eighty pounds after the first month and a half. It was unreal! Even with how much Marni was eating, nobody should have been able to get <i>that</i> fat, <i>that</i> fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she glided around as easily as ever! No aching muscles, no groaning or panting or puffing. The only groaning was coming from the furniture as it struggled to carry Marni's steadily increasing immensity! Marni was somehow healthier now, at her heaviest, than she had been every other day of broadcast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only seemed fitting that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And it would have been easy enough to ignore the Yeng-Huan wonder pill if it hadn't been bleeding into other areas of Alice's pop media-enveloped life. One woman, however influential she may be, was still just one voice on one talk show. But then there Emily Vaughn, or Evie to her fans. And Alice was a diehard fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who knew Evie knew the story: a promising gorgeous young, blonde Italian actress had been told to gain weight for a role only to find that, afterward, she couldn't get the weight off. In fact, having gained even <i>more</i> weight after the movie had premiered (and flopped), she found herself being ostracized by hiring agencies because she didn't fit the typical \"Hollywood look\" anymore. It had only taken just her first few \"funny fat friend\" roles before Evie was sick of the typecasting and had publicly taken arms against Hollywood's misconceptions about beauty standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an overweight and insecure young girl like Alice, it was a powerful message indeed. Alice would silently root for Evie in the news whenever she tackled a beauty industry ideal that had to do with weight. She would listen to Evie's sassy retorts to criticisms about her still-ever-increasing weight and practice saying them later to the mirror, of course never actually to another person.  That would be.. super confrontational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was all a few years ago and Emily Vaughn had faded somewhat into obscurity, taking less roles in acting and putting more time into weight acceptance and activism. Alice had grown out of her dreaded \"chubby phase\" and had slowly begun following Evie's movements less and less. Sure, Alice still remembered <i>Chubbiness and Chastity</i>, a cult-classic chick flick if there ever was one, and had been disappointed to find out the movie hadn't done well enough for a sequel, but Alice's Evie obsession had, over time, faded away. Until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like two worlds colliding. About three months in total had passed since Dr. Huan's first appearance on the Marni Blake show and here she was, scheduled to appear again. Alice sat in anticipation, glued to the screen as usual. Especially seeing as there was a lot more to umm, take in this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarni was <i>big</i>. Like, BIG big. A casual observer might have noticed that the rate she was increasing at was bigger as well. If the first month and a half had yielded around 80 pounds then the second had looked to have added another 120. And the setup of her show had changed. Marni was almost always eating now, camera or no, and to either side of her sat two large tables groaning with the kind of spread that likely could have fed the entire audience. Marni would frequently hop up during the show from her extra-wide seat, seemingly more buoyant than ever, and fill up a plate or two before sitting right back down and continuing with an interview. Even at the start of her own show, Marni was busy tucking in while the overhead announcer went through the usual introductions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice couldn't have been more immersed anyway. There was something about seeing a woman... <i>enjoying</i> herself like that that was so engaging in its own way. Alice hadn't always snacked when she watched The Marni Blake Show, but as of late, she hadn't been able to help herself. It was just another guilty pleasure to enhance the one she was already hooked on, no big life change or anything, she reasoned. And, other than the near-constant eating by the show host and, very frequently, her guests, the format hadn't changed <i>too</i> drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys remember just three months ago we had a very important scientist on our show with a huge, and I mean huge, medical breakthrough just waiting to hit the markets,\" Marni began. Or rather, the pre-recorded Marni on the large screen behind her did. It was another change Marni had made to the show: prerecorded guest introductions would play for the audience and the viewers at home while Marni used the precious few extra minutes to keep on filling her face. \"Well, friends,\" the recorded Marni continued after quickly chewing and swallowing another bite of a muffin she had been eating even as her team had done the recording that morning, \"she's back and with better news than ever- can we-gulp-please welcome everyone's favorite doctor, Dr Brittany Huan!\" More whooping and clapping as Dr Huan slowly made her way out onto the stage. As the video Marni faded to black, Real Marni was lightly dabbing excess crumbs from her cheeks and stood up, finally ready to actually talk on umm, her own talk show. Not that she needed to hurry herself at all, wonder pill or no, the good doctor still needed a good amount of time to waddle her way over to the center of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice whistled in amazement. Dr Huan certainly hadn't been doing any slacking since her last show appearance. On the contrary, she looked to have put on even more weight than Marni had. And considering just how <i>big</i> Dr Huan had already been compared to Marni to begin with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany had gotten truly massive. Her belly, as always, led the way for her as she waddled, ever so ponderously, to an extra, extra-wide divan to Marni's left. It was a spectacle, truly, the size of that thing. It somehow stuck down and out at the same time, drooping far past her knees and jiggling in time with her heavy, quaking footsteps. It still split into two mighty rolls, the upper of the two already larger than a truck tire. Her legs- the sheer width of them- were so bulky that they were almost impossible to move over each other; Dr. Huan was forced into a very wide stance as she inched one foot awkwardly in front of the other, her flabby, jiggling arms held out slightly for balance as she lumbered towards her destination in an awkwardly slow shuffle that left the audience with nothing else to do but drag out the applause while they waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still... Dr Huan somehow seemed just as content as ever. She was still not the slightest bit out of breath, she wasn't sweating, Hell, just that fact that she could even <i>walk</i> so casually at her size... Clearly, walking for Dr Huan was <i>taxing</i>, but still not necessarily <i>tiring</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still smiled and waved to the audience as normal before setting herself down heavily in her seat. Even sitting, Alice could tell she was much, much fatter. Her legs were parted wide at what was practically a 55 degree angle in order to allow that surging, slumping belly enough space to occupy the entirety of her lap, and quite a bit more space on top of that. Dr. Huan's absurdly fat stomach stuck out a few inches past her knees and sagged heavily in between them. She folded her hands curtly atop her massive tummy and, once the applause had died down, began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fantastic to be sitting here back on my favorite show, Marni!\" she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh it's official, people!\" Marni squealed, mouth not preoccupied with chewing for once, \"we're Brittany Huan's favorite show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight applause and a smattering of laughter from the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I came here last, I was understandably met with quite a bit of skepticism about whether or not my \"miracle pill\" could really counteract the negative health effects of extreme obesity in the human body.\" Dr Huan continued. \"A lot of people just couldn't believe it when I claimed that my physician gave me a clean bill of health, or that there was simply no way the human body could maintain extended mobility at 638 pounds. Well,\" she added, arduously getting to her feet, but still standing under her own power nonetheless, \"I'm here to tell you that I'm almost 240 pounds heavier and still moving entirely under my own power!\" she beamed, giving the top of her mighty midsection a firm pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the audience let out a thunderous applause. Brittany smiled again before sitting back down with a WHUMP that was loud enough to be picked up on the mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that?\" Marni turned, addressing the audience now. \"We have a scientist so sure of her product that she intentionally gained almost <i>240 pounds</i> just to silence the haters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yes, well, it wasn't exactly intentional,\" Brittany admitted with a bit of an embarrassed smile, \"but your point still stands, I'm fitter and stronger than ever- trust me, I'd have to be to carry around all of <i>this</i>,\" she said, patting her huge belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore hearty laughter from the audience. They were hooked at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, to be fair, maybe the word of just one woman isn't quite enough.\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you certainly have my support,\" Marni chimed in. More audience applause. \"But I know what you're saying.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why I'm proud to announce our new public spokesperson! She's not only a strong advocate for GS-216 research but a personal client as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Marni stood up, ready to make yet another introduction. \"Plenty of you guys know her for films such as Tight Squeezes, No Space Between Us and, my personal favorite, Chubbiness and Chastity!\" Alice's ears perked up. \"Please have a warm welcome for our next guest: actress, former model and current activist, Emily Vaughn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Alice was engaged.

Emily had changed since Alice had last gone on a craz filled research of the actress. She look like she was above 600lbs and the work of the pill was obvious since a women that bottom heavy couldn\u2019t possibly gotten up from a couch. The blonde hair was in a bob cut died a light blue at the ends. Her face was round with a double chin and a small third, she had a average set of breast nothing that impressive. Her arms were in the air waving making her giant pillowy arms send waves down her body. Her stumic was a massive ball in front of her flapping over her thighs her body was covered in a green gown that was basically skin tight and out lined her rolls. Her most defining part was her massive lower half, her hips were so wide they probably not even fit through a ragular door way. Her legs were bigger than some people, touching all the way to the knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cCome on over here Emily sit next to me,\u201dDr. Huan said giddichly. But looking at the seat next to her Alice thought it would be a wonder if she fitted. Emily began her woddle over practically swinging her lags outward, her thighs still rubbing together the hole way. Just like Huan she showed no trouble getting there the movement was only awkward like moving a coolier on wheels whos handle was just to short slow and awkward but no trouble at all. The applause just like for Huan was awakedly long. Once she got to front stag she twirled around on one foot a feet no one haft her size should be able to do yet there it was. The twirled showed of one feature that Alice had some how missed her absolutely massive ass the thing was bigger than water melons and jiggled madly with the spin right above her dimpled thighs. Emily finally sat down sending her body ripping her body barely fitted in the chair with her fat being pushed out because of the arms of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201c Believe it before I took this pill I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that with out taking a nap after word,\u201d Emily laughed and the crowd returned the laugh ten full. She reached over to the plater and grabbed a hamburger putting it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201c So Emily it has been what has been two three years since you\u2019ve been seen in the media what have you been up too!?\u201d Marni said in excitement before grabbing a hold of a cupcake and shoving the whole thing in to her mouth before grabbing another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cWell I still did some activist stuff but no avail and kanda just gave up for awhile. But in my slums I found my love for music making and while coming up with some song, Huan over here came to me with a real way to help people like me now the 2nd trial period is done and when the third is done the drug will be on the market and being a different shape than the norm will be just as easy to live with as any one else,\u201d Emily preached and it was fallowed by a cheer from the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to release my first album and then hold a concert with me dancing and every thing just to show of what the pill can do.\u201d  Cheers erupted from the crowd and Emily started biting on a chicken leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cWow, you\u2019ve really been busy you can bet I\u2019ll be buying a ticket to that show,\u201d Marni squealed after finishing a family sized chip bag. \u201cSo Mrs. Huan when will the 3rd trail be done?\u201d Marni beet into a slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     So Haun raised a finger telling the audience that she was finishing up her 18th hotdog.

Alice had never had to work so hard to stay caught up with her classes, and she went to one of the most prestigious schools in America. The professors here were crazy, and they all expected her to treat their class like it was her number one priority! What\u2019s that? She wanted to go out and do something with Zack? Nope\u2014she had the History of American Fashion to brush up on. Want to go hang with some classmates? Better be a study session, \u2018cuz she had a Fashion Design course that required her to know why <i>everything</i> looked the way it did. Grab a bite to eat? Nope\u2014Biology!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, forgive her if she fell a little slack on the press. Buzzfeed was atwitter about Dr. Huan\u2019s miracle cure, and it had been making rounds in social media, but who had the time to glance through Facebook when there were papers to write?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, if it hadn\u2019t come up in Mrs. Wallace\u2019s English course (why did she even need English? She was a Fashion Design major!) Alice would have forgotten all about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Haun\u2019s miracle pill had become something of a controversy, on campus and in the rest of the country it seemed. Most were skeptical of her claims, citing the fact that it made its debut on daytime television of all things and Dr. Huan\u2019s controversial theories regarding body mass and excess weight in general. However there was (apparently) a rather vocal and growing faction that took the opposite stance; one that saw the Yeng-Huan pill as a scientific breakthrough and hailed Dr. Huan as a medical messiah. Not only had she managed to <i>map</i> the human genome, she was planning on curing any ailments through her research, and making it available to the general public! If her hypothesis were correct (and so far, they were purportedly so) Dr. Huan\u2019s research could very well change the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Alice, just struggling to keep up in Biology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege was so friggin\u2019 hard, she didn\u2019t have time for any of this other extraneous stuff! Sure there were miracle pills and lots of speculation/accusations getting thrown around, but Alice needed to focus on surviving her first semester at ASU before she could worry about any hot-button political-slash-scientific issues\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this would all be resolved by Winter Break? Then she could catch up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, as she stood right now, Alice had much more pressing matters to worry about. She was doing splendidly in her GenEd courses. She\u2019d covered most of the material during her days at Buttercombe, and filled in the gaps at DPCC. But, for all her fervor for fashion, she was floundering in the higher leveled courses pertaining to her field of interest. There was a difference between being able to sew and being able to tell the professor <i>why</i> it should be sewed a certain way and who made the technique and what kind of material should be used\u2026 it was exhausting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Alice had asked for a little help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like Zack could help her study\u2014Alice needed to pass these classes! So she\u2019d been asking around campus for a tutor that could help her pass these stupid design courses, or at least help put her on the right track. She\u2019d already flunked an exam (luckily her professor dropped the lowest test grade, but still!) and that meant she needed an A on this midterm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she\u2019d found someone in her class who was willing to help her\u2014free of charge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat in the cafeteria, her notebooks open, Alice awaited the arrival of her tutor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile <i>she</i> had maintained a neutral standing in this whole Yeng-Huan debacle, her tutor certainly hadn\u2019t. Alice really hoped that they could actually <i>study</i> and not have literature or facts or statistics shoved down her throat\u2026 the non-academic sort of those things, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause her tutor was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet\u2019s give a big Marni Blake welcome to Ken Glen, the fattest man alive, coming to us live from Abercrombie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice almost choked on the soda she was drinking. Abercrombie? The world\u2019s fattest man lived in her own city? What were the odds of that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a giant screen set up to the side of Marni\u2019s stage a man fatter than anyone Alice had ever seen \u2013 and she had experience being in the realm of fat people \u2013 came on. During the interview the feed cut between two camera angles; one a close-up of the man\u2019s face, his chins running all the way down to the bottom of the screen and below it, and the other a diagonal angle from the front, taking in all of the man\u2019s ginormous belly and giving a good idea of how big his sides and butt were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice couldn\u2019t tell if he was sitting on a bench or resting on a bed, his own fat filled so much of the screen even with the camera pulled back. And it wasn\u2019t even a complete picture. Alice was certain his belly must have hit the floor and piled up on top of it, but she couldn\u2019t see because the screen cut off at where his knees must have been. She could see the reason for two cameras; the one further back was too far back to make out his head properly. It looked like a small ball of flesh and hair atop the mountain of fat that was his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Glen, thank you for joining us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Ken, Marni, and let me say it\u2019s a pleasure to be here. Yours is the only show I\u2019ll do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop,\u201d Marni waved him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it. It\u2019s so rare to find a woman with the strength of character to own who she is, not apologizing for not fitting into the supposed ideal body type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t panting with exhaustion just from speaking, he didn\u2019t look tired or struggling to breathe. Contrary to all of Alice\u2019s ideas about how how fat was too fat, Ken looked as comfortable and at ease as anyone. Dressed in a sail-sized polo shirt and khakis, he looked no different than a suburban father enjoying a lazy Saturday; aside from the excessive fat, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was certainly leagues above the usual trailer trash Marni had on her show. Put him on radio, where people could only hear his voice and not see the elephant of a man he was, and he could probably host a talk show of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you put it that way, why don\u2019t we get right to the big question (pun intended): what\u2019s it like being the fattest man alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to be frank I never thought about myself as the bigGEST until Guinness weighed me and announced it to the world. Until a month ago I was just Ken. Software programmer, loving boyfriend, a pretty good trivia player at the local pub. There was never a point in my life where I wasn\u2019t skinny, but aside from a lot of jokes at my expense growing up \u2013 and what can you do about kids, really \u2013 I\u2019ve always been comfortable with my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough my size has never leveled off, so perhaps I should say I\u2019ve always been comfortable being fat and then fatter. People who know me for at least a few months get used to my size, and they might be surprised when I mention reaching another hundred pound milestone but by that point they already know I\u2019m a big guy and a big eater, so they\u2019re used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody gets on your case about your size? Not your doctor or your boss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy boss, never. He knows what a dedicated worker I am, and since I started working from home he says my productivity has only gone up. So if constant eating and being the size of a Volkswagen means I\u2019m finishing projects a week before deadline and under cost, it\u2019s a wonder he hasn\u2019t given me a bonus just to cover grocery expenses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed at this, his entire body quaking and shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my doctor... not so much. He stopped his finger-wagging a few years ago, but I think it\u2019s just him giving up on getting through to me. My physicals are always good, no medical issues because of my size, so he doesn\u2019t have any cards to play besides general fearmongering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you\u2019re still growing. Is there a medical cause behind your size, or...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless overeating is a medical condition, no. This is all me. When I was young my mother always gave me treats, maybe too many, and as I got older I got in the habit of filling my belly whenever I was hungry. I just enjoy eating, and being fat doesn\u2019t bother me so I never felt the need to diet and drop all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel, being so huge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly? Pretty damn good. My body is constantly rubbing against itself in a thousand different places, the physical stimuli flaring up every time I move or just shift my weight. Plus there\u2019s something about having so much... presence. Standing out anywhere I go, the attention people give me. I\u2019ve never felt embarrassed about this; if anything I thrive on the looks other people give me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked so confident, almost proud. Alice was reminded of her sister, Mel, an almost aggressive fatty. She was probably watching this right now; what did she think of Ken?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this is the question everyone wants the answer to more than any: exactly how much do you weigh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I can\u2019t give a solid answer to. When Guinness weighed me it was 3,258 pounds,\u201d he paused as he was interrupted by spontaneous applause from the audience, \u201cbut to celebrate the announcement that I held a world record Babs \u2013 that\u2019s my girlfriend, Barbara \u2013 and I took a trip to Las Vegas and, well, there are a few buffets where I can\u2019t show my face anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughs from the audience and a few chuckles from Marni. This guy wasn\u2019t a professional comedian, but he knew a little about working a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how about this: any plans for the future? I don\u2019t know if anyone is going to challenge you for your title anytime soon, but what are you doing to hold onto it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just being me. It\u2019s what got me here in the first place, and as long as I keep stuffing my belly and gaining more I should be the champion for a good long while. Plus, I\u2019m getting a lot of help from the neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s quite a few people here in Abercrombie that are taking pride in my title. Mostly restaurants and eateries. They might not be thrilled with how much work I drop on their kitchen staff, but they love the publicity and media attention I\u2019ve brought them. But there\u2019s also some fashion designers in town that cater to the plus-sized crowd, and again, I\u2019m bringing them great publicity. I\u2019m not the only biggun here in Abercrombie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s ears perked up. Plus-sized fashion designers, here in Abercrombie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re going to be king of the hill \u2013 or should I say mountain \u2013 for a good long while, Ken. Enjoy your reign.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Marni. Love the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marni directed the show to commercial, Alice\u2019s thoughts were drifting away from the TV. Memories of frustration with finding fashionable outfits when she had been bigger were coming back to her. Thoughts of Mel or her friends from Buttercombe who hadn\u2019t dropped their own fat, making due with what meager offerings in plus-sized fashion there were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t need a better diversity of choices, but Alice hadn\u2019t forgotten what it was like being a big girl and the needs (and frustrations) that came with it. So hearing that there were designers in her own town focused on that piqued Alice\u2019s curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly heralded by angels with trumpets coming down from on high, but Alice felt she had found her mission in life.</span></div></div>",

She had regularly railed against the meager offerings of the plus-sized shop, though her sister Mel and many fat friends from Buttercombe had just made do with those limited selections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her current size, Alice had more choices, but she hadn\u2019t forgotten what it was like being a big girl - and there were still many cute outfits that didn't come in her size! So, hearing that there were plus-size designers right here in Abercrombie piqued her curiosity.  Would some of them even teach in the fashion program at ASU?  Alice could only hope.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, though, before classes began, she could scope out the Abercrombie fashion scene - she had Zack had been so busy moving, finding a place, unpacking, settling in, and just spending time together than except for the supermarket and the hardware and furniture stores, they hadn't really seen the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, thinking back, Alice remembered having an impression that the salespeople in the furniture store were well-dressed.  And that the guys in the hardware store had been, well, big. Not to mention some of the check-out girls at the supermarket.  Could it be that Ken Glen had some family here? Or was it just chance that she had seen some big folk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving immediately on her idea - it involved fashion, after all! - Alice dressed carefully, applied light but stylish make-up, and spent a few minutes considering which shoes.  Perhaps she should get another pair, to go with the brown linen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving away from the condo, Alice realised that she didn't have a map of Abercrombie.  Oh well, first stop the tourist bureau - they would know about shops and designers too, maybe.  And there were easy-to-follow signs to find them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women and one man in the tourist bureau were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alice exited, her long blonde hair tied up in a towel, while Zack stroked the baby-smooth skin of his neck and chin. They had both lain their clothes out for the day, and would be embarking on another one of their adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been two weeks since they had moved to Abercrombie, and most of it had been spent exploring the new town that they found themselves in. Eating out, seeing the sights, going on little romantic excursions to this place or that, it had been nice! And today was going to be no exception. Zack still had a few vacation days to play around with, and Alice wouldn't start school for another week or so, and that meant that they had at least a few more days of puppy-love before reality tore them in their respective directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was the first to undress, kicking off his pajama pants and tearing off the baggy white t-shirt he had slept in, revealing his nudity for all to see. He was a solidly built boy, with a naturally athletic figure that, though underdeveloped due to his desk job, still afforded him a lean figure and slight tone. His soft blonde hair was tussled and tossed, even as he poked his head through the neckhole of the t-shirt he had laid out before his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stole some appreciative glances, but was more or less slow to unravel herself from her towel. Before she undid her makeshift garment, Alice made sure to step into her panties and pull them up around her waist. Then she stepped into their closet, grabbed a bra, and fastened it before quickly hurrying herself into a flowy white top. Letting her long, mostly-dry hair fall down to her shoulders in fluffy blonde locks, Alice practically jumped into a pair of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quite comfortable with one another--they'd been dating for over three years now. And they'd seen each other through their respective \"chubby phases\", so it wasn't like they weren't comfortable with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just... weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe because they lived together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them knew quite sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully it would wear off, Zack told himself as he turned to sneak a glance at his girlfriend's pert round butt filling out the seat of her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Zack buttoned his pants, Alice opened the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day, after all... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So the hardest part about moving was probably going to be getting to know everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was to be expected. Zack had come from a big family, and was raised in a big city where he knew almost everyone. Even when someone new moved to town, <i>he</i> was always the one showing <i>them</i> around, never the other way around. And Alice had come fresh out of an Academy where she knew almost everyone within a two-year radius. By the time she had become a senior, Freshmen were actively looking to her for advice on what to do and where to go\u2014neither of them had been fish out of water for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Alice felt, and Zack agreed, that it was important that they get to know people in this new town. Not only as individuals, but as a couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them really got started with this whole \"life in Abercrombie\" thing, it would be a pretty good idea for them to get a fresh start. Make some new friends, build some familiarity with the people around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a businessman now, it would be important for Zack to need to network anyway (was that the right word, network?) and Alice would need to know everything there is to know about Abercrombie if she ever wanted to find good venues to debut her designs. It seemed only natural that they would start exploring on a more social level than they had been in the past week or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were going to start right here, in their apartment complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know babe, aren't we a little... <i>old</i> to have a playdate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Alice giggled as she gave him a little punch in the arm, \"They invited us over like, <i>last week</i>. We said we wanted to make friends... well, this is how you make friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple in 21C, right down the hall from them, had actually been the first people besides the movers to <i>speak</i> to them in Abercombie. They had been moving their stuff down the hall, and they poked their heads out to offer a hand. Even though they said they were fine, they were still nice enough to offer Zack and Alice over one day, to help them get situated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been a week ago, and it wasn't like they were doing anything <i>else</i> before their respective responsibilities kicked in. Alice had made sure their offer was still open last night as she passed one of them in the hallway, and they said to come on over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were their names again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the guy's name was Seth.\" Alice whispered, \"And... Tess? I want to say his girlfriend's name is Tess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Alice couldn't hold back a giggle as Zack cracked a smile, \"Stop being dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Tess were two self-described \"sorta-kinda-okay neighbors\". They were about Zack and Alice's age, and were in a pretty similar situation. They were young, a couple, and taking the steps towards moving towards bigger and better things... why <i>shouldn't</i> they hang out together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice gave the door a little knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's open!\" came a voice from inside, \"Come on in guys, we were just getting started on lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack and Alice looked at one another, steeling themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got this?\" Alice asked her at-times-awkward boyfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Zack nodded with a playful intensity, \"You good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good.\" Alice smiled, \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go make some friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey high-fived each other and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Tess were...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hiya! Welcome to the neighborhood!\" cheered the couple at the door. Alice and Zach were a little surprised by who was there, with their neighbors not looking like what they thought they would. Tess was <i>very</i> short, probably standing at about 5'2 at the tallest with flaming red curly hair and very pale skin. Seth towered over his girlfriend (which wasn't hard to do) with dark hair and almond eyes. They looked so mismatched yet paired perfectly at the same time, but there was something about their appearances that seemed off and it wasn't until they came inside and sat down on the couch that it became evident what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess and Seth were quite the conversationalists, talking enough that they didn't notice when Alice and Zach barely said anything and just kind of stared at them. They may not have were it not for the fact that evidence of Seth and Tess having gained the freshman 15 just became clear. When standing up you couldn't really tell, but when the pair sat down the pounds showed up. Seth's stomach surged forward upon sitting down, almost flopping out into his lap, like the beer belly of someone who had been drinking for many years (<i>had he been sucking it in before</i> Zach wondered). Tess's sides seemed to pool over the waistband of her pants, giving her a large muffin top while seated. Alice and Zach were shocked that this came off of the people who when they stepped in the door seemed so thin and trim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and we just finally got the pictures from our friends who's a photographer in town from the day we moved in a couple weeks ago. We didn't even know he had been taking any, it was such a nice housewarming gift to get! Here, don't we look precious?!\" Tess flashed her phone to the couple sitting opposite of them, which surprised them more because it was a seated picture of the students across from them (in almost the exact same pose) but with no extra weight showing on any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you two look great there! This friend must be a great photographer, especially since they say the camera adds ten pounds to a person,\" Alice commented, trying to subtlety find out how they could look so thin there but so much bigger here in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could still say that, I swear since those photos were taken two weeks ago I've gained at least 15 pounds! I mean there's no way that's actually possible but it sure looks it, not that I'm about to do anything about it. I hate working out, so it was only a matter of time before this happened\" Seth replied, shaking his small yet prominent gut to add emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, there must be something in the water here! I've always been thin as a rail but since moving here I just keep feeling more padded than before. But at least we're not nearly the size of most of the locals here, those people are HUGE,\" Tess added in agreement. \"I don't know what you two are planning to do here or how long you plan to be here, but I recommend getting pictures together now before you wind up... well, before you wind up like the locals,\" she laughed as she mocked the townie's sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we've both put in a lot of work to get to this point, we're not going to let ourselves turn out like them,\" Zach replied, reminding himself of all the work he and Alice had put in to lose the weight they had gained during their high school years. Alice nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you two! Now, let's get us some dinner, I'm starving!\" Seth exclaimed. The two couples then got up and went to the dining room, where Tess and Seth had covered the table in all kinds of takeout food from around the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They want to lecture us about not becoming like the locals, they had better watch themselves,</i> thought the new couple as they sat down to eat with their new neighbors.</span></div></div>",

We don't want to be late to Seth and Tess's party, especially since we're so close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zach, can you help me zip up the rest of this dress? I can't seem to reach the zipper,\" Alice called out from the bathroom. Zach did a short jog from their living room to their bedroom to go help his girlfriend finish getting ready, wheezing a little bit as he made the short jog (something felt really off, but he couldn't figure out what). While the party at Seth and Tess's wasn't a fancy party, Alice being the fashionista she is decided to wear a casual dress she had been working on for one of her classes at the college. However, as Zach observed when he tried to get the zipper to meet and go up, she may not have done her measurements correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I don't think you got your measurements correct, I can't even get the zipper to meet in the back,\" he told her. He could see her scrunch up her nose in the mirror, the look she always gets when she's trying to solve a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I did it right. It was fine when I tried it on last week,\" Alice replied. \"Maybe if I suck it in it'll work?\" Zach tried the zipper again and still got nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, still the same result.\" Alice sighed and stopped trying to suck in her stomach... wait, when did that get there, Zach said in his head. He hadn't noticed until now the bulge that was at present keeping Alice's dress tightly on her body despite it not being zipped up. He could even see the indent from her naval through the dress it was tight enough on her. It looked as if, much like their neighbors, she had gained some college weight, and by the look on her face she hadn't realized that until now either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zach, I think we've both gotten a bit lazy with our diets, I think we need to try to eat healthier more now. I mean look at us, we've both gained weight in just 2 weeks of being here!\" Alice exclaimed. Zach looked at her confused. \"Don't tell me you haven't noticed this development in your gut,\" she scolded as she stuck a finger into his stomach, which shocked him with how far in it sunk. He hadn't noticed his stomach until then, and then noticed too how his shirt clung tightly to his body (and not in a good way).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, we need to stop this. I swear, I've just been too tired lately to go to the gym after work! I don't know why all the sudden that's how I've been, I've never had that problem before,\" Zach said with a slightly despondent tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, I have no idea why I just haven't been able to get motivated enough to go,\" Alice replied. \"But there's nothing we can do about that now, let me go change so we can get to the party.\" She quickly walked away, and as she walked Zach noticed a slight jiggle in her body that he hadn't seen in a while from her. She changed into a pair of leggings and a cute tunic instead of the dress (though this new outfit still clung more tightly to her new curve than it used to) and they walked down the hall to go to the party, with Zach finally realizing what had felt off when he was jogging to the bathroom earlier: his stomach bounced now too, and the wheezing was because he had gotten so out of shape so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked right into Seth and Tess's place, not needing to knock since the door was wide open and people were bustling about in their apartment. They started looking around for their hosts, not seeing them anywhere but noticing a lot of large bodies in the apartment. There wasn't a single person who didn't look at least chubby, most of them bordering on overweight or downright fat. As Zach and Alice made their way to the kitchen they continued to bump into wide hips and round bellies, all of whom seemed unaccustomed to the sensation. They finally spotted the couple in the kitchen talking to another couple, but their hosts blended in better than anticipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that in the two weeks Zach and Alice had lived in Abercrombie their neighbors had practically ballooned, with the beer gut Seth once had now looking more like a 25 week pregnant belly. His whole body really looked softer, with his arms being tightly packed into his t-shirt and his softened chest noticeable through the shirt as well. And Tess, whose short stature showed her weight more in the first place, looked even bigger, with her hips flaring out significantly and her thighs touching all the way down to her knees, looking fairly chaffed from rubbing together in areas not covered by her shorts. Her face was even rounding out with her cheeks now constantly looking as if she had something in her mouth (which, in all fairness, she usually did). The couple standing next to them were even larger, probably outweighing their friends by at least 100 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, so glad you two could make it! Let me introduce you to Maria and Darren, they were the first ones to welcome us to town just like we were the first to welcome you! Darren's also at the college while Maria runs a restaurant downtown!\" Tess excitedly babbled. Maria and Darren conversed for a couple minutes with Zach and Alice then left the party. Zach and Alice stayed in the kitchen for the time being, not super comfortable socializing with so many people they didn't know. After a little while Tess came and dragged Alice away to join a group of the women chatting in a corner, leaving Zach with Seth and a group of guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, I see you and Zach have really taken to the town,\" one of the women said to her. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I really like the college and there are definitely some cute shops downtown, but I'm still getting to know the place,\" she replied. The women all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, when I say 'taken to the town' I mean you're starting to be shaped like the rest of us! I didn't think I ever would when I moved here a year ago but the weight started piling on immediately and I just couldn't bring myself to do anything about it. Everyone else seemed unbothered by it so why should I have let it bother me, am I right?\" said one of the women. The rest nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, it must be something in the water! Seth and I have only been here a month and we've both already put on 40 pounds and neither of us seems to be able to do anything about it, <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">not that we've really tried...</font>\" Tess trailed off. Alice raised her eyebrow, concerned about what would happen to her and Zach after too long here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach was having a similar discussion with the guys. When he and Seth walked over to the group of men they didn't do a traditional greeting, they belly bumped him instead, something he found quite odd. One of the biggest guys noticed the quizzical look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, some people here are so large they can barely lift their arms or their arms can't reach past their stomach, belly bumping is a much easier greeting! Plus, it's way more fun, although your belly isn't quite yet large enough to appreciate it, but give it another month or so and then you'll see,\" the man said. Zach dropped his jaw, that seemed absurd! Not just the whole concept of the belly bump, but also that he'll soon be large enough to understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it takes no time to put on weight in this town. I moved here a year and a half ago a super slim 150, now I'm bordering 400 on a good day!\" the gut laughed and the rest of the guys chuckled too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, I mean you met me two weeks ago and I was not nearly this big! I put on 40 pounds this past month, and it looks like you're on track to do the same. It takes some adjusting and learning how to move at the larger size, but it's actually pretty freeing to not worry about what you put into your body and just let nature do what it does. Now, you have to join our fantasy football league\u2026\" Seth continued going on about fantasy football with the guys, eventually roping Zach into their league. But Zach couldn't get past the idea of everyone seeming to gain so much weight upon arrival... it all seemed too odd, yet he didn't know what to do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

POP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach sighed as his shirt fell to either side of his ever-rounding belly, having gotten large enough in the past month that it just popped the buttons off his second new work shirt. He just looked down and the bulbous mass blocking his view of his feet, disappointed that he can't seem to do anything to slow it. Every time he's said he was going to go to the gym he just gets too tired to go, his hunger never seems to go away now, and his new group of friends certainly don't help him try to eat less. In the two months since moving to Abercrombie he had already gained 60 pounds, having just hit 230 that very morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, is there any chance you can fix my work shirt? Three buttons just popped off it,\" Zach yelled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh AGAIN? Didn't you just get a new one?\" Alice groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not like you haven't done the same thing!\" he retorted, especially since it was just last night that she popped the button off her jeans at dinner with Tess and Seth. \"We just have to face the facts, we're not going to be getting any smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't mean I have to keep fixing your clothes for you,\" Alice added. \"It's just too much work.\" She walked into the bedroom and plopped down next to Zach, the ever-growing couple staring at themselves in the mirror that makes up their closet door. Neither one liked how large they were getting and neither one was willing to put in the work to curb it either, resulting in them resembling more of what they looked like in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile neither of them were close yet to the heaviest they had ever been, they were certainly on their way back to that look. Alice's stomach was still, much to her chagrin, the largest part of her. Since she had already had breakfast that morning her stomach was fairly round and taut but usually it resembled more of a bowl of jelly, hanging a bit like a fat sack on her body. The rest of her had grown too, her thighs having begun to chafe, her arms having puffed up, and her face now being graced by a double chin again. Zach was also all belly, but his was more like a small beach ball had attached itself to his midsection, straining any shirt with buttons and making it impossible to find a t-shirt he owned to cover the whole thing, often leaving the apartment with at least a couple inches of belly exposed for the world to see (not that the world cared, that look was the norm in Abercrombie). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple just stared at themselves for a few minutes in the mirror then looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go clothes shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about tomorrow, we have plans with Tess and Seth tonight.\"</span></div></div>",

Zack noticed there weren\u2019t any end tables or bookshelves or whatever else could be casually knocked over. Everything was put up on shelves running along all the walls, kept at shoulder-height at a minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously the two had not been transformed overnight. Not that Zack thought the Freshman 15 ever went so overboard as to be a Freshman 450.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs comforting, in an odd way, as meeting with two out-and-out fatties was, there was still an awkward period of getting past that initial shock and seeing Seth and Tess as Seth and Tess and not two blimps of blubber. It was hard to look at their face or follow their hands as they gesticulated when said face or hands were lost behind bellies bigger than a beanbag or when Tess, sitting across from Seth at the table and thus around the corner of both Alice and Zack, was resting on a butt big enough to double as a loveseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess, a natural brunette, was a pear. That was the first thing Alice and Zack noticed. They couldn\u2019t help it. When they had walked into the apartment\u2019s tiny foyer and turned towards the kitchen, they had seen her bent over in front of the stove, her rear rising so high and so far back it was brushing against the fridge on the opposite side of the room. Her hips expanded so wide they masked the oven and part of the cabinets on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the rest of her was given the shaft. Her breasts \u2013 great gelatinous mounds that jiggled at the slightest provocation \u2013 exceeded any department store\u2019s underwear section. Bras had to be specially made for her, and today it looked like she was going without. And her belly, tiny as it was compared to the rest of her, still bulged out like a gravid womb, rolling over the waist band of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was mostly belly, but he had so much middle that after a couple attempts Zack and Alice realized they couldn\u2019t just walk around him in the hallways of the apartment, or outside the apartment either. His belly was too big for him to wrap his arms around, falling past the middle of thighs and looking perpetually stuffed (which, Zack later mused, it might be). Every part of him was a collection of rolls and bulges, but his belly was like a solid sphere for fat leading him around everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably in search of more food, if his performance at lunch was any indication of his appetite. The spread laid out on the table was a feast, the kind of meal that made Alice and Zack flashback to the heftier part of their life. And not necessarily in a bad way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a giant bowl of lobster bisque, a single crab cake the size of a cake, cheddar biscuits overflowing a basket, lobster rolls, fried calamari strips, mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives, steamed carrots drowning in butter, French fries seasoned in garlic salt and for dessert pieces of tiramisu as big as bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Zack spent all of five seconds fighting the urge to pig out, an effort that fell away as Seth and Tess dove in. Filling their plates until they almost spilled onto the table, the two Abercrombie natives greedily claimed massive portions of every dish for themselves and began chowing down. They went at it with such gusto that you could see their bodies shaking and quivering as they scooped food to their mouths and they chewed furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t out and out pigs, but it was clear from their excitement that these two didn\u2019t come by their size by happenstance. They had done this to themselves, and they felt no regret about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Alice said silently as she looked across the table to Zack and shrugged, when in Rome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the lead of their hosts, the two newcomers filled their own plates, taking as much as they thought they wanted. One bite was all it took to get them hooked; for Alice it was the crab cake (she had cut off a sizable piece) and for Zack it was the lobster rolls. Both were so delicious it was almost surprising. They both knew how good food could taste, but they hadn\u2019t expected anything like this from a simple get-together. This was almost gourmet-level cuisine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was what Seth and Tess ate normally, no wonder they were so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first course went into seconds, Seth and Tess leading the way as they refilled their plates to the threat of spillage and Alice and Zack following suit later. They didn\u2019t eat as fast or as much as their hosts, but the two had both decided to let loose this one time and enjoy the food to the fullest. So they went into seconds, thirds, and then fourths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final course was a dish-cleaning exercise, as everyone took the final portions of whatever dish they fancied and cleaned it out. Zack grabbed the last two lobster rolls and the last few cheddar biscuits, while Alice finished off the mashed potatoes and calamari. Seth pulled the remainder of the crab cake (a full third of it was left) onto his plate, and Tess picked up the bowl of lobster bisque and drank straight from it to finish it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end Alice and Zack were almost in pain, their bellies swollen uncomfortably, but Seth and Tess looked like they were thinking about ordering a pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof,\u201d Alice moaned. Her duties as a guest pushed through her food-hazed mind. \u201cThank you for the food. That was...\u201d she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was outstanding,\u201d Zack finished. \u201cAre either of you guys a cook?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot professionally,\u201d Seth said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve taken a few culinary courses at school, and Tess has always known her way around the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Alice said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself, that was all too good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Zack added. \u201cI thought this was just a normal get-together. I wasn\u2019t expecting you guys to go all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth chuckled, his eyes meeting Tess\u2019 as she smiled coyly.</span></div></div>",

This was <i>normal</i> for them? Sure that explained their size, Alice thought to herself, but how could eating <i>that</i> much be an everyday occurrence for them? Surely, Zack paled at the thought, they were exaggerating. They definitely ate well, judging by their respective and collective rotundity, but eating all that more than once a week? Once a month? There was no way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly oblivious, even as Alice's heart dropped and Zack's stomach turned, the other couple continued on in conversation without much of a second thought. There hadn't been much of it while everyone had been stuffing their faces, so perhaps they felt obligated to make small-talk while Alice and Zack picked themselves off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it.\" Tess said finally, her three chins flexing and rolling as she spoke, \"Seth and I eat in all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kind've have to when you're in college, am I right?\" Seth seemed to miss the irony in a man of his size preaching about moderation, even as he stroked the great swell of his beanbag-sized belly \"It's just so expensive when we go out; y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we always make plenty.\"  Tess quickly added, taking a sip from her glass, \"You guys are more than welcome to join us any time you'd like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no question as to whether or not Tess meant it, and it was sweet to offer. But all Zack and Alice could do was look at each other like Tess had just stomped on all of their toes with her every one of her hippy pounds. They were both so full, neither was honestly comfortable even thinking about eating, ever again! But here these two were, chatting it up politely and talking about dinner down the road!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you.\" Alice's cordiality won out over her initial shock as she cradled her swollen stomach, \"I, um... We appreciate the offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're both usually <i>super</i> busy.\" Zack burped, \"I mean with work\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014A-And with school!\" Alice nodded appreciatively of Zack's quick thinking, \"Sometimes we both just forget to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, their host couple made a collective face. Not anything ugly, or that they had said something that offended them somehow. It was more like Alice had just suddenly started speaking Chinese halfway through her sentence. \"Forgetting to eat\" was clearly a foreign concept in this household, as evidenced by Seth and Tess' floor-bending figures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better get rid of that attitude real quick!\" Seth said with a belly-laugh, his jowls quivering jovially, \"There's all kinds of awesome places to eat\u2014<i>especially</i> around campus! You're at ASU, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice gulped as she envisioned all the awful temptations that she was going to have to face if she ever wanted to maintain her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there's this neat little sub shop that opened up right off the exit!\" Tess interjected excitedly, gesticulating with her calf-sized arms behind her pumpkin-sized melons, \"We should totally take you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now?\" Zack asked nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there guy, I was talking about when school starts up!\" Seth snorted, leaning over ever so slightly to resituate himself in his seat, the curve of his belly dipping against Zack's knee, \"But hey, if you're up for it, there's a great pizza place that we haven't scared off yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Zack's turn to pale, rather green, as he imagined eating just one slice of pizza, and piling it on top of what he'd already shoveled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... a lot... buuuuut I really think we should get going.\" Alice rocked herself to a standing position with a grunt, \"It's getting late and, uh... Zack's got work in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" Zack nodded eagerly as his girlfriend helped heave him up, \"Y'know, early bird. Worms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was late, or at least getting there. Zack and Alice had almost quite literally eaten the time away dining with Seth and Tess. For what it was worth, Zack really <i>did</i> have to get to work in the morning. Sure Alice didn't exactly have an excuse, but it was just easier to piggyback on her boyfriend. They were a couple, right? It was okay to leave together. Especially when they were feeling more full than they had in months... maybe <i>years</i>, and their hosts were talking very casually about finding even more food to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe we'll see you around!\" Seth said with a friendly smile, \"You work for that hotel in town, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah!\" Zack stalled, smiling in a way that he hoped was friendly, \"The Hammond. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an awesome little bookshop in downtown. <i>Great</i> coffee.\" His smile was much more genuine, \"If you're not busy tomorrow, you want to grab lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, there he went again talking about more food. Zack had to practically button his mouth shut. Any more talk about anything gastronomical was bound to make him either toss his cookies or pop like an overstuffed tick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, uh... we'll see.\" Zack said with a nod, \"Thanks again for dinner guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great.\" Alice wasn't lying, but she may as well have been. All this food... it was just too much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found more success as they slowly inched themselves towards the door. Seth and Tess content to wave them out, rather than rise from their clearly comfortable positions. Alice and Zack wondered, for a moment, if they even could. Being so full and fat like that... there was no way they were going to be able to follow them out, was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh-bye!\" Tess announced as she picked up the phone, probably to make good on that offer of pizza Seth laid out earlier, \"Don't be strangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later guys!\" Seth raised a hand in farewell, \"Let's do this again sometime!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As interesting as their encounter with Seth and Tess was, Alice and Zack would soon find that they weren\u2019t privy to a particularly unique mindset around Abercrombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next few days, as they settled into their new lives in their new hometown, Alice and Zack would be exposed to the same sort of outlook that very much reminded them of their neighbors. While Seth and Tess were still by far the <i>largest</i> people that they had come in contact with over the course of their stay, their outlooks regarding food, weight, and overall friendliness were seemingly pretty common! After dinner with their neighbors, it was almost like a veil had been lifted, and they could see Abercrombie in all its actuality for the first time since they made the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack noticed it first; and on his first day, no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean Hammond, his senior manager, had been a very large man. Not quite as large as Seth from the night before, but still quite big. If Zack had to take a guess, he would have placed Dean somewhere around four hundred pounds\u2014mostly belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a bit taller than Zack, as most other men were, but also much wider around than he had ever been. Dean\u2019s gut was a very prominent, a single roll of fat that swelled out and drooped over his beltline to a ludicrous degree. His face was just as plump, a brown stubble beard peppered his many chins and his round face quite handsomely. And from what he could see beneath the red blazer, his arms were just as big. His fingers were stubby and thick and, as Zack was given the opportunity to check many times as he kept a steady pace behind him on the tour, Dean\u2019s derriere was just as doughy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that belly of his was unreal. It was just\u2026 <i>there</i>. Present in every conversation. Zack couldn\u2019t help but stare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of the hotel staff, too, was a bit bigger than Zack would have expected. Marianne, the concierge, was a wide-hipped little redhead with a round face and a doughy belly that spilled over into her soft lap. The bellhop that he\u2019d been introduced to, Deanne, was just as round in the waist as she was in the chest. Even Dan, the valet who had taken his car, was sporting a meaty little belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on what seemed like the other side of the world, Alice had taken a bit longer to come around to seeing this side of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt mostly stemmed from her not having to start school until the week ended; she had enjoyed many days in the comfort of her own home since the move; she\u2019d been too busy facebooking her friends, sketching up new designs, and catching up with the Marni Blake Show to notice anything <i>too</i> strange about their new town. But once she started attending classes regularly, Alice\u2019s eyes had been opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had literally walked onto campus and ran into Tess. She had been trying to avoid it after such an <i>eventful</i> first coupling, but being as big as she was, Alice supposed it was inevitable. She had shown her to her class building and waddled off in kind, leaving Alice all by her lonesome in the strange new world of ASU. So imagine her surprise when she entered her History of Fashion course, and had to stop herself from staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of her class was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like going back to Buttercombe all over again, except this time Alice took the time to recognize that half of her class was easily obese. It was a largely female class, lead by an instructor just as heavyset as the rest of them. Dr. Braun had distractingly large breasts, that seemed to stare at her as the older woman turned to face her tardy student. Alice shrunk into herself as best she could, and wriggled her way through the shrinking aisles between her classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were girls bigger than some of the seniors back at Buttercombe, crammed into desks specifically designed to carry their bulk. And spilling out of them. Between all of the desks she passed, Alice must have brushed against at least fifty pounds of excess chub just hanging over the surface of desks. Bellies, arms, hips, one girl\u2019s <i>breast</i>. Alice eventually settled down next to one of the only skinny girls in the class, and tried to pay attention to her professor\u2019s lecture, rather than the sheer scope of her class\u2019 size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t hard to see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack and Alice were still getting used to living in Abercrombie, just as they were still getting used to all the Abercrombians in it. But even they had to admit that there were an awful lot of restaurants. And not just fast food, either; sit-down places with menus and booths, with real chefs in their very real kitchens. As Alice was more or less hopeless in the kitchen, they\u2019d found themselves eating out quite a lot over the years. But never had there been so much <i>variety</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s more, none of it had ever tasted this good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir meal with Seth and Tess had been a precursor for many meals to come, apparently, as the quality of food very much matched the quantity. Every other place was city-wide famous for this thing or that. The best pizza in Abercrombie. The best Mexican food in Abercrombie. The only place you can get a pizza-dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell even <i>was</i> a pizza dog?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack and Alice were sure to find out. Because, as the days flew by and their lives settled into some semblance of normalcy\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Because, as the days flew by and their lives settled into some semblance of normalcy, they could see that it was going to be a 24/7 job to avoid slipping back into their chubbier days. Memories of doughier bodies clad in outfits pulled from the racks at Lane Bryant or the Big 'n Tall shop were too fresh in the young couple's minds to be written off as paranoia. Even without any genetic predisposition to porking up, old habits had revealed how easily they each could go overboard with constant snacking and generous portions at mealtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Abercrombie wasn't going to help them, they realized this quickly. The obvious issue was that despite the unexpected density of food-hawkers, from food carts on up to ritzy restaurants, this did not guarantee as deep a selection of low-calorie fare as they might have liked. When being confronted with dishes that tantalized the tongue and satisfied the belly's craving \u2013 food that elicited such descriptors as 'savory,' 'rich,' 'indulgent' or 'decadent' \u2013 the best defense would have been an equally diverse offering that tended towards fruits, vegetables or lean meats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as if there were some conspiracy targeting the weight-conscious, like our young couple, even those dishes that had the illusion of healthy were undermined by the inclusion of garnishings that added at least a couple hundred calories. Fruit bowls came laden with heavy cream, salads a similarly rich dressing. Chicken wasn't always fried, but baked dishes were practically drowned in sauces or accompanied by hearty sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the portions. Given their financial situation Alice and Zack were happy to get their money's worth, don't doubt that. But this didn't mean they wanted every meal they ate out to be a stomach-busting feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time they hit a trendy restaurant \u2013 not a quickie burger joint, but a real restaurant \u2013 they made the mistake of ordering appetizers with their meal. When the plates of fried calamari and loaded potato wedges were set in front of them, it looked like they had accidentally been given entrees instead. Then their actual entrees arrived, the servings so big they each got multiple plates: one for the main dish and another for the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t quite like a repeat of their first lunch with Seth and Tess, but the end result wasn\u2019t much different. Alice and Zack were left cradling groaning bellies by the end, the waitress\u2019 perky query if they wanted to see the dessert menu almost making them heave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was representative of how every place practically threw food at its customers, but the new arrivals had nowhere to turn to voice their astonishment at this except one another. Because there was a second front in their war against expanding waistlines: the population of Abercrombie. The question of why the restaurants offered such massive portions was answered by the simplest of facts; it was because there was a demand for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas every person in Abercrombie an unrepentant, food-obsessed glutton? Not hardly. But were constant snacking, overeating and the occasional gorging commonplace? Absolutely. Between classes, at study sessions, during breaks at work, hanging out with friends, going shopping; at almost every time, during almost any activity, the average Abercrombian was more likely to have something to nosh on than not. It wasn\u2019t that food was dominant in their thoughts so much as chomping on something casually was a predominant habit. And when they sat down to a real meal, few would get up before they had had all they could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough those early weeks Zack and Alice avoided being drawn into old, undesirable habits by dint of not eating out too often, but even that couldn\u2019t shield them entirely through the time it took to learn just how pervasive the indulgent habits were in this city. The couple didn\u2019t want to withdraw entirely from their neighbors, coworkers and classmates, becoming hermits or shut-ins; but Alice politely begging off a third round of pub food during a study session at a bar near campus or Zack mentioning his plans to hit the gym after work didn\u2019t get through to the fat and happy Abercrombians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if someone did notice them turning down more food too forcefully or too often, there was a distinct coolness to their future interactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they self-conscious about eating when we\u2019re not?\u201d Alice asked once, as the two shared notes about their respective days and they discovered the similar patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they think we\u2019re refusing their hospitality or something,\u201d Zack offered. \u201cOr we\u2019re ruining the mood, being stuck up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t rock the boat. Not this early on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt probably would be easier to just go with the flow. We don\u2019t have to gorge, just nibble on something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscussions of the plan stopped there, but both were grappling with other thoughts about the situation. Namely, the temptation to indulge just as their new acquaintances did. They had to eat, that wasn\u2019t up for debate, but allowing themselves to reach satisfying fullness without going for \u2018just one more\u2019 serving or dish or whatever was a constant struggle. The people around them and the city itself passively encouraged them to go beyond mere satiation, but they both knew just how easily they could be swayed (or even just to let themselves) overdo it. It was devilishly simple to say to themselves \u2018Everyone else is eating, so I can have another slice of pizza\u2019 or \u2018Compared to what most of the others have eaten another plate won\u2019t compare.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was the fact that as the days passed into weeks and the novelty of moving to a new city gave way to routine, their perspective changed. Seeing so many large-bodied people eating so much, it was hard to keep in mind what constituted a normal diet. Yes, limiting the fattiest or greasiest dishes was still possible, but when you\u2019ve gone several weeks eating what constituted a \u2018full\u2019 meal in Abercrombie you would take it for granted that a half-pound burger, side of fries, side of onion rings, extra-large soda and a jumbo slice of cheesecake for dessert was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one area where the changes to their diet couldn\u2019t be ignored: wardrobe. The extra pounds and inches could be ignored if they crept up slowly enough to not be noticed, when when one struggled to pull up a pair of jeans or threw on a favorite shirt and found it didn\u2019t quite cover one\u2019s belly, the full scope of what was happening came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch is what happened one morning a month and a half into their new life in Abercrombie, as</span></div></div>",

That was more than half of them now, all downhill from here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling slowly, Zack let his middle inflate to its usual rounded size. He couldn't deny that it was bigger than he recalled, but as one part of his mind reflected on too many indulgent Abercrombie meals he tried to shift his conscious thoughts to other topics. He wasn't blind to how his eating habits had backslid since moving here, or how his plans to go to the gym regularly hadn't turned out exactly as he hoped. And this wasn't the first time he had noticed a tightness in clothing that had previously fit just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he'd have to buy some new shirts. That wasn't the end of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inhaled again, sucking in his belly. Then he was slipping another button into its hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling, slowly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the buttons popping off was like popcorn kernels erupting in the microwave. Bang! Bang! Bang! Three buttons shot off his shirt, rebounding off the wall and falling to the floor as Zack's belly spread the two parts of his shirt and hung free. The undershirt he had on rolled up an inch or so from the outer contour of his belly, exposing his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" he said, thinking too late to keep his voice low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Alice asked, poking out from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's... This shirt's too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered turning away and hiding the damage to his shirt, but decided on honesty. If anyone could understand the frustration and guilt he was feeling, it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stepped into the bedroom, clutching her towel tight despite the many times they had seen each other naked, and inspected his sundered shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shirt's too small?\" she said, giving him a look that said 'Are you being honest?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe I'm too big,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have gotten softer,\" her tone wasn't judgmental at all. \"And you're not the only one. Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened up the towel to reveal a body that looked like a curvy exaggeration of her pre-Abercrombie physique. She clearly meant to allay Zack's self-recrimination by pointing out that both of them were feeling the effects of Abercrombie's culinary temptations, but where he saw how his thicker middle distorted his body all he could think when he looked at his naked girlfriend was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God damn, she's sexy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw how her torso was rounding out into a little pot belly, but that only served to emphasize the widening of her hips, the swelling of her thighs, and the heaving fullness of her breasts. All her added weight was going to exactly the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't her intent, but Alice's display did help take Zack's mind off his own problems. Taking her by the shoulders, Zack pulled her in close and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you realize just how damn good you make 'soft' look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice purred, grinning mischievously...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she pushed Zack away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, lover-boy. I have class, you have work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unf,\" Zack groaned. \"That's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adult life isn't fair. But I'll make it up to you later. Now go find another shirt that'll fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy, but Zack did find a shirt that, while labeled as the same size as his others, had more give. When he got it buttoned up he could feel it hugging his middle, but there weren't diamonds of flesh between the buttons, nor was he afraid to twist and bend or make sudden movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed Alice goodbye, squeezing her plush rear, and headed to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the elevators he met Seth. The supersized dude was dressed casually in a polo shirt, khaki shorts and sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man. Headed to work?\" he said, all smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bringing home the bacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why'd he have to mention food</i>, Zack asked himself. His breakfast of cereal and a couple bananas hadn't filled him up, and the thought that he could eat more made part of him think that he should be hungry enough for more. And if he should be hungry then he wasn't he hungry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his belly grumbled, loud enough that Seth heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're headed to work on an empty stomach,\" he said. \"I was headed to get some breakfast. Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Conflicting thoughts raced around his mind. If he turned him down he might sound rude. If he said he didn't have time that might sound like a lie. If he said yes he'd have to be careful not to eat too much. If he said yes he'd have to eat quickly, because he didn't have all the time in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he decided, \"I can get something quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something quick' turned out to be a stack of pancakes with bacon and a couple fried eggs. It paled in comparison to the one-man feast Seth ordered for himself, but it was still a sizable meal when combined with the cereal and fruit he had already eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once he was sitting down, chatting with Seth - they had plenty of similar interests when it came to movies and music and video games, and a legitimate friendship had developed beyond the fact that they were neighbors - the earlier issue with his shirt and the matter of his rising weight receded from his thoughts. While he hadn't gone full-on native, Zack had reached the point where the blithe view of indulgence characteristic of Abercrombie was distorting his own view of his eating habits. It was the fact he was eating less than Seth that stuck out in his mind, not how much he was by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still conscious of the time, though. He had to excuse himself while Seth was still on his first course to make the bus and get to work on time. But as he shuffled out of the diner the heaviness in his belly was a mere pleasantness, the satisfaction of satiation, rather than the oppressive weight of overeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt normal to him, and when it came time for his lunch Zack tried to replicate the feeling, ordering a second burger to go with his large combo, and then a couple slices of pie for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone voice, subdued but not entirely absent, that had suggested watching what he ate and maybe being more active, spoke up again later in the day. It couldn't make itself heard around mealtime, but when Zack was getting dressed, undressed or just letting his mind wander during the later afternoon slump at work it had more success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were other voices it had to contend with. Voices advocating pleasure, voices downplaying his weight gain, voices pointing out that he didn't stand out at all in this city.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If Zack had needed his girlfriend to point out her own 'ripening' under Abercrombie's influence, it wasn't just because he had been so focused on the changes to his own eating habits as of late. The scene of him struggling to get his pants buttoned had been recreated by Alice with certain variations. The chief one being that while her wardrobe had its share of button-down shirts and pants, it also had enough dresses, blouses, skirts and leggings to allow her to avoid her own battles of sucking in her middle and tugging the waistband or hem to cover herself. She hadn't failed to notice how less flowing certain garments were, or how more snug others felt, but it was easy to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier, actually, when compared to Zack's internal monologues. Maybe it was because Alice was primed to be less shaken by issues of weight (having dealt with them, in one form or another, more than her beau), or maybe she was more receptive to her self-directed assurances that a few pounds was nothing to fret over/this was only temporary/it looked good on her. Again, this could tie in to her greater experience with fluctuating weight, a positive side-effect to help balance the ledger after years of eyeing the number on the scale for herself or her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA possible third option was that something fundamental inside her had shifted, with the milestone of moving to a new city, moving in with her boyfriend, putting some distance between her and her mother AND finding herself in a city with a far more body-positive culture than she was used to all coming together to liberate her of conventional standards of beauty and the self-recrimination she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking backwards at the reason(s) wasn't on Alice's mind, so let's not devote too much time to it ourselves. Alice herself wasn't even thinking about the change to her behavior too much; school and life with Zack was more than enough to keep her occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't blind to the changes of her appetite, nor its effects. When she was at a study session or ordering the full combo at lunch she knew she was eating more than she used to. More than she needed, and sometimes more than she actually wanted. It was in social settings that this latter incident happened; being with her study buddies or meeting up with Tess on campus, she fell into the habit of grazing just because everyone around her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even by herself Alice had taken to letting loose with her appetite as a matter of fact. On those increasingly rare moments when she had a moment of guilt or second-guessing she had no trouble justifying herself; she needed to get her money's worth, this place just had large portions, she didn't want to seem like a killjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through her first semester she wasn't calling up these rationalizations. Zack still grappled with his desire to indulge because on a certain level his coworkers were potential rivals and how he carried himself in the office reflected on him in a very serious way, but Alice didn't have such worries on campus. Her enthusiasm for food and drink endeared her to most people, and the general loosening up she had experienced made her more approachable and open. She still covered her mouth when she had to burp (she was a lady, after all), but she had a relaxed vibe most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it wasn't a shocking turn when it was Alice who ended up crossing the 200-pound mark first, despite Zack's lead on her at the start of this impromptu race. Calorie-rich meals at the campus quad and regular study sessions accompanied by rounds of snacks or multiple pizzas had not just softened her frame but were thickening it steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as grown her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Zack. We can't keep them waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice slapped her boyfriend playfully on the rump (a decidedly more padded rump than a couple months ago) as Zack struggled to pull the hem of his polo shirt over his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no rush,\" he grunted. \"They live next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm already hungry, and I've been craving Mexican all morning.\" She walked over to the closet and pulled a hockey jersey off a hanger. \"Here. Just wear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack groaned inwardly as he caught the jersey. The article was a remnant from his fat days, one of the few items he hadn't disappeared into a donation to Goodwill because he was a fan of the team and it made a good nightshirt during the warmer months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the polo wasn't going to do the job, sohe heeded his girlfriend's command and threw it on. The bottom hung down below his crotch, almost to his knees. He wasn't exactly swimming in it, though; you could easily see the rounding of his potbelly. A bit of insult to injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice didn't comment on his chunky physique, though. She didn't exactly have a leg to stand on, Zack mused, noticing how full her own rear and middle looked. And her breasts were filling out the top of her shirt nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why did women carry their weight so much better than men,' he asked himself as they made their way to Seth and Tess' apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also asked himself if heading to a Mexican buffet for lunch was the best idea when both of them were putting on weight, but it was too late to break off the lunch with their neighbors. And Zack himself was looking forward to a filling meal; trying to cut back had meant eating a small breakfast, not a satisfying one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was my problem. I should adjust my eating to 'enough' rather than limiting calories.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting tomorrow, he didn't include. But it would have to be so, because by the time the four neighbors got to the buffet thoughts of curbing his intake were drowned out by the rumbling of his stomach, made more intense by the aromatic smells filling the restaurant. If Zack could take any solace in his gorging at lunch it was that he didn't eat near as much as his neighbors (small comfort, given they were each three times as large as him) or even Alice. But that point of pride was undermined by the fact that he went back to the lines of steam trays twice after reaching satiation, as Alice wanted company as she went back and gone more food for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was four taut bellies that waddled back into the apartment complex, not three. Zack wasn't too hard on himself for giving in to temptation, but when the four of them squeezed into a single elevator, Seth and Tess' ponderous frames taking up most of the space, encroaching on Zack and Alice, he did chide himself that this performance can't be a regular thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If Alice and I were even half as big as those two,' he thought to himself 'We wouldn't all fit in here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight squeeze was forgotten by dinner, though. As Zack and Alice worked in the kitchen he let himself by talked into preparing more than the two of them really needed. And then once the dining table was filled with spaghetti in alfredo sauce, garlic bread, shrimp fettucine and gelato it was too easy to justify taking seconds, thirds, fourths and before he knew it there were no leftovers to put in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So today was a cheat day,' he told himself later. 'As long as this isn't a habit...'</span></div></div>",

As she turned around to sit on the couch next to him, he couldn't help checking out her growing butt. Since they'd arrived in Abercrombie - especially since they'd struck up a friendship with Tess and Seth - he and Alice had been eating more, and at least in Alice's case, it was adding nicely to her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially her butt curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Zack was different - except that, for him, it was the 'gut curve' where the change was most noticeable.  They were both definitely getting heavier. The first week, he hadn't noticed anything, then he'd suspected something as his jeans seemed to be gettting tighter - but a month in, Alice had gone clothes shopping for both of them. He was alarmed, briefly, because the two of them had worked hard to get thinner to move to Abercrombie - but when you spend your workday around people as fat as his coworkers, a \u2018normal\u2019 sized person looked skinny. He was, he knew, the slightest person on the hotel staff - and given that, even skinny, he wasn't small, that was saying something!  And he knew, from a few comments Alice had made, that she'd had the same situation in her classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was on campus \u2013 with its bevy of restaurants, most of them offering special meal deals for the cash-strapped students \u2013 for lunch five days a week - and he had the free employee buffet at the hotel for lunches.  Then, there were meals with their new friends Tess and Seth, which always seemed to go on all evening.  And he'd had a couple of weekend shifts, which included meals... and Alice had evening study sessions a couple of times a week, with snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no wonder that they both were 'growing', Zack realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't really discussed the situation, and Zack wondered if they should - or if he should just start hitting the gym at the hotel - also free to staff. Alice had gone out and adjust their clothes, and bought some new ones - but still, was she really OK with this change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should he just let sleeping dogs lie?</span></div></div>",

He had gotten the top ones done, but the bottom three had trouble meeting across his pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt wasn\u2019t new; the belly was. Since starting his new job Zack looked to have put on 15, maybe 20 pounds, most of it finding its way to his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that Zack was suddenly letting himself go now that they had started living together. For breakfast and dinner he kept to his normal routine, small meals with the occasional dessert before bed. Even when they went out and came upon one of the restaurants that offered jumbo portions for every dish \u2013 and more and more Alice was convinced that was EVERY restaurant in Abercrombie \u2013 he never ordered more than would suit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all respects, he seemed to be showing the same restraint and moderation Alice was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept... He had mentioned that the staff break room at the hotel was constantly filled with tempting treats. In-house stuff, made by the hotel\u2019s kitchen staff. Alice knew friends who said office breakrooms usually only had a single box of doughnuts every morning, but the way Zack described it there was a full spread of breakfast or lunch offerings throughout the day. Steam trays of bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs with peppers and onions, hush puppies. Platters of cold cuts and cheeses, bread and various condiments to the side. Potatoes au gratin or baked potatoes with cheddar, sour cream, and bacon on the side. All they needed was a carving station and it would be a small buffet, just for the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall wonder Zack didn\u2019t ever leave the building for lunch. It was just economic to accept the free food whenever he could, plus he wanted to get on good terms with his new coworkers, not appearing standoffish or rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she knew, Alice probably wouldn\u2019t agree that his attempts to ingratiate himself with everyone else required him to match them plate for plate, filling his belly past satiation. Maybe Zack wasn\u2019t aware of it himself. When everyone around you is eating, you\u2019re probably not watching your own plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking in his gut, Zack managed to get the final button done. He exhaled slowly, worrying about popping one or two off, then put on his suit coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater, babe.\u201d He kissed her on top of her head before leaving. As he walked away, Alice saw how the seat of his pants was clinging to his bottom just a little. He was softening up in more places than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be wrong of her to bring this up, she wondered. It was just a few pounds, and clearly he knew about it. But he had been fat before, he hadn\u2019t liked it, and he had put in so much work to lose the extra weight. What would happen if he kept gaining? What would that mean for his own self-image? He had just started a new job in an unfamiliar city, this wasn\u2019t the time or place to be developing any body image issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should say something, help him focus on keeping his weight down. Or would that seem like he was being attacked in his own house? That even his girlfriend was looking down on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice bit her lip. What was the right answer?</span></div></div>",

She discovered Zack brushing his teeth, wearing his undies and a small T-shirt displaying his newly minted pooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack spit into the sink and set down his brush. \"Hey hon. How'd you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I slept alright even though you nearly pushed me off the bed in your sleep at around four in the morning.\" Alice teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn, sorry hon. If I were awake I might have been able to stop it, maybe.\" He grinned mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rolled her eyes jokingly, and then fixed them at Zack's tummy which definitely has begun to swell these past few weeks. It wasn't anything major by any means, but certainly noticeable when he was scantily clad. His slightly hardened and edged figure has been sanded off somewhat. His thighs were also starting to expand. Like most of his body, they still had some tone, but were softened and wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When does your second class start?\" Zack enquired while washing off his toothbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was thrown from her stupor. \"Oh, it starts at 11:30.\" She replied. \"What are you doing up so early? Don't you have a day off today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran into Seth and Tess when I came home from work yesterday. They invited me over to their place to watch the game at around noon. Thought I'd get up early and make sure I don't look like I slept in a dumpster.\" Zack grabbed a comb and began to rub it through his bed head. \"Are you alright with me heading over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice gave a genuine smile. \"Oh sure! I'm glad you're making new friends, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. They're some odd birds but when you come down to it they're really fucking hospitable. By the way they said if you get home before I leave their place, they said you're free to come over if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll probably do that if I get out of my last class ahead of schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice wish she hadn't lied.

Lunch is almost ready.\" Tess said as she led Zack into her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, neighbor!\" Seth greeted and lazily waved. The vastly overfed college boy was sitting in a love seat facing the TV with his back facing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yourself. Sorry I'm a little late.\" Zack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it! Just take a seat and Tess here will bring out lunch in a sec.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tess waddled to the kitchen, Zack contemplated where he was going to take his seat. It appeared to Zack that the massive couple moved around the furniture a bit since the last time he visited. He noticed two sofas facing across each other and perpendicular to the TV as well as Seth's love seat.<br>\r\nAs Zack strolled over to the sofa to the left of the TV, Seth lurched up at an alarming pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah! Not there!\" Seth gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was taken aback at Seth's sudden protest. \"Jesus man, is the couch cursed or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tess and I broke it the other day. Sorry I don't mention it before. I clearly should have done that as soon as you got hear.\" Seth then sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you guys do to kill the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess strolled in holding two full platters and some empty plates. \"You wouldn't wanna know.\" She grinned and looked at her elephantine beau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess set down the platters on the coffee table. The platters held two different types of which both looked like something out of a fancy, trendy, and expensive restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so on the left I made arugula, gruyere, and Dijon mustard burgers while on the right I made mozzarella, basil, and tomato burgers. Why don't you big boys dig in while I finish up the hot dogs and fries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Zack promptly began to pile burgers onto their plates. Tess toasted the buns perfectly so the juices from the meat, cheese, and veggies didn't make the burger too soggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zack didn't even know where to start, Seth was getting to work. He balanced his plate on the little section of lap he had left while holding two burgers in both hands, alternating bites. <br>\r\nZack picked up the tomato basil burger first and took a sizable bite into it. Zack was instantly enamored with the sandwich, as it tasted much like a caprese salad in burger form. Zack then tried the arugula and Dijon burger. The plump young man found an equally as intoxicating experience in this burger, as the tang from the mustard harmonized beautifully with the peppery arugula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Seth and Zack were digging in to what they already had, Tess soon returned with two huge serving platters filled with steak cut fries and hot dogs respectively. <br>\r\nTess lowered herself down to the right of Zack. Her massive thighs oozed outwards to the point where much of her left thigh met Zack's right. This made Zack slightly uncomfortable but he realized that she didn't notice so he brushed it off.<br>\r\nTess looked over at Zack and smiled when she saw how pleased he was to be stuffing himself with her creations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch was a slaughterfest for the spread Tess happily assembled. There wasn't much conversation between the trio and the game was only glanced at from time to time.<br>\r\nTess would occasionally walk into the kitchen to take away dishes and bring new servings out. She would also happily plop more food onto Seth and Zack's plates. From time to time she'd observe Zack eating and observing how he liked each dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around two hours the vast majority of the food was gone. Seth was leaning back, Zack was gently holding his stomach, and Tess was shifting her bulk to accommodate her newly stuffed tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, thanks for having me again. Today was a blast.\" Zack told the obese couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't leave yet!\" Tess cried. \"You haven't had dessert yet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sat up. \"Dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess lifted her immensity up and waddled to the kitchen. She soon returned with one final platter containing three huge chocolate souffl\u00e9s. Zack must have grown a second stomach as he was instantly peckish again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stood be the front door while Tess and Seth said their goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, thanks again for swinging by. It's always great to have company.\" Said Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please don't feel like you're being intrusive. Come by anytime you like! I always like cooking for someone who enjoys it.\" Tess remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll definitely drop by again when I'm not busy with work or spending time with Alice.\" Zack promised. \"So yeah! Take it easy you two. I don't wanna come back to another broken sofa. I don't think we could-\" Zack contemplated about joking not being able to fit all three of them on the remaining sofa, but decided against the joke in favor of good taste. \"-afford another one with our salaries between rent and school!\"<br>\r\nThis triggered a hearty laugh from Seth and a giggle from Tess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack walk back to and entered his apartment, aiming straight for the couch. He payed on his back and held his taut tummy in his hands while staring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout fifteen minutes after Zack returned, Alice unlocked the door and came in. \"Hey Zack, I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack slowly rose from the couch and stretched. \"Hey babe. How was school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay. Nothing really interesting happened.\" Alice took a good look at Zack and noticed his stuffed belly fighting against his shirt and what looked to be chocolate at the corner of his mouth. \"Did you have a good time with our neighbors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah! Tess made some bomb ass burgers. I had a freakin great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled. \"That's great!\" She walked over to her boyfriend and gave him a hug, feeling his belly pushing against her frame. She tucked her concerns in the very back of her mind, being more than content with the fact that Zack made some benevolent friendships.</span></div></div>",

Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling empowered - there was something she could do! - Alice dug out her tailor's tape and went to the closet and the dresser.  Taking out Zack's shirts and pants and jackets, she measured each, then put aside the smallest ones, and the ones she remembered seemed tightest.  Her sewing machine and sewing tools had come with her, and she set about adjusting Zack's clothes, the ones that would adjust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDress pants and even jackets were relatively easy, to an expert sewer, but the shirts were harder.

A month into his job at the Abercrombie Hammond Hotel - and a month into their 'agreement' about his weight gain - and Zack was looking really, really good, Alice thought.  Stretching in front of the mirror, the changes to his body over the last month were highlighted by the morning glow of sunrise pouring in through the windows - the heavier arms, the thicker pecs, the swelling belly, the bigger butt below - Zack was looking really good to Alice.  And, best of all, he seemed really happy - happy with himself, happy with the new job, and happy with her - very happy with her, as his performance in bed last night had demonstrated... Alice felt warm again just remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack moved away from the mirror and into the shower, as Alice slowly roused from bed.  He'd be putting on more of his 'adjusted' clothes this morning - she'd replaced several items yesterday for him, and the new, bigger than every royal blue shirt had been one of his picks for today.  Combined with the vest with the adjusted darts, and the dress pants with the adjusted waist, butt and thighs, Zack would look good today - like an old-fashioned innkeep, Alice thought, and that was the model she followed in working on all his clothes.  Zack had told her that several of the hotel staff, including his boss, Mr. Hammond, had told him how well he dressed and how he projected the right image for the hotel, and Alice had thrilled to the words of praise on her fashion abilities - it made up, a bit, for some of the frustrations and critiques of her work at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he toweled off, Alice got ready for her shower, and again took a moment to admire Zack's form.  Sigh.  She had seen him fat before, and had dieted with him to get 'thin' (or at least average) for the move to Abercrombie, but this thicker, heavier, fat-and-strong Zack was the best one yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still like?\" Zack asked, catching her staring at him.  He flexed an arm, making the muscle rise out of the layer of pudge, and Alice smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great!\" she replied, as Zack turned and stepped onto the scale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"225,\" he said and stepped off.  \"Wasn't I about 185 when we moved here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Alice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"40 pounds.  Well, at least it isn't all fat, like last time!\" Zack exclaimed.  He headed off to get dressed while Alice showered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a plate of the eggs he'd scrambled, Alice asked, \"So, what's on for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a convention arriving today,\" Zack replied, \"I might be a bit late getting away.

It wasn\u2019t the sort of thing he would turn up \u2013 even this long into their relationship he didn\u2019t take for granted that Alice was a physical person with a tangible body he could embrace and caress or just admire at any time \u2013 but lately he had been paying closer attention to it. First to confirm his suspicions, then to wrestle with his own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely getting heavier in the caboose. He had suspected it for a week, but it wasn\u2019t until a couple days ago that it was undeniable. It took him a while to even notice it, because after you spend a day around people as fat as his coworkers a \u2018normal\u2019 person looked even skinnier. But one he noticed her jeans hugging her tighter, or her skirts rising an inch higher on her legs, he saw it. And once he saw it he couldn\u2019t help but watch as it seemed to get even bigger. She wasn\u2019t Kardashian-sized or anything, but she was definitely bubbling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all he could do, watch. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess why she had been packing on a few pounds back there. Her class schedule fluctuated each day, but she was at the campus \u2013 with its bevy of restaurants, most of them offering special meal deals for the cash-strapped students \u2013 for lunch five days a week and breakfast three. And on Thursdays, when she got out of class at 6, she would grab dinner with some of her new friends. All of them, like Tess, \u2018full-bodied\u2019 representatives of Abercrombie. Eating with such unrepentant porkers, Alice had trouble saying no to an extra helping or some dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assumed Alice was aware of it. Shouldn\u2019t she know her underwear was being stretched out? And she hadn\u2019t worn any of her tight leggings in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing it up in conversation didn\u2019t strike Zack as the best approach. If she was somehow unaware of it pointing it out might make her feel foolish; how could she be blind to her own body? But if she did know she was probably working to fight it, and Zack didn\u2019t want to add to whatever embarrassment she was already feeling by coming across as critical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it just seemed better to say nothing and let Alice take care of it herself. She was a grown woman, and he wasn\u2019t so vain or shallow that he needed to pounce on her for letting herself slip a little. How would that look, him judging her for just a few extra pounds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was if he didn\u2019t like her new butt, which was about 180-degrees from the truth. He wasn\u2019t just scoping out her ass every chance he could now because he was a detached observer. He liked the little padding she had now, and if she somehow got even meatier back there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would she take it, though? Alice knew how predisposed to gaining she was, and she had worked hard to slim down and get this lean body. She wouldn\u2019t have just given up on that, would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here she was now, curled up next to him on the couch, with a big bowl of heavily buttered popcorn in front of her. Grabbing big handfuls, scarfing them down while her eyes were glued to the TV. Dinner hadn\u2019t been small, either. Zack wasn\u2019t up for more, but here she was snacking the night away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should say something...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then again, you know... he didn't <i>have</i> to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zack and Alice had met, they had both been pretty chubby. In fact, they had both been at their heaviest that fateful Summer; they fell in love despite their size, and had been together ever since. And even if they hadn't, it wasn't like Zack would never have fallen in love with Alice if she had kept her weight. Just like, he hoped, Alice would have still loved him if he was still fat. They would love each other, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut laying with her, feeling the roundness of her rump pressing against his lap as they spread across the couch, his hand wrapped around her soft waist as she continued to pick away at the bowlful of popcorn nestled in the crevice of her elbow, it felt... <i>visceral</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subtle squishiness of her modest pot-belly as he pressed his arm across her chest, the gentle but present firmness in the pit of her stomach. It was the only hint of a capacity that she had shown lately; without context, with her eagerness in picking and plucking from the bowl of popcorn, Alice may as well have been tiding off hunger until dinner. But dinner had already passed, and was quite intense. But there Alice went away, popping kernel after kernel into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunch munch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrunch crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack spread his fingers across the softening sphere of Alice's stomach as it eeked out from over the waistband of her pajama pants. It yielded to his slight touch, his hand sinking into the newfound flesh that had settled on his girlfriend's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had spent so long getting her weight under control. Granted, she faired better than some of the other girls that had graduated with her (Zack had been told) but it was still a somewhat tentative topic for her. She and Zack had slimmed down, together, and it had brought them closer. Even now, it brought them closer. Their mutual love of food was always a welcome topic at tables, diners and drive-thrus, as was the genuine concern of regaining their old weight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zack <i>knew</i> that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Alice shifted her position, resituating herself on the couch and nestling herself closer to him, Zack could feel the pressure of her big round ass grinding against his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Alice yelped in surprise, feeling a familiar, welcome resistance as she backed up, \"Baby? Are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's heart skipped a beat; it was like he'd been caught watching porn by his Mom or something. His blue eyes widened and his breathing quickened. He shied away instinctively, feeling guilt for his dirty thoughts. He loved Alice, and she was really sensitive about her weight. She had worked so hard. What kind of boyfriend fantasized about that kind of thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Zack admitted abashedly, retracting slightly, \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't apologize...\" Alice said with a wry little curl of her eyebrow, the traces of popcorn butter catching the light from the television as she smiled, \"I mean, unless you don't <i>like</i> it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Alice began to playful gyrate her wider hips and fuller rump against Zack's waist. He felt himself harden and his veins pulsate. Her butt was so round and big... and <i>squeezeable</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Alice yelped again as Zack suddenly grabbed the side of her thigh, \"What's gotten <i>into</i> you tonight, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what can I say?\" Zack said a little more confidently, \"Date nights are special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Alice slowly turned away from Zack; her lovely lower half reduced to an outline against the tv. Her soft pot belly pressed against his chest, her shirt having ridden up as she wriggled herself into a 180. Alice pressed herself firmly against her boyfriend, who reached around to grab ahold of the swollen set of cheeks behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recalled, vaguely, trying this out during the first few days of them dating. They had both been too big to do this comfortably. Any given roll or fold was in danger of flopping off of the couch and taking someone with it, or the poor couch itself with its groans of agony as they pressed more than a collective quarter-ton of teenager onto its frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were both small enough to pull the position off, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie you're gripping me really hard!\" Alice broke away to whimper, \"Go easy, okay? I have to sit on that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure!\" Zack said with a nod, \"U-Uh, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't he stop thinking about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's eyes travelled to the coffee table, where Alice's first choice of date for the night, the bowl of popcorn, sat neglected. It was bathed in the glow of the television, as if it were watching them make out on the couch enviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why couldn't he stop thinking about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's booty was so big. Not like it was when she was younger, though. Alice had really grown and matured, and something about seeing her bubble butt fill out the seat of her pants, swishing and bumping with her every step, it made Zack crazy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't help but think...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovebirds ground and geared against each other for a while, sucking face and exploring their respective anatomies. They gave each other one of those little looks; it was completely unspoken, but there was a mutual agreement between them that this conversation would be better suited for the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice hopped off of her boyfriend, all giggly and excited, Zack took a swat at her butt, noticing with much appreciation at how much <i>more</i> jiggle there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if it were <i>bigger</i>?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her body is starting to grow pear-shaped, and her most prominent part was her big behind.

Not wanting to disappoint them, Zack and Alice decided to go and celebrate with them. When the couple arrived at the restaurant they easily noticed Seth and Tess among other obese and fat people and sat nearby them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday Tess\" Alice said as she sat down. \"So how old are you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since your curious, I just turned 23!\" Tess replied, while holding up and reading a menu. \"And if your wondering, you don't have to worry about paying, since this meal is on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more chatting, Zack and Alice noticed some good changes from when they first met the two. While Seth only seemed to gain 10 pounds and had a slightly bigger, yet still huge stomach, Tess looked obviously bigger than when they first met her a bit over two months ago. Her huge body, reaching almost 660 pounds, was barely able to fit into the booth seat she was using, and she looked a bit stuck in her booth seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of Tess's added weight went to her monumental behind and thighs, of which both cheeks together was humongous and could probably be touched from the other side of the table where Zack and Alice sat. Her stomach also was noticeably bigger and covered some parts of her part of the table. The rest of her body seemed to be slightly bigger as well, and because of her size Zack and Alice were a bit worried about if she could get out after she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all four finished ordering their meals, with Seth and Tess ordering 1 of everything each, Zack ordering some burgers and some fries, and Alice, after talking and asking with Zack, got quite a lot of burgers and a few milkshakes from the dessert menu. All four of them ate through their orders rather quickly, and while Zack was full after he was done, Alice still had quite a bit of room and after seeing their neighbors ordering most of the milkshake flavors and some ice cream for dessert, Alice decided to get dessert as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tess do you mind if I can try some of your smoothies?\" Alice said while her neighbors were chugging down on their desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course Alice!\" Tess said in between milkshakes. \"I can always get more to go so go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was able to have three more milkshakes before Alice was finally full, and after a hour, Seth and Tess were also finally stuffed as well. \"Thanks for the meal\" Zack said while helping Seth up from his seat. \"I hope we can do stuff like this next year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your welcome\" Seth said. \"It was nice eating with you, and I think that your roommate is finally starting to get her Abercrombie appetite!\" Alice blushed at that a bit while trying to help the immensely heavy Tess up.</span></div></div>",

While Tess finally got out, Alice noticed that the table was bent around a bit where Tess was sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day after her classes, Alice decided to talk about the incident with Tess at her house. \"About yesterday,\" Alice said, \"I'm so sorry for you that you got stuck yesterday. Does this happen regularly for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, it happens sometimes, but not usually\" Tess said, in between bites of some ice cream that she was having as a 'snack'. \"A few of these stores are built in Abercrombie, but most of the time I eat at local restaurants, which usually have seats for people like me. I can show you if you want tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am a bit busy,\" Alice said while grabbing a scoop from Tess's 'snack' for herself. \"But I think I can cross a few things off my list make some time. Where should we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we should go to Pizzalini's. It's been open from when I was just a kid, and it serves the best deep dish I've ever tasted. Well I'll see you at 5 there if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Alice said, making a mental note to figure out the place before tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, after school, Alice met up with Tess at Pizzalini's as they planned, and Alice was surprised at what she saw. She saw booths that were quite a bit bigger than the booth Tess got stuck in two days ago, and she saw massive chairs which when Tess sat down in one when the two got in, she learned they were much sturdier than the chairs she saw at Buttercombe, as one of them could hold up someone as massive as her neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, what did I tell you Alice,\" Tess said while making a big order of 4 deep dish pizzas for herself and a extra one for Alice. \"I told you that it was a rare occurrence. Abercrombie definitely has huge people, and they definitely know how to take care of them with seats like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am kind of suprised of this, but I guess this is what it's like in here.\" Alice replied.

It was a month since she and Tess started hanging out, and it was starting to show well on Alice and her now 243 pound frame. Her behind was now starting to get pretty big, and the slightest movement would get her behind bouncing. Her stomach was also getting pretty worse as well, and the rest of her body was starting to swell up a bit with fat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zack, do you mind if I borrowed your sweatpants?\" Alice asked. Her boyfriends sweatpants was from when the couple were dieting to try to get slim after graduating, and while Zack barely used them anymore, Alice occasionally wore them when she needed to get new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Zack replied. \"And if your leaving, when you get home I'll have some meatloaf ready for you when you get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Alice then put on the old pair, which was a bit tight on her fat butt, and finished clothing herself for the day.

Her titanic behind was so big Alice thought that she could probably sleep on it, and it had a hard time going through her own front door despite it's width. Her belly was also huge and was bulging two feet past her body.

Staring at herself in the mirror Alice begins to note all the new and yet familiar transformation of her body. With only a black bra and panties on everything was on display. Fat oozed over her panties as Alice's stomach reached down to the top of her thighs. While not as large as the rest of her body Alice's breasts strained against the confines of her already tight bra. Continuing to stare at her fattened figure, Alice sighs as she notes the stark contrast in color between her black undergarments and her pale flesh. Moving her hands towards her large stomach, Alice pats it causing it to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack's not the only one gaining weight...\" Alice relents, staring at her expansive bottom heavy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the closet Alice looks at her options for clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what to wear?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a bright green sleeveless formal dress from when her and Zack finished their weight loss journey. Both Zack and Alice attended a dance in Daven's Port to celebrate their success in accomplishing what seemed to be an impossible task. The green dress has black frills at the bottom and a black pattern on the left and right side of waist area on the dress. This pattern was meant to accentuate Alice's slim curves from that time, however, it may do more than just that now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's mind began to race debating on whether or not to put on the dress, \"What would Zack think of it?\" was the main question that was going on through Alice's head. She was quite aware at this point about the weight she has gained, it would be impossible not to notice it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meatloaf is almost ready!\" Zack shouted from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be there in a second!\" Alice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice decided to do it anyways and quickly took the dress off of the coat hanger. Struggling to slide on the bright green formal dress, Alice somehow managed to get it on. Even though it felt incredibly tight Alice decided to go through with wearing it anyways. Quickly, before leaving, Alice decided to look at her reflection in the mirror. This dress was more than just unflattering per se, before leaving to go to Abercrombie this dress was able to reach to the bottom of her legs. Now, it merely just goes to the top of her thighs. Additionally, her arms looked like pale white sausages as do to her even chunkier legs. Not to mention, the black pattern on the waist of the dress makes Alice's stomach look like a massive sphere of fat as it threatens to burst out of the fancy dress. Feeling the cool air from the air conditioner on her backside, Alice turns around to look at her plentiful bottom and the dress barely covers it with her pale ass mostly on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back around to look into the mirror, Alice begins to feel her curves and grabs a handful of fat from her gut and shakes in in irritation, making her whole body jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Grrrrr</i>, maybe this was a bad idea...\" Alice mutters to herself as she looks down at her plump figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meatloaf is ready!\" Zack shouts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously looking at herself in the mirror one last time, Alice takes a deep breath as she steps out of the bedroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Annnnnnd</b></i><br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice's jaw dropped as she stepped into the kitchen. There's way more food than just meatloaf, an assortment of grains, meats, vegetables and other delicious foods spread out on their table which had two candles lit on each end. While Alice was in her awe struck state, Zack gawked at her curvaceous form which was on full display in her tight green dress. Eventually, both of them snapped out of their collective trance and made their way to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, how did you manage to make this much food...\" Alice muttered in disbelief as both her and Zack sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't make all of it. Some of it was from work events, they have been feeding us pretty well lately...\" Zack noted while briefly looking at his own smaller yet noticeable gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grumble</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it was almost on cue, both of their stomachs began to grumble. Alice began to blush and Zack laughed awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like our stomachs want us to start eating.\" Zack stated pointing out the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded and leaned over to reach for some food making her plush gut push itself into the table. Zack began to grab some food himself but not nearly as much as Alice, it looked like she had grabbed at least one of everything on the table. Considering how much time Alice has spent with Tess simply just eating non stop this amount of food was child's play. It's not like she was going to go beyond a single plate right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice began to feel as if something was missing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zack?\" Alice exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Zack looked up with his for and knife already in a piece of meatloaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have anything to drink with all this food?\" Alice asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Pfffffft</i>, what do you think I am some kind of idiot?\" Zack stated jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaaybeeee...\" Alice said giggling in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, you wont be laughing once you see what I brought home!\" Zack claimed bombastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack got up from the table, leaving Alice for a minute as she listened to the various sounds of objects getting moved around from their bedroom. Alice's stomach began to rumble again, making her look down and grab her fatty stomach rolls in retaliation in an effort to make it stop. Not long after Zack returned with a bottle of wine prompting Alice to stop grabbing her adipose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, please don't tell me that you bought that.\" Alice said with a concerned tone, \"What would we do for rent or food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you got the wrong idea. I got this the same way that I got the food, and that's through events at work.\" Zack said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed in relief, and with that the two lovebirds began their feast. With haste, Alice began stuffing food in her mouth and washing it down with the fancy red wine that Zack had brought home. Originally, Alice started off with the meatloaf considering how much effort Zack put into making it, but then she began eating the mac and cheese, then the mashed potatoes and the sausages. It just didn't seem to end as Alice kept on gorging herself with the various different foods. Her stomach began to strain the confines of her dress as it bloated more and more after each plate and glass of wine.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nUrrrrrrrp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice burped as she continued to eat. Zack felt something harden as he watched with bliss as his formerly thin girlfriend's inner glutton took over her senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, really like your dress. It looks really good on you.\" Zack exclaimed while Alice stuffed a roll into her mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, thanks it's been a while since the last time I have worn it...\"  Alice grunted leaning back in her chair to make more room for her expanding gullet as she rubbed her hands against it's taut form,\"As you can see it doesn't exactly fit too well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them continued to eat as the night went on, Alice more so than Zack. However, with his new gains Zack was definitely no slouch but he definitely didn't hold a candle to his thickening girlfriend. Despite not being as large, Alice's appetite clearly matched that of Tess from when they had dinner together for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huff, Huff<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAlice gasped for air after each bite of food not wanting to stop, at this point her dress had maneuvered it's way to the bottom of her stomach as it pushed out from all the food. As she went to grab more food, Alice belched as her hands found nothing. Confused, Alice's eyes wandered the table to see that all the food is gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, where is the rest of the food?\" Alice drunkenly moaned patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack unbuttoned his pants and sighed in relief feeling his own stuffed abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we may have ate it all...\" Zack relented,\"But fear not I got us dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully standing up, Zack walked over to the fridge and took out a dark chocolate cake. Walking over to the kitchen cabinets, Zack began to grab some plates and silverware. Alice looked at Zack with lust, despite him not cooking all the food he truly put a lot of thought into tonight and for that she truly loved him. Not to mention he's been getting pretty pudgy himself lately. Did she like that? Alice wasn't sure, but hell, the buttoned shirt that he's wearing definitely wasn't fitting like it used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Zack made his way back to the table then placing the cake in it's center. Alice attempted to lean in to cut herself a slice but her stomach met the table before she could effectively preventing her from reaching any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urmph, Sweetie can you cut me a slice?\" Alice asked twiddling with her blonde hair seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you beautiful.\" Zack said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack began to cut Alice a large piece of cake then placing it on a plate and handing it over to Alice who eagerly accepted it. Alice took a bite, it tasted amazing and the frosting on it was no joke either. The couple began eating their respective pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a while they both...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first the couple only had a slice or two from the large dense cake. But as the night went on, the effects from the previous meal and a few slices of chocolatey goodness began to take their toll on Zack and Alice. Both began to eat slower and slower. Alice, who's absolutely stuffed began to caress her bulbous gut feeling the sleek texture of her dress as her stomach strained against it. Zack, wincing follows suit and begins to do the same with his own taut stomach mimicking his plush girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huff Huff</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can eat anymore...\" Alice moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huff Huff</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, watch this.\" Zack picks up a forkful of gooey cake and slowly puts it in his mouth. Zack winces as he struggles to chew the baked good before finally gulping it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice watches Zack's endeavor with a remorseful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Urp</i>, maybe I can help.\" Alice drunkenly exclaimed struggling to speak from the pure overload of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack watched in lust as the self indulgent Alice struggled to escape her seat. Noticing her predicament, Alice realized that she couldn't stand up naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to require a bit of effort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice began to brace herself.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n1,2,3</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice with all her effort pushed her seat back causing her stomach to surge outward making her pale generous gut peak out of the bottom of the forest green dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice slowly wobbled towards the stuffed boyfriend, Zack took the moment to examine his girlfriend's plentiful features. Before dinner the dress was already a bit too tight on Alice. However, now it just looked ridiculous on her. Features that were previously hidden on Alice were now on full display such as her meaty thighs rubbing together as she walked. Additionally, her plump ass jiggled with each step no longer concealed. Not to mention, the black pattern on the hip portion of the dress was stretched beyond belief accentuating her expansive gut/bottom heavy figure. It's a miracle that the dress hasn't ripped yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple tiredly grinned at each other as Alice moved the cake to a more accessible spot for the two of them. Once the plump blonde finished her trek...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" A surprised Zack exclaimed as a rotund Alice plopped herself on his lap making the chair creak from under the two rotund lovers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Are you okay Zack?\" Alice still wasn't completely used to her returned girth. Well, it hasn't fully returned, but Alice knew that if she kept going at this pace all that fat was going to be back in no time. But at the moment she was more worried about her bloated boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I should be okay.\" Zack huffed. \"Just a heads up would be nice next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed in relief. However, she was still worried about crushing Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too heavy for you am I?\" Alice relented with a pout. \"I could get off, and maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're perfect!\" Zack protested, catching Alice off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect? Is that what being fat meant to Zack? Alice wasn\u2019t sure what to think about this, but she definitely liked the way that Zack was clearly enjoying her body. Even if she felt like she was a tub of lard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect huh?\" Alice coed, as she began to move her finger up and down Zack\u2019s dress shirt feeling the roundness of his stuffed stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, I meant what I said.\u201d A clearly flustered Zack said in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice began to unbutton Zack\u2019s shirt staring at the damage that\u2019s been done to his body as she went along. Zack had clearly gained a little bit of weight earlier from the small amount of pudge that had gathered in his stomach. However, it may be a little more than just a \u201csmall amount of pudge'' after tonight\u2019s large feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in and pushing her globular stomach up against Zack, a stuffed Alice took another forkful of cake plopping it into his mouth. Zack followed suit and started doing the same to Alice. Overall, this was a slow process for the expanding couple, as the two were already more than adequately stuffed past their brink. This was especially noticeable with Alice who looked almost cartoonish being crammed into her old dress. Who knows how much longer it will last for? Probably not too long as her blubber seeped from any area where it could free itself from the dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing how much the dress was restricting her movements, Alice opted to take it off. While removing the dress, Alice could feel the cold air immediately hit her plump frame. Alice\u2019s expansive belly plopped out of the dress pushing against Zack\u2019s bloated gut once more. Now, finally free from the ill fitted dress, the fruits of Alice\u2019s gluttony were now out in plain sight for Zack to see. Alice\u2019s breasts have grown bigger the past few months spilling out of the blonde's black bra barely being contained. Alice's boobs rested upon her bloated belly, which truly is a sight to behold as it jiggled with each small movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alice began to feel something grow at the bottom of Zack's pants touching the bottom of her stomach. Despite large stomachs blocking the view of the bulge, this was a very familiar sensation to the two of them. The young blonde couple looked at each other blushing as their faces turned beat red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-want to finish the cake on the couch?\u201d Alice sheepishly asked as she stroked Zack's belly. \u201cIt would be more comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack nodded eagerly in response. Cake in hand, and not even bothering to grab a fork, the two helped each other to the living room couch. Alice plopped onto the couch making her whole body jiggle in response to the sudden increase in movement. Resting the cake on a coffee table next to the couch, Zack slowly climbed on top of his bottom heavy girlfriend. A few moments later both Alice and Zack began alternating between shoveling the dense chocolate cake into the other's mouth, and making out slowly but passionately. Their stomachs pushed together as Zack's bloated gut drooped down pushing into the much larger belly. Zack grabs two large handfuls of cake, a wide eyed Alice weakly opens her mouth eagerly waiting to receive the chocolate dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice felt like an oversized chipmunk as Zack began cramming the cake into her mouth. Once Alice finished chewing and gulping down her food she let out a light burp followed by a sigh of relief. Normally, an action like this would make Alice red with embarrassment, but after all that food and wine she didn't really seem to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, Zack how often does your work give out food?\" Alice inquired before once again burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty often, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason I guess.\" Alice lied while patting her expansive middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour goes by and piece by piece the couple manages to polish off the rest of the cake. Not long after, both were fast asleep on the couch bloated. Alice and Zack were covered only by their undergarments and various chocolate debris scattered about. Zack\u2019s head rested upon Alice\u2019s swollen belly using it as a massive pillow as she rubbed the edges of it in a sleep induced haze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the night, Alice briefly woke up and looked down at her boyfriend who was still very much asleep. A soft smile formed on Alice\u2019s face as she is appreciative of what she has. Sure, she was getting fat\u2026 okay maybe she was starting to get a bit more than fat, but you know what? It\u2019s worth it. She has a great boyfriend, a roof to sleep under and what feels like an everlasting supply of food provided by Abercrombie. Worst case scenario she could always go on another diet kick with Zack\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s also been a few weeks since the couple's first stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right <i>first</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack continued working at Hammond Hotel in Abercrombie he learned quickly that being a manager has its benefits. One of which is that he gets to decide what happens to all of the leftovers after work events. Initially Zack thought that this was a good way to encourage Alice\u2019s weight gain. However, despite being correct with that assumption and successfully plumping up his blonde girlfriend there\u2019s been a few side effects\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack is <i>chubby</i> now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a normal chubby, but properly chubby. His pants don\u2019t fit anymore and neither does his work shirts. Thankfully since he\u2019s the manager, Zack was able to grab a work uniform that fits a lot more comfortably without anyone noticing. Well, someone has been noticing. Alice has been stroking his stomach a lot lately. An area in which all of Zack\u2019s weight tends to settle. He wasn\u2019t quite sure if this was a good thing or a bad thing. Whenever Alice did pay attention to his larger features he didn\u2019t think too much about it though, mostly because Alice has grown quite considerably in a short amount of time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Zack egging her on with all the food from Hammond Hotel in addition to limitless access to the cafeteria at ASU Alice has blown up in size. When the couple arrived in Abercrombie Alice felt like a twig compared to her classmates, but that has changed. At this point most people would honestly think that Alice was native to Abercrombie, she wasn\u2019t nearly as big as most of the town's population but is by no means small. Alice\u2019s dress size has gone up considerably and it has become increasingly difficult to fit into some of her clothes. Thankfully, with her major being in fashion design it\u2019s been quite easy to replace a lot of her former clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple also continued their friendship with Seth and Tess, yet another reason for their weight gain. Double dates have become a tradition among the four of them. Most of the time they consist of going to restaurants and getting greasy high calorie foods. Finding a table that fits the four of them has become an issue though. Seth and Tess are large even by Abercrombie standards and are clearly gaining even more weight. With all four of them gaining weight the top half of their belly fat tends to stick out past the table as the table pushes into their abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the increase in their respective sizes they were happy, and that\u2019s all that mattered to Zack and Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell and food of course.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\nHot steam rose out of the shower in the couples bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack scrubbed himself clean under the shower head making sure nothing was missed. He made sure to get under the pooch of his stomach, something new and yet very familiar to him. Satisfied with his shower, Zack turned off the water and grabbed a towel to dry himself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping a towel around his waist, Zack stepped out of the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey handsome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hair tied back in a bun, Alice stood in front of the mirror with only her panties on as she began to fasten on a dark blue bra. Her large pale stomach hanged down a considerable bit which Zack\u2019s eyes zeroed in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning babe\u201d Zack said, still focusing on his plump girlfriend\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looks over to Zack noticing his stare and a playful smile forms on her face. This has become a habit of his during their morning routine, one Alice has accepted and finds adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking at this?\u201d Alice asked, playfully grabbing a handful of lower belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's face turned red knowing he got caught in the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Zack said with an embarrassed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice walks over giving Zack a peck on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Alice said giving Zack a playful wink \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sighs in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Alice says deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's heart starts racing again wondering what his girlfriend is going to say. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe have been putting on a lot of weight lately.\u201d Alice states, then proceeding to give her doughy middle a light pat making it jiggle slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Zack makes a disgruntled noise as his gut is clearly disproportionately larger than the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see what you mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even been here for a full two months yet and look how big we are getting\u2026\u201d Alice begins pulling up her panties over her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how much weight we have gained\u2026\u201d Zack says thinking to himself, still staring at his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little light bulb goes off in Alice\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing we got a new scale!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a new what?\u201d Zack looks at Alice confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember how our scale was broken and we got rid of it a few weeks back?\u201d Alice asks a confused Zack, \u201cIt was saying that my weight was much higher than it actually was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a forgetful boy, it took Zack a second to remember why they threw out the scale. Mel gave it to Alice before they moved. Which explains why it never worked and always gave really off numbers. Alice was still pretty fat but not as fat as the former scale was claiming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh okay, I remember now.\u201d Zack says nodding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice walks over to one of the bathroom cabinets pulling out a new digital scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Mom being the way she is sent us a new one in the mail.\u201d Alice relents, \u201cBut at least we\u2019ll know what our weight is now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice places the scale down in a convenient position in the bathroom as the two look at it with apprehension. Zack gulps and decides to lead the charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go first I guess.\u201d Zack states walking towards the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack steps on expectantly staring at it\u2019s screen as it begins calculating numbers. Being a shorter guy, Zack weighed only 145 pounds when the two moved in. He could only guess what he weighed now looking at how the numbers were climbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>145 lbs, 149 lbs, 152 lbs, 158 lbs, 164 lbs, 170 lbs<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe numbers begin to stop before finally landing on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>172 lbs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale stops at 172 and Zack just looks at it stunned. He\u2019s gained almost 30 pounds in two months. Zack may not be the smartest guy but he knew that if this keeps up he\u2019s going to catch up to his girlfriend in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof, that\u2019s not good.\u201d Zack mumbles to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alice is filled with fear. Not because of her boyfriend's recent gain, but because if he gained that much weight... then her gain is going to be massive. Not to mention, guessing at how the number started at 145 for Zack, it looks like Alice\u2019s Mom put their \"original\" weight into the scale before sending it out. Obviously this was her mother's way of making her more health conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice takes a deep breath and finally steps on the scale\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>140 lbs, 152 lbs, 166 lbs, 184 lbs, 198 lbs, 204 lbs, 210 lbs, 212 lbs<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nFinally, the scale began to slow down before revealing Alice\u2019s weight... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>215 lbs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice took a moment to just stare and process that number and for good reason, she gained 75 pounds. Not only that but she\u2019s over 200 pounds, that\u2019s huge... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter processing their weight Alice looks over to Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZ-Zack?\u201d Alice muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Zack asks looking at Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got fat.\u201d Alice mumbled silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuup, I think we did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gurgle</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked down at her plush stomach which seems to have a mind of its own now. Letting out an annoyed groan, Alice began to caress her belly trying to keep it from complaining any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it wants breakfast.\u201d Alice joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine too\u2026\u201d Zack said patting his gut, \u201cI\u2019ll go make us some food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth kissed as Zack left the bathroom to make a hearty breakfast. Alice stayed and struggled to pull up a pair of jeans over her rotund rear before giving in and wearing a large skirt instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after they quickly stuffed themselves with waffles, bacon and eggs. With that out of the way, Alice got ready for class and Zack got ready for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow for the rest of the day? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite his eventful morning, Zack felt that the day would just continue as normal. Well this wasn\u2019t exactly the case\u2026 as soon as he entered the hotel something abnormal came up. Marianne Foster, the concierge excitedly told him that Dean Hammond had an announcement to make and all staff were to meet in the conference room on the top floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, since Zack was alerted before most people about the meeting he was able to snag a seat in the conference room with Marianne before anyone else. Despite the room being fairly large with a long table to match it was being filled with people that were quite big which left little space and a certain amount of people standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne twiddled with her red hair deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this is about us getting new uniforms.\u201d Marianne exclaimed, \u201cMine has been getting pretty tight lately\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked over to Marianne who was munching on a donut, he could definitely see what she meant as her plush stomach spilled out of the waistband of her pants. Her pale white flesh could also be seen peeking out between the buttons on her work shirt. Zack figured it must have been a struggle for her to put her work clothes on in the morning. Hell, everyone was probably having trouble with their uniform. Ever since he started working here his co workers were getting pretty chunky, well chunkier than they already were. All that extra food from events has to go somewhere and it may as well be the gullets of hardworking Hammond Hotel employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being rather plump Marianne was also pretty attractive by conventional means too. Having a rather plump but pretty face she very much had a \u201cgirl next door\u201d aesthetic going for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who has been struggling with their uniform\u2026\u201d Zack exclaimed patting his chubby gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well you got an excuse Romeo.\u201d Marianne joked, \u201cPeople usually gain weight when they\u2019re in love, but me on the other hand\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne gestured to her food and then her plump stomach. Both Zack and Marianne chuckled at her ridiculousness. Despite not having the most authoritative position within the staff of Hammond Hotel, Marianne was definitely the heart of the place. She knew every name of each person that was considered staff and went out of her way to get to know everyone pretty well. Considering that Zack was not from Abercrombie, Marianne went out of her way to befriend him in an attempt to be nice. Since then the two often spent time hanging out during breaks just shooting the breeze and talking about random things so she was well aware of Zack\u2019s life beyond work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe and Alice weighed ourselves this morning\u2026\u201d Zack said, continuing the discussion of weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph, how did that go?\u201d Marianne asked while chewing on a chocolate glazed donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how Alice feels... but we are both getting pretty fat.\u201d Zack explained, \u201cI managed to get all the way up to 170\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne finished chewing and paused to think thoughtfully for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be honest with you Zack, most people who end up living here in Abercrombie get pretty large\u2026\u201d Marianne stated, \u201cBut to tell you the truth, if you two lovebirds keep gaining weight at the pace you are now you'll be just as heavy as the <i>REAL BIG FOLK </i>who live here\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we'll just have to be careful then...\u201d Zack said while grabbing a boston cream donut from the center of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, it's only been a few months and you're already twenty pounds away from weighing more than me.\u201d Marianne exclaimed giving her pudgy stomach a quick pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack opened his mouth to respond but the chatter in the room became silent. Dean sluggishly entered the room and sat in his fancy chair at the end of the table. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nCreaaaaaak<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe Chair struggled to contain the pure girth of this man. Dean was certainly the heaviest there, probably because of all the benefits he receives as senior manager and being a part of the Hammond family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope everyone is feeling good today!\u201d Dean said cheerfully, \u201cI have some announcements that I need to make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared curiously at him in anticipation. Dean wasn\u2019t typically one for \u201cpublic\u201d announcements, he usually just sent out an email which fit his lifestyle a lot better as he spent most of his time sitting in his office eating or chewing on something at a corporate meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst thing, everyone is getting a new redesigned uniform!\u201d Dean exclaimed proudly, \u201cIt\u2019s important that we keep things fresh as we, uhhhh, grow as a business!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to clap and chatter amongst themselves pleased. Looking around the room Zack noticed how many people were having wardrobe malfunctions similar to Marianne\u2019s<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Grow as a business</i>?\u201d Marianne mockingly whispered to Zack, \u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to say that we\u2019re all getting too fucking fat from the amount of food they give us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nDean looked around the room pleased that his workers were happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I still have one more announcement I need to make!\u201d Dean piped up recapturing the room\u2019s attention, \u201cWe are going to be hosting a new event here at Hammond Hotel, <i>bigger</i> than our normal one\u2019s and it\u2019s\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Primarily being that it was going to span a weekend, they have to treat the celebrities right, and each day was going to have a main event to cap off the evening. Friday is a cosplay fashion show, Saturday is a concert and Sunday is a cosplay banquet. Zack had never been to a comic convention before, so most of this information was pretty new to him. However, Marianne seemed very interested. She leaned in infatuated with the news, her plush midsection rested comfortably on the table's surface as it spilled out of her waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack never really pictured Marianne to be the kind of person that would be interested in geek culture. He was interested in the idea of an Abercrombie Comic-Con himself but only due to his inexperience with such events. He also thought that a Comic-Con could prove beneficial to Alice, considering she wants to be a fashion designer this could be an opportunity for her. Cosplay does technically fall into that category...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Zack refocuses himself back onto Dean as he continues to explain the event. He didn't want to get too lost in thought. Especially considering the fact that this new event meant more work for him\u2026<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\nAn hour of Dean talking concludes as he begins to finish discussing his final points. Marianne and Zack are full to the brim with donuts. From what Zack understood Dean tended to over-explain things, so whenever he held a meeting people made it worth their time. Which could be seen with the various bloated staff members within the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne unbuttoned her pants and stroked the curve of her lower abdomen under the table. People most definitely noticed Marianne\u2019s bulging gut, but she chose not to care as she wasn\u2019t the only one in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s it for this meeting, hope everyone has a good lunch!\u201d Dean said enthusiastically as he patted his stomach like a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Dean sluggishly made his way to the door to let everyone out. Staff members slowly began to exit the crowded room. Marianne looked ecstatic by the latest news and turned to Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like this job has more than one benefit other than keeping us full.\u201d Marianne exclaimed with a hardy laugh making her belly begin to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem excited.\u201d Zack noted with a mocking smile, \u201c I never knew you were into comic books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I haven\u2019t liked them for too long.\u201d Marianne explained, \u201cA few years ago I started reading Thor. I just casually liked it at first, but then I saw that new movie\u2026\u201d Marianne continued beginning to blush, \u201cHe had that plush lumberjack bod and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkaaay, that\u2019s way too much info.\u201d Zack said, interrupting Marianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You're the one who asked\u2026\u201d Marianne remarked as she trailed off deep in thought about Thor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith most of the staff out of the room, the two chubby Hammond employees made their way to the door as Dean waited expectantly.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Zack, can I talk to you for a moment?\u201d Dean asked cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne stood on the tip of her toes and tilted towards Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re busted Tyler.\u201d Marianne jokingly whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s jealous that you\u2019ll outweigh him in a few months\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful slap on the back, Marianne was gone before Zack could retort back. It puzzled him that someone so chunky could also be so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could I do for you Mr. Hammond?\u201d Zack asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, just call me Dean.\u201d he said matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh okay, well uhhh, what could I do for you Dean?\u201d Zack said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked!\u201d Dean said with a wide grin, \u201cI need a favor, and if you do it I am willing to <br>\r\ngive you two free weekend passes for ACC.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cACC?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s just what we\u2019re calling the comic convention.\u201d Dean explained, \u201cIt\u2019s easier than saying Abercrombie Comic-Con.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack thinks for a second pondering the idea of more work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d Zack asked, changing the subject back to the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... part of my job as a senior manager means that I am required to go to dinner parties at the local restaurants around here.\u201d Dean uncomfortably explained, \u201cMy wife often comes along too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack raised an eyebrow, he was curious where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLately, my wife and I have been attending these events too often.\u201d Dean relented as he gave his gut a light pat, \u201cI was curious if you and that girlfriend of yours would be willing to go in our place for a few weeks? It will be free of charge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded, Zack was trying to process the information that was just given to him. Was he really being asked to do this? It almost felt as if he was getting a second promotion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, well you see, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean chuckled, interrupting Zack's indecisiveness. His gut began to wobble in response to the slight movement. Zack struggled to avert his eyes from his employers waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t have to decide now.\u201d Dean stated, \u201cJust make sure to give me an answer by tomorrow afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean\u2019s hammy body swayed with his ample stomach, bobbing up and down as he walked away leaving Zack deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do? Zack sure as hell wasn't sure. His offer certainly has more potential pros than cons. But the biggest con was glaring at him in the face, literally. Imagine what would happen if he and Alice ate out every day? It could lead to some weighty consequences and not to mention these dinner parties were probably a bit too rich for his taste. But on the other hand, a weekend pass to ACC could land Alice a few opportunities in her pursuit of fashion design\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day Zack decides...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ultimately, Zack decided to help Dean out. Why wouldn't he want a free meal every night? Besides, this helps Alice out too! Speaking of which, the young blonde was quite happy about the possibility of getting her work shown. Who knows what kind of people they will run into at ACC?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean was also pretty grateful that Zack decided to take him up on his offer. According to Marianne, all of Dean\u2019s personal assistants were too busy preparing for ACC. So they didn\u2019t have the time or luxury to eat out every night. Zack just hoped that Dean\u2019s future favors don\u2019t involve food, or else he may find himself as big as the other residents of Abercrombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the couple to realize that none of their formal clothes fit like they used to. Zack and Alice felt like they were in a comedy sketch, as they failed to get their clothes on. To their dismay, buttons were popped and zippers refused to move up. With fat overflowing from their waistbands, it would seem that a shopping trip was in order for both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack opted to get a black tux with a bow tie to match. He felt like a chubby James Bond \"going out on a mission\" with the way he was dressed. Zack\u2019s weight gain comfortably settled in his shirtfront, which swelled with the ample paunch settling past his waistband. He did feel small in comparison to some of the other customers he saw in the clothes store. Same could be said for the fitting room, it was very spacious! No wonder fat people felt some comfortable in Abercrombie. Which in turn made him feel better about himself as he stared at his chubby body in the mirror. <br>\r\n                <br>\r\nWhile Zack purchased fancy new clothes, his better half was up to some shopping as well. Alice decided to buy a new dress, this was the perfect time considering her old ones didn\u2019t exactly fit anymore. Mostly due to the increased amount of fat that has settled in her lower half. Being bottom heavy was the bane of her family's existence after all. This is why Alice needed something flattering, and to her credit she did find something. Well, sort of. With some help from Tess,  Alice purchased a dark blue cocktail dress, along with a black beaded belt that stylishly went around her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, the dress complimented her curves well, but it showed off her ass more than she liked. Alice\u2019s larger behind pushed the bottom of her dress up to her mid-thigh region, showcasing her fattened ivory legs. Her flabby arms were also on full display due to the dress being sleeveless. However, one part of Alice\u2019s gain that she did enjoy was the increased boobage. Which, the dress complimented nicely, showing an ever so small amount of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith clothes shopping out of the way, Zack and Alice were ready to dine.<br>\r\n-----------        <br>\r\nWhen Zack and Alice arrived at the dinner party their worst fears were confirmed. Everyone is huge! Like, Dean Hammond level of huge. On top of that, the parties had so much food! These restaurants knew how to keep their guests well fed. Obviously, this didn\u2019t change the fact that these dinners were still technically \u201cwork\u201d.  Begrudgingly, Zack had to talk to some of the other guests on behalf of Hammond Hotels. He had a few conversational fumbles, but Alice was always able to chime in and save the evening. Which Zack was obviously grateful for, as well as the food of course. But oh man was the food good, and it was everywhere! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party's food was sprawled buffet style, so Zack and Alice had plenty of food to choose from. To their shame, they picked out a bit of everything. Even if it meant coming back for seconds or thirds. At first, Alice was afraid that someone was going to call them out on it. But that changed later on, as she realized that they weren\u2019t the only ones. It would seem that all the attendees made frequent trips to the buffet station. Ironically Zack and Alice did get called out that night, but it was for a different reason than they anticipated. It was by a young woman who introduced herself as Morgan Potel\u00e9, who\u2019s roughly around their age.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be careful.\u201d Morgan said with a thick french accent, \u201cPeople here get upset if you don\u2019t have at least four or five servings of food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan has long black that goes all the way past her shoulders, her lacy black dress matched her hair and complimented her slim figure. Zack and Alice felt like they needed to readjust their eyes after not seeing a thin person in so long. Not to mention, how did she stay so thin? Alice couldn\u2019t help but feel a tinge of jealousy and curiosity towards Morgan's petite frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of conversation out of the way, the couple learned a few things about Morgan. She\u2019s a model that has moved to Abercrombie from France for a change in scenery. This piqued Alice\u2019s interest, as she awkwardly brought up the fact that she\u2019s trying to become a fashion designer. Morgan was similarly interested and the two girls talked shop for a while to Zack's dismay. At the end of the conversation, Morgan felt gracious enough to give Alice her number and said that she may be willing to model some clothes for her in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of conversation, Morgan had to leave and said that they should talk again sometime. Not long after Zack and Alice left as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ride home, the young couple left the event bloated and with Alice massaging her stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof, that was good.\u201d Zack stated with one hand on the steering wheel and the other patting his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this keeps up, we're gonna have to be rolled out of these events.\u201d Alice grumbled to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least we\u2019ll be rolled out together.\u201d Zack joked trying to ease the tension.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re adorable.\u201d Alice said warmly, \u201cBut you have a long way to go before you\u2019re my size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill keeping his eyes on the road, Zack paused to think for a moment. Despite the couple gaining adipose at a quick pace, he was still far behind Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not, but I could make it up to you tonight?\u201d Zack asked not so subtly with a cheesy wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice bit her lip as she sized up her chubby partner, he was going to make it up to her tonight all right. She was certainly in the mood after a whole night of eating and talking to rich folk. Besides, Zack kinda looked good bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the evening over, the couple continued going to dinner parties for the rest of the week. Every now and then they saw a familiar face like Morgan, but they were all more or less the same event. Eat food, talk, eat even more food and then represent Dean Hammond. So with a week of dinner parties behind them, it was no wonder that they were starting to both look a little more plump. However, one evening something catches Alice's attention mid meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud beep could be heard emanating from Zack and Alice\u2019s bedroom. Alice sighs and turns off the annoying alarm clock in a sleep induced daze. In an effort to not wake a sleeping Zack on his day off, Alice slowly maneuvered her way out of the bed to begin her morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Alice entered the bathroom and stared at herself in the mirror. Wearing only black lace panties and a small a small crop top, the young blonde was looking pleasantly plump. Ever since that night a few weeks back Alice has grown in every way possible. All she has done since then is eat out with Tess, gorge herself on whatever Zack brings home then go to class, and it shows. Now sporting a double chin and a massive belly that drooped down in front of her panties, Alice looked at herself perturbed by her gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d Alice relented as she rubbed her stomach, \u201cHow could I get so fat while Zack is still just chubby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at herself for another second, an annoyed Alice began to suck in her gut. However, this did not last long as her face quickly became red and Alice\u2019s stomach  bounced back out, jiggling in retaliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll defeat you one day\u2026\u201d Alice proclaimed giving her stomach a poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccepting defeat, Alice struggled to pull her crop top off as her plump arms and slightly larger breasts made what used to be a simple task all the more difficult. Her panties followed, as it slowly made its way off her expansive rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally nude, Alice entered the shower to begin washing her blonde hair and her plump body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all this extra weight on her, Alice had to make sure she fully cleaned every region of her body. Due to this, Alice's hand went to parts of her body that were not previously there. Running her hands across her obese frame, Alice felt every inch of her plush body. She smiled noticing her larger breasts which quickly transitioned to a scowl as her thick ass knocks over a bottle of shampoo. A noisy reminder that everything else has grown too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a particularly bottom heavy woman, Alice has gained most of her weight in the lower regions of her body,  fact she knew too well from her time at Buttercombe. It was difficult getting clothes for her body type, most of the stylish clothes for plus size women were for women with hourglass figures. Something that Alice didn\u2019t have due to her pear shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned off the water, ending her shower and finished getting ready for the day.<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\nThe rest of the day progressed as normal, well the new <i>normal</i> anyways. Alice went to class which was an uncomfortable experience for her to say the least, her enlarged ass made sitting annoying, as she constantly had to readjust herself. However, she did feel cute though. Recently, Alice cobbled together a navy blue skirt in class as an attempt to hide her belly fat and show off her ass. Unbeknownst to Alice, the skirt was already getting a little tight around the stomach area showcasing a slight bulge. She also wore a white buttoned shirt which was used for school when she felt like feeling more professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Alice and Tess went to a local burger joint filled with natives from the town. It was a cheery atmosphere as the locals gorged themselves after a hard day of work. A triple chinned Tess, struggled in her seat as her ginormous stomach pushed against the table. Both of the young women were greedily scarfing down plates of food filled with jumbo burgers and fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph, this is good.\u201d Tess exclaimed mid burger bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Buuuurrrp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mmph, Tess can I ask you a question?\u201d Alice asked while shoveling a handful of fries in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess jestured for Alice to give her a minute as she quickly scarfed down the rest of her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrp, what\u2019s your question?\u201d Tess asked caressing her globular belly.</span></div></div>",

She knew she was getting near the 300 pound mark, and she was a bit worried that she was beginning to get into a uncontrollable spiral of weight gain. While she did enjoy the large breasts that her weight offered, she was a bit embarrassed about the rest of her flabby body, especially her gut, as it sagged into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Alice could at least know while she was big, Tess would most likely remain bigger. Growing only bigger and bigger over the weeks, Tess was now most likely weighing around 780 pounds, her body continuing to explode out with fat the longer she would eat and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the part of Tess's body that was the biggest was her monumental ass and hips, which were continuing to boom outward in weight. Most likely if she kept up her gaining, Alice thought, not only would she be able to sleep on it, but perhaps Zack too. In addition, her gut was now a very big orb that stuck out of her, no matter when she was empty or full, which her breasts would lie on like two round orbs of pure fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess would quickly finish on her current burger before she would respond. \"Getting too fat? No such thing, girl. At least, no such thing in Abercrombie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for you Tess, but I'm worried I may get too fat for Zack if I keep up this gaining...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that? I thought about that when I first met Seth, but I found that the bigger I got, the more he would love me! Besides, I've seen how Zack would look at you when you came over last week to have lunch with us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that comment, Alice would blush heavily, before sighing. \"Maybe... maybe your right. Still though it's only going to be harder and harder to get new clothes and food if I keep growing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Alice. I'm sure that if you do have problems with food, something will come around to help you. Besides, if you need any clothes ever, just come over to my house! I've outgrown many pairs of jeans, so I practically have every size ever made!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a slap to her own behind a bit, Tess's humongous backside would shake heavily from the force, making her smile as she felt the jiggling. Finishing her meal of burgers, Alice would think about Tess's words, as she eventually left with Tess and spent a bit more time with her, before going home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It turned out Alice didn\u2019t need Zack\u2019s help gaining weight. Whether it be the influence of her new classmates or old habits coming back or something in the water, the former chubster was reverting back to the butterball Zack had first met. And not just physically. Her diet had grown less restrictive and particular; snacks and desserts were less a special event and more part of her routine, and portion sizes were getting bigger just as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of that was Abercrombie\u2019s culture. Restaurants and diners gave more value for your dollar than back in Daven\u2019s Port; even the fast food franchises substituted each combo size with the next one up. Smalls were mediums, mediums were larges, and for the larges they went super-sized, as if that hallmark of indulgence hadn\u2019t been done away with years ago. Zack and Alice ate out fairly regularly, and there was only so much either could do to limit how much they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were Alice\u2019s peers. She was fitting in at the school well enough, and thought she didn\u2019t have a new circle of tight-knit friends there were a couple classmates operating on the same wavelength as her. She would chat with them between classes and often they would go to the campus pub or one of the restaurants around the school afterwards to study or compare notes and sketches. And of course while they studied they snacked. Alice described the two as being like younger sisters of Tess, quarter-ton gluttons born and bred in Abercrombie. Food was never far from reach from either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was Alice going to count calories when sharing a table with these two? Or when every class of hers was filled to capacity by lard-laden classmates with butts and bellies spreading across wide benches, and most stairs replaced with escalators and freight-sized elevators? Obese was normal in Abercrombie, and Alice seemed to be internalizing that without problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack himself had grown blas\u00e9 pretty quickly about seeing titanic neighbors and coworkers everywhere he turned. In general his staring and \u2018There but for the grace of god...\u2019 thoughts had fallen away, and now he just saw his boss or the girl behind the counter at Starbucks and not their acres of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept in a few cases. Having noticed Alice\u2019s plumping and thinking about what she would look like if bigger, Zack had developed a habit of scoping out other women who had a tendency to gain below the waist. One of the reception girls at the hotel, Rachel; a bakery assistant who lived a floor below him and Alice; one of the teachers at the high school Zack passed on his way to and from work. There was a nice selection of overripe pears in the city, and Zack was picking up on all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no thoughts of cheating; his designs were arguably purer, picturing Alice if she got up to 400, 500, 600 pounds. What would she look like if she were twice as big as when they had first met? How big would her butt get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow fat would she have to be before she couldn\u2019t drive a car anymore, because her butt pushed her belly up against the steering wheel? How long would it take before she was getting stuck in doorways or turnstiles? How much would she weigh when walking became too burdensome, the act of getting one overstuffed thigh around the other too difficult to be worth the trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to Alice; if the citizens of Abercrombie didn\u2019t seem so preternaturally healthy he wouldn\u2019t be entertaining these thoughts at all. But living in a community of obese and yet surprisingly healthy people, Zack couldn\u2019t help but imagine Alice joining their ranks, or even surpassing them. When they had dinner with Seth and Tess Zack would take every opportunity to catch the two women standing side by side or face to face, imagining Alice swelling up and out to rival Tess, then continuing on so she was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t feel he was being unfaithful in any way, picturing her being transformed. Zack told himself it was more like predicting where things would go if he just stood back and let it all unfold on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Alice owned some responsibility for her changing form, after all. With her lighter schedule grocery shopping fell on her shoulders, and she was bringing more junk food than she would have accepted in the house just a couple months ago. And most of it was finding its way into her belly, not Zack\u2019s. That wasn\u2019t Abercrombie, that was all Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd where had all this indulgence and relaxing of her diet gotten Alice? Zack didn\u2019t have a number, but from his perspective the answer was either \u2018A very good place\u2019 or \u2018A good starting point.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual number on the scale, should Alice step on one, would read 225 pounds. A more than insignificant increase. In fact, it was almost twice as much as what Alice had weighed when the two moved to Abercrombie. Her entire body had softened, definition and tone being lost under a layer of baby fat coming from her face down to her toes. But in certain areas she had gone beyond euphemisms for \u2018soft\u2019 and earned any descriptor for \u2018fat.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were two gelatin mounds that filled and strained her D-cup bras. At home, alone with Zack, she found it better to just let them breathe, covering them up with a t-shirt or pajama top that did nothing to stop them from quivering and shaking at the slightest jostle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly, even when empty, was a distinct pot belly that stretched out most of her shirts and left a crescent of bare flesh visible. When stuffed that crescent became a wide strip, her stomach stretching out to full-term pregnant sized after a particularly hearty meal (and there weren\u2019t many non-hearty meals to find in Abercrombie). At the end of any heavy meal Alice would have to lean back or scoot her chair away from the table a bit to give herself room to breathe. And as of late undoing the button of her pants was a necessary step towards comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was her lower half that commanded your attention. Zack\u2019s attention, definitely. Alice\u2019s butt and hips and thighs were all packed with blubber, curves exaggerated to the point of parody. If she strolled down the street of any regular city Alice would attract stares, gobsmacked expressions and more than a few catcalls and wolf whistles. Her booty was a ballooning barge that rocked from side to side wherever she went, a hazard to nightstands and end tables and a nightmare to panties and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall wonder she had been favoring skirts as of late, but even loose and flowing garments couldn\u2019t hide the plateau on top of her butt cheeks, the shelf that invited you to rest your drink or plate on it. Nothing Alice could wear or design would ever slim down the growing ball of fat she was below the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet Zack\u2019s eyes kept returning to Tess or Rachel or bakery girl, his thoughts on Alice reaching those dimensions. He had never thought of himself as greedy, but seeing Alice nearly double her weight only made him want more of her. He less wanted to let things play out on their own and more wanted to help guide and propel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlans came to him, mostly unbidden, about how to encourage Alice\u2019s growth without coming across as too obvious or drawing her attention to it. But he kept hesitating. She was doing so good getting bigger on her own. Maybe he could hold off just a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if he helped, he would ask himself, how much bigger would she get? And how much faster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to keep playing spectator, but Zack wasn\u2019t 100% sure it was time to step in yet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perhaps fittingly, all this came into play over dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbercrombie was lush with buffets and eateries with self-service stations and various build-your-own bars. Even when they had first moved, Zack and Alice often ate at these types of places. For those more concerned about budgeting than calorie counting (which, granted, at the moment they were) places like Evan's Eats and the Broken Stool Buffet were a godsend. For eleven dollars and fifty cents apiece, Zack and Alice (or, presumably, any diner) could get their fill and take some home for later! However, now that Zack was far more concerned with calories, this place was a godsend for a different sort of reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a single entr\u00e9e on the menu that wasn't fattening. Greasy, fried, butter-basted, cheesy, or just <i>fatty</i> in general were optimum terms to describe the fare at these sorts of places. All of them! The buffets in Abercrombie seemed to be no exception to the rule\u2014everything in this whole city was <i>big</i>. The people, the portions, even the damn <i>plates</i> were above-average size. And since the silverware could plop entire serving sizes at a time, it was no wonder Alice hadn't noticed how much she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least, Zack hadn't thought she'd noticed how much she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause not long into his little plan to tiptoe behind his girlfriend's increasingly softening back, she said the four words that he had hoped to have never heard. Or at least, not until it was too late to do anything about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, I'm getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart practically jumped right out of his chest. It felt like she was calling him out, right then and there at the dinnertable. Like she had known what he was doing. What he'd been fantasizing about behind her back. But she couldn't have! No, that... that wasn't possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Zack put on his best managerial smile, \"B-Babe, no way\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>am</i> Zack, and I think its because we eat out all the time...\u201d Alice\u2019s face fell as she glanced down at her meal accusatorily, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t Zack\u2019s fault\u2014mostly. Really! Aside from the past week or so, he\u2019d been content to lay back and watch Alice fatten herself up. Helping herself to extra portions, snacking on junk food in front of the sofa, going out with her friends from campus all the time, comfort-food to go with her homework; it was all her! Granted, he\u2019d been egging her on for the past week. Buying her chocolate, bringing home Big Burger after work, taking her out to... well, places like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fact that she was so eager to say \u201cit\u2019s not your fault\u201d, well... it was kind\u2019ve cute how readily she was to cast blame aside for her own burgeoning waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, baby, I love you no matter what size.\u201d Zack tried to deflect her concerns, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you do, but look at me!\u201d Alice held up her hands to emphasize her big belly, her arms were thick and meaty. She\u2019d even regrown her second chin with remarkable speed, \u201cI\u2019m huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she wasn\u2019t. Comparatively, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I still love you.\u201d Zack said with an attempt at definitivity, \u201cI promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not... I mean, I love you too but...\u201d Alice whimpered as she threw her head between her hands, her elbows propped up on the table, \u201cUgh... I\u2019m sorry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack knew going in that this wasnt\u2019 going to be an easy sell. And it was stuff like this, that had been popping up the past semester or so, that was giving him second thoughts. A <i>good</i> boyfriend would have helped her <i>lose</i> weight instead of helping her pack it back on. She\u2019d worked so hard for her body. And it was great! But the thought of Alice at three, four, five... dare he think it? The size her butt would be when she weighed <i>six</i> hundred pounds? Her big round ass getting bigger, rounder, meatier by the day? The thought alone made him weak in the knees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Zack said with a smile, feeling the conversation tip in his favor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not... I shouldn\u2019t yell at you because I can\u2019t control myself.\u201d Alice sighed, looking back up, \u201cIt\u2019s just... I\u2019m stressed out, y\u2019know? School\u2019s kicking my butt and my mother\u2019s been calling me and I\u2019m getting <i>fat</i> again and... and... ugh, I\u2019m just sorry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack reached aross the table and grabbed Alice\u2019s hand. He noted how remarkably soft they were now that she\u2019d crossed the two-fifty mark. It took him back to when they were both young and chubby, that day at the beach in Daven\u2019s Port. Her arms were soft and toneless (not that they\u2019d ever had much tone before!) and remarkably doughy. Zack felt his member move underneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re stressed out. I get it.\u201d he said with a smile as he stroked the softness of her hand, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Alice said appreciatively, \u201cYou\u2019re the best boyfriend ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack felt a twinge of guilt as the words left her lips. He wasn\u2019t. He really, really wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook... you\u2019re... you\u2019re stressed out your weight. I get it.\u201d Zack shook off his feelings of guilt the best he could, \u201cBut... y\u2019know, you shouldn\u2019t worry about that. School comes first, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I guess...\u201d Alice looked away defeated; it was like he didn\u2019t get it at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I know you\u2019re freaking out, but...\u201d he caressed her soft, chubby cheek and brought it back to the conversation, \u201cIt\u2019s school. It\u2019s tough, right? I mean, I\u2019m just a manager at a hotel. Give me that over college any day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Alice sniffled, but smiling, \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty for college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Zack laughed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have made it if Ms. Hammond hadn\u2019t gave me a job. But <i>you\u2019re</i> gonna be a big-time fashion lady. So you need to focus all of your energy on school first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked down, the smile slowlying fading from her face as she contemplated what Zack was suggesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t lose weight later, right?\u201d Zack offered weakly, \u201cYou should treat yourslf as much as you want if it means you can concentrate more on your school stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas... was this working? It was kind\u2019ve hard to tell with how Alice held herself. She looked off in thought. But what kind of thought? God, if she suspected what he was up to, it was over. She\u2019d start crying, drop out of school, move back in with her mom... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was in too deep? There was still time to\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d Alice huffed finally, a small smile on her face, \u201cAs long as you <i>promise</i> you won\u2019t make fun of me if I get fat again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise!\u201d Zack said almost too eagerly, \u201cTotally, no way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked at him lovingly as she took his hand into hers. God he was such a jerk. But her couldn\u2019t help but <i>love</i> what living in Abercrombie was doing to Alice\u2019s body. A few inches here, a few pounds there, and before he knew it Alice was almost back at the size she had been when they met\u2014and he loved it! He knew it was the wrong thing to do, total dick move boyfriend thing. But... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... does that mean you\u2019re gonna stop drooling and finally get thirds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God... I didn\u2019t want to look like a pig!\u201d Alice admitted embarassedly, \u201cWas I that obvious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot <i>obvious</i>.\u201d Zack laughed, \u201cJust... transparent. Completely and totally transparent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice snorted into her hands, covering her mouth as she laughed. It was good to see her laugh again. It helped ease the intense sense of guilt he was feeling, considering what he was doing. Just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god... I think I will have some more macaroni pie...\u201d Alice giggled as she worked her way out of the booth, \u201cJust, you know, it was so good... promise you won\u2019t think I\u2019m a pig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smooched him on the cheek and sauntered back over to the self-service bar. Zack watched each cheek fight for shade underneath her skirt, big balls of butt-fluff bouncing up and down with her every step. Her thighs were a wide, womaly shape, and the way the backs of her legs seemed to bounce ever so slightly with her every step? Zack was at full mast as he watched his girlfriend go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sipped his coffee, and allowed it and his erection to drown away his feelings of shame...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack\u2019s guilt over not being completely 100% upfront about Alice\u2019s growth led him to pull back a little in \u2018helping\u2019 her let loose, but as he eased up Alice leaned in. Now that her reversion to her old weight was out in the open, and especially now that she had, as she saw it, Zack\u2019s blessing to be her fat and happier-than-she-wanted-to-admit self, the blonde co-ed had taken the initiative of her own growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t deliberate, and it didn\u2019t involve any significant changes to what she had been doing before she opened up to Zack about her fretting over her weight. It was, rather, simply a matter of adjusting her standards to adapt to the Abercrombie way as her new sense of normal. The meal-sized snacks when she was studying with her classmates, the multiple courses at the buffets she and Zack went to, the girls\u2019 afternoons with Tess that invariably became miniature restaurant crawls. Every one of those was a dramatic shift from what pre-Abercrombie Alice would have seen as acceptable, but the new Alice did not see the before-and-after picture. What she saw was the incremental changes that had happened here and there, bit by bit, over the course of a couple months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanges that came along with other upheavals like adapting to a new town and a new school and learning so many new names and faces and oh yeah, living with her boyfriend and taking their relationship to the next level. It wasn\u2019t just Alice\u2019s diet that had changed; everything had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she felt so wonderful all around, loving her new city, her new school and her boyfriend, making it easy to roll with the rising number on the scale. That was the only thing that might bother her. Not even her mounting gluttony was a concern, because wanting to eat more simply meant she got to enjoy even more of Abercrombie\u2019s wonderful cuisine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she was. At every opportunity. It wasn\u2019t Alice\u2019s genes or a glandular disorder that was causing her to inflate with fat; it was an appetite she couldn\u2019t say no to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want any ice cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Zack were at home, unwinding with some stupid sitcoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good, but help yourself.\u201d He didn\u2019t really need to say it, Alice was going to indulge no matter what. But he made sure to sound as encouraging as possible here and there, just in case some doubts or self-criticism started popping up in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice came waddling into the living room carrying a carton of grasshopper pie ice cream and a bottle of caramel syrup. When she opened the carton Zack saw that less than a quarter of it was gone. By the end of the evening it would be empty, Alice eating straight from the carton, occasionally pouring in healthy dollops of caramel, until all that was left was a puddle of melted ice cream and caramel that his girlfriend drank straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen for good measure she drained the bottle of syrup, drinking from it like someone emptying a bottle of beer. And when she was done she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there still some pie left in the fridge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack watched this spectacle breathlessly. As Alice\u2019s appetite had lost all restraint a new dimension of her eating had been discovered; beyond just quantity of food devoured, there was the unremitting gluttony she was displaying more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alice had settled into her unrepentant piggishness, the idea of her being dismayed by how fat she was getting now laughable, she had less and less tried to hide her intention of filling her belly to the utmost. At buffets she was piling more food onto her plates and taking two at a time; at fast food places she ordered two or three combos at the largest size and a few sides for good measure; and at home she prepared family-sized meals and then worked to make sure there weren\u2019t any leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was amazed, but in a good way. Even the fattest people he had ever known \u2013 including Alice back in Daven\u2019s Port \u2013 would still show restraint in addressing portion sizes, afraid of fitting the stereotype of the food-obsessed fatty people assumed they were. But here was Alice making no bones about her desire to stuff herself at every opportunity. Every meal time was another chance for her to pack her belly taut, the great dome of it swelling outward, hanging over the ground in defiance of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t something Zack could cause, no matter how devious and underhand he was. This came from an influence in a different direction: Abercrombie itself. The city was not just fat friendly but fat enabling, and as Alice began to see herself as an Abercrombie woman this extended into the same kind of unapologetic gluttony that so much of the city\u2019s population engaged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results of this about face in indulgence was sitting right next to Zack on the sofa, pressing against him even as he sat far to one side. After a few weeks of shedding her inhibitions Alice had reached and then passed her old weight, sailing by on track to reach 400 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was now visibly bigger than she had been when Zack first met her, her girth swelling out in every direction but especially behind her. Alice\u2019s booty, the centerpiece of her body, was a pair of hypnotic boulders that needed two chairs for her to sit comfortably and blew apart anything less than a 5XL pair of spandex. Her butt extended behind her further than her breasts did in front, and those babies had grown into a pair of 50-GG sweater puppies. When Zack and Alice spooned he couldn\u2019t feel her backside, and his arm would only go halfway past her belly (now blown up into a pussy-obscuring ball of flab in its own right).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was quickly turning into a body double of her study buddies. The \u2018younger sister of Tess\u2019 analogy now applied to her, aided by the way their neighbor had taken Alice under her fat wing. Seth and Tess were still the couple\u2019s main point of reference in their own apartment, and over a series of weekend get-togethers Zack had seen how the much larger pear had taken a shine to Alice. At the dinner table all four of them would eat to their heart\u2019s content (Zack bowing out first, of course), but there was this unspoken conversation going on between the two women as Tess silently encouraged Alice to keep going, to have just a few more bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time \u2018a few more bites\u2019 had turned into another helping, and then another plate, and by this point Alice was eating almost as much as Seth, trying to match Tess bite for bite for as long as she could. Zack could only imagine what was going on when the two went out to eat alone. Was Tess actively encouraging her to eat more? Or was that just a wild fantasy that Zack wanted to be true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a girlfriend who weighed twice as much as him was even more exciting than Zack had guessed, and the fact that she was letting herself be stuffed by her friends and neighbors put him over the moon. How much fatter was she going to get under Tess\u2019 influence? What if she passed her friends in size and liked it, working hard to make sure she stayed bigger than them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost enough to push Zack to start \u2018helping\u2019 her again, but the fact that Alice was doing so well on her own so far held his hand. He didn\u2019t want to do anything sneaky, going behind her back, and until they had another open conversation about her weight gain and her gluttony, he would have to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t a topic the two could avoid forever. Even as Alice was being propelled to quarter-ton status, the young couple was going to have to talk about...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack\u2019s shame and guilt lingered over him for the rest of that week, but as the days rolled by his dread slowly seemed to dissipate. Alice wasn\u2019t gaining anymore, or at least not as fast as she had been. He\u2019d thought that his act of constantly keeping food around his blond bombshell of a girlfriend just to hint her towards snacking, as well as minutely encouraging her enormous appetite that such stress eating was quite alright would have led to her blowing up bigger and bigger by the meal, but alas, Alice seemed to be balancing out at the same steady weight, rather than gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot, to say this was a bad thing, no, far from it in fact! Zack continued to explore his new found fetish of his girlfriend\u2019s bigger body, and Alice responded just as vivaciously in the bedroom as before, having her man\u2019s hands running all alongside her plush curves, things had never been better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet\u2026in the far back of his mind, there was a tiny part of him that was far greedier than Alice\u2019s stomach, in  this primal part of Zack\u2019s brain\u2026 he still wanted to push Alice bigger.  A red and wild lust was inside of him, aching and horny to see her push higher and higher upwards on the scale, wanting to see his beaux balloon bigger just a bit more, and then a LOT more. Sexy and wild scenarios would play out in his head during the duller moments at work, imagining Alice at the size of some of the Abercrombie based hotel\u2019s portlier patrons; things like Alice\u2019s ass growing bigger so quickly it ripped a hole in her pants and then exploding to such gigantic proportions it broke the very chair she sat on, or  her stomach getting so large and heavy so quickly it broke her belt while it sagged down towards the floor, or even, Alice face first into a buffet scarfing handful after handful, growing bigger by the bite soon dwarfing the other restaurant patrons in a new monstrous size.  Yeah\u2026he\u2019d have to file those away for later\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and adjusted himself,  clearly feeling mixed up inside. Why couldn\u2019t he just enjoy the awesome girlfriend he had already? He knew he could talk to Alice about anything, that\u2019s why the two of them got along so darn well\u2026but\u2026this\u2026maybe this something too wild and too personal for either of them, for him to bring up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother week passed, and soon an entire month had come and gone. Somehow, almost to the day, the two had ended up back at the exact same buffet; with Alice looking almost exactly the same as far as Zack could tell.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026baby\u2026\u201d Zack trailed off, knowing he\u2019d have to be so careful about what he said next. Alice was so caring; she cared SO deeply about what Zack thought about her, she\u2019d do just about anything to make him happy; Zack didn\u2019t want her starving herself over him, and Zack didn\u2019t want her fattening herself up just for him\u2026 Well most of Zack didn\u2019t want that last bit\u2026 He licked his lips before continuing\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going okay with school stuff?\u201d he asked working on his own plate of fresh sliced prime rib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d affirmed Alice in her usual sweet tone, and between mouthfuls of hot beef pot roast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019re not as stressed out as you used to be\u2026.\u201d He pointed out, hoping she\u2019d catch his drift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d said Alice suddenly, and setting her fork to the side. \u201cI think I completely forgot to tell you\u2026I joined a gym a few weeks ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe! That\u2019s\u2026great\u2026\u201d said Zack the answer to his BBW based brainteaser answered. Conflicted as he was on how to move forward next, he stalled for time. \u201cTell me more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s this new gym right of campus called Dynamic Core. Right off of campus.\u201d She explained while picking up her utensil and putting her knife and fork back to good use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Wait what did you just say?\u201d Zack blinked, as something seemed to flash across his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDy-<i>namic </i>Co-<i>res</i>. Right off of campus.\u201d Alice explained stretching out each syllable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack blinked again staggered a bit, he\u2019d sworn he\u2019d heard that name before somewhere, but couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. He shrugged it off, focusing back on Alice and her assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey just opened up, and were giving free trials to Abercrombie residences. Sooo I figured, sign me up! It\u2019s so neat inside; everything is high-tech and state of the art, I guess it\u2019s the kind of equipment the military uses to train or something like that.  But everyone there is super nice! I love it! It\u2019s like a completely judgement free zone.  You should come one day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Zack trailed off, the image of Alice in booty shorts, sweating up a storm huffing and puffing as she felt the burn was quite appealing. But then again, if Zack was going to follow through on encouraging Alice that a bigger belly was quite an alight sight in his eyes, he might just as well come out and say it\u2026Or maybe\u2026. Maybe it would be for the best if he said nothing and let Alice just keep doing this gym thing, she\u2019d probably get tired of it after a while right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As unbelievable as it sounded, it was hard for a one-income home of two to support themselves in a nice apartment in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Alice was going to school full-time, that meant that Zack was the one bringing home the bacon. Well, figuratively. They could definitely afford to bring home the <i>metaphorical</i> bacon, but the <i>actual</i> bacon was a little lacking. As was the bread. And the cheese. And the sandwich meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice as his raise and promotion to management position was, Zack wasn't making nearly enough money to support both he and Alice all by himself. This apartment complex was expensive! And Alice <i>would</i> have gotten a part-time job if it didn't mean risking her almost full-ride at ASU. She had to devote all of her spare time to her studies if she wanted to be able to exist like a normal person. And honestly, she'd never had a job before\u2014her time in and out of prestigious academies looked great on paper, but didn't translate well into actually getting a job. Especially not one that would respect her demanding school schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that left three options\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) They could find a cheaper apartment, which would necessitate more money for gas and bus-fare respectively. Plus, this place came stock with a washer and dryer, which was <i>awesome</i> and meant that they wouldn't have to lug their clothes down to a laundromat or something. Plus, y'know, they had <i>just</i> gotten settled in and... well, option one was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) They could crawl home with their tails between their legs, which was definitely a no-go. Their mothers had had shitfits when they announced that they were moving across the country and out of the spread of their respective tentacles' reach, and they had worked <i>really</i> hard at getting them just sorta-kinda-almost okay with the idea of them moving in together. Running home now meant defeat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that only left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Get a roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't really hard for them to get a lot of people interested. This was the big city and there was a college campus nearby\u2014there were <i>lots</i> of people about their own age in a similar predicament. They wanted to live near campus, and near all the fun stuff, but didn't have the money. And they had that spare bedroom for this exact reason (Alice wanted to turn it into a studio, but Zack was pretty firm in his stance that they needed to eat more than she needed to make clothes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real trouble was sifting through the potential candidates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a <i>lot</i> of weirdos out there, and neither Zack nor Alice were keen on sharing their space with someone who wasn't going to pay their share on the rent. Or keep them up at night practicing his guitar. Or one of those party girls who would never be home alone because they'd always invite friends over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they had convened over the past few days and had finally decided on a small pool of applicants that they were going to accept. They'd worked everything out with the landlady, and she was just fine with them renting out their extra bedroom. As long as they didn't have any pets, this whole thing <i>should</i> go off without a hitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for this?\" Zack asked Alice as she stood in the full-length mirror in their bedroom, \"You ready to meet the person who's gonna be all up in our personal space for the forseeable future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop, don't be such a baby.\" Alice kept her face straight as she did her eyeliner, \"I had roommates back at Buttercombe all the time\u2014it's not so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we <i>just</i> got moved out on our own.\" Zack leaned against the wall, \"I guess I kinda wish we had a little more time to... y'know, <i>ourselves</i> first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll only be for a little while.\" Alice turned from the mirror, one eye successfully lined, \"In my experience, the worst thing you have to worry about with a roommate is keeping them out of your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess...\" Zack's head lulled against the wall with a soft thud, \"You think it'll be weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah, I mean, it's kinda gonna have to be for a little while.\" Alice resumed applying her makeup, \"It always is. But it gets better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere hadn't exactly been <i>that</i> many promising candidates. But over the past week or so, they'd managed to break it down to three potential roommates who, they decided, wouldn't be too terrible to live with. They were supposed to arrive at eleven, sharp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was already 10:55...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al, babe? You, uh... you almost done there?\" Zack snorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush! You almost made me mess up!\" Alice snipped, \"Al...<i>mosssst</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it wouldn't be so bad, Zack said to himself as he watched his girlfriend painstakingly apply her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe they'd have a good sense of humor, so he could laugh about the silly faces his girlfriend made when she was getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do this.\" Alice pumped her arms in a cutesy sort of way, \"Let's go meet our roomie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo, threeway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two opened their bedroom door and did their best to look as normal as possible. They put on a pot of coffee, sat down on the couch, and waited for their final interview to arrive. The minutes ticked by slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally, Alice's phone began to buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she answered cordially, \"Oh, yeah, hi! We're... okay, I'll buzz you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended the call and turned to Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was our pick. They'll be up shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, there was a knock at the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, moment of truth\u2014who would Zack and Alice be sharing their apartment with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice opened the door to reveal...</span></div></div>",

Zack would shove his girlfriend out of the way, or Alice would sneak in front of him to get a better look at herself. Alice was still dripping from her time in the shower, and Zack was getting water all over him as they played like puppies in love. Soon their giggling ceased as Zack wrapped his arms around her, pulling her in by the wet waist as they embraced. Their lips touching, he pressed her sopping form against his, getting the front of his flannel pants and t-shirt damp. And then wet. Alice wrapped herself around him like a blonde, blue-eyed snake. Her hand travelling up the back of his head and holding it in place as they locked lips passionately. Whatever steam had cleared from the shower, Alice and Zack were renewing with their heavy passion... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Zack asked breathlessly, diving back into Alice's kisses, \"It's eight in the morning...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So rude.\" Alice laughed as she watched her boyfriend pout, \"You wanna get it?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What?\" Zack's chubby member was noticeable through his pants, \"Why should I?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Because I'm <i>naked</i>, dummy.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nZack rolled his eyes and dried off with the spare towel. Leaving Alice alone in the bathroom, he went through their bedroom and into the living room.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOf <i>course</i> there'd be someone knocking on the door. They had lived in Abercrombie for almost two weeks now and no one had shown up knocking before. So of course right when he and his girlfriend start flirting and kissing, getting all touchy, someone <i>has</i> to knock on the door. Of course. Of friggin' course. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith the time that it took for him to get to the door, Zack's mood was already sour. The mood hadn't been ruined, but it had been wounded. With any luck he could open the door, get this over with, and get right back to his passionate makeout session with the love of his life. That is, if she hadn't gotten dressed without him... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hello?\" He asked as he whipped open the door, \"Anything I can help you with?\"</span></div></div>",

This woman had massive arms that, while flabby, clearly had some serious muscle-power buried beneath them. A substantial bust loomed high over Zack\u2019s head, almost obscuring his view of anything higher on her body, so he decided to turn his gaze downward instead. Her middle meanwhile was dominated by a huge stomach that rolled over her waistband and covered her thighs; and what thighs they were. Like her legs they were fat but clearly burying massive muscle-power. Finally looking back up to the woman\u2019s face he saw a surprisingly slender face and a only slightly thicker than average neck. She bore a sweet innocent smile and dimpled cheeks; long eyelashes only added to her \u201cadorable\u201d face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer \u201ccute\u201d face was mirrored in her fashion sense. She was dressed in a large pink tank top with dark pink horizontal stripes across it that covered her barrel-like belly perfectly; with a medium-length light-brown skirt that matched her long tied back hair. Her feet were in clean white sneakers with pink socks running up her legs; finally she carried a pink clutch purse over her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026ummm, I came to greet you, I am one of your neighbours\u2026so hi!\u201d at this the woman gave a rather nervous wave that shook her large upper arm fat generously. \u201cSooo are you living alone here or with anyone else\u2026\u201d she asked before suddenly her eyeswent wide with shock and she gave a loud squeak, \u201coh I don\u2019t mean I am asking if you are single\u2026please don\u2019t take that the wrong way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I am here with someone else\u2026\u201d Zack replied slowly, \u201cAlice\u2026one of the neighbours has come to say hello\u201d he called out as footsteps echoed back as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice finally emerged from the bedroom, dressed presentably but not overly business-like. Her hair was still quite obviously damp and she had not had the chance to add socks yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d Alice greeted as she looked down, still trying to fix her hair, \u201cI am Alice\u2026woah\u2026.\u201d Now, Alice had seen some big women in her time, she HAD gone to Buttercombe Academy after all, but a sight like this was still something shocking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! I\u2019m Kennedy, Kennedy Simpson\u201d the massive woman greeted in her high-pitched voice, greeting Alice with the same timid wave and blushing profusely. \u201cI\u2026sorry <i>we</i> brought you a welcome gift, enjoy!\u201d Kennedy stated with a smile as she removed her right hand, which until now had been permanently behind her back, to reveal a jumbo-sized box of chocolates, rather fancy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thanks!\u201d Zack stated as he received the gift, \u201cI am Zack\u201d he introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Probably not my place to ask, but; are you guys like, a couple?\u201d Kennedy asked with a bigger smile, \u201cBecause you look soooo cute together with your matching hair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah we are\u201d both lovebirds replied at once, giggling slightly at the coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! I knew it! I have an intuition for these things!\u201d Kennedy giggled back before a sudden beeping could be heard coming from Kennedy\u2019s pink purse. Turning to the blaring item, Kennedy fumbled around in it for a second before retrieving a phone and turning the alarm off. \u201cSorry, gotta run, gym opens in five minutes and I need to work on my biceps\u2026but if you have some free time, would you like to pop in for dinner tonight? We really would like to get to know our neighbours better\u201d Kennedy added with another innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, we\u2019re not doing anything tonight\u2026are we?\u201d Zack asked, turning to Alice to make sure he hadn\u2019t forgotten anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, not that I can think of, we would love to come\u201d Alice added, returning the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! See you around sixish? We are the third room down on the right, my girlfriend and I will make sure to bring out something really special\u201d Kennedy added with a sweet wink before turning and heading off, giving the couple a long look at her super-sized rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then closed the door and looked at Alice for a few seconds before bursting out, \u201cDid you <i>see</i> the SIZE of her?!\u201d With a frown on her face Alice responded by whacking him on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack don\u2019t be mean; you were chubby too if I remember correctly\u201d Alice added with a teasing scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was more talking about her height, nearly strained my neck talking to her\u201d Zack corrected before pondering, \u201cCome to think of it though, haven\u2019t quite a few of the residents here been kinda\u2026large?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Alice replied, \u201cBut they might not be residents, just tourists; Kennedy might not be local either for all we know\u201d this comforted Zack a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026now, where were we before we were interrupted\u2026\u201d he added with a sly wink, causing Alice to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeeeeell as I remember we were doing this\u2026\u201d Alice purred as she leaned in, wrapping her now-dry arms around her boyfriend and leaning in to continue their kiss. And this time they were NOT interrupted by the doorbell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a perfectly normal day for Alice and Zack. Each had gone through their respective days without a hitch and had returned home for the day. Once their intimate greeting was over they considered their earlier invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be a good chance to get to know <i>somebody</i> around here\u201d Alice stated, referring to how none of their other neighbors had actually bothered to greet them yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery true, and if we ever need someone to move furniture around\u2026\u201d Zack joked, once again referring to the sheer mass of the woman at their door earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be mean, she was ever so sweet\u201d Alice scolded as she picked out a semi-formal dress from her closet while Zack was freshening up across in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t dare say it to her face\u2026.ok that was the last one I swear\u201d Zack stated as Alice gave him a stink-eye so powerful Zack could sense it through the locked door. Moments later he emerged to see his girlfriend in a long dark purple dress and carrying a clutch purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBit much?\u201d Alice asked as Zack looked like he had to pick his jaw up off the floor. He simply shook his head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to wait around, Alice and Zack set off a little before six. Of course it took no more than a few seconds to reach the door. Crossing their fingers around each others for good luck, the couple knocked simultaneously as heavy footfalls echoed from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hi guys!\u201d Kennedy greeted from her lofty height, \u201cYou\u2019re a little early, Marissa is not ready just yet\u2026HONEY! The guests are here!\u201d Kennedy called out over her shoulder, but Alice was not paying attention to Kennedy, well not fully anyway, she was looking at Kennedy\u2019s dress. Following Alice\u2019s eyes, the massive woman took note. \u201cYou like?\u201d she asked with a blush, pressing the few creases in her dress out with her tubby hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026it looks very\u2026um\u2026.familiar\u201d Alice tried to point out delicately. Kennedy looked up, and then she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d she squeaked, \u201cWe\u2019re wearing the same dress\u2026oooo this is so embarrassing!\u201d Kennedy was half correct; it was not <i>quite</i> the same dress. While Alice was in the low end of a medium, Kennedy\u2019s dress had a tag branded with many X\u2019s scrawled on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201d Alice tried to laugh off, \u201cI am sure our entire wardrobes are not identical, it probably won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right\u201d Kennedy agreed before noticing she was still blocking the door with her huge mass, \u201cHow rude of me, come in come in.\u201d Kennedy ducked back to allow Alice and Zack entrance, letting them take in their neighbours apartment for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very similar to theirs; in fact there were still a few half-empty moving boxes here and there in the far corners. A large TV had been set up on the right wall facing the couch, and an adjoined kitchen was part of the same room on the left. A pair of doors sat on the left and right of the back of the room, and a gigantic wall-to-wall window covered the furthest part, allowing the early-evening sun to pour in. As Zack and Alice finished their little observation, a second set of heavy footsteps echoed, this time from one of the back rooms. And as their couple watched, another full-figured woman emerged from the door on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKennedy, can you help me with this dress? It won\u2019t do up at the back\u2026\u201d the woman stopped, frozen in a staring contest with the pair. \u201cI\u2026didn\u2019t hear you come in\u201d she tried to smile off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarissa! I called you to say they had arrived\u201d Kennedy faux-huffed as she walked over to join the shorter woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I had the hairdryer going\u201d her partner muttered as they retreated back inside to help with the aforementioned dress, before re-emerging. \u201cSorry about that\u201d the new neighbour explained with a smile from her rich red lips; \u201cI am Marissa, Marissa Dupont.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDupont\u2026that name felt familiar to Alice\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDupont\u2026? I think I went to school with a Dupont\u201d Alice swiftly pointed out, calling back her memories at Buttercombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What did you say your full name was?\u201d the familiar woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice Carlyle\u201d Alice replied, which made the woman\u2019s eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Alice!? Oh my god! You look so\u2026so\u2026so wow! You look good!\u201d she replied, Alice still none the wiser. \u201cI had a twin sister, Anna? Looked like me but bigger boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was unlikely Alice thought, this woman\u2019s chest was HUGE, but the name did strike a bell. \u201cAnna Dupont! I was in the same classes as her! We shared notes a few times!\u201d Alice would have done something like that; Anna was a very scholastic person, all about her grades. So Alice would have gone to her for help time and again; and now that she remembered Anna, she could certainly see a strong resemblance in Marissa\u2026only\u2026there was one <i>big</i> difference\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember Anna! But\u2026I am sorry to say I don\u2019t recall you much\u201d Alice nervously explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool, we hung out in different social circles\u201d Marissa shrugged off before adding, \u201cPlus, I got SUPER fat.\u201d That she was certainly right about. Marissa was, under normal circumstances, a whale of a woman. Her hips were absolutely massive, far beyond the capacity of ordinary seating arrangements; and from what Alice and Zack could see, there was quite a sizable backside behind them. Her belly was a large fat done that sat lazily on top of her thighs, covered up by her mauve dress; expect for the little diamond in the center that showed off her deep bellybutton. Above her pot-belly, and very much overshadowing it, were a massive pair of breasts; clearly held up by some incredible feat of bra-engineering. Lastly she had a very round face, complimented with a double chin and a hint of a third; all framed by her long blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not <i>that</i> fat honey\u201d Kennedy tried to argue as she emerged from the door, adding some finishing touches to her hair, now out of her topknot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKennedy\u201d Marissa replied sternly, \u201cMy ass has its own zip code, I am fat and I need to diet.\u201d At this Marissa noticed the looks she was getting from the guests; \u201cSorry, Kennedy and I are a couple; this should make it clear\u2026\u201d and then in one shockingly swift move from someone so fat, Marissa whipped a chubby arm up and around Kennedy\u2019s neck and brought her down for a passionate kiss on the lips, shocking the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKennedy didn\u2019t exactly fight off the kiss, but she sure was red in her beefy face when Marissa released her from the tongue wrestling contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026um\u2026should check on dinner\u201d Kennedy mumbled sheepishly before waddling away as fast as her mega-sized legs could in the tight dress.</span></div></div>",

You play?\u201d Zack asked, peering over Marissa\u2019s shoulder, suddenly extremely keen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah just a little\u201d Kennedy replied with a smile as she began to serve up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmph, modest\u201d Marissa chuckled, causing her massive bosom to quake, \u201cShe is the Quarterback most of the time; all the other players are tiny in their skimpy outfits, she goes through them like a knife through butter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u201d Kennedy answered as she laid the plates out. It was a very meat-heavy meal, the entire circumference of the very large plates was filled to them brim with very heavy food. As Zack and Alice watched, Kennedy took out what looked like a condiment container and began to spread a grey powder over her food. Zack, out of politeness tried to reach for it, but Marissa stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take that if I were you, unless you want to end up like her\u201d at this Marissa gave her girlfriends belly a generous pat, emitting a dull booming noise as she did. Zack recalled his hand; he didn\u2019t feel like dousing his food in protein powder at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group then tucked in, chatting as they ate. Compliments were initially thrown at Kennedy\u2019s cooking \u201cI just added some lemon zest, that\u2019s all\u201d before talk turned to schooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you both went to Buttercombe?\u201d Zack asked, curious to hear stories of this infamous school from a second perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but as I said, Alice and I hung out in different groups\u2026all the parties all the time for me\u201d Marissa recalled with a cheeky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! I DO remember you!\u201d Alice added suddenly, chocking down a forkful of steak. \u201cYou hung out with that tall Goth and the nerdy Asian girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026\u201d Marissa stuttered, as her taller girlfriend leaned in, suddenly curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you hung out with the school outcasts\u201d she said in a sweet tone, \u201clook at you being so cute and making friends.\u201d It was Marissa\u2019s turn to blush this time. The guest couple couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the turned tables this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u201d Marissa quickly interjected, eager to change the subject. \u201cWhat are you two doing all the way here anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got promoted to manager of the local Hammond Hotel\u201d Zack explained with a hint of smugness; the opposing couple making little \u201cooo\u201d motions with their lips at his fancy position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a scholarship at ASU\u201d Alice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKennedy has one as well\u201d Marissa interjected, pointing with her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I only got it because they like me playing football for them\u201d Kennedy shrugged off before turning to Alice, \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFashion\u201d Alice replied; at this both Kennedy and Marissa\u2019s eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Kennedy squealed, \u201cMe too! I have missed out on some of the classes due to practice, no wonder I didn\u2019t recognize you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! That\u2019s amazing!\u201d Alice replied. Kennedy was practically bobbing up and down in her pair of chairs at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh oh oh! I can\u2019t wait to show you all the little shops hidden away here! I used to visit them ever since I was little!\u201d Kennedy practically swooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, little?\u201d Zack interrupted. \u201cSo you were born here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d Kennedy proudly replied, puffing her huge chest out, \u201cAbercrombian born and bred!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDam!\u201d Alice muttered under her breath, there goes her bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Marissa, what do you do?\" Zack asked, grinning internally at that little nugget of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...\" Marissa hesitently replied before a chubby hand was placed over her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to be ashamed of\" Kennedy comforted, \"She is at a local community college <i>and</i> works at a local cafe to help pay for this place.\" Kennedy stated proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing really\" now it was Marissa's turn to be modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, you are supporting both of us and I love you for it\" Kennedy added, booping Marissa on her nose. \"You come home so tired every day, I wish I could take some of the load off for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you come home tired too\" Marissa replied, turning as best she could to face Kennedy in her pair of seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only because I have to spend ages at the gym\" Kennedy huffed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack and Alice chose to turn their attention back to their plates, this conversation looked like it was going to get very mushy and overly-sweet. After a few minutes of indefinable cooing noises Kennedy turned back to the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that; I am going to get myself another protein shake, would anyone like seconds while I am up?\" the beefy woman asked with her sweet innocent smile. The smaller couple simply looked at each other in mild horror. Seconds!? Just how much did these two <i>eat</i>?!</span></div></div>",

He looked like Abu from Aladdin. Right down to the short stature and tussled hair. He was this scrawny little guy, pale as could be, with a little crop of brown hair up top beneath a pillbox hat. It took literally every ounce of willpower he had not to bust out laughing once he realized what was going on. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" His face faltered, showing a smile, \"You're kidding me, right?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Who is it, sweetie?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlice came into the living room, drying her hair with a white towel. She had thrown on some of Zack's old pajamas. Damn.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We have a telegram?\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt sounded more like a question that Zack was asking. But it was weird! Almost nobody knew them in Abercrombie. Who could have possibly known where they lived, outside of maybe their parents? And even then, it wasn't like either of them were going to spring for a telegram. Alice's mom was too chintzy, and much more preferred to do her nagging where her tone could be appreciated and feared. And Zack's mom ws old school, but not <i>that</i> old school. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"They still do those?\" Alice asked with an optimistic glee as she bounced over to the front door, \"What's it say? Or... is that the thing where we need to know morse code or...?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I-It's like a letter...\" The little guy said skittishly, \"It's a little old fashioned, yeah, but... hey, fella's gotta eat, right?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nZack and Alice took the letter from the valet's hand. It was an austere looking thing\u2014with artificially yellowed edges and printed on really nice, thick paper. It was sealed (sealed!) with wax, with an emblem made up of a stylized S and W. It pained Alice to open something so beautiful, so she urged Zack to open it gently... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Dearest Alice, <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOne, this letter's from Sam. Sam Wilsey\u2014you <i>do</i> still remember me, right? We haven't seen each other for so long, I was afraid your blonde ass would forget about me! Two, sorry about the valet. I figured it might be a little weird, but hey, it's all about presentation, right? <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhich brings me to my next point: <br>\r\n <br>\r\nI'm writing you because I saw that you moved into town a couple weeks ago, and wanted to invite you over to my place. We're, like <i>way</i> overdue for a reunion. As you can probably tell by the valet, a <i>lot</i> has changed for me. So get your ass over to my house this weekend and we'll catch up! Bring your man if you want! Trust me, there's plenty of room to keep him occupied while we catch up.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKidding! <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLove ya,  <br>\r\nSam <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPS: don't feel obligated to tip the valet. I already took care of that.</div> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>hat weekend, Zack and Alice headed out. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe ride to chateau Wilsey was a long one. She lived just outside the city limits of Abercrombie. But Abercrombie was a big place. It was a really scenic route, with lots of flatlands and fields. Plenty of wildlife all around. Even still, it took about an hour and a half to get from their apartment complex to \"almost there.\" And all the while, the only thing on Zack's mind was... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So who's this Sam girl anyway?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nZack could help but find himself a little perturbed by the fact that he was only just now hearing about one of his girlfriend's closest friends. Granted, they hadn't talked much about her life at Buttercombe. She had been much more enthralled learning about Daven's Port, and he had been way too focused on falling in love with her. After two years of dating, Zack only really knew about Megan and Ronnie\u2014two of Alice's oldest friends. But he hadn't heard much about Sam; or if he did, he couldn't remember it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"She's an old friend.\" Alice said definitively, fiddling with her smartphone, \"She was friends with me, Megan and Ronnie when I went to Buttercombe. We were in the same grade\u2014I'm pretty sure that I've told you about her before.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I mean yeah...\" Zack chuckled nervously, \"But like... you know, what's she like?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlice seemed to ponder this for a minute. Like she was asking herself this for the first time herself. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I don't know... she swore a lot.\" Alice said nonchalantly, seemingly oblivious to Zack's suspicions, \"Sam and I were roommates after Megan graduated, so I guess you could say that we were pretty close. I used to help her with her homework and she used to help me keep those prissy white girls off of me. Sam was pretty tough.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah she was this really deep writer. I remember she used to write all this great poetry.\" Alice said before she started laughing, \"I remember one time I found her journal of poems and she\u2014snort!\u2014she got this <i>horrified</i> look on her face!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlice fell into a giggling fit. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I swear to effing God if you tell anybody I'll effing kill you!\" Alice recreated the scene, poorly, as she laughed, \"I teased her so much for that. I don't know why she hid them. They were really good!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nZack's supsicions were not abated. It seemed so odd that he had never heard of this Sam woman. Not that he expected Alice to tell her <i>everything</i> about her life (there were a few seedy details that he himself had tactfully left out!) but for them to be so close\u2014close enough for her to send her a <i>valet</i>. It made Zack a little on edge. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe rest of the ride was mostly uneventful, until eventually their sputtering sedan came into view of a large mansion, out in the middle of the fields.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nDespite the oddity of it all, the building was definitely organic. It didn't stand out like a sore thumb, despite the fact that it was literally a giant mansion in the middle of flatlands. They could see a big lake nearby, and there were lots of domestic plants nearby. A cobblestone driveway led them up to a gate, which sealed them off from the interior yard. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Um... hi?\" Zack pushed the button, \"We're uh... we're here to see Sam?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere was a pause. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>\"Come right in then.\"</i> <br>\r\n <br>\r\nA few seconds later, the gate doors opened, allowing the silver sedan to sputter on through. Zack and Alice were amazed by the tender love and care that the yard were given, the beautiful sights as flora crawled up beautiful sculptures and were carved into magnificent topiary. A few shirtless, sweaty folks were tending to the impressive garden as they passed by. They gave friendly enough waves as Zack and Alice passed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Zack whistled, his suspicions abated momentarily abated, \"Buttercombe girls really are rich.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah but...\" Alice's blonde brow furrowed in confusion, \"Sam's not...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnother look at the garden. The gardeners. The gate. The intercom. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"At least, she didn't used to be...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div> <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlice and Zack were thrust inside the stately Wilsey manor. Their coats were taken, and they were shown to the sitting room. One of many sitting rooms, presumably. And that's when they met her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They were sitting across from one another, each a loveseat to themselves with a coffee table in between them. They had been discussing, idly, the strange choice in decorum for Alice's supposedly punk-rock former roommate. When suddenly, Zack noticed, their waters began to ripple. The sound of heavy footsteps, both knew the sound quite well, rattled the room. Growing closer and closer until the foyer doors opened to reveal one massively made over mate. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Alice!\" Came a husky, raspy voice, \"You came!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt once, this sea of white blubber entered the room. It took both doors opened, wide, for the master of the house to make her way through. Samantha Wilsey was this enormous woman, no older than Alice, but more than four... <i>five</i> times her size. Neither of them had ever seen a woman so large!  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOf course, like most Buttercombe alum, Alice had expected her friend to have retained some of her pre-graduation weight. Most of her friends did. But to have nearly doubled in size since they had thrown off their caps... it was unheard of! <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Sam rushed over, gasping with effort, her entire body seemed to quake. Her great gut was this heavy, multiply-tiered bulge that swung pendulously with her every labored step. Her legs were, comparatively, stout and very under-equipped to handle such a load. Though very bolstered by the great rings of fat that encased them, built with two enormous cheeks to act as counterbalance to Sam's swollen stomach. The floorboards creaked and groaned, squeaking in agony as Sam made her way ponderously over to Alice. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe had dressed rather conservatively, much to eithers' surprise. It wouldn't have done her justice to call Sam's outfit a muumuu, but it was a long dress that had been designed with her size clearly in mind. It was, however, very tight. Alice and Zack could see every roll and fold coming at them as soon as she entered the room\u2014the deep canyon of her belly button was very much on display even behind the fabric. Her triple chins tremored with her every step as she somehow made her way over to Alice and wrapped her in a big, fleshy hug. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ooh, Sammy...\" Alice wheezed, \"I... I missed you too...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nZack, meanwhile, took this opportunity to drink in this woman. This whale. Alice had told him that most Buttercombe girls were big. But this... this was something else entirely... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh I've missed you so much!\" Sam squealed like a girl half her age and a fourth her size, \"Can't believe you went and got so fucking skinny on me, girl! You're so fuggin' pretty I wanna squeeze you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!\" Alice managed, suffocating beneath all that was Sam Wilsey's girth \"You, uh... you too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference between the two women was astounding. Both he and Alice had been big before. But even put together, Zack doubted that they could have matched Sam Wilsey in size. Her short crop of black hair allowed for her inflated cheeks to puff out, her chins resting on the acreage of cleavage that her low-cut dress showcased. Her arms were as big around as Alice's thighs! And the way Alice sunk deeper and deeper into her friend's fat, the harder and harder she squeezed... Zack was honestly afraid that she might suffocate in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey!\" Zack called out in an attempt to save his girlfriend from certain doom, \"I'm, uh... I'm Zack. The boyfriend. Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too!\" Sam released Alice (who broke away pink-faced and panting) before taking Zack's outstretched hand and giving it a good shake, \"I'm Sam. Your girl's probably told you all about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Sam cut her eyes at Alice, \"You get yourself a man and you forget all about your little friends from high school, huh? Way to put misters before sisters, Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled sheepishly, trying to not-so-obviously scope out the size of her friend's impressively immense ass. She was huge! Sam had always been the bigger one between them (well, after Sophomore year, anyway...) but Alice had never suspected that she would have gotten this... this... huge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... oh man... I gotta siddown...\" Sam panted, her cheeks reddening along their crests, \"All this catching up is exhausting. What do you say we\u2014</span></div></div>",

Say, still remember the shit we had to bear from that stuck-up bitch, what was 'er name, Gail?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace, Grace Sawyer,\u201d Alice involuntarily lowered her voice as if mere mention of her could call her old nemesis back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you showed her good, Alice!

What were you doing all the time, girl?\u201d Seeing her old friend redden, Sam cheerfully laughed, making all her chins wobble. But that laugh quickly turned to a bark. \u201cCarmen! Where the hell are you? I told you to bring the snacks as soon as my guests arrive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young, plump Hispanic woman scurried into the stately room with a large platter in each hand. \u201cS-sorry, Missus, the cook was still getting them ready\u2026 But they're on the way now. They'll be here in a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, good,\u201d Sam glared at her for a bit, then turned back to Zack, all smiles again. \u201cYou oughtta hear this, Zack. How your little Alice got the biggest, meanest bitch of all Buttercombe expelled...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 and remember when we had our first taste of Buttercombe dinners?\u201d Alice giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was the shit,\u201d Sam nodded, plopped another canape into her mouth and turned to Zack who was getting a glazed-over look. \u201cBut we're talking and your man here's bored to death, huh? Hey, listen, Jack's got plenty of games here, console, arcade, God knows what other shit's there. Interested?\u201d Not waiting for his reply, she shouted, \u201cCarmen! Where're you? Move your lazy butt here and take Zack to the game room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I don't want to impose...\u201d Zack didn't get any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d Sam laughed out loud when she saw his startled expression. Then she relented. \u201cLook, I want you to enjoy your time here just like Alice does. So just run along and play. And Carmen'll take you some more snacks. Y'hear, girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Missus.\u201d The Hispanic bobbed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tell the cook to bring more snacks to us too! Or I'll tell Jack you're both starving me to death!\u201d And Sam caressed her enormous gut as if she believed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your\u2026 uh, Jack, likes gaming?\u201d Alice picked up courage to ask about the thing she was interested in the most \u2013 Sam's mysterious partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he's quite a bit into it. And wasted a fortune on various old arcades etcetera. I used to love that stuff, too, but it's sooo exhausting,\u201d Sam languidly stretched on her sofa. \u201cMuch better to just watch TV, y'know? Which reminds me, what do you think about...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour has passed and Alice was getting a little frustrated.  Doubly frustrated, she admitted to herself. With Sam, for avoiding all her indirect hints about Sam's mystery man. And with herself for partaking a bit too much in the feast that spread in front of her \u2013 in the best (or worst) Buttercombe traditions. She was again experiencing that familiar sated feeling and her little tummy was curving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, dusted off crumbs from her blouse and opted for direct attack. \u201cListen, how did you meet, uh...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean my Jack? Jack Spencer? That's another long story. Pretty long and pretty twisted one, girl. Aaand\u2026 \u201d Sam snickered and half-turned her head to the window. Alice watched, fascinated, her chins rearranging. \u201cAnd it's better be to leave it for next time since that's his beemer in the driveway.

She'd enjoyed the idle afternoon and there were so many more things to ask Sam! But she ought to watch her eating, she'd already scarfed down enough calories for two days. And besides... \u201cI really couldn't fit a single mouthful,\u201d she made a sad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't worry 'bout that, girl. That's what digestifs are for.

Remember, if you say yes you'll get to meet my sweet Jack at dinner,\u201d Sam winked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it. Curiosity made Alice accept the dinner \u2013 and a glass of calvados \u2013 and while she watched the Latino maid manoeuvre her behemoth of a friend out of her sofa, she quietly sipped it.  She'd never drunk calvados and it was so good! Smooth and nicely sweet and yet a tad tart too, it tasted better than drinking apple cider\u2026 and though she knew it had a lot bigger kick too, Alice decided it was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sam was finally hoisted upright, she noticed Alice licking her empty glass. \u201cLike it, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?

And you're right, I feel I could eat a little bit more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out, girl, it's strong stuff. D'you wanna get stoned before my man comes? By the way, believe it or not, Jack's distantly related to one of our schoolmates. Huh? Jack Spencer,\u201d Sam emphasised his surname. \u201cAs in\u2026 Arisa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean he's somehow related to Arisa Boonliang-Spencer?\u201d Alice couldn't quite wrap her mind around it. She took another big gulp of calvados instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, to that whale,\u201d Sam ironically ignored her own bulging body that must have outgrown Arisa's and went on. \u201cUn-frickin'-believable, right? And somehow is a good word. Jack explained it all to me, and not just once but all I got from it is, they don't have a family tree but a real jungle. Huff...\u201d she ponderously moved towards the door. \u201cAnd he should be here right about\u2026 now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, door swung open and Alice could finally see Sam's partner. Jack Spencer was dark-haired and chocolate-skinned, as befitted his familial relationship with Arisa. Otherwise, though, he seemed her exact opposite \u2013 quite tall and quite slim, lithe might be a better word; with a moustache and a goatee like a cheap B-movie villain. Impeccably dressed in an expensive-looking dark striped suit and a tie, he looked like a slick broker ready to help you part with all your money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloorboards groaned when Sam affectionately leaned into his embrace (well, a demi-embrace at best). \u201cHi, lover!\u201d she chirped like a girl a third her size. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible. Boring, drab and tedious. I missed you,\u201d he bent over for a long, thorough kiss. Only then did he notice the shy blonde figure trying to blend into the background. \u201cOh? We have a visitor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's Alice. Y'know? I toldya 'bout her. Even showed you our photos together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right? The schoolmate from Buttercombe? Is that you?\u201d Jack's upper-class accent rolled the words as he looked Alice up and down, \u201cI'd expected someone, eh\u2026 less mature looking,\u201d he saved nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, duh! Those photos were four, five years old,\u201d Sam shrugged, oblivious to the hidden context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I, uh, I slimmed down, uh, a lot...\u201d stammered Alice, all-too-aware of the new bulge around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there was no need, you looked stunning back then. Just like you do today. Anyway, welcome to the Wilsey-Spencer household,\u201d he untangled himself from Sam's folds and stepped forward to kiss Alice's hand like a Victorian era gentleman. She felt a blush forming on her cheeks while he went on, \u201cI trust you'll stay for dinner? I can promise you a feast worthy of Buttercombe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, y-yeah...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, Jack, I already talked her into it. Yeah, they'll have dinner with us,\u201d Sam barged in. \u201cSo we should go eat right now, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey?\u201d Jack looked around the room as if expecting to find someone he overlooked in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure, Carmen, go fetch, err... Zack from the game room! See, Jack, her boyfriend got bored listening to girl talk so we sent him to play some games. You don't mind, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's OK. That's why they're here, eh?\u201d he winked at the girls, making Alice wonder if Sam had learned this gesture from him. \u201cZack and Jack, huh? We should go along splendidly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time steps echoing in the vast hallway announced the missing guest and soon a sheepish-looking Zack entered the room. After another round of introductions everyone moved to the dining room, Sam leaning on her boyfriend. He helped her reach a sturdy-looking loveseat, apparently adapted to her size. She ponderously sat down again, spreading her thighs wide apart so her belly could freely flow downward. The plump maid quickly scurried to her mistress and placed a small stool underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked up to see his guests already seated and clapped his hands. \u201cBring the first course!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFirst a little ap\u00e9ritif, dear guests, my beloved,\u201d Jack smoothly took over the host role, \u201cto whet our appetites. Cheers! To old friends\u2026 and new,\u201d he winked at Alice. \u201cThe first course is Mexican, just some small hors-d'oeuvres. I hope you'll enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps his perspective was skewed by living with Sam but there was nothing small about tacos, fajitas and who knows what else on large platters that were brought to the table by two maids (one was Carmen, Sam called the other, even plumper one Teresa). They both returned to the kitchen twice before they filled the entire surface with food. This was to be first course? At first Alice thought they'd never be able to eat all that but when she had a look at Sam she realised how wrong she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam ate like a woman possessed, as if she hadn't eaten for days, no, weeks. At first she made a couple attempts at small talk but that soon gave way to piggish grunts and other gluttonous sounds as she was scarfing down everything in her reach and stuffing herself even further, paying no heed to her guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice felt somewhat embarrassed by that shameless display of gluttony. And a little alarmed, when she noticed Sam's appetite was rubbing off on her too. She put down her second taco, reminding herself she wanted to slow down. She'd already crammed her stomach full today, no need to stretch it even further. She knew she had to find a diversion so she turned to Jack. \u201cSo how did you two\u2026 get to know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's an epic tale,\u201d he smiled a little, \u201cand rather too long for this small dinner, I am afraid. But I can give you a short digest, at least. One day I was returning back to Abercrombie from a business trip and only when my plane landed, I realised I messed up. You see, I always call my chauffeur to pick me up at the airport but that one time I forgot. Luckily, as it turned out. Oh, by the way, have you tried our fajitas yet? They're to die for, Maria \u2013 that is, our cook \u2013 is a wonder. Here, let me get them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, where was I? Oh yes, at the airport, with no way to get home. Oh, sure, if I called Mike, he'd jump into the limo but it would take him at least an hour to get there, even if he broke all kinds of speed limits. And I didn't want to wait that long. Burritos, Zack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't want to wait at all, I was feeling restless, so I went to the airport Hertz office. It must've been fate, eh, darling?\u201d Sam just grunted. \u201cI went there and behind the counter I saw a woman so striking, so\u2026 original that I just stood there staring...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large dining table was strewn with remnants of the last course. There had been half a dozen desserts to choose from and although Alice had tried to exercise her self-control, she still managed to taste all of them. But now she was well beyond full and couldn't swallow a single bite more. And from the looks she'd exchanged with Zack he felt similar. Jack, too, ate only a couple pieces but there was no need to worry about leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir humongous hostess was so stuffed her stomach turned into a perfectly spherical shape, all its rolls and creases smoothed out. Sam's face was flushed, red and sweaty, she must have been far past the point of sating herself but her greedy gut wouldn't let her stop. She groaned and moaned and kept stuffing cheesecake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost revolting and yet somehow entrancing, too. Alice placed both her hands on her stuffed tummy to prevent them from reaching for another morsel, started gently massaging that hard ball. \u201cI'm glad I won't be the one driving home,\u201d she noted to Zack sotto voce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let out a heavy sigh but their little exchange didn't escape Jack. \u201cOh, there's no need to overexert yourselves, either of you,\u201d he rushed to assure them. \u201cYou can leave your car here, Mike will take you home in the limo. Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don't want to be a bother,\u201d replied Alice immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no bother at all, trust me. You can pick your car tomorrow evening or some other day. That is, unless you need your car right in the morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I can take the bus to work,\u201d Zack assured him. \u201cI usually do anyway. And so does Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Well, in that case...\u201d he let it hang in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had another look at Zack and his painful scowl. \u201cYes, we accept. You have our gratitude. And Zack's too busy at work tomorrow but I'll come to pick up our sedan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! Tell Mike and he'll pick you up tomorrow in the city. Well, then,\u201d Jack smiled warmly at both of them, \u201cI'm glad that's sorted out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid it is getting rather late and Zack has a morning shift so...\u201d Alice shrugged, looking at her old friend, still stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis finally broke her trance. Sam took several deep breaths before they heard her deep voice again. \u201cOK, girl, but remember, you can come anytime.\u201d And her next sentence proved she'd been following their previous conversation, certainly to some degree: \u201cAnd we'll continue our little chat tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'll take you to the car, no need to bother Sam with getting up right now, eh, dear?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou betcha, lover!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for coming and just like Sam said, you're always welcome here \u2013 that goes for you, too, Zack,\u201d the smooth businessman slipped between them, hooked an arm through theirs and guided them towards the main entrance. \u201cMike! I have a small errand for you. Can you take our guests home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small grunt but then the unseen chauffeur answered, \u201cSure, boss.\u201d And in no time, a large limo stopped right in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you tomorrow, Alice,\u201d Jack opened the door for her, \u201cand you, too, hopefully, Zack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, maybe. Bye. Oh, God!\u201d Zack plopped down on the plush back seat and unzipped his pants. \u201cI thought I was going to die. I couldn't eat another bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Alice couldn't bring herself to unzip her skirt, as much as she'd have liked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that's your bestie, huh? She's...\u201d Zack became aware of chauffeur's presence, \u201can interesting girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that she is. She's always been.\u201d Alice wasn't inclined to discuss Sam's expansion either, certainly not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're both very nice but, ughh\u2026 I don't think I'll be coming here often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me neither, except I have to pick our car. Oh, this reminds me, Mr. uh, Mike? Jack told me you could pick me up tomorrow and drive me to the Spencer residence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Miss, just tell me where and when.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as Alice finished her senior year at the prestigious Buttercombe Academy she quickly used her lofty credentials to enroll in Daven's Port Community College, so as to be more closely located to Zack as he toiled his way up the ladder of the Hammond Hotel racket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Alice has been accepted to a more prestigious college studying fashion and Zack is getting a promotion, the two have decided that it's time for them to take it a step further. They're moving halfway across the country to a new town called Abercrombie, where hopefully they can move towards bigger and better things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmphasis on the <u>bigger</u>.</div></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\">\u2014RULES\u2014</div></font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"left\">ANYONE CAN GAIN\u2014</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">This interactive is born from the acclaim and favor that two fan-favorite characters have received from their respective interactives.

It works as more of a direct spin-off to Buttercombe, and may not bear much weight on this particular story, but I and many others enjoy it just the same. Mel is a four-hundred pound active gainer, who aspires to be the world's fattest woman. There's no real \"right\" way to tell her story, thanks to its looser story-telling style. Mel can wind up anywhere, doing anything! As long as she's getting fat along the way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Buttercombe Academy, Super-Sized <i>focuses</i> on female weight gain. However, it does allow for male weight gain to occur.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><div width=\"100%\" onmouseover=\"showMine('cItemItemID3');\" onmouseout=\"hideMine('cItemItemID3');\"><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"position:relative;min-width:400px;\" width=\"95%\" class=\"citemTable\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"55\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"Awardicon Information:\n\n Given By: frown \n\n Given To: psuedophobic \n\n Date Awarded: 08-10-16\n\n * Click here for details. * \n\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/awardicons.php?action=show_case&amp;award_id=142629\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/awardicons13/ribbon1_yellow-10.png\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"50\" height=\"62.5\"></a></div></td><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"65\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2072923-Davens-Port\"><div class=\"coverImg  whiteBackgroundColor\" style=\"padding:0px;margin:0px 0px 0px -1px;width:64px;height:64px;background: white url('https://www.writing.com/main/images/action/display/ver/1598583469/item_id/2072923.png') no-repeat center center; background-size: contain;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trans.gif\" width=\"64px\" height=\"64px\" id=\"protectImg\"></div></a></td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"norm\" style=\"padding-left:15px;color:#000000;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2072923-Davens-Port\" target=\"_top\" class=\"blue2roll noSelect\" style=\"font-size:1.3em;font-weight:bold;\">Daven's Port</a>\u00a0<a title=\"Open Item in new window.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2072923-Davens-Port\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> [<b><a class=\"sblueroll\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools.php?action=pop_rhelp&amp;crating=10',%20'crhelp10',%20'500',%20'350');\">E</a></b>] <div id=\"cItemItemID3\" align=\"left\" style=\"align:left;overflow: hidden;float:right;display:none;visibility:hidden;\">#<b>2072923</b></div><br>Dakota moves to a new town, where she finds herself and her friends getting bigger...<br><nobr>by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'psuedophobic', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '100565841'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'psuedophobic', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: psuedophobic\r\nMember Since: November 11th, 2007\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">Bobo the Hobo</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View psuedophobic's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/psuedophobic',%20'CommunityR_100565841',%20'400',%20'650')\">78</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/psuedophobic','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/psuedophobic\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'psuedophobic', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Private', '', 'November 11, 2007', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a></nobr></td></tr></table></div></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Daven's Port is the story of Zack's hometown, and the adventures of his friend Dakota Johnson as she finds her place in it. Though younger than its sister interactive, Daven's Port has quickly developed a cult following thanks to the talented writing from many different authors, as well as its unique reading experience. Though the story isn't about Zack <i>per se</i>, he does play a large part in how it unfolds, and is one of the main character's very first friends in her new home town. But life in the city gets weird sometimes, especially when everyone's growth spurt just means that they're getting fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaven's Port, like this interactive, caters to fans of both male and female gain.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
