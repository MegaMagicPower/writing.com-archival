Getting close to the big, shocking twist at the end of the next episode's script. Jensen squinted blearily in all directions. He tried to move and immediately felt his back protest. Was he sleeping on a table? What the hell..? The surroundings didn't seem completely alien, but he didn't recognize where he was at first. Jensen groaned under his breath as he sat up and smacked his lips. He tasted something bitter... Had he been roofied? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust have been some strong stuff, because the next thing he spotted blew his mind: he was sitting on a  oversized copy of the script! He yelped, scrambling to his feet. He suddenly recognized that he was still in his trailer at the studio! But everything was bloomed into enormous proportions... A pale sheen of nervous sweat dotted his forehead as he heard rumbling movement from the other side of the door. As his luck would have it, Jared was knocking, coming to check in on him. He could hear Jared shifting, getting ready to come in, and knew he had only seconds to make up his mind. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly he cried out as the pixie, about three feet tall with fish like facial features, leapt and bit the base of his neck.  He heard Dean shout, gunshots firing and a dead weight dropping from his back.  But all he could hear was the ringing in his ears... The pain in his back. Dean crouched in front of him, more worried than ever. <br>\r\n\"D-dean..?\" Sam slurred, frowning. His brother was shrinking! \"Dean! You.. You're getting smaller..?\" <br>\r\n\"More like the the other way around.\" Dean said grimly. Sam stopped around 30 feet tall, his head bumping the branches of the trees. <br>\r\n\"Holy shit...

There isn't much that could have done any harm to them at the moment, anyway. Vengeful yet cautious, the other sprite approached Sam, who didn't seem to notice. Testing the hunter's sensitivity, it lightly nudged him. Sam twitched but didn't wake. However, airing on the side of caution, the sprite waited for Sam to settle back into full slumber. It watched, as the hours passed, for any sign of discomfort or awakeness. Sam slept in an almost dead-to-the-world sort of way. As the birds roused and dawn came, the sprite no longer cared about surviving, only causing greater discomfort for the two hunters that had killed its friend. It lunged out and bit down hard on the side of Sam's free hand. Sam sat up, instantly wide awake, with a yelp. Dean woke immediately after Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his hand, trying to dislodge the sprite, but it wasn't helping.  In fact, it only seemed to have gotten worse. Dean got up and hurried to the Impala, grabbing the gun he had used to kill the last sprite. \"Sam, hold still!\" he snapped at Sam. Sam immediately obeyed, allowing Dean to shoot the sprite. However, despite being dead, the sprite hadn't been dislodged. \"Okay, stay still, I'm gonna get it out.\" he said as he put the gun back. He hurried over and grabbed hold of the sprite's head. Or what was left of it anyway. The entire back of the sprite's skull had been blown off. Using utmost care, Dean pulled the teeth out of Sam's hand, then stepped away. \"There\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean, I feel\u2026kinda funny\u2026\" Sam mumbled. Dean frowned before it clicked, then hurried to his car. He closed the trunk of the Impala and drove it a little further away. Sam was already growing. The look of discomfort was unmistakeable on Sam's face. When the growth stopped, he towered over every tree in sight at almost a hundred feet tall. Dean felt an animalistic fear hit him as he stared up at his big little brother. Sam bent over and looked around. \"Dean? Dean, where are you? This isn't funny.\" Sam whined. Dean quickly realized that Sam was afraid that he'd smushed Dean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean stepped out towards Sam, who didn't seem to see him. \"Hey, Sammy, down here!!\" he called up. Sam twisted toward the voice and looked down. The second Sam's eyes found Dean, Sam sighed. \"Jeez'! Think you could /not/ gale-force me with morning breath!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blushed slightly. \"Uh, sorry\u2026 just\u2026I'm just glad you're okay.\" Sam admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still like being a freakishly tall Sasquatch?\" Dean teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026 This sorta sucks.\" Sam confessed. \"I mean, being a lot bigger than you is cool and all, but being this big just sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean sighed and came closer, every hunting instinct screaming for him to turn and run. He ignored them as best he could, but every step forward made it that much worse. Like trying to walk away when stuck by a bungie cord. \"Dude, you're fudging massive!\" Dean blurted, unable to force himself any closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shifted under Dean's stare. \"Uh, Dean, you're, uh, making me kinda uncomfortable.\" he said sheepishly. </span></div></div>",

I mean, I was a freak before, and that's bad enough, but this is way worse!\" Sam moaned, dropping his head into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean came closer. \"Sammy\u2026 Yeah, sure, this is a mess, but we've been in worse situations before. It could be worse!\" Dean pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam huffed out a laugh and almost scowled at Dean, but refrained himself from doing so. \"How!? How could this POSSIBLY be any worse!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean smirked slightly. \"It coulda been me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam froze in the middle of turning to yell at his brother as the words sunk in. He frowned and tilted his head slightly. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean spread his arms out. \"Dude, I eat, like, four times as much as you do! And I don't eat rabbit food! You do! How do you think that'd turn out?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam thought about it for a second, then a smile broke out across his face. \"Yeah, I guess you /would/ kinda suck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean glared up at Sam, then gave a sideways nod. \"Yeah, and you're bitchy. I wouldn't last five minutes before you'd be whining about everything I do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gave Dean a brief bitchface. \"Well I wouldn't have to if you'd exhibit some form of self control.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I wouldn't be able to eat without you judging me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled. \"You'd judge me for eating plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean huffed. \"Yeah, well, I'll be eating people food. You can stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're just gonna ditch me\u2026?\" Sam asked in a sad tone as his facial features echoed the hurt feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean internally winced, having not meant to make matters any worse. \"No. At least, not completely. I was gonna get food and come back. Jeez'. Whiny much.\" he teased, hoping that would cheer Sam back up. Unfortunately, Sam had shut down. Dean moved in closer. \"Sammy, come on. I wouldn't do that to you.\" Dean pressed, desperate to get Sam out of his current state-of-mind.</span></div></div>",

Dean smiled on the inside and head back to the Impala, only to be stopped as something grabbed the back of his shirt. Suddenly, the ground was out from under his feet. He let out a half-terrified half-indignant yelp, realizing who it was. Almost as suddenly as he was picked up, he was being pressed into something warm and relatively comfortable. It took him a few seconds to realize he was being pressed into Sam's shoulder. \"Thanks, Dean.\" Sam said finally, after a minute or two of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. Just put me down. Gotta move the car.\" Dean huffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gave a slight nod. \"Right, sorry.\" Sam gently and carefully put Dean back down. \"Sorry. I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Relax a little!\" Dean cut in. Sam winced slightly. \"That's enough apologizing for one day, okay?\" Sam nodded. \"Exactly, so just take it easy, alright?\" Sam nodded again.

He pulled a handful of leaves off the tree closest to him and, with a sigh, stuffed them into his mouth. Surprised at the edible-ness of the leaves, he continued to eat until he was full. Then he sighed and got comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was a soft giggle coming from nearby. Sam turned towards the source, only to find a find little girl of 4-6. He smiled sheepishly at her and she smiled back. She then proceeded to climb up his pants leg and sit on his lap, looking for all the world as though she was sitting on the lap of a parent and not the lap of a giant, strange man. He looked around for where she may have come from to see a playground full of small children. There were some other children looking at him. He felt more than a bit embarrassed for not having seen the playground beforehand. The children looking at him began approaching, attracting the attention of even more children. The small group climbed onto his lap as well. If it weren't for the first kid sitting on his lap already, he would have already left. But now that the girl was settled he didn't have the heart to move her. And he definitely didn't have the heart to touch her for fear of hurting her. The new kids settled on his lap, followed by more and more until the playground only had six or seven kids left. His heart felt like too at this point. Some of the kids on his lap had fallen asleep and others were looking up at him with puppy dog eyes that could rival his own. The only thing he was worried about now was how the adults in charge would handle this. He knew he wouldn't be able to move until the kids got off his lap.</span></div></div>",

One started to fall sideways, so he raised his arms and used them as barricades to keep any more children from almost falling. Then he heard a shriek of alarm and flinched, jostling a few children in doing so. Three of the jostled children began to cry, having been interrupted from their naps. Sam's eyes softened and, utilizing the extreme care he had been taught and raised to have, gently picked them up held them to his chest. \"Hey, hey, hey. Don't cry, okay? I know you're tired and I'm sorry I woke you. It's okay.\" Sam murmured softly. After a minute or so of soft-spoken words and gentle hushing, the three were fast asleep, clinging to the plaid shirt so tightly he didn't want to risk trying to pry them off. So instead he looked around for the source of the shriek. His eyes widened from 'cute' to 'deer caught in headlights' as he spotted several older women that he recognized to be teachers staring and gaping at him. \"Oh crap\u2026 I-I uh\u2026\" The teachers quivered at the sound of his voice. \"H-hey. Uh\u2026d-don't freak out\u2026? Please? I-I didn't see the playground and I just stopped for breakfast and she got on my lap and I didn't know what to do. I'm scared I'll hurt them if I try to get up and I'm more scared I'll hurt them if I grab them. I didn't\u2026\" he babbled nervously. He paused, seeing the looks of disbelief and fear now replaced by amusement and unstable calm. \"M-My name's Sam. I'm just waiting for my big brother. His name's Dean and he went somewhere else for breakfast. And, as you can probably tell, I ate my veggies.\" Sam joked shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We work at the school down the block. I'm Jackie, that's June, and that's April.\" one of the teachers said, still seeming uncomfortable with him but not quite scared anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can tell teachers apart from other people easy. Too bad my life's as messed up as it is. Made it to Stanford. Had a future for two years. Then, for no reason whatsoever, my apartment catches fire and my brother shows up in time to drag me out. The fire took my girlfriend. Can't go back now. Too many memories.\" Sam muttered sadly. Shaking his head to clear the depressing thoughts away, he focused on them again. \"I take it this is a preschool class? They don't look much older than maybe kindergarten at most.\" June nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Impala pulled up as Dean stared baffledly at Sam. He'd seen the women staring at something, but to see Sam sitting so close to a playground was definitely the least expected thing he'd guessed. Sam's eyes focused on the Impala and he gave a sheepish smile. \"Damnit, Sam\u2026\" Dean muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dean. Uhhh\u2026sorry about\u2026ya' know. C-could you lend me a hand over here?\" Sam called out softly. He winced as Dean laid on the horn. \"It's not as bad as it looks. But I seriously need a hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three teachers were more startled at the honk of a car horn than at the name. But what startled them most was that the extreme height difference between the two brothers. \"That's your brother?\" April asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded and lowered one arm to tap the ground nervously. Dean facepalmed at the sight of so many kids sitting on his brother's lap. \"What!? Did you just let them all swarm on top of you?! The hell were you thinking, Sam?!!\" Dean snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam lowered his head slightly. \"I didn't see the playground. I sat down and heard giggling and this little girl climbed on my lap before I could think of anything to do. I need help getting them all down. I'm scared to try grabbing them or even just stand up.\" Sam sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean groaned. \"Of course. Leave it to you to let a bunch of kids climb on your lap. Damnit, Sammy! At least half of them are guilt-tripping me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam lowered his head even more and looked up at Dean through his bangs. \"Please, Dean? I didn't see the playground until it was too late. Just\u2026please?\"</span></div></div>",

Dean climbed on and was lifted onto Sam's lap. Sighing, Dean began carrying one kid at a time to Sam's hand. It took several handfuls to get all the children off Sam's lap. Then Dean noticed the three attached to Sam's shirt. \"Dammit.\" he muttered. Sam looked sheepishly at his brother. \"Gonna need a lift.\" Dean grumbled. Sam nodded and gave Dean a boost. Dean had some difficulty getting the children off Sam's shirt, but once he had they started crying. \"Son of a bitch. Are you fucking kidding me!?\" Sam couldn't work up the courage to glare or scold Dean for his language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three kids were down, Dean sat down, looking cross. The teachers got the kids down and led the class back to the school. Sam moved to set Dean down, but Dean didn't get down. \"Crap.

He ran after his little brother, desperate to make up for his actions. As he began nearing Sam, he began trying to get Sam's attention. \"Hey! Sammy! Come on! Stop! I gotta talk to you!\" he called up. Sam ignored him, and he knew Sam was ignoring him because Sam had started walking faster. \"Aw, come on!! Sam! Sam!! Slow down!! I need to talk to you!!\" he tried again. Sam ignored him but didn't try to walk any faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam continued walking just fast enough that Dean had to sprint to keep up until Dean's voice became unsteady. He slowed down a little, but Dean's voice remained weaker and more strained, and then it stopped altogether. Concerned, he stopped and looked back. Dean had collapsed. \"Dean?\" Sam asked worriedly, fully turning around. Dean didn't respond. Sam walked back to Dean and knelt down. \"Dean?\" he asked again, lightly nudging Dean with a finger. Dean remained limp and unmoving. Sam gently picked Dean up. \"Hey, y-you still wanna talk?\" he asked with a shaky grin, which dropped when Dean still didn't react. Sam sighed sadly and looked Dean over. Dean had overexerted himself. \"Didn't even bring a blanket\u2026\" he muttered forlornly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean woke a few hours later. Sam was awake instantly. \"Sam\u2026?\" Dean asked, voice hoarse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You collapsed. Had me worried, \u2022\u2022\u2022hole.\" Sam sighed, offering a finger to help Dean up.

All of a sudden he heard thunder, he had to cover his ears how loud it was, but the thunder kept going into a rhythm. Next thing he knows he hears his name like an explosion. \"Sammy!\" Dean called out to his little brother. \"Sammy, are you there?\" It didn't take long for Sam to know what happened, the stupid demon shrunk him. Dean walks over to where Sam was last seen and doesn't see him; he stands there totally baffled on where his brother could be. Sam's emotion immediately went from confusion to fear when he noticed two giant black Caterpillar Akon boots. Sam was frozen in fear that his protective big brother was about to stomp him like an ant. All could do was close his eyes and wait for a reaper to claim him. Then instantly the thunder stopped, Sam opened his eyes and saw one of Dean's dirty boots right in front of his face. The stench from Dean\u2019s gigantic feet was seeping through his old boots. \"Oh god dean, when was the last time you showered?\" as Sam rose his hands to cover his nose. Next thing he had to do was grab his big bro's attention. \"Dean! Dean, down here! Look down!\" but it was no use Dean was still standing there pondering where Sam could be. \"Shit! Now what? He might wonder the house and leave me here or worst crush me...\" Sam had to think quickly of what to do next and he can only of one option that he was probably going to regret.... He was going to hitch a ride on the Dean Express... It's a good thing that Sam is a good jumper with all that practice chasing monsters over tall fences. The reason why this is important is because the top of the toe of Dean's boot is a little over his head, so guessed to be about 6 centimeters. So he took a few steps back for a running start and took a huge leap onto Dean's size 10 boot. Sam went straight for the laces and hung on for dear life for what was about to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit Sammy, where the hell did you go?\u201d Dean said as he scratched his head.  \u201cI hope you went back to the hotel bro\u2026 I\u2019m supposed to protect you man.\u201d As Dean was talking to himself Sam was on his rank foot hearing the worry in Dean\u2019s voice. He never knew how much Dean truly cared for him.  The moment was interrupted when Dean started taking his first step forward towards the car. A rush of air pressed towards Sam\u2019s face as Dean\u2019s foot rose and Sam had to keep as tight grip when it descended. This rhythmic motion of Dean\u2019s feet went continuously until he reached his car. Sam was about to get motion sickness if Dean didn\u2019t stop when he did, the car was a good breather so to speak. \u201cWhat should my next move be, I can\u2019t be on Dean\u2019s foot forever\u2026.. I need to get his attention somehow. Well, common sense tells me I should shoot for the ear for Dean to hear me call for help.\u201d Sam was muttering under his breath. Sam decided to venture upward while he had the chance even though Dean is a good 180 feet tall now. From the laces of Dean\u2019s boot Sam used them as ropes to climb up to something sopping wet. At first glance it looked like a web of tangled wet string but looking at it as a whole Sam didn\u2019t like where he was. Sam found himself soaking in Dean\u2019s sock and sadly it was drenched in Dean\u2019s man sweat. \u201cGood lord Dean, do you ever take these socks off, I\u2019m going to pass out from the odor!\u201d  Just then Dean rode over a nasty pot hole on the road. \u201cFucking Christ, people need to fix the god damn road! \u201c Dean said looking back at the road in the rear view mirror. Sam was pushed into the outer layer of Dean\u2019s sock and became stuck in the web of sweaty fabric. \u201cGreat! Now I\u2019m stuck and I smell like a gym locker room!\u201d Sam struggled to free himself but it only made it worse, now all he can do is wait and watch the events unfold listening and watching everything that occurs around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean drove back to the hotel and rushed inside the room hoping to find Sam there. \u201cSammy, yo Sammy, you in here bro? Answer me man!\u201d But there was no response. This made Dean worry about his little brother even more. \u201cWhat do I do now? I have no idea where Sammy is and I have no idea where to start looking.\u201d Dean whispered to himself as he paced around the room, all the while Sam is feeling guilty making his big bro worried and nauseous from a mixture of Dean\u2019s pacing and sock sweat stink. Then thought of contacting their great friend Booby Singer, maybe he would know what to do. Dean went in his duffle bag and ruffled through to find his cell and dialed Bobby\u2019s number. \u201cHey Bobby, you haven\u2019t heard from Sammy have you?\u201d Dean asked worried. \u201cNo boy I can\u2019t say I have something the matter with Sam?\u201d  \u201cWe went out on a hunt and he disappeared after the demon muttered something in Latin and I can\u2019t locate him anywhere, I\u2019m starting to worry and I don\u2019t know if he is safe.\u201d \u201cWhoa slow down you igit and grow a pair, Sam is fine he has been in worse situations. Just try to relax and calm down and we will search for him in the morning, good night.\u201d Bobby then clicked on Dean and Dean threw his phone on the dresser with frustration. It was that Dean was alone is a hotel room with nothing to do. \u201cWhat the hell I\u2019m I suppose to do until morning, not even tired yet.\u201d Dean sits on the foot of the bed and ponders what to do next. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dean slowly approaches and says hey bro wow look at you, your huge now.  Sam doesn't say a thing and simply shys away from the attention as his brother chechs out his bulging muscles.  Dean continues to rub his brothers muscles trying to see the difference.  \"Drop your pants I want to see how built your legs are.\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   Sam slowly starts unbuttoning and unzipping his trousers and drops them down around his ankles and steps away from them.  Dean now on his knees starts feeling his thighs and shins and just how developed they are and is a bit jealous.  Then he starts thinking I wonder if it effected his cock at all and how big it got.  Not wanting to say anything he slowly starts to pull his younger brothers underwear down.  Sam a little weirded out but realizes why Dean would do this and allows his brother to continue.  Sam's huge cock now was revealed and Dean was really jealous as it dwarfed his own.  Dean looked carefully and hadn't remembered that his little brother was uncircumcised but it added to the appeal.  Slowly dean brought his hand up to his brother's flacid cock and started to feel and examine the appendage.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n   Sam didn't know what to do and Dean was so busy thinking about never having another man's penis in his hand and now here he was with his younger brother's warm huge cock.  Suddenly he don't know what came over him but he brought it closer to his face and then inserted his brothers cock in his mouth.  Sam was shocked here his older brother who was such a ladys man was with his cock in his mouth sucking him.  Before he realized it his cock began to grow and he began enjoying what his brother was doing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dean on the other hand forgot all about what was happening as he enjoyed sucking his brother's cock and especially enjoyed nursing on his loose foreskin.  He couldn't take his entire cock down his throat but he continued to try and accomplish this task.  Sam was pleased not only becaused if felt so great but it looked as though Dean was really enjoying himself as he continnued to slurp and suck like his cock was the best thing ever.  For an instant Sam felt bad for doing this having his cock in a man's mouth but then he saw the pleasure in his brother's face as Dean's mouth continued to nurse on his huge cock and looked as though there were no other place it should be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sam couldn't stop him if he wanted to so he allowed his brother to continue to suck him and just relaxed and enjoyed the immense pleasure he was bringing to him.  Dean really enjoyed his cock as he continued to go up and down over his shaft faster and faster.  Sam just started humping his face and soon Dean was able to engulf his entire huge cock down his hot wet throat.  Sam had never had anyone able to deep throat his cock and he wasn't about to complain as it brought pleasure he had never known before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sam didn't think it could get any better when he felt Dean's warm hands started to carress his hot hairy balls as he continued to suck and inhale his huge cock.  Sam knew it wouldn't last much longer if he continued to show ths much enthusiasm.  Sure enough he tightened up and Dean continued to suck and service his brother's cock as if it were a lollipop.  Sam couldn't stop it and he warned his brother as Dean just pushed forward and continued to suck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sam felt one two three four five six huge volleys of his cum erupting from his huge cock and entering his brothers warm wet throat.  Dean just swallowed and continued to suck and enjoy his brother's wonderous love tool.  Sam felt the best he had ever felt after cumming and he thought his cock would start to shrivel up soon and it would be over.  However as Dean continue to work his wonders Sam's cock remained hard as ever and Dean continued to suck with new abandonment.  Sam was in awe as usually after such an incredible orgasm he would have to recover a day but he remained hard as a rock in his older brother's talented mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dean was just as surprised as his baby brother he never thought he would enjoy this but once he started sucking his baby brother he was hooked and couldn't stop.  He especially loved the feel of his cum coating his tonsils and warming his belly.  At that point he understood that he had really done a good job and his brother liked his mouth and its work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   While Dean continued to enjoy his brother's pacifier, Sam decided maybe he should help his brother out and he moved around and started undoing Dean's pants.  Unbuckling his pants and unzipping them were easy as Dean was so busy enjoying himself he hardly noticed what his brother was doing.  Finally Sam found his package which was already rock hard and although it was much smaller and circumcised he still dove in and swallowed it whole.  Dean was surprised at the intense warmth now surrounding his happy cock he continued to nurse on Sam's huge uncut cock.  Sam at first didn't take much of a shine to it but he wanted to help his brother out and forced himself but then he started to warm up to it and eventually really started enjoying sucking his brother's smaller cock.  There the brother's were sixty nining each other's cocks like they were going out of style as they knew it wouldn't be long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Up and down on each other's cock enjoying every slurp and suck more and more and realizing that there could not be anything better.  Dean tightened up under Sam's expert nursing as Sam also did under Dean's and they both knew they were near.  Sam exploded again in his brothers mouth as Dean continued to suck and swallow as fast as he could, while Dean was thrusting his first volley of sperm into Sam's mouth which he swallowed eagerly and continued to nurse.  They continued to cum over and over again coating each others warm stomachs with their love juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dean looked over to his younger brother and said, \"Sam I know it might be a lot to ask of you but I really enjoy sucking your hot cock!  Do you think you could allow me to suck you off much more often, I mean I could suck you as often as you would like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Sam shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Dean. Let's just find a way to get you back to normal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, there cowboy,\" Dean smirked, \"I don't want to go back to normal just yet, i'm finally taller than you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dean, you're filling the hotel room and the witch is right. We'll be thrown from the town if you go outside, not to mention the only way you would be able to even go outside is to bust through the room\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean knew Sam was scared, either of the situation or of Dean and his new size, and he wanted to take care of his (now literally) little brother. But he also had a curiosity about his new size he wanted to explore. He knew he still wouldn't harm a human, but on the other hand he was a giant now, bigger than any human. </span></div></div>",

Sam looked much more uncomfortable now than earlier. \"Sorry, Sam. Just trying to get comfy.\" he muttered as he attempted to sit down. As he fell onto his backside, his boots went through the wall, barely missing Sam in the process. Screaming came from the room next door. \"Crap\u2026\" he sighed, lowering his head into his hand. \"This sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked up at Dean and back at the wall. He swallowed down as much of the rising panic and discomfort as he could. \"Yeah\u2026 maybe we'd be better off getting out of here.\" he admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean quiried an eyebrow at Sam. \"Seriously? Now you wanna get out of here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean, your feet went through the wall!

He tried to pull himself up onto one of the legs, but it wasn't working. \"I-I can't get up. I-I can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean lifted an arm, testing his mobility, and concluded that he had just enough space to help Sam up. He grabbed his little brother and pretended for both their sakes that Sam hadn't just squeaked like a little girl. He gently set Sam down as far across his legs as he could. \"Okay, I can't help you any further than that, so\u2026hurry up, okay?\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded and swallowed again. He scurried over the rest of the distance as quickly as his shakey legs would carry him. Sliding off the edge, he found his laptop\u2026lid smashed but bottom half still intact. \"No\u2026\" Sam choked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean frowned. \"What? What happened? What's wrong?\" Dean asked, urgently trying to catch sight of what had upset his brother. The second he saw the laptop, he wished he hadn't looked. He knew Sam loved the laptop almost as much as he loved Baby. \"Aw, Sammy\u2026 Hey, we can get looked at. See if it can be fixed. Huh? We'll get it fixed up.\" Dean murmured, watching his brother with empathy. Sam was still for a few seconds before nodding. \"Now you get outta here. I'm gonna get myself out.\" Sam nodded again and choked out a half-sob. \"It's gonna be okay, Sammy, just you watch.\" Dean pressed. Sam nodded again, grabbed the duffel bags and his partially destroyed laptop and the car keys, and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam opened the trunk and put the duffel bags in, then carefully placed his laptop inside too. There was a heavy thud, and another, and another. Sam looked over to see the wall of the motel room cracking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean rammed his elbow into the wall again. He could feel it giving out a little more each time. He rammed it again two more times. It was a massive dent now, and he was sure just a couple more whacks and he'd be out. He took a deep breath and gave this hit as much strength and momentum as he could. The wall collapsed and gave him just enough room to pull himself out.</span></div></div>",

He pulled himself out slowly but surely. Once his legs were out, he stood up\u2026and watched as everything around him began rapidly dropping away. Sam was staring at his laptop, shoulders slumped and shaking slightly. Dean kept his mouth shut, deciding it would be better if he waited until he stopped growing since it had scared Sam the first time through. But it didn't seem to be. He looked at the motel, only to realize he was taller than the motel's neon sign. He was starting to feel anxious and worried. The only thing still bigger than him were the skyscrapers. And they weren't going to maintain that status for much longer. He glanced down to check on his little brother, Sam was still in the same state as when he'd started. He glanced back at the nearest skyscraper. The roof was now at his eye level. But it wasn't lowering any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean sighed in relief and crouched down to check on Sam. Still no change. Dean gingerly gripped Sam's jacket collar with his forefinger and thumb and lifted him. Sam squeaked in panic and wriggled and squirmed, trying to free himself. \"Shhh. It's okay, Sammy. Just take it easy.\" Dean murmured as he brought his little brother to his shoulder and gently, yet firmly, pressed him against it. \"I gotcha, Sammy. I gotcha. It's gonna be okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stopped fighting as the voice hit his senses like water. He relaxed, reached his arms up and over (as far they would reach) Dean's shoulder, and pressed back as much as he could. \"Thanks, Dean.\" he said tiredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean smirked and wrapped his hand around Sam. \"Need you to shut the trunk. We gotta get outta here.\" he explained, lowering Sam to the ground. He released Sam behind the car. Sam nodded and shut the trunk. \"Alright, you gonna stay calm this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just\u2026I think it's like a 'have to see it coming' thing.\" Sam mumbled sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean nodded once, agreeing that it made sense, and wrapped his hand around Sam. \"Alright, you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think so. Umm, be careful about picking the Impala up. Like, really really careful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. The laptop's your baby. The Impala's mine.

Gravity shifted and Sam tumbled against the side of the pocket, then tumbled back to the bottom again. Sam was biting his lower lip hard enough to draw blood just trying to avoid screaming at how much more intense the pain had become. Gravity shifted back and forth, ramming Sam into the solid wall of flesh, bone, and muscle that was his brother. Sam fought against the rising nausea, but it was a losing battle between fighting both the pain in his ankle and the sickening and painful movements his brother was causing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean looked down at the car as he closed the pocket he had just dropped Sam into. Bending over, he considered the best way to pick it up, then rolled his eyes and picked it up anyway. He stood up, making sure his baby was balanced well enough to avoid any possible damage to Sam's already damaged laptop. Giving brief consideration to who he should go to for help, he headed for Bobby's home. He brushed off the idea of checking on Sam, deciding Sam's silence was understandable under the circumstances. As he walked, he realized he had no idea which direction he was headed. But years of hunting all over America had made him more than capable of recognizing any familiar landmarks the would help him make his way to Bobby's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was jarred again from his near-unconsciousness as Dean paused and, most likely, turned, if the sudden slam into the side of the pocket was anything to go off of. It jarred his already sprained ankle and he quickly acknowledged that any more damage would result in a broken ankle. The nausea wasn't letting up either. Sam was delirious at this point, but with the lack of light it didn't seem to matter. He was barely managing to avoid vomiting already, and was beginning to almost pray for unconsciousness. Dean must have turned again, because he suddenly slammed into the other side of the pocket. Another turn, and Sam felt the pain in his ankle become nearly unbearable. Then a abrupt stop slammed him into the front of the pocket again, resulting in a chain reaction of sorts. A painful crack came from the abused ankle, drawing out an agonized scream from Sam, cut off quickly by the violent upheaval of all his stomach contents and a merciful loss of consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean stopped in front of Bobby's house, relieved to see that Bobby's truck was there, only for the relief to be cut short by a scream from his little brother. Setting the Impala down quickly but not quickly enough to damage anything, he opened the pocket up enough to peek in, and winced at the sight that greeted him. There was a large puddle of green covering most of the bottom of the pocket.  Carefully, he reached in and plucked Sam out. Sam was limp, but unmistakably injured. Looking closer, he noticed the swelling and notiably broken ankle. \"Sammy?\" Dean asked softly, concerned and nervous since he now realized he couldn't patch his little brother up anymore. Sam didn't respond. Dean looked down at the house below. \"Bobby!! I need some help out here!!\" </span></div></div>",

Dean\u201d Sam said heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean continued to suck and this caused his thighs, ass pubic, balls, back, and legs to grow hairier within 2 minutes. Dean\u2019s feet grew hairy as a werewolf, his thick, smelly aroma on his feet grew stronger. The hair on his toes grew thicker. The more Dean sucked, the more he\u2019d grow hairier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of sudden, Sam felt his self about to cum. \u201cOhhhh... fuckkk. DEAAAAAN.... Aghhhh\u201d Sam said as he cummed into Dean\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean took every drop and swallowed every single gallon of cum. Sam was worried about how much he cummed.

I\u2019m hairy af and im starting to feel the growth\u201d Said Dean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean felt his self growing bigger. Dean started to fill the room with his growth. Dean was now hunched to the roof with his feet against the other wall. Sam was ontop of Dean\u2019s dick when it started to grow. Fom 38 inches it started to grow thicker and longer. Within a minute, his dick grew to 90 inches. His balls increased to the size of the balls that is at Target. His dick filled the room. The room started to now smell as Dean was sweating more and more. This turned Dean and Sam on. Sam was scared because Dean\u2019s muscle started to grow bigger. Dean\u2019s shouldes grew more broad and his traps grew humongous. Dean could do nothing, but grunt in pain. His pecs started to over take Dean\u2019s face. His nipples grew hard and sensitive to the touch. he grew a 14 pack. His thights grew as thick as some trees, so did his calves. His feet was about 20 inches and it grew to 40 inches. Dean\u2019s forearms grew as thick as a tree, just like his deltoids. Dean\u2019s bicep and tricep were fucking huge. He had a triple bicep. He had veins everywhere snaking up him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chuh huh huh huh, Sam, fucking look at me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam has always known Dean was a little pudgy, and not with muscle. He even took account for the past few months, when the pudge became chub, allthough still small. Dean's appetite was increasing, that's all. Eating more than 10 pies a day will most certainly have a toll on you, and Dean has obviously suffered these affects.<br>\r\nThis, however, was crazy. Impossible. As Sam gently rolled over his brother, a full blown gut came along with him, as the top of the t-shirt crinkled into folds at the top. It had to be a good 40 cm away from him, and fuzzed with small hairs. his belly button had gotten bigger, and there seemed to be a bite mark on the side of it. His moobs, once just barely noticeable, had ballooned out, so they were near spherical. Dean had a double chin  coming on, and his cheeks were pudgy. Not only those cheeks, but his ass had grown too large for his underwear, as they've ripped the sides. His ass was firm, and humongous. His thighs were like tree trunks.<br>\r\nSam was in shock, as Dean continued snoring, oblivious to his size. \"how did this happen?\" Sam thought aloud, as he inspected the bellybutton. <br>\r\nSam didn't know what to think. He was too conflicted, honestly. The sensible side of him wanted to wake dean, show him what happened, find the thing that did this, and kill it. The other side of him, the more private side, however...<br>\r\nDean was all ready gorgeous. He was model material, with a plump ass and bulge to go with his looks. But what Sam loved was his appetite. Watching Dean whorf down food in one sitting was such a joy. Dean decided it was time consuming to swallow, and Sam has noticed that he can now just swallow foods if they're soft enough- for example, his beloved pies. He just squashes it into his mouth- he must of stretched his cheeks, somehow-, took a drink of whatever was there (usually Melted Ice Cream), and swallowed. <br>\r\nThe first few times, he choked a lot, but after practise, he never does. It just goes down his thick throat, and into his pudge. Dean took to belly rubs, and liked to burp or fart as loud and as long as he could. Sam swore he saw a boner sometimes.<br>\r\nHe loved every minute of it. What Sam would give to be his feeder, for Dean to be so huge... For Dean to smother him with his gut is Sam's dream. And it's came true! Sam could feel his dick hardening. <br>\r\nHe reached out a hand, and ever so cautiously, touched his brother's hairy gut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed to have the mind and eyes of a human, but its strength was beyond that of a normal werewolf. It landed a few solid punches in Dean's stomach and then smacked him around a bit, knocking him to an alley wall. Dean's breath left his body, and he felt a burning pain in his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam quickly came to the resure by jumping onto the creature's back and shoving a syringe into its neck. The creature fell to the ground and slowly returned to its nude human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam helped Dean up, and Dean instinctively took a look at his burning arm. He lifted up his shirt expecting to find blood, but instead found three pink scars that looked as if they'd been there for years, perfectly healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Dean asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean, that thing scratched you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no shit, Sherlock,\" Dean retorted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Dean, you don't get it. A bite from a werewolf turns you into a werewolf. But a scratch . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was cut off when a strange rumbling came from his body. His pecs began shaking beneath his shirt and he began to howl. His body remained smooth and hairless as that of the naked man lying in the street, but his muscles began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs were the first to inflate, growing to the size of boulders. Next were his arms, which turned into loaded cannons. His abs were next, turning from a six pack to a stong, well-defined eight pack. And then his calves, thighs and glutes grew big and strong. His mountains of muscles soon loomed over Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen . . .</span></div></div>",

Dean replied, 'so what you've put on some to chubby' dean was right Sam had also put on a few pounds. It's been 5 years since they closed off heaven and he'll so Sam was now 37 and dean is 41. Dean said, 'this is life we get older than fatter.' They have put on 15 pounds each. And they are loving in a house, dean and Sam being managers of a car repair shop. Life was smoother without monsters attacking every week. The door opened and castiel (human age 39) walked in he was human now and their house mate  he ripens a radio show. 'Hey bros' cas said he was eating a super sized hamburger with jumbo fries and a large vanilla shake, he's also gained some pounds with the brothers, 'hey cas' they both said. Than Sam said, 'cad I have dinner on the table for us  and your eating fast food' 'what can you say Sam human food taste good.' Cas scratches his beginner gut.<br>\r\nThe next day <br>\r\nIt was work and it was a slow day both the brothers were on their third triple patty burger and Sam said to dean, 'did you at anytime see us doing this in life I mean it's that I pictured being married and being a father to 5 year old by now.' Dean said, 'Sam just be happy your alive and Mabel if she's blind enough she'll dig You.' Sam flipped off dean. <br>\r\nCastiel was on break eating a doughnut and an intern came by and said, 'good job out there cas the fans just seem to love you and I can see you sure love food' cas pats his small belly laughing, 'yeah I sure do the bigger the soul the bigger the waist'. <br>\r\nAt the Barthes guys got together. They all ordered wings a few rounds of beers.<br>\r\nFive baskets of onion rings and wings later.<br>\r\nSam leaned back patting his gut, 'uh that was good' dean said, 'told ya you get used to this' and cas just belched.</span></div></div>",

Dean scratching his gut, 'yeah sure bro' dean walked off and castiel walked by with a ill fitting collard shirt said, 'Sam can I go with you?' 'Yeah sure cas'. They went to jc penny and got new clothes. Sam had bigger jeans and a plaid button up shirt with the sevens rolled up and cas had a black shirtsleeved shirt with khaki shorts around his meatier thighs. They were at a diner on thier 2nd jumbo burger and castiel brought up, 'hey sam there is girl that I'm seeing that I got a date with but she has this friend that wants join in and I was wondering if you can be her date?' Sam scratching his fuller face said, 'sure I need get this bad boy back in the saddle' he starts slapping his full gut.<br>\r\n7:30<br>\r\nSam was dressed in white blue button shirt and jeans he was combing his hair dean walks in and says, 'hey Sam what you dressed up for?'

Cas was wearing a white button up shirt with a brown waistcoat which wrapped around his belly over his filling black pants. Cas said, 'ya ready?'

His shirt just straining over a hairy beer gut and meaty arms and blue jeans fitting around his thicker thighs and bigger ass. He looked in the mirror and saw changes in his face, he saw some fat on his chin and chubbier cheeks and his hair hade some gray to it. He walked into the living room and saw Sam and cas watching tv. It's been 2 months since their date and things had been going steady and both Sam and cas had got more heft to their frames. Sam has a round spare tire and love handles, a softened chest and a double chin. Cas had a  rotund guy and he was filling his chino pants. Dean said, 'hey guys I saw an add for a new all you can eat Buffett and I was thinking if y'all want to join me.' Sam and cas said yes.<br>\r\nAt the Buffett they got a table because the booths look a little small for them to fit in. They each all got a huge stack of food.

Back in the Middle Ages this was a sign of success.' Cas was pinching his flab and Sam just patted his a the though of it.
