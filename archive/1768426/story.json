Ready for your journey?\u201d He asked your formally. He was, of course, a Lucario and well known in the village. Some citizen though of him as a a proud man who raises his child strict and with discipline. \u201cGood morning dad. Uhm.. Yes I packed my stuff yesterday already.\u201d you answered him with a little bit uneasiness in your voice. Actually you weren't ready for it but here is absolutely no way you could tell him that. They morning pasted pretty standard with the exception that your neighbors came over and wished you good luck and told some more or less helpful tips about surviving in the wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished everything you planned to do before breaking up were told to meet up with the major at the village center. It was also part of the tradition that the major wishes the young Pokemon which are leaving the village good luck and present them a small gift might be useful on the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your back make and make your way out of the house and through the streets to the marketplace where u suppose to met the major. As you arrived there you could already see the major. He was a old Alakazam. He greeted your friendly. \u201cHello there young one. I hope you had a good morning. Here this is for you.\u201d greeted you by using telepathy and handed you over a small package. After you opened it you held an little white shimmering crystal in your paws. You were wondering what it supposed to be but your thought got interrupted by the Alakazam. \u201cFrom this moment you are on your own. I wish you luck my little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuffed the crystal into your backpack and then you planned in which direction you want to  set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could leave the village to the west into the forest which lead into inner parts of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also could leave the village to the north and try your luck in the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last option was to go east where the sea was.

You hoped your parents came to wish you also good luck or just be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at the gate and of course you looked back still hoping that your father or mother showed up. But nothing... It was always this way, your parents where to proud to show afraid to shed a tear. To be honest you were quiet happy that you can escape the strict rules of your parents and make your own decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step through the gate your journey has finally begun. You follow the small dusty road which leads directly into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the forest you can finally leave the open road. It was a hot summer day and you enjoyed the cooler air here in the forest than the one in the open. On the other hand your vision was obscured by all the trees and bushes. But you weren't afraid of anything. You never heard about something dangerous around the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about two hours wandering through the forest you get hungry. Of course you could eat some of your supplies but you decided instead to look for some fruits and to safe your stuff for emergencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found some bushes with delicious looking berries.

You don't know what else to to do. The Meganium moved it's head down, closer to you. You consider to run away, but your were to scared to stand up. It was strange. Normally you wouldn't be afraid and also normally stay your ground. Maybe it was this way because you know that your parents could not help you or maybe because you never had such big \u201copponent\u201d than this Meganium. \u201cOh don't be afraid little one.\u201d The Meganium suddenly said ti you.

On a journey to become adults, they said.\u201d The Meganium told you and you were listing carefully. But your not really surprised about that. The forest was close the to village so it would be strange if none of the previouse children din't passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI'm just happy that the first person I meet, doesn't want to eat me or doe something else to me.\u201d you said with relief. The Meganium gave you some strange look and you got nervous again. \u201cIf you wish I could eat you.\u201d she said. And to be honest the fact that she talked so freely about it scared you more than the fact to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at and started to giggle a bit as she saw your fear and confusion. \u201cThe one I ate before you said, they liked it very much.\u201d You were indeed confused. What hell was she talking about? Did she eat some of the children before him? It almost sounds as of they survived her belly. It was strange.

You watch the vine approaching and as it reaches you it moves slowly around you once and then it wraps softly around your waist. The grip on your body wasn't very strong but strong enough to lift you into the air.

Tell me your name.\u201d  She asked while you dangle with your feet in the air. For some strange reason you feel quiet comfortable in her grip.

Just relax and enjoy the trip.\u201d she said to you and open her wet maw. Normally you should scream and fighting back to avoid the maw but hold still and just watch the gaping maw closing in. You could feel the warm mushy smelling breath of the Dino. As maw was close by you saw the tongue playfully whipping up and down and reaching for your face. As the warm meaty tongue touches your snout your shiver for a moment but then you fell it quiet pleasant. Meganium used that tongue to lick all over your face. You enjoy the washing tongue, the warm and wet feeling all over your face. You didn't see that your head was already inside the maw of Meganium. You only realized that as the jaws clamp down on your shoulders. It came suddenly that you flinched for a moment but you almost instantly relaxed again as you feel the tongue moving underneath you wrapping itself around your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass Pokemon used it' vine to push you deeper into it's maw. Meganium raised her head upwards and retracted her vine which was used to hold you in place. You were hanging up side down in her wet fleshy and warm maw and your feet and tail were dangling in the air. It didn't take long and they also were drawn into the broad maw of the Meganium. Her cheeks were bulging out a little as she starts to push you around in her maw with that meaty tongue of hers. You could hear her humming quietly while enjoying your rich taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments the movement of the tongue stopped and suddenly you start to slide head first in the direction of the throat.

With another gulp she sends in your shoulders and your head made a nice little bulge at the downside of her neck. While you were halfway inside her neck she to use her tongue to lick your feet. It tickled and you had to laugh a little bit, which was difficult in her tight throat. Then Meganium took another deep gulp and only your toes and half of you tail were remaining in her maw. With another swallow you were completely entrap in her throat.  Strong muscles were slowly pressing downwards to your destination. The warm and wet massage you received by the muscle let you chitter happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a noticeable squirming bulge slowly traveling down along the long neck of the Meganium. She was humming and enjoyed your movement inside her throat and then she used one of her vines to nudge the bulge a little bit. The bulge disappeared into the body of the Meganium.  After sometime, which felt like hours for you, you were pressed through a tight ring. With plop you landed in the belly of your predator. The stomach was already half filled with acid which was working on the recently devoured berries. To Your surprise it didn\u2019t hurt you there was just a really light tingle on the part of your body which had already contact to the acid. \u201cJust relax now and enjoy your stay in there.\u201d You hear her voice even through walls of your temporary home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But this was different the slimy stomach walls and the heat of her body made yourself feel safe and comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingle on your body parts which were submerge in the acid was a strange funny feeling but it also told you that the belly of the Meganium was  slowly working on your body, digesting you and turning you into nutrients and energy for her.

Her belly was swinging a bit from side to side and it felt almost like lying in a hammock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the movement stopped and instead you were suddenly squeezed a little bit by the stomach walls. Apparently Meganium found a place to rest and lay down. Then the belly started to shake a little bit and pulled even tighter around you. It was still quite comfortable but your movement was limited to some wiggle and squirming.  Meganium let out a rich belch as she laid down which caused the shaking in her belly. You couldn\u2019t do much more than wiggle a little bit around to please her. After an half hour so you couldn\u2019t resist anymore and you slowly drift into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t see or even feel anymore how your body slowly breached apart by the work of the acid.

It slowly came back into your mind. You were recently devoured and digested. The scary thing about it was that you liked it so much that you actually hoped that it will happen again. Funny what you have become on your first day of the journey. You decided to rest a little longer against her belly and to wait until she wakes up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, little one.

How did you do that?\u201d you were totally excited as you spoke to her. Meganium laughed happily as she listened to you.  \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything special. Tell me little one, did you also received a strange crystal before you left the village?\u201d She asked and you were wondering what she meant by that. Luckily Meganium remembered to take your backpack with her as she searched for a place to digest you. You searched in the backpack for that crystal but it was gone. \u201cOhm\u2026 Yes I had one but I can\u2019t find it right now.\u201d You said while still searching in your backpack. \u201cYou won\u2019t find the crystal anymore. As you \u201cdied\u201d in my belly the crystal shattered and gave you its power. From now on you will always reform once digested.\u201d She explained to you. You were confused. As far you understand from now you don\u2019t have to worry anymore about predators. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that before you devoured me?\u201d you asked with curiosity. \u201cOh, I just was curios whether you were willing to feed yourself to me or not.\u201d She explained and you thought that she was a little bit weird but on the other side you were even weirder that you allowed it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me please, but I need to carry on my journey. I hope you understand that. \u201c You carefully explained to her. She gave you a sad look probably she hoped you would stay a little bit longer so she might devour you once more. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the way it should be\u2026 Well, feel free to pass by if you need a belly to rest. \u201c she said and nudged you with her snout. You gave her a last hug and then you grabbed your backpack and left her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still thinking about the fact that you actually like to be devoured you wander around in the forest you guess you\u2019re going west again but with all these trees you weren\u2019t able to determine which direction you actually went.

After you finished dinner you decided to go to sleep in you tent. It wasn\u2019t as pleasant as the belly of the Meganium but it was still okay.

You were bulging out Seviper\u2019s neck as you descend deeper into it. Soon your feet disappeared in the serpent\u2019s greed maw.

As you try to figure out what it might be it seems it has already spotted you. As it comes slowly closer you thought about running away, but something told you not to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seems like an eternity took in reality only a minute or so but then you can clearly see what is was. It was the most beautiful thing you ever have seen. It was Milotic and it scales were shimmering in the bright moonlight. As it was close it looked down at with it\u2019s redishpink eyes. You had to take a few steps back to look into her face because she was really giant compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting what the night brings to my lake.\u201d She started in a really nice voice. But you couldn\u2019t see moving her maw or something like that. So she was talking right into your mind by using telepathy. \u201cWhat takes a little Riolu out here deep into the woods?\u201d she asked polite. You weren\u2019t sure what to do. On the one hand the presence of the Milotic was mind numbing but on the other hand something was telling you to get away. In the end you decided to talk to her. \u201cUhm\u2026 I\u2019m coming from village to the east and I\u2019m on a journey. I liked the lake so i decided to rest for the night here.\u201c  She lowered her head close to you almost piercing you with her deep eyes. \u201cAhh\u2026 I see so the beauty of water has drawn you to me. You have a very good taste little one.\u201c As she spoke you realize that she has started to move her long and almost gigantic serpent body onto the dry and around you.

The thick coil entrapped you whole body and only head was visible. The grip onto your body wasn\u2019t very strong, though. It might still be possible to escape if you wish to do so but your mind was affected by Milotic\u2019s seduction. \u201cI\u2019m Starla and the queen of this forest and I welcome you to my home.\u201d She explained telepathically to you. \u201cMy name is Senji, your highness.

Form the place where her lips connected to your head a very hot spread out. At first it ran through your whole head, through your neck and into your chest. From there it spread further down your body and in your arms and even into your tail. Milotic continued that kiss for a while and with each second your body felt hotter and hotter and for a moment you thought that you were burning. As she withdrew her lips form your forehead the heat slowly started to disperse. Then she draws herself to her full height. \u201cWell then my little one. Your first order will be to give me a nice massage from the inside.\u201d Then you were lift into the air almost at the same height as Milotic\u2019s head was. \u201cWhat do you mean, giving you massages from the inside, your highness?\u201d you asked.

As long as you will serve me you will not die by getting eaten alive and digested.\u201d Before you could say anything she opened her maw and reached with her meaty wet tongue for you. She licked all over your head and tasting you. \u201cYes, you will serve me well.\u201d She muttered to herself. You enjoyed the licking for a while and you were completely coated in salvia.

Mighty muscles were pulling on your head and soon on your shoulders too. Milotic enjoyed your taste and was playing with her tongue on your toes, tickling you. She took her time to let you slide in her throat. It was obvious that you both enjoyed how the strong muscle in her throat slowly worked on you pushing you deeper and deeper. Sadly you didn\u2019t create much of a bulge in Milotic\u2019s neck. You loved it being inside of her throat. It was warm and soft, okay the goo and all that saliva was a little bit nasty. With sudden shock you realized that you almost forgot to wiggle and squirm inside of her. Starla really seems to enjoy your movement as she was humming and smiling brightly. The bulge was slowly traveling down, wiggling and squirming. The bulge disappeared within a broader section of Milotic\u2019s long and powerful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles were pushing you forward until you entered a section which wasn\u2019t as tight as the throat but still the walls were providing unique feeling, almost as laying in your sleeping bag but much hotter and warmer. Okay the gurgling and the noise of her mighty heart beat was a little bit irritating but nothing to worry about. You stretched out and tried to turn yourself onto your back much to Milotic\u2019s enjoyment. Beside some squirming and enjoying there wasn\u2019t much to do except waiting. It was anyway strange that there was light within Milotic\u2019s belly which was a little bit frightening because you will probably see the whole digestion process. You don\u2019t know how long it took but after a while some green yellowish goo was produced by the stomach. The goo was covering you whole body soon you feel a slight tickling sensation as the goo made contact with your skin. Milotic moved herself in a more comfortable position.

Submitting to the pressure of the stomach and the acid working on your skin and flesh. You just lay there and watching how you slowly disappear. Normally you should scream in vain hoping to get regurgitate you but there was only the broad smile on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sometime you decided to return to your sleep hoping that you will reform after you have been digested. Over the next two days you were slowly digested by the Milotic providing it with some useful nutrients and with your life energy. Sadly she lied to you and you won\u2019t reform after the digestion process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your story ends here in the belly of one of the most beautiful Pokemons on the planet. At least it was for both fun you enjoyed as much as the Milotic did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For you, each birthday represented you coming one year closer to today\u2026 the day that you would have to finally wander off from the village, leaving your family and friends behind as you ventured towards what felt like certain doom. It doesn\u2019t help that you were just generally an anxious person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been overwhelmed by anxiety for this day all year\u2026 but by now, you were just numb, glancing over at your backpack dejectedly as you laid in bed. Stupid village. Stupid ritual. Why are they making you leave? None of the other kids seemed to mind leaving, granted, but you? You don\u2019t want to go. As you contemplated this, you didn\u2019t even notice the entire night pass you by. You had gotten so caught up in your thoughts that you only snapped out of it when you noticed the morning\u2019s sunlight pouring in through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Now, not only were you going to have to brave the big, scary world, you were going to have to do it on no sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, honey\u2026 you didn\u2019t get a wink of sleep last night, did you?\u201d Your father, an umbreon, frowned as you stumbled down into the living room, bags under your eyes and your pack lazily slung over your back. He sighed as he sat down across from you at the table. \u201cYou know what I\u2019ve been telling you. When I was your age, I felt the exact same way. But you know what? Everything turned out just fine. And you\u2019re even tougher and smarter than I was, so I know you\u2019ll do great out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t even bother to reply to him, just staring downwards with a frown on your face. In response, he just nuzzles your side. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. You\u2019re gonna look back on this day and wonder why you were ever worried,\u201d he said simply, before hopping down and heading towards the pantry. \u201cBut I know we\u2019re not gonna see eachother for awhile. Which is why I made you your favorite\u2026\u201d Your moping was disrupted as a delicious fragrance reached your nostrils\u2026 and you looked up to see a huge tray of muffins plopped down in front of you! \u201cSitrus berry muffins! Eat as many as you like, sweetheart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at his smiling face for a moment, before sighing, unable to resist. \u201cThanks, dad\u2026\u201d With that, you started to reluctantly chow down, stuffing the delicious muffins into your maw in the hopes of quelling your anxieties. It works alright\u2026 but before you know it, you\u2019ve burned through your entire plate! You let out a shuddering burp as you lean back in your chair, grunting as you knead your paws into your big, stuffed full belly. Well\u2026 at least you won\u2019t have to eat anything else today\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, it was off to the town gates. You huffed and puffed as your now huge, round belly swayed beneath you with every step, but eventually, you made it to the crowd of Pokemon that had been waiting for you. They all cheered and wished you good luck, and gave you all sorts of gifts and trinkets to take with you on your travels. All the while, you did your best to fake a smile, trying to act like you were actually excited to leave, like most kids were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe celebration was over mercifully quickly, and soon, all that was left was for your dad to give you one last, big, long hug. \u201cI love you, sweetheart. Never forget that.\u201d He whispers. And with that, you just have to walk away, out into the forest, while everyone in town stands at the gate, happily waving you goodbye. You want to take one last look at the village, but you don\u2019t dare turn around\u2026 if you did, they\u2019d all see just how much you were crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven once you were out of eyesight, you kept walking for as long as you could, but eventually, you just had to collapse onto your heavy belly and bury your face in your paws, so you could let it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, kid. Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you look up to see a pudgy raichu looming over you, looking vaguely concerned when he sees how red your eyes are. You were embarrassed to be seen like this. You had no idea how long you\u2019ve been crying. But that embarrassment was quickly replaced with fear! You remembered that you weren\u2019t supposed to trust the Pokemon on the outside! Terrified, you backed away a bit\u2026 but he just patted your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, c\u2019mon. No need to get all scared. If I wanted to eat ya or something, I would\u2019ve already,\u201d he says confidently, trying to soothe your fears. You cringe when he reaches down a paw and takes a handful of your belly, squishing and kneading it a bit. \u201cAlthough honestly, with a belly like this, you\u2019d definitely be scrumptious. Hah!\u201d With that, he leaned his head back and let out a big, jolly, guttural laugh, patting his own belly happily. This, obviously, failed to reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-just...\u201d You whimper. \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned, crossing his arms. \u201cOh, c\u2019mon. You just got kicked out of that village, right? You\u2019re probably scared, confused, alone\u2026 don\u2019t you need a place to stay?\u201d You wanted to ask how he knew that, but before you could speak up, he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of pals in a comfy cabin just a lil north of here. If you\u2019d be willing to do some chores for us, we\u2019d be happy to keep you fed and safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, unable to help considering it. He\u2026 was a little creepy, but\u2026 he did seem nice. And like he said, if he had bad intentions, he would\u2019ve just grabbed you already. Besides, you were really desperate not to have to take on this big, scary world all by yourself. You knew it was crazy, but some part of you wanted to trust him...</span></div></div>",

You were scared, and you were confused...but perhaps you did not have to be alone. You had your doubts, to be sure, but you were willing to give this stranger the benefit of the doubt, if only because he was the clearest path to go on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu gave you a warm smile and rubbed a paw over your head, trying to calm you down. \u201cNah, you\u2019re too cute to eat.\u201d He smirked as he slowly wrapped his arms around your body, pulling you into a hug. You gasped a bit from shock, but soon eased into the hug and returned it, your small form sinking into his chubby, white belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you\u2026\u201d You offered, scared that you may have been too trusting, but happy nonetheless that you had someone to lean on in this big world now. \u201cSo...where do you live?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu gave out a content sigh, enjoying the feel of your body pressed up against him, and relieved that you had warmed up to him. He debated on how to respond, going through several different responses in his head before responding. \u201cMy cabin is not too far from here. Follow me, it\u2019s just a half hour walk.\u201d He released you from his hold and gestured to you to follow him as he walked towards his home. Hesitantly, you walk up behind him, getting further and further away from your old village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you walked along the forest path, you decide to break the rather pregnant silence in the air by making some small talk. \u201cSo, w-what were you doing around the village? Half an hour is kinda a long way to walk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu noticed the slight stutter you seemed to still possess, but didn\u2019t bring it up \u201cThe berry bushes around that place come full bloom every couple of weeks. You caught me on my on one of my runs. It takes a lot to keep guts like ours filled for long, you know~\u201d The Raichu patted his ample belly again, letting out a soft murr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuts? Like, plural?\u201d You question, a little bit of fear creeping up on your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like I said I gotta cabin with a couple of pals. You can stay for as long as you like, as long as you do a little bit of work.\u201d The Raichu explains, trying to be as gentle about the topic as possible. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be too bad. Besides, as cute as you are, you\u2019ll be a smash hit with the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kinda work? I\u2019m ready to do it, I just...wanna know what It is before I start.\u201d You walk up to the Raichu\u2019s side to get a better look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lay down the ground rules when we get there. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The Raichu rested his flabby arm on your head, flattening your ears against your skull, using his other free hand to pick a piece of berry from his teeth. \u201cI promise, you\u2019re gonna just love it there. Oh, where are my manners, I never asked for your name!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s...A-akira\u2026\u201d You try to look away from the Raichu\u2019s gaze, but his paw on your head kept you from moving it too far. \u201cWhat's your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkira\u2026\u201d The Raichu slowly dragged out the name, almost as if he was tasting it. \u201cSounds pretty, like a sunset. A fitting name for pretty gal~\u201d He didn't give you his name, but you didn\u2019t want to press further. You wanted this \u2018relationship\u2019 to be as conflict free as possible. His terms of endearment did elicit a bluish to rise to your cheeks, but you couldn't shake this creepy feeling you had about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finally manage to make it to the Cabin. It was a standard affair, not to big and not to small, and far away from any apparent civilization surrounded by a thick grove of trees. The Raichu led you up the steps to the porch, and you took your seat on a nearby chair as you waited for him to introduce you to...whoever was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was inside the Cabin, anyways?</span></div></div>",

Her chubby legs were pillowing against your body until she let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila brought you upstairs to her room. Looking around, it seemed quite quaint, but you could tell she was easily hiding something from you. As soon as she walked in, she sat down with you, and hugged you softly again. It was like lying in the comfiest bed you've ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-U-Uh...\" You stuttered as she let go<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Lila asked politely, \"Am I hugging you too much?

Her saliva drips onto your face a bit, as you stay frozen. She closes the gaping maw, and laughs a bit \"Looks like you enjoy it, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe once again opens her maw, this time, licking you slowly across the face. Her mouth starts wrapping around your face, as you accept what's happening. You are speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, your head crawls down her throat, as your legs start coming into her mouth. Your head slips into her stomach, as the rest of your body comes in after. Your surroundings are currently tight. You watch as the hole above you closes, giving you no escape but down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee~\" Lila giggles, patting her belly softly. She doesn't let out a single burp, which is pretty odd. \"You can relax, cutie~\" She says flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're piled up in a hot Raichu's stomach.<br>\r\nWow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, are you going to relax, or try to get out now?</span></div></div>",

Hopefully for  your sake Twi gets here first since if Oan eats gets here first he will eat you, and you will be digested.\" Lila mumbled, though you were already asleep,  and therefore did not hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up as a loud gulp sounds around you, and you can hear the storm outside of Lila, as you look up and see a Pichu head popping into the stomach thouggh it was to dark to see which one, and unknown to you to dark to see which  one will eat the remains of the food, and you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwi: good  you will be safe in her stomach as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOan: oh, oh you will be digested in his stomach</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The main room of the Raichu\u2019s cabin was dark and in shadows. Blotted out swells of some furniture rose from the wooden floor in the dim absence of light. Hugging against the far wall was a staircase that revealed an overhead banister. Drawn across each window was a heavy curtain, and the hanging chandelier from the ceiling had been turned off. Akira went into the room against her judgment, and the electric mouse followed her, closing the door behind him. The room than became almost entirely pitch black, with only slivers of thin bright emanating from the cracks in the window shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan there was a shuffle of movement. Footfalls, heavy ones at that. Soon after that, the lights came on, and Akira found herself in between two other Pokemon, neither of which was the Raichu. There was a shout of \u201cBoo!\u201d that made the female Eevee leap backwards in shock and surprise, inadvertently fumbling up against the soft body of the electric mouse\u2019s belly. \u201cWh-what the heck?!\u201d The young girl exclaimed to nobody in particular, running around to face her host with a hundred questions on her tongue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d The Raichu cut her off with a warm smile on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSu-surprise?\u201d Akira echoed with a fearful stammer. \u201cI don\u2019t...what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is your welcome party, of course.\u201d The Raichu announced as if it was matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-huh?!\u201d Akira contorted her face in confusion and anxiety. The Raichu, now releasing a mischievous grin that he had been concealing all this time, explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I was only telling the half truth when I said that I was just getting berries earlier. We\u2019re always on the lookout for Pokemon coming from Sierras. I was just a little Pichu when I left when I was ten, but than I met these guys!\u201d. The Raichu gestured to the other Pokemon in the Room, prompting Akira to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Akira\u2019s left was a fairly enormous Greninja who must have been a few hundred pounds over what a normal one would look like. His amphibian skin was a deep sky blue with a cream white stomach that projected out a couple feat, a rotund body supported by thick limbs. Crimson eyes move up and down in his sockets as he looked over her body with an approving glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Akira\u2019s left stood a Snorlax, whose body took up most of the room alone, easily the tallest of the Pokemon quadruplet. He gut was the roundest and most defined, but at the same time was well muscles in his arms and legs, as stumpy as they were to support his weight. He leaned in with a casual hunger in his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu draped his arm across Akira\u2019s back and, against her protests, walked her into the center of the room to be closer to the two strangers. \u201cAkira, I want to introduce you to my best friends in the whole world. This here is Peter,\u201d He singled out the round and flabby frog Pokemon. \u201c and this colossus is Boris.\u201d He pointed out to the Snorlax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe found this Cabin together when we got kicked out of the village like you. Since than we made this place our home, and try to help others find their way out here.\u201d The Raichu explained further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter interrupted the Raichu\u2019s speech by circling around Akira, dragging his amphibious index finger across the contours of the Eevee\u2019s skull. \u201cBut not a lot of other wild Pok\u00e9mon are as nice as us, so it\u2019s our job to protect our guests by any means possible.\u201d His long and flexible tongue slurped itself across her chin, freaking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu smirked and put both of his paws on Akira\u2019s back. \u201cCoincidentally, what you might see as a threat to your well being, we see as an excuse for a free meal.\u201d He said in a hungry quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough\u2026\u201d Boris came into the conversation, squeezing his own, bulbous, round belly with both of his pudgy paws. \u201cWe don\u2019t just limit ourselves to WILD Pok\u00e9mon\u2026\u201d He shook his stomach a bit, making it slosh loudly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait\u2026\u201d Akira looked twisted her neck around to face the Raichu behind her. \u201cYou said...you said you weren\u2019t going to eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu smiled and nodded. \u201cYes, and I still don\u2019t plan on doing so...but I still eat Pok\u00e9mon, and I said nothing about these guys chowing down~\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if you are a little light for a snack.\u201d Peter cooed, leaning in close to grin so wide his teeth showed behind his tongue. Knowing fully well that Akira was on the verge of shouting and hightailing it out of their cabin, the Greninja chuckled. \u201cHey, don\u2019t be scared, \u2018lil lady! We\u2019re expert prey reformers.\u201d He tried to reassure the small \u2018vee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always reform, \u2018though.\u201d Boris nodded, rubbing his belly as he took a seat on the wooden floor of the room, making the whole place shake like mad. \u201cBut I could never turn a cutie like you into pudge forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Akira Trailed off. \u201cYou\u2026want to eat me?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. This all sounded like something out of a nightmare, but not grounded in reality just enough to know she wasn't sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris the Snorlax smiled warmly, while Peter nodded with enthusiasm. \u201cWell, as long as your willing, how could we say no?\u201d He croaked. He leaned on closer, but not as domineering as before. \u201cBut please don\u2019t be scared of us, lil\u2019 lady. We put up a scary front, but each of us is a big ol\u2019 softy on the inside, literally and figuratively. We won\u2019t make you stay if you de uncomfortable, but give us a chance and I think you\u2019ll like it here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis...this is all so crazy\u2026\u201d Akira whispered to herself, but loud enough for everyone to hear. \u201cBut...you guys seem to be pretty okay, so...maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough, we\u2019ll give you a week to see if you want to stay or not..\u201d The Raichu nodded. He lifted Akira\u2019s chin up to that they were eye to eye. \u201cWe were all like you when we first started out, you know. Scared, not knowing if we would live to see tomorrow. But we had each other to lean on, and that\u2019s how we survived. No one deserves to feel alone out here, and if you want, you can have a place here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira didn\u2019t know what came over her. She was still scared out of her mind about the concept of being eaten...but the Raichu\u2019s words comforted her in a way she didn\u2019t fully understand. She hugged her host as tight as she could around his soft, warn belly. \u201cThank y- you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu smiled and took a step back to beam a happy, hungry smile at the Eevee. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, Akira. Now, why don\u2019t you get acquainted with your rooms for the week?\u201d He marched up the stairs to the bedrooms, leaving Akira alone with the grinning, chubby predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm. Arceus, I\u2019m starving.\u201d The Greninja drooled with a rub of his white stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, take it slow they're, Peter! The poor kid is probably scared out of her mind.\u201d Boris patted his gigantic belly, gesturing to the Eevee to come forward. \u201cTake a load off with me, kiddo. You look like you could use a big ol\u2019 hug.\u201d The Snorlax teased as he appeased the lean form of the Eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira blushed, not daring to disobey her new hosts. She tentatively walked forward and climbed up the Snorlax to take a seat on his soft and fluffy stomach. Boris drooled down his round front and licked his chops, laying a soft and fuzzy arms arms around the Eevee\u2019s head to hug her close against his fat body. A faint whining gurgle erupted from the predator\u2019s midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Akira began to rub the Snorlax\u2019s belly. It was fat and supple enough to pinch entire folds between her paws, with so much left to play with. She smiled cautiously and added a second frontal paw to the massage, running both of them across the silky and thick fur. Boris tilted back his head, tongue hanging out of his open mouth. He stretched his legs out on the floor, enjoying his tubby body getting rubbed by the Eevee. \u201cAh...ah you give a great belly rub, kiddo\u2026\u201d The Snorlax purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris\u2019s hold on Akira tightened, not uncomfortably, but still strong. The fat paw slowly slid up the Eevee\u2019s neck, ruffling her ears a bit before pushing her face against his belly. Her face was squished against the soft body, and all the while she kept rubbing everything she could get her paws on. All the while Boris just hugged tighter, so closely that she could hear and feel the grumbling of the hungry organ deep inside. It wanted food. It wanted Akira. Was she ready for this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
