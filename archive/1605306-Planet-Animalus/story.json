So, I will do them a third time, this time with an intro that most people should be able to understand. The rules are in the story. *Please note* Seeing as to how I have to fix my rules, if you have questions about something, like tasting houses or the Wild Beasts for instance, or the charactors that one can use, please e-mail me and I will answer your question. For instance, when I first put this up, Twiga asked me a question about whether or not birds were humanoidal, which they are, and I answered her question. So, even when my rules are compleatly fixed, but you have a question about something, ask away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Quick note. When it comes to accents, if the story is between 0-100AS, or 4000-4100AS, I will allow the natives to speak with them, unless the person is from a group of nomads, or some such thing, that tends to speak a language other than Standard, which is a variation of English. Of course, to a human from another planet, Hybrids have a wide variaty of accents, like barks, growls, meows, hisses, chirps, baas, moos, naighs, ect, due to the fact that they are part animal, due to what their ancestors had done to stay alive, but the natives don't really hear these, including those called \"born humans\", as well as pure humans that were born and raised on Animalus. Thank you for your time.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note about drinking. Hybrids can't handle alchool too well. As a result, if they want a drink, it's either specially carbonated fruit or vegtable juices, for herbivores, or blood mixed with water, for carnivores. Now, with the blood/water drink, the ratio is a maximum of one cup of blood to three cups of water. Also, the blood is actually donated from people, who are paid based on how much the blood from their race is in demand, with pure human blood being worth the most, especially before 4000AS. (A large wolf pops a cork off of a bottle that is labled \"Human Blood\" and asks, \"Is anyone thirsty?\" as he pours a glass for himself and slowly drinks it, savoring the taste, and smiles widely, revealing blood-red teeth.)*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one walks the street in a city on the planet of Animalus, they notice a few things. While there are indeed humans, most people seem to be part animal. This was because of a battle that their ancestors had been in and in order to survive, it had been necassary for the scientists on board the ship, that everyone had been on, to fuse them with the DNA of the animals that they'd been cloning. The attackers had been those known as Herogs, ten foot tall lizard like creatures with a warrior culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists had been reluctant to turn their fellow humans, especially those who were their friends and family, into freaks of science. However, if they didn't do it, out of one hundred thousand people, only one hundred people would of survived. As a result, after the captian, who had also been wounded severly, talked to his wife, who was the head scientist in charge of the cloning project, and asked her which would be better, to just let them die, or do something that could potentially save their lives, the scientists began to, one at a time, starting with the captian, who had voluntered to be the first one to be changed, put the wounded into special chambers, and flip a switch, which fussed them with the DNA of the animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the captian. who had been turned into a cheetha hybrid, set the ship on a course to the only planet left in the ship's navigational computer, which had been codenamed Paridise. This had been the planet that the cloned animals, who were of species that had gone extinct on Earth after the twenty first century, would of been taken to, without the interferance of humans to wipe them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the people, who came from a wide variety of backgrounds, from ship's crew, to scientists, to soldiers, to police and prison guards, to criminals of all levels, to priests, to a wide variety of other law-biding citizens, got to the planet, they realized that there was no going back, not only because the ship's engians had gone out, but because no other planet would understand their sacrifice. They were now what writers and artists would call, anthros, basically humanoid animals. Also, they had the instincts of those animals, like the urge to mate during certain times of the year, and those who were carnivores had the urge to eat human flesh. As a result, various laws and places were set up, which were modled on the laws of the USA and most western European countries. Of course, given the fact that those who were humans had no natural weapons, it was agreed that they would be allowed to carry a long knife, which had to be worn on a belt, in plain sight, no matter where they went, as every other person had weapons, like teeth, claws, horns, ect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, special houses were set up, mating houses for when single adults had the urge to mate, but they didn't have a partner, and tasting houses for carnivores who hungered for the taste of flesh. However, despite the fact that these places had people there provide customers with certian services, there were rules that had to be followed, and the safty of the employees was the owners' top priority, with money following ten spaces down on the list of important things that ran those places. (Note, see Leland, under average person in the city, for a summery of those rules. If you have further questions about them, e-mail me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were those who couldn't stay in the cities, as they had the urge to travel, or were highly dangerous criminals, like murderers and rapists who could never settle down and become decent citizens, or want to. While those who were law-biding citizens that hate to stay in one place for long were allowed to come back from time to time, the criminals could never enter a civilized city until they had redeamed themselves. Now, there were many criminals, like theives, smugglers, and counterfiters, and the like, who were allowed to stay, as they had been sentanced to do hard labor on a penal colony for a few years anyways. Also, some of these former criminals had useful skills, which the people could use. After all, things like birth certifricats and other documents are useful in civilized society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the exiled criminals struck back, and attacked the law-biding travelers that were soon called nomads. The leaders of the groups went to the cities, demanding protecton from the murauders, who were soon called outlaws. Of course, the cities were unable to help them, until reports of various soldiers and police officers fighting each other started to come to their attention. Every single one of these men and women, three hundred of them, were brought before the leaders of the cities, and as they were being indicted for conducts that were unbecoming of officers, they started to call each other wild beasts, which came to a stop when one judge called them all wild beasts, and gave them two choices, prison, or become members of a new force that would require both parts of their combined training, to fight the outlaws. To a man, they all joined. After that, they begain to fight the outlaws, and were soon called Wild Beasts by the outlaws themselve, and this became a source of pride for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was a problem that all societies must deal with, death and funerals. After the first settler to die was burried, it was discovered that there was a plant, with a strange black flower, with skull-like leaves, that threatened to destroy the settlers, as it grew on the graves of the dead and gave off a gass that made cyinide poisoning seem like the cold in comparison. As a result, people needed a way to deal with the way to give people proper, and safe, funerals. Someone made an off-hand remark that the people would be better off just eating them. Of course, this sparked a great deal of arguement, especially from priests and other religious leaders. After all, such a thing would violate the soul of the dead. However, the cities leaders then asked the priests if it would violate the soul of the dead if a priest was the one to do the deed to make those who died safe to eat. After some discussion amongst themselves, the priests agreed that it would be acceptable for them to cook the bodies and serverd them to the friends and family of the deceased. As a result, several of the younger ones started to learn how to cook things that were around the size of a human, searching for methods that seemed to be the most respectfull for one's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the next settler died, the priests were ready. After the doctors had removed the deceased's viable organs, like kidneys, liver, lungs, ect, the body was turned over to the priests. Then, under the watchful eyes of five of the person's most trusted friends and family members, a tradition that contenues afterwards, the priests drained the body of any fliuds, and used preserving methods, such as salting and smoking, which kept the Death Plant, as the dreaded black flower that had leaves that looked like skulls was called, from growing on the body and producing its deadly gas. Then, they carefully roasted the body, under the watchful eyes of the five witnesses, making sure that they didn't destroy, or damage, the body during the cooking. Then, when the body was ready, the priests, aprehensively, started to cut the first pieces off of the body, which were the size of one's palm, and served them to the five who had watched. After a few minutes of nervousness on their parts, one of the five cut a small piece, and was the first one to taste the flesh of a dead friend or relative. After shedding a few tears for his friend, the rest tried it as well, and after they finished crying as well, they gave premission for the rest of the body to be served. During the course of this first \"meal of a loved one\", as it was soon called afterwards, no one said a word, and ate in relative silence, as if to respect the dead. While such things had never happened before, at least not like this, these things soon became a common practice, five witnesses to watch the priests, the five were to be given the first portions, and the body was to be eaten in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, where death exists, so does life. The settlers spent time with the loves of their lives and started to have children who were born on the planet, which was called Animalus, after someone said, \"We can't call the planet Paridise, becuse all of us are animals\" and the words \"animal\" and \"us\" were combined. One such couple found a flower that seemed to intensifiy their own desires to have sex with the other, and increased their pleasure as well. When they took it to some of the scientists, the flower, which had leaves in the shape of the hands of two lovers holding the other, was found to be an apherdesiact, with high potancy levels, especially the gas it produced. Several researchers, who were botinasts, started to study the flower, noting the variaties, where they grew, their colorations, growth cycles, everything. Coincidently, they found that the flowers, no matter the variaty or their location, bloomed their fullests on one day, and dispersed their seeds, and that day was the day that the cities celebrated the day that the ship brought them to Animalus.The flower, which was called the Lovers' Flower, with the name of the type, like the color and locations that it grew in, in front of it, was given to couples on their wedding days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, when it came to weddings, people were soon starting to have two weddings, one was in church, which was anytime, and the second was during the planet-wide celebrations of the settling of the planet, when everyone in the city was gatherd in one place, meaning that there was no shortage of witnesses. In fact, it became a tradition to hold the weddings first, followed by the rest of the celebrations, which revolved around feasting, contests of strength, agility, and other things, with everyone having a good time. In fact, providing that they behaved themselves, this was the one day of the year that convicts, who had been on good behavior all year, could be free, without spending time in prison or having to report to work, and mingle with the rest, although there were plenty of police officers and soldiers, who spent time protecting the cities from outlaws, around to keep an eye out for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when it came to marages, same sex marages, as well as marages to multiple lovers, had been leagle for several thousand years before Animalus had been colonized, and the leaders saw no reason to get rid of them, and took comfort from their own lovers, both multiple and of the same sex as themselves. (Note, when it comes to sexual practices, I will be leniant, providing that one doesn't go too overboard with oral, anal, and the like. Try to stay with casual sex, be it gay/lesbian, or straight, if you can, please.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, during this time, those who had been turned into foxes found it difficult for themselves to lie, meaning if their lover asked if they'd been doing something that they shouldn't, they could only speak the truth. However, they found a way around that by telling what has become known as fox lies, basically speaking the truth in riddles that were hard to figure out, unless one was a fox themselves. Also, many started seeing the doctors, complaining that they were hearing peoples' voices in their heads, long before the people spoke. Of course, while the whole \"I cannot tell a lie\" thing had the doctors stumped, telepathy was something that had been known for centuries, and usually required the activation of a certian gene to awaken it. Eventually, while the exact reasons for these two things were still not explained by the scientists and geneticits, these things were passed onto those of fox blood, including those who were born human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as the years passed, just as the rest of the people had families and children of their own, so did the outlaws. These children were usually of captive nomads that were turned into slaves and the outlaws themselves, usually by rape. These children either became outlaws or slaves themselves. However, they heard stories of the Wild Beasts, warriors who caused both fear and awe in anyone who saw them, especially when they were in combat. They traveled in groups of three, a male and a female, both of which were about the size of humans, with a snake or a croc with them. (Note, while most hybrids are humanoidal, like birds, mammals, fish, and most amphibians and reptiles, snakes and crocodilians are not.) At first, they seemed like ordinary travelers, and would seem to cower in fear as the outlaws surounded them. But, just when things seemed to be at their worst, the trap was sprung, and the cowerdly travelers became feroucous wild beasts, who would tear the outlaws limb from limb, sparing only those who decided to surrender, and would free those held captive by them, especially the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, deciding that it would be better to be executed by the Wild Beasts, rather than see those who were what they once were turn into them, the younger outlaws and slaves of several groups overthrough the older ones, and went to the Wild Beasts, to be judged for what they had done. However, instead of killing them, they were pardoned for what they had done. Of course, due to their upbringing, it was decided that it was best they should not be allowed to just enter the cities. However, they were not compleatly cast out of society, as the Wild Beasts had them build settlements along the roads between the cities, especially where different nomadic groups tended to meet up, swap goods, spend time with friends, with travelers that were going to another city leaving one group to travel with the other, and those of age could leave their family groups, both for personal reasons, like seeing other parts of the world, and to keep the nomadic groups from being too closly related to each other, especially by blood, as most groups tended to be family members with the others of the same group. It was at these meeting spots that settlments were built, with houses for the residants, places to trade goods, a school, a church of some sort, and a place that was a mix between hotel, mating house, and tasting house, all to provide travelers, nomads, and Wild Beasts out on patrol, with a few comforts of civilization. Overtime, these settlement soon became towns and cites themselves, with their own police force and town/city guard to protect them and enforce the laws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note, this is just the basic of things that happen after settlement of Animalus, up to 4000 AS, which is equal to aproximently 10,000 AD/CE so to get Animalus years turned into AD, just add 6000 to the current Animalus year. Also, around the equator, the weather is dry for half the year, with little to no percipertation, and the other half is rainy, or as you get close to the poles, snowy, and at the higher elevations, like mountians, you may only get two months of dry, with the rest being rain or snow filled. Also, the first three cities, in order, are, Grass City, as it was built in a grasslands, Marsh City, which was built on the edge of a marsh, and Undersea/Dome City, which was built under the sea, with a dome for land dwellers to live in. (Those who live in the dome tend to be related to those who are fully aquatic. Also, they have special double tasting houses. E-mail me for information about those.) Also, technology is highly advanced, though environmentally friendly. Of course, there is a wide variaty of weapons that one could have to compliment their own natural weapons, especially for use in the Wilds where one needs to be armed to protect themselves from wild animals and outlaws. These weapons can range from simple knives to swords to axes, always useful in a forest, to projectile weapons to partical weapons, like \"Phasar-like\" pistols. However, it is concidered to be more honorable to fight without anything other that the wapons that one was born with, though humans can weild long knives. These knives tend to be crafted to fit the individual, from the size and shape of the grip, which is about the length of the person's fist, with half an inch added for the guard for the blade and the pomal, to the length of the blade, which can be no longer than the distance between the tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinky when they are fully extended. (Make the sign for \"Call Me\" and you will get the idea as to the length.)*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after 4000 AS, things got interesting, not only for Animalus, but for the rest of the universe. (Note, after this date, you can chose to be some sort of alien. Also, if you want to be something like a giant, a dragon, or some \"mythical\" creature, they are to be concidered aliens of some sort. Also, your hybrids can only be mammales, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, all of which are mamalian in the ways that they have children and produce breastmilk. Also, your hybrid can be a mix of other types of creatures, and hybrids can give birth to \"born\" humans, though this tends to occur more often with those of \"human\" ancestory that was within a few generations back. Also, if you are one of the first settlers, especially one of the first hybrids, the early hybrids had two souls in them, the human soul, which is in control most of the time, and the soul of the animal that they were fussed with,  which tends to take control during certian situations, like when they have the urge to mate or, in the case of carnivores, the urge to eat the flesh of humans, which was what tasting and mating houses were created to deal with. With those that were born hybrids, they, more or less, had one soul, with that of the animal only emerging when it was needed, or the person was under stress or the influence of something.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is the basic rundown: *Note, dates are aproximent*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4000AS Earth and Herog are destroyed by those known as Spidarians. Survivors from both worlds flee, leading enemy forces away from other planets settled by those of human and Herogan ancestory, and others. Survivers stumble across Animalus, whose inhabitants welcome their long lost cousins, as it were, and allows them to stay. For the next seventy years, Animalus is the jump off point for various missions against the faction of Spidarians that destroyed Earth and Herog. (Think of England during WWII against Nazi Germany when U.S forces used it as a stepping stone to strike at Nazi-occupied Europe to get an idea.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4050 Zena makes her first public theft. *Note* Where Zena is mentioned, see her profile for details.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4055 Zena turns herself over to the athourities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4070 The faction of Spidarians that attacked Earth and Herog is destroyed,(Zena) and trade is established between Animalus, and the friendy faction that had been fighting a gurialla war against the other faction for serveral centuries. (Think of the French resistance, and other \"Freedom Fighters\" during WWII to get an idea.) Animalus begins to set up embasies on other worlds that had been former colonies of Earth and Herog. *Note* Human occupied worlds resented the fact that a bunch of Half-animal Half-human creatures did what they couldn't, while Herogan occupied worlds respected them, as they had proven themselves to be formidible fighters during combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4130 Zena fakes her death. Scientists make an improved safty pill, which replaces the old two pill system, though it takes about seventy years to be used in every town, especially in the more remote settlements in the Wilds. At this point, tasting houses can allow swallowers, who wish to do so, swallow the \"dishes\" that they are served, who need to be brought back up before the client leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4150 Contact with a planet called Floras is established. Planet is inhabited by two groups of sentiant beings, Fleras, basically sentiant plants, and Flarans, human-like beings, which depend on each other for survival. *Note, Earth had discovered the planet in 1000 AS, and tried to colonize it, but after an event, in which a settler raped, and murdered a Flaran, and was executed in a manner customary to Floras laws, the humans left the planet, and avoided it. When an expadition from Animaus arived, the natives avoided them, as they had heard of the stories, until an expadition member gave his life, protecting a young Flaran from a rampaging wild animal, and in doing so, opened the minds of the natives to the chance that these offworlders were different from the other group.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween 4150 and 4430, contacts with other planets, that Earth tended to avoid, are made, and rumors of the ghost of Zena wiping out outlaw groups and freeing their slaves spread like wildfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4430 1500 people fall under a strange sickness that puts them into a coma in Grass City, which is gone within two months. (Zena)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4450 The spceship that carried the first setllers is unearthed, and Animalus's early history is revealed. (Zena)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4460 Leadership of the Wild Beasts is given to one who was once hunted by them. (Zena)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4480 Animaus decides to create its own colony, on a recently discovered planet, but when it was revealed to contatin sentiant lifeforms, that plan was scrapped, in favor of trading with the natves. *Planet is called Char, the inhabitants are Chargons, which are dragon-like creatures, and meat-eaters, and Charzons, which are human-like creatures, and are, quite literally, on the bottom of the food-chain. The relationships between the two species has changed from that of owner and livestock, to master and servant, to actual friendship over the millenia since the Chargons started to capture Charzons, which have the unique ability to make a new body when something eats them, a usefull ability as the planet is full of predators that seem to like the taste of Charzon flesh.* (Zena) *Please note, if someone that is not a native of Char, or of their blood, tries to eat a Charzon, the experiance is painful for the person, because a Charzon reforms its body using the energy of the thing that ate them to do so, yet another reason to nap after a meal.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, in 4480 AS, on EarthTwo, a theif makes a horiffic discovery when he breaks into a labratory. Unethical scientists, and others, had been kidnapping and preforming illeagle expariments upon those between the ages of ten and twenty. These expariments turned the people into things that were a mixture of animals and humans, and not in the manner of Animalus hybrids mind you. For instance, these people might look human, except for a tail and the ears of a cat, or some such thing. The theif is captured by the scientists, and mutilated, and mutated. However, this was the biggest mistake that those people ever made, as he was fussed with none other than the cheetha with whom the captian of the ship that the settlers of Animalus had been fussed with. The man managed to escape, and took a hostage with him, and went to a dinner, where he called up his twin brother, a police officer, and asked him to head to the place. *Note, the dinner was close to an Animalus Embasy, and was fequently visited by people from there, so he didn't stand out much.* After explaining the situation to him, and the fact that the scientist, a woman, had basically been a prisioner there herself, the officer took the pair to his place to hide. However, after a close brush with death, the three of them, along with the officer's fiance, and her same-sex mate, fleed to Animalus. Then, they went to Char, where they hooked up with Zena, and the group brought down the whole operation, and got justice done, and freed those held there, both those who had been exparimented upon, and those scientists who had been corroesed into doing it, in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note, after this date, you may use people who look like a mixture between hybrids and humans, but these are few, and tend to be located around Grass City* *Also Werewolfchick777, from Deviant Art, deserves some credit for this, as I read her/his D.N.A. Expariment stories, and got the idea from them. Buddy, if you are reading this, thanks for the insperation.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4490 Planet Talkan discovered. (Zena) Planet is full of beings that resemble creatures of various mythical ledgands, and thensome. Beings come in all sizes, from human size, on up to 600 feet tall. Given the size discrepancy between the various peoples, smaller ones tend to wear special safty bracelts, which can reform one's body, should something like getting stepped on or eaten occurs, which activates when someone touched them. *Note, if the bracelet is destroyed, there is no way to bring the person back from the dead.* Status seems to be determined by height, with the tallest being the rulers. However, something is descovered when an exbaditon from Animalus shows up. *Note, wide variaty of cratures here, like giant anthros, Taurs of all sorts, dragons, and even human like, and sized, creatures as well.* *Credit Goes to Talon for insperation, I hope to hear from you buddy.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this date, the future has yet to be forseen, so, proving that it is plausible, if improbable, put it on guys. Just contact me if you have questions about anything, whether it is something silly, like how many breasts a female hybrid could have, or something more seriouse, such as what happened during the war between Animalus and the Spidarians that destroyed Earth and Herog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope that you have fun walking down the streets of Animalus, the home of the hybrids, and people with strange ways of living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS Always leave options for others of the same race of aliens or species of hybrids, savay.

The men and women who work here are not just nice faces to look at, should one get rough with the workers, that person may find themselves tossed through the window, and into the trash. *note* they are expected to pay for the window.<br>\r\n4. those who violate the rules are marked, with a dash on both sides of their face. this dash can turn into a cross, and once one has three crosses on their face, they can't enter mating houses, anyplace, or tasting houses for that matter.</span></div></div>",

I don't really know who my parents are, I woke up one day to consciousness being looked after by a feline lady called Trixy, believing she was my mother untill the Wild Beast law, Age of Truth kicked in at 16 and Trixy had to cough up the facts. I was a born human, that much I'd figured out because I was inhumanly fast, and spoke in riddles most of the time. So I was probably half fox, or some other sphynx-like creature. As I can't lie you have to take my word for this, I'm not used to explaining myself so excusemoi if I forget stuff, it's unintentional. I'll try to excuse you if you dont get the riddles, but I most probably won't be successfull. Also, just because I cannot lie doesn't mean I have to tell you everything, I can keep my mouth shut, capiche? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I live in this city, Angria, and I'm unemployed. I used to have a job in a tasting house but I sacked that off, It may be reputable, respectable, but I don't like offering myself up as bait to the sleezy filth that crawl in there at unholy hours. I've kept the contact lenses though, I can see all the freaks who've got too rough with a 'dish' once in a while, all the ones so aggressive they're banned from tasting houses, and I can avoid them. Plus, the idea of being a 'dish' for someone else is repulsive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, i don't really need a job in Angria, it's all bartering, and I'm a born human. I have the flare of capitalist tendencies of buying and selling and that's why my little stall here took off so well. I set up, swapped Trixy's blanket for a basket, swapped the basket for two sheep skins, one sheep skin became a gold pendant, the other a leather jacket. I swapped the gold pendant for gold pieces in The Wilds and in Angria I had enough to get myself a place to stay. Life is easy, it's interesting too, the things people try and swap, I met a hybrid Lion the other day who tried to barter me his own jaw becaused \"powdered Lion jaw is a good luck potion\" just to get the shedded lizzard skin i found in the wild. What a character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth is though, I'm fed up of this life, and I'm fed up of unanswered questions. So I'm off sailing to Dimen where the scientists are at. If lucks a good'un I could get myself in a position to discover the fusion of these blasted DNA strands,and maybe how to unwravel this sick world that we live in. Make animals animals, and humans human, didn't you ever wonder why the scientists are all human? The ones who administered the poisonous \"life saving\" cure never gave it themselves, vaccination procedure innit - testing on animals, Aha, now that's funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spark up a cigarette and lean lazily on my stall watching the hustling filth go buy, a huge Mare trying to manouver her enourmous behind and tail through the small stalls. I arched an eyebrow at her and nearly coughed. I hate smoking, but it's something that pretty much only humans can do, proud of that fact innit. Plus, there's cures for cancer now, it's no biggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down to my shins, and stood there is an odd looking creature, sort of like a raccoon but with bright intelligent eyes. It reaches around 4\"9 and is nervously playing with it's hands and it's ring tail is bobbing behind it. Ah, a lemur, never seen that hybrid before, must be foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you interested in kid?\" I reply slapping my hands down on either side of the stall. \"I got your finest skins around, you're nice china, and maybe even if you got some jewelry I could hook you up with some people who do some great rates on all the fruits of the rainbow, I know you monkey boys love that kinda thing.\" The fruits of the rainbow is a type of tasting house, the one I despize the most, that recruit humans of different race, stature, weight and thereby - taste, for the pleasure of their clients. Even eye colour and heriatage is particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you are mistaken miss, I merely could not help overhearing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know what you're talking about mate, I haven't said anything, so can I help you or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrings his hands again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you see, you didn't say anything out loud but darling, I inherrited telepathy from his father, and I heard your little sailing plan, I would be honoured to join your crew.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I come from Earth in 2014. And this whole ordeal happened in a single, simple month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was assigned to study Arctic cellular life as I have already graduated from Yale with flying colors. One day, I was enthralled with a mutated strain of single-cell bacteria. Unfortunately, I fell in, freezing in a matter of a day. Frozen with me were only a few things: my white shirt, blue jeans, black shoes, thermal coat, black shoes, glasses, and weather goggles made up my sub-zero wardrobe; my iPod, filled with upgrades, music, and photos; a specially forged gauntlet with talons to pick up ice samples without contaminating it that can be sheathed, launched, and recalled via magnetism, now being bonded to my body due to extreme temperatures; a foldable gun on a sliding rail, an idea I got from a movie, also bonded to my body; secret stashes of wine and scotch for my weddings and science ceremonies; the samples I collected along with my research notes; and finally my grade-A root beer with a STRONG kick to it that only I ever had the guts to drink. But now, I rest, trapped. Trapped in my comet jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know exactly how long it has been but I can tell you one thing for certain: the universe is beautiful. I've seen supernova, intricate nebulas unfold in front of me, passed the Voyager I, seen raging stars and luscious planets. I've orbited Cygnus X-1, rode the magnetic waves of a pulsar, and gazed upon the dying glory of Canis X-Y Majoris. And I even saw two galaxies, not ours or Andromeda of course, begin a fast dance. I cannot describe it, for all I can say I shed a crystal tear. It was that glorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what is that on the horizon. It's, a planet with lights! The dark side has lights shining brilliantly from this view. Finally, I've reached civilization! And at that, my \"ship\" starts to yearn and pitch, moving closer towards this Earth-like planet. It's bigger than home, with much variety just like back on the 'ol blue marble. I soon enter the atmosphere, the ice starting to shake. However it soon rolls forward, causing the air to slip beneath me so no blaze can form, while simultaneously keeping me aloft and slowing my descent. Now I can make out cities, and boy are they big. One in particular has a mass of people in its center, celebrating som kind of event. Now my trajectory is clear. I'm going to be landing in...</span></div></div>",

The collision creates a shock wave, blowing back papers and cake. Unharmed, I slowly get up, my body being reintroduced to movement it hasn't done for years. My skin pale, I feel warmth rush back to me. A wonderful feeling, I could just stretch out and lay in this crater forever. I start to climb out of my crater, a testament to my last name. I reach surface, open my mouth, and speak with a voice that hasn't been used for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I, am Thornton Fall.\" I introduce myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA being, a groom it seems, walks up to me. A creature resembling a buck but humanoid, he is much taller than me, his 6\"9' towering over my 5\"7'. He stares at me, yet never says a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, buddy? Are you alright? We're you going to introduce yourself? No? Well, thanks for your attention at least.\" I say while starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my stride is overruled when the buck-man grabs my head and turns me around, staring at me with incredible intensity. He then gasps, and lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you. I can't read your mind and you can't receive my messages!\" The buck-man exclaims worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmurs spread with the notion of a human unlike what these people even seen before. People come toward me, wanting to examine me like a test cockroach. Scared, I slide out the pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back, stay back all of you! I don't know who you are, just don't touch me! I don't want to hurt any of you, but if you dare to treat me as prey, than you'll meet my boomstick!\" I yell aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople cower and I see the fear on their faces. I not want to frighten these civilians. I sheath my firearm, just as the authorities arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, can you not fear me. I don't know what this is. I've been away from Earth for so long, I just, I just...\" I say out of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people stand up and let the officers and researchers through.

He figured that, with his agility and speed, a small sword would suit him nicely in the case of an attack in close quarters.  Though, that only narrowed the selection down to like... around three hundred blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I need some help selecting a blade\"  Kami asked before seeing a very large and muscular Boar turn around from behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I might be able to help you little fox man\" the boar said in a very deep Russian accent.  The name tag on the beast's nicely tailored black suit said \"Boaris Stroganoff\".  \"What does someone like yourself need in a place like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKami gulped for a second before saying, \"I'm looking for a good, small sword for self defense.  I was also hoping to get it custom tailored, I suspect that your the one who forges most of these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoaris gave a loud and deep laugh saying, \"you think I created these, I'm flattered my friend but I think you might need to talk to the real artist if you want a custom blade.\"  Boaris then turned around and yelled in a voice that caused the swords to shake, \"KLASH, CUSTOM ORDER FOR YOU AT THE FRONT DESK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD ON TO YOUR TUSKS!\" called back a surprisingly younger male voice.  There were some deep clomping footsteps as a human in his late teens early twenties walked out of the back.  Klash was wearing a white dress shirt with gloves, along with a katana hanging from his hip.  The young man's black hair was greased back showing off his slightly sweaty forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klash\" Boaris said, \"our friend here wants a customized small sword for defense purposes.\"  Kami noticed that Klash was looking at him with a calculating stare, though it probably didn't help that Kami himself was at slight disbelief that someone so young and thin could be a sword smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he hasn't fought much, but I think a single bladed New Moon style might work\" Klash mumbled to himself, \"though I might want to dull it a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dull the blade?\" Kami said with surprise, \"I don't want a dull blade.\"  Then as quick as he finished his sentence, Kami saw Klash place his hand near Kami's arm.  that was when Kami saw the hidden blade that was sticking out right under Klash's hand.  With a slow sweep, a small section of Kami's fur was shaved off of his arm with an almost unreal ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I consider, 'a little' dull\" Klash said with a smile, \"I don't want to give you a blade that can accidentally cut part of your foot off if you happen to drop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K\" Kami shuttered as Klash handed him a dagger and sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's something to tide you over until I finish your blade\" Klash said, \"just tell me where you live and I will deliver it.\"</span></div></div>",

The second was a theif, who was captured and exparimented upon by immoral scientists. What do these two men have in common?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer is this, they were both turned into cheetha hybrids, and not only that, they were both fussed with the same cheetha, who calls himself King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being seperated by time and occupations Captain William James Hennry and Robert Marans, gentleman theif extrordanare, have more in comman than they would realize, if they ever met in person. Both care about the ones that they love, to the point that they'd give their lives for them. They would also go out of their ways to help those they don't even know. They are also both married to scientists who took a hand in their transformations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam's wife, Jane, did it to save her husband's life, and despite her innitial reluctance to do so, was glad that the process had saved his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert's future wife, as they didn't know each other then, Victoria, did it to save her own life, but despite her innitial remorse when she did it, was glad because the man had saved her life when he had escaped, taking her with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are their Bios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain William James Hennry<br>\r\nPersonal information: Telepathic. Leads by example. Lost an arm and a leg when he and his step-brother and step-cousin attacked some Herogan raiders, and his cousin gave his life so that the other two could escape whe he was twenty-five. After being fitted with prostetics, he met up with his future wife, Jane, who was five years younger than him. After the two of them got married, they tried to have a child, but the child died before it was born, and Jane nearly died herself. Despite this, they decided to try again, and after taking some special mediciane for more than a year, they were ready to try when a series of events changed their lives forever. *Note, they were on the ship when they tried to make this attempt as Jane was the chief scientist in charge of the cloning project.* First off, they were called to the labratory when an alarm sounded, and they were forced to watch in horrer as a young boy, who was the son of William's step-cousin, was fussed with a tiger. Later on, William was forced to face the tiger side of the boy's mind. While in the boy's mind, he found himself face-to-face with King, who told him that what had happened had been forseen by him, and that the two of them would Join as well. *Note, the boy was alright after the tiger side had calmed down.* Moments after William had left the boy's mind, the ship was attacked by Herogan raiders. This group was lead by none other than the one that lead the group that cost William the life of his cousin, as well as the lose of his arm and leg. During the fight, he, and most every one else, was severally injured, and only won by shere luck. After that, he asked his wife to do to the wounded the same thing that had happened to the boy, as it was the only way to save their lives, which she reluctantly did, using a special machiene, and, believe it or not. his entire body was healed, with his arm and leg growing back, which surprised everyone, including his wife and him.<br>\r\nAfter this, and after they settled on Animalus, Jane finally became pregnant, with twins, both girls, but one was a cheeta, like her father, and one was a human, like her mother.<br>\r\n*Note, after about fifty or so years, William is to be placed into a chryostasis chamber on the ship, and in roughly 4400 or so years sees Zena, and hands her a remote that she uses to activate a recording, which tells her, and others, the early history of the planet.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Marans, ex-gentleman thief (ex on the thief part at any rate)<br>\r\nPersonal information: Expert thief, on par with Zena herself, though he didn't have her swallowing ability. His twin brother, William, was a police officer. When their father was arrested for tax fraud, Robert put his house up as colatteral, and William put any future chances of promotion within the department down as his. However, in return for their love and devotion, the man skipped bail, leaving his sons in the learch. As a result, while William was stuck with a low rank with the police department, Robert was forced to turn to thevery. Needless to say, this caused William a whole bunch of trouble when museum officials, and jewlry store owners, pointed at him and said that he was the thief that had stolen the stuff when he came to investigate, especially since he acted simmilar to the thief, spoke with the same voice, and seemed to know his way around. Needless to say, he was very surprised when he caught Robert in the act of robbing a museum. Since the two of them hadn't seen each other for several years, they decided to do a bit of catching up, while William tried to capture Robert, and Robert tried to escape from the place, which had been locked down, and the two of them trading blows the whole while, until William's partner got lucky, and managed to knock him out. While in prison, Robert got a tattoo on his right shoulder, one of a police badge, which had on it, \"My better half.\" (Coincidently, at the same time too, William got a tattoo on his left shoulder, a prison window with bars that said, \"My worse half.\") Sometime later, Robert was give two choices, spend the rest of his life in prison, or work for the police department, and check out places they couldn't, as the whole department was investigating a series of kidnappings that had been going on for the last decade, with some of the more recent victems being the mayor's daughter and one of her friends. Robert took the option of working for the police department, and his brother became something of a parol officer to him. (Talk about being a brother's keeper.) The first place that Robert was ordered to check out was a lab that had not been investigated sice it was built a decade earlier, coincidently at the same time that the kidnappings started. After some prelimanary investigations, Robert broke into the place, and was shocked to find out vthat he had found the kidnapping ring, and what was more, the scientists were doing highly illeagel, and dangerous, expariments on the captives. However, after promising to come back with help, he was captured, had the ring and pinky fingers of his left hand torn off, along with that part of his hand, as a tracking chip had been instuled in it to track his movements, and was injected with the serum that turned him into a cheetha. (However unlike with the original hybrids, his hand wasn't healed.) When he woke up, he managed to get his good hand loose, and forced the scientist, Victoria, who had been told to check on him, to release the rest of his restrants, and using her as a sheild, managed to escape. While waiting for his brother at a dinner, Victoria told him something important, that she'd been a prisoner at the place herself, and was sorry for what she had been forced to do. A while later, at his brother's place, the man had been shocked with what had happened to his brother, the two of them, spent some, personal, time with each other, in a guest bedroom, after Robert had gone through his first mating urge. Later that night, after meeting up with his brother's fiance, who was, of all things, a fox hybrid named Rosie, and her same-sex mate, a loin named Sandy, both of which had been friends of Victoria's seven years prior, (Rorbert and Victoria are both 25 years old at the time) the group had been forced to go on the lamb, as it were, when someone tried to take William's life, but Robert had dealt with the man by knocking him out, and fleed first to Animalus and then to Char, where they met up with Zena, who helped them out, and brought the group down. However, during the trial of the leader of the group, the man had tried to kill his lawyer, by shooting him, when the man decided to quit being his lawyer when the guy saw a video of what his client had done. Thankfully, Robert was able to save the man's life, when he practically jumped over the witness stand and kicked the lawyer, causing him to avoid being struck by the bullet, but he himself was not so lucky, as the bullet had entered his body, just barely missing any vital organs and his spinal cord. It was during his therapy that Robert asked Victoria an important question: Would she marry him? Needless to say, she said yes, and on the anuversery of when the two of them met, Victoria found out that she was Pregnant, with a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Okay, now that you know the captian and the theif, let's meet King*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing - Cheetha<br>\r\nPersonal information: Can foresee the future to a certain extent, though he is purpossly vauge on what he \"sees\". Can take control of his hosts, both of them, especially in times of necessity. Is very honest, and will tell people what he thinks of them. Helps William with leading the settlers when the planet is first being colonized, and helps Robert deal with what he saw back at the lab.<br>\r\nAnother thing to note is this, King can talk with the person whose body he shares at the time. This can either be on the same level as telepathy, or, taking a page from Smegle/Golum from the Lord of the Rings, using a reflection to talk to the other. Also, when King is in control of the person's body, he can talk to others himself, though his voice tends to be deeper than that of his hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, which Cheetha do you want?</span></div></div>",

However my fur has several black markings all over my body. Apparently my mother had some \"ancient tribe\" acestory or something but I'm getting off topic. A bit of my fur seemed to progress and grow into \"hair\", same sky blue as my fur with black streaks woven in. My wings are attached to my arms, thankfully I have hands. Most humans always mistake the bones in our wings as our \"hands.\" I stand decently tall, about seven feet exactly. Most humans are smaller, but I get it from my father. My father is a large Vampire Bat. My mom is human. You heard me, human. There is nothing wrong with that, but that's a common topic most other hybrids bring up to me for torture. As if my life didn't already have enough problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the term \"blind as a bat\" right? Well the term goes double for me. I wear these special glasses that help me see better and withstand bright lights. But without them, I might as well have no eyes at all. My fangs are much larger than they should, sticking out to scare everyone away. I can't seem to meet anyone but hybrids, no humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for abilities, mine are simple. I can fly, not that fast, but I can fly. My sonic pulses that I can produce can be loud enough to shatter glass in the middle frequency. According to my father, I can also suck the blood dry from anything, but I rather not use that ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough of my disadvantages. I love to read books and write stories. Sure my wings get in the way but I love it! I just hope tgat one day, I'll meet someone, human or hybrid, that will care for me for who I am.</span></div></div>",

Everything merged together and the horizon curved into a large bright orb. The atmosphere glowed brilliantly in the rays of Animalus' star, the entire planet becoming a beacon as it began to shrink into the encompassing darkness, the blue atmosphere giving way to space. It was quite the sight. With the liberties made possible by the spacecraft's gravitational fields, passengers could pack themselves like sardines in a tin around the larger shielded windows to stare in awe at the spectacle, as if it was better than watching it on the video feeds from their seats. Those who would differ either had weak stomachs or jaded eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such person was sitting on a vacant bench next to a vending machine, one of many scattered in the seating area, with two black suitcases placed to the right of himself on the ground. He was a human; the common Caucasian descendant from Earth. His visage was disheveled with his dark hair slicked up and combed back in what must have be a feeble attempt at fixing what would have been a mess, though the adhesive had already dried and locks of shaggy hair began to spike up. It would have been difficult to discern his age through the lines of fatigue on his face, the lines under his green eyes, and his untamed stubble, the remnants of a neglected shave from days earlier. He Bordered on a haggard appearance as he slouched in his seat with his left elbow propped on the armrest, hand on his chin, yet his his body told a different story. He wore black boots polished to a mirror shine, impeccable black jeans and a green button up with the sleeves rolled above his elbows, all of which concealed the powerful frame underneath. Honed muscles comprised the athletic legs and strapping arms, wound up like springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut to his left, one of the large screens had been displaying footage captured from the rear of the shuttle. He finally shifted his gaze to see how he was putting thousands of miles between himself and Animalus as the craft picked up speed to a modest forty-five kilometers a second. In a few days it would be a few tens of parsecs away, its star a dot in his homeworld's night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed, getting up and stepping over to the vending machine. It would be two and a half hours before the bucket he was on would reach the docking station and he had not eaten for the better of eighteen hours. However, perusing the displayed items and finding nothing that appealed to him in the selection all-natural fruit beverages and blood drinks, the latter being the most numerous. With a grumble he sat himself back down, pressed to endure the journey until he'd come across something more satisfactory than shuttle fare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was leaving Animalus for the second time. The first time it had been right after his breakup with his longtime girlfriend, who had dragged him to Animalus planet from his homeworld, but shortly after she would leave him for some hybrid denizen of the planet. Looking for an excuse to leave, he needed not to look further than he previous career, which was indeed the military, an obvious correlation to his current physique. Reenlisting was easy; as soon the human military caught his name they shoved him into a uniform and immediately shipped him out to the Tau Ceti System. From there, certain routines kept him on the move, always changing his scenery, bouncing from system to system, from planet to planet, satellite to satellite, on some remaining stationed longer than others but never staying put for longer than a year. Eventually, when he did not reenlist when his time was up once more, circumstances got him down to Animalus a second time in 4996. The next three years were spent on solid ground and in solid time, the longest he had done since he left his homeworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the millennium in ten days. 4999 A.S. was going to turn into 5000 A.S., or \"Y5K\" to some, or to those astrology wackos it was the \"Peak of the Age of Scorpio\". They were still clinging to the idea that predictions based off of ancient Babylonian astronomy held influence over the flow of the universe. Well, those things just didn't seem to hold up now that there was no longer a little mudball circling Sol, and the constellation of Scorpio just didn't look right from the angle at Sigma Draconis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he could care less about any of that. Year 5000 just also happened to be the fiftieth anniversary for his first hostile alien engagement that took place on the planet called Vegas. It was one of those times when his old combat buddies with whom he rarely spoke, would get together and knock a few back, raise a glass to the past, fallen comrades, the future, and all that jazz. Though with this reunion he hoped to finally slow his life down. His two bags were packed with everything he cared to own and he would start anew on on Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it! What a ripoff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stirred awake at the sound of banging on metal. He must have fallen asleep during his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you pressed it right? The buttons <i>are</i> right next to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head sharply from side to side, eliciting a few pops from his neck, he became suddenly away of the three teenaged hybrids standing around the vending machine next to the bench he was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Look at them; I wouldn't mix up buttons that damn big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all male, wearing casual clothing like hoodies, t-shirts, and blue jeans. They didn't look the part to be the kind of. . .persons to be making a journey as expensive as the shuttle ride itself. One of them was shaking the entire machine, or at least trying. He appeared to be a fruit bat; wings folded along his back, those big ears standing atop his head with scruffy blond hair on the rest of his scalp, the rest of his fur brown, and those big eyes that would have almost been cute if they weren't boiling with frustration at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think the machine would make a mistake like that. You must've done something wrong,\" said his friend, an iguana. Lizard head, lizard tail, lizard feet. Not a Herog, so, an iguana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>has</i> to be rigged!\" the bat growled. \"I didn't want lemon-lime, I <i>wanted orange</i>! They just expect me to blow more money on this thing because it gave me the wrong drink!\" The bat paused to look at his other friend, a buck with cream colored fur and large, sturdy antlers. He watched the scene unfolding with his arms crossed and a bored expression on his muzzle. \"Hey, Ed, ram this thing so that it spits out the can it owes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer waits for a beat before inhaling and his hooves bracing against the floor, his muzzle suddenly carrying an expression that said, \"Aw, what the hell,\" then suddenly charging forward, head down, antlers connecting with the machine that shuddered with a metallic ringing noise. The beck staggered back, easily shaking off the impact just in time to hear the whirring of machinery from within the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did it work?\" the bat asked excitedly. \"I think you got it, Ed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burst of noise and a can of juice flew out of the vending machine's receptacle, but probably with more force than what the boys expected, especially the buck whom the projectile nailed right in the groin. His hands grabbed for his privates and his legs clenched together as he fell over and gave out high-pitched groans. His friends stared in shock, first babbling their disbelief and trying to help their friend when they notices the machine. The human had already scooted down the bench when he saw the machine raise itself off the ground, sprouting four metal spider-like legs from its bottom corners. The two boys still standing were freaking out already, screaming confused obscenities, only deciding to run when another can sailed over their heads. They fled down the corridor and the vending machine burst into motion, skittering after the two hybrids, shooting cans at them from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen human observed the spectacle with a somewhat vacant expression; he had always found the ways of justice on Animalus perplexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention passengers,\" a female voice boomed over the intercoms, \"We will be docking at the interplanetary space station in five minutes. Please......\" and the message went on. Relieved that he had the fortune of sleeping through the hours of space travel, the human grabbed his two bags and set out to wait next to the exit, stepping over the supine form of the buck, the vandal still huffing and clutching at his battered balls.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vegas was not exactly named after the city that had once existed on Earth, nor did it orbit Vega the star, rather it was named as such because of its geographical features. The surface was mostly covered in rocky terrains with variations of bare mountains, jagged cliff formations, deep crevasses, and desert plateaus while bodies of water accounted for only eight percent of the planet's entire surface area, and even then it was too saturated with minerals to be immediately of any use. Civilization's saving grace for any hopes of prospering was a network of natural subterranean waterways nestled underneath the bottoms of deep canyons that spread like veins across the land with the fertile soil down in the valleys nurturing the green paths of the planet's lifeblood. Where these underground rivers occasionally intersected in mass were verdant valleys resting atop underground lakes, oases on a mostly barren planet. Therefore, on the day when man first set foot on the planet it was decided that the planet would be named \u201cMeadows\u201d in whatever language happened to be drawn out of a hat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen the human woke three days later on the FTL craft docking in Vegas\u2019 orbital station, he was lying insensate in his cryogenic capsule when he was jolted awake rather unpleasantly by the machines stimulating his cells back into action and then jabbed by a tongue depressor a few times, held by the hybrid physician who wanted to make sure he was \u201cwell thawed out\u201d. It was only after he clambered out of the freezer feeling as limp as a microwaved breakfast burrito that he could finally stare out of a shielded window to appreciate the sunbathed Vegas day from orbit while hacking up huge globs of mucus buildup from his unused throat. Glorious space travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was certainly a lot of commotion in the terminal, a hustle and bustle that was more common in intraplanetary travel hubs. Humans and hybrids began to populate the halls with their activity, most going through the same ordeal as he, while others were in better shape if they had traveled first class, something equivalent to a three night stay at a luxury hotel if the rooms had gorgeous views of the hyperspace column walls and the guests were barred from leaving the building. The human now realized, as he hacked another yellow wad from his windpipe into his paper cup, that kicking back for three days would have been a grander experience. However, he was no stranger to being the frozen cargo and the three day skip in time was nothing like the first time he woke up on a different world. Back then, the fact had really thrown his head into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after a particularly large chunk of phlegm dislodged itself and joined the accumulated mass that the human cared to take notice of a voice calling a name. He\u2019d been aloofly ignoring it as he was caught up expressing a sentiment of wonder towards his home world, but it was essentially right in his ear. The person obviously knew who he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you Hazard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human set his cup on the ground and slowly turned to intercept another man who was walking down the hall holding a sign up to his chest that read HAZARD. The other was dressed casually for the most part, but he had a flight helmet on with the visor retracted. The human said nothing as his gaze shifted from the sign to the other's face before his gaze changed to a questioning scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haze Hazard, right?\" the pilot said, very surprised by the other's appearance. \"That one guy that was part of the team in the crisis fifty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human sighed, turned his head away and nodded, the scowl replaced by a apathetic expression. On Animalus, Haze Hazard, as he had been named, had taken the opportunity to remain discreet with his identity. Lately, however, with the rising publicity over the anniversary for what had happened five decades ago, drama would sometimes ensue if anyone actually recognized him. The looks he had gotten when he presented his ID at the Animalus ports was enough to tell that emotions were still high. It was to be expected that he would get a lot more attention from the public on Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Okay, that's great!\" the pilot smiled, sounding relieved. \"Y'know, uh, heh, all they gave me to go by was your name and old photo. Didn't expect that you\u2019d look...y'know? Because...well, I thought you'd be...\" he was obviously trying not to step on any toes. \"Well, anyway, I'm here to fly you down to New Powys immediately, by the, *ahem*, \"orders\" of Sergeant Santelli. He told me that you were once under his command.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard nodded absently. He hadn\u2019t even set foot on the planet and he was already getting snared into arrangements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot continued when Hazard did not reply. \u201cSo, is this it,\u201d he motioned to the other, \u201cor do you have any luggage I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Powys, Vegas. The planet\u2019s capital. Like many cities it was built around one of the meadows, only it literally went around a grassy field sixty-five kilometer in diameter while the city itself added three more kilometers to what was sometimes referred to as the Capital Crater. It did resemble one from high altitudes, which Hazard could observe during his descent in the exospheric shuttle which he had all to himself, courtesy of the military through a favor called in by Santelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shuttle wasn\u2019t too big though, maximum occupancy of twelve people in the passenger area, which made it possible for air controllers to actually let the pilot fly the ship low enough to clip the tops of skyscrapers, but he had proven to be skilled as a pilot, contrary to what Hazard's first impression would have led him to believe. The pilot was setting it down right next to some reception hall that did not have a landing pad on the roof, but the front lot was made for the arrival of vertol ships. The craft smoothly rocked to a halt in midair before continuing to descend between the buildings. Hazard could see the building that was his destination as well as a small gathering outside the entrance. The ship was touching down when Hazard noticed that the ship\u2019s arrival managed to gain some of the group\u2019s attention. He could then see that they were mostly hybrids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, look at that turnout,\u201d the pilot quipped over the comm. \u201cNever see this many humanimals in one place on Vegas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. Vegas was a relatively young settlement, but most importantly a human settlement and resolutely identified itself as such. Discrimination against hybrids was not uncommon, as was demonstrated by the pilot\u2019s slur. He would not be surprised if this was just another protest against the repression of practices that were legal on other planets. Hazard slid the door open and prepared to exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hey, I can leave the ship here if you want me to go in with you, y\u2019know, in case the crowd decides to give you a hard time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard didn\u2019t answer, leaving the decision up to the guy himself. He was contemplating how to handle getting through to the front door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They were just a bunch of kids. Hazard saw no point in riling them up over some sort of pride he had for his home world, as if Vegas didn't have enough pride to lord over the hybrids. And if anything did happen, there were plenty of New Powys police officers on standby in the area. He made sure to note this as he glanced left and right across the plaza. Security was already positioned at the entrance to the building, keeping the crowd from spilling into the atrium while a line of troopers in full riot armor, shields and batons at the ready, stood behind the gathering, waiting to jump at the first sign of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard strode forward, making a beeline for the front door, not intent on avoiding the protest by trying to creep around the hairball; he was going to keep that dignity. Someone else might have been intimidated into reconsidering their position once they were surrounded by animal faces with the capacity to express disgust, but Hazard was used to hybrids enough to settle on being uneasy about the situation. The first people to step in his way were two humans, college aged girls, as they screamed their message over the leader with the amplifier at the head of the gathering. After them it seemed that the hybrids close by decided to show their bravado as well and join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down with the imperialist police state!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They deserved to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Vegas Heroes are fascists!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd blah blah blah, on they spouted their diatribes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard had an idea what the protest was about and why it was taking place here. More clear was the message that boomed from the amplifier: 'The planet state of Vegas has been promoting imperialism with its 'Heroes' as a flagship for the justification of brutal oppression', which probably not verbatim, but it was close he could say, and it was near impossible to make out the words now with fifteen hybrids, some towering a head above him, all shouting what they thought of the government. At this point, the one thing that concerned Hazard was the possibility of a fox standing somewhere in the crowd picking up on his identity. It had probably helped that he did not show up in uniform, but he couldn't help but wonder if they knew who he was whether the circumstances would be any different for them. Would they fall on him given this chance? With a good view of some bared ivories, it was not difficult to imagine that they were a small step away from being out for blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance to the building was finally near. A few more protestors cleared the way and Hazard was face to face with the line of security guards at the ready. They all held him back, though they seemed more at ease that it was a human trying to get through, and their senior stepped up from inside the building to explain the situation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but with this protest taking place I'm afraid only those who have been registered as invitees to the reception can enter from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a billfold which he flipped open and then handed to the guard. The guard look at it for a moment before he spoke into his mouthpiece<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haze Hazard. Military,\"  the guard said with confidence, though he still went on to check the number with a handheld scanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard turned his head a little, only glancing back before returning to the guard who was still scanning. It must have been just his imagination, for he could have sworn that the lead speaker had called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was feminine, but it spoke force with such force and Hazard could almost feel the shockwave when it was apparent that she was talking to him. He whirled around to face it. The hybrids around him had taken a step back and looked at the speaker as well. She was far off to the front of the crowd, standing on a platform raising her four heads higher than the rest, pointing a black furred digit right at Hazard. The human drew a breath in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you, boy!\" called the fox, her golden eyes almost piercing as they stood out from her face covered in silver fur. Her dark jacket complimented her look and Hazard would almost agree to calling her pretty if her muzzle wasn't curling into a snarl. \"How does it feel to honor the deaths of men who brought genocide onto an entire race, yet got off scot-free, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that struck him was the sight of the fox, but his concern dissipated when she confronted him with such a question. He stepped forward, glaring, not caring if any of the hybrids knew who he was at the moment. He was just about to open his mouth to shout out his rebuke when the guard grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hazard, inside!\" he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard spared a fierce gaze at the fox before he complied, turning away and leaving the cacophony of voices behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard had his suspicions when he had arrived. Inside the building was a funeral reception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front of the hall were two framed pictures with bouquets of flowers placed all around. He could barely recognize the aged faces of Nikula and Valentine, only by the names on their uniforms could he tell who they were. Much like the outside, Hazard had to squeeze through quite a number of people to get anywhere, though they were much friendlier company, offering their sympathies despite that no one knew him by name. He was quite surprised at the number of people in attendance which was much more than he would have come to expect for soldiers, but these were the Heroes of Vegas after all. Their public image actually seemed just as strong, if not more so, from what he remembered fifty years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know  you're here, Hazard.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear that voice in his head. It wouldn't have been meeting the Sergeant again if the psychic bastard didn't bark in his mind from the next room over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why don't you quit wastin' everyone's fuckin' time and get up here already.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard immediately got the impression of where exactly he was supposed to be. He did not even need to ask one of the servers to tell him to go down the west hall, take the second door on the left, and take the flight of stairs up on the right to find the door leading to the lounge area. Once the door was open, he was met with the stares of men seated around a table. The lights were turned down low and warm so that the smoke rising could waft densely through the air from lit cigars held in the fingers of uniformed men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough. Did you stop to jerk one out on the way over?\" one of them said in a raspy voice. He was the exception among the uniformed men, along with Hazard himself. Confined to a wheelchair, the man was no longer fit to serve the military in the common fashion. Sergeant Santelli was retired, but he still served as a psychic consultant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard thought up a___________________for the old man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hazard crossed his arms and sent a nice thought over to the old man while he stood there and simpered. No one could hear the exchange, but Santelli read it loud and clear, and it was very cutting. The other three men in the room exchanged glances when neither Hazard nor Santelli spoke, their confusion only making the younger man more pleased with himself, even as the bearded cripple started to show signs of frustration at his continued insubordination, to the point where his internal words were vocalized:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you little faggot, you'd best explain why you had to drag that sorry ass of yours halfway across the galaxy, just to land back on Vegas.\" Hazard wasn't sure if the old man was actually trying to intimidate him because the effort was comical to say the least. The drill instructor's attitude didn't suit him well anymore and when he wheeled up to him in what was supposed to be a paraplegic's equivalent to accosting, the sight was almost pitiful. \"And for what? Don't tell me you wanted to pay your respects to Val and Nik. You couldn't give two shits about the team! Where the fuck were you when Emile, Jeckt, and Gennett bit the fucking dust?\" He even threw up three fingers for the names he listed. \"Where the fuck were you after the crisis?! Instead of fighting on your home turf, you went and joined up with that fag SCT outfit!\" Hazard could see the other men in the room shake their heads or clench their eyes closed in disbelief, all of them aware that Santelli's rant on Hazard's entry into the VSCT forces was inevitable. \"So what, your contract with the troopers ended and they left you high and dry? You hoping to scrape something off of their wills, is that it? Can't keep a day job to earn a buck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergeant!\" one of the men barked, having finally heard enough. \"Now is not the right time to bring up your grudges with former squadmates; we\u2019re here to discuss important matters with Mr. Hazard and yourself.\" Santelli frowned at the soldier, who was evidently higher up the chain of command, then glared back at Hazard before backing away and returning to his empty spot at the table. \"Mr. Hazard,\" the soldier now regarded him, \"Thank you for coming. Will you please sit have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard glanced at the men wearing the grey Vegas military tunics seated on the other side of the table and then saw that the seat they expected him take was adjacent to them, next to Santelli. With a huff, he resigned himself to pull up the chair next to Santelli, the old man's steeping resentment sometimes tossing unbidden telepathic curses into Hazard's mind. He could only sit there and hold his thoughts in check, expression askew in consternation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will cut right to the chase.\u201d The soldier from before continued. \u201cI am Major Gormann, and this is agent Lewis from Vegas Intelligence,\" the Major motioned to the middle-aged looking man immediately to his left, \"and Captain Blake, former VSCT such as yourself.\u201d The last person furthest to the Major's left looked about early thirties, short black hair. He was leaning back in his seat, eyes glazed over in a contemplating stare. The shrewd type, Hazard could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Lewis had a friendly smile when he reached over to offer Hazard a hand shake. \u201cNice to finally meet\u2019cha, Haze.\u201d Hazard took his hand, surprised by the iron-grip that was attached to a demeanor that he wouldn\u2019t have pinned to a man in Lewis\u2019 occupation. The man chuckled dryly, \"Sorry I didn't step in to keep Old Man Roller there from biting your balls off, but you know what they say, 'when the old man talks, just shut up and listen', eh?\" Lewis chuckled again. \u201cNo? Well it was something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hazard,\" the Captain only acknowledged him with a nod, only for a smile to break across his face before adding, \"the Fighting 45th, isn't that right?\" Hazard nodded, in both acknowledgement and affirmation, though unable to reciprocate any enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fighting 45th. Fuck, all of them boys had numbers!\" Santelli suddenly scoffed, slamming his fist down onto the table. \"You pick one out of three-thousand ground-pounding assholes that don't even have names? Fucking useless for anything but target practice for the enemy!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Santelli, I thought you were here to be in support of Haze's inclusion,\" agent Lewis interjected, composed as he lit up another cigar. \"Why don't you stop griping about the VSCT program and give your opinions when they have authority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Lewis, there's no need for a new team when the original still exists.\" Santelli straightened up in his chair and jabbed a thumb to his chest. \"Me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, fuck you,\" Lewis switched to the offensive, \"the image you've made of Vegas' heroes is in every way a mediocrity. You carry that honorary title while looking like a hobo off the streets of EarthTwo, probably thinking a wheelchair grandpa gunny is a joke that everyone still thinks is funny. Well, jokes on you now isn't, old man? Vegas is getting past figureheads and war icons.\" He sneered and pointed his cigar down towards the table. \"We want shock troops who get their legs back when they lose 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard had to imagine that Santelli's psyche-comm implants were making non-existent electronic screeching noises when the room quieted again, the old man's bearded visage clouded in silent anger while Lewis' face scrunched up like a man who just wasn't used to telepathic messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, that's enough from both of you,\u201d the Major said, aiming to get the meeting underway \u201cMr Hazard, perhaps you've already come to this conclusion, but the reason why we requested your presence is because we are putting together a team...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot act with such violent hostility towards them; it's a peaceful protest organized by a recognized group founded here on Vegas from the New Powys University,\" A grizzly bear was roaring into a phone that he held to his ear, its design made to reach his muzzle. \"They are foreign exchange students from Animalus planet colonies, not a terrorist group!\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMay I remind you, Mr. Simons, that these kinds of protests are illegal on Vegas. Now I\u2019d say I've been quite lenient with the hybrid crowd with accordance to exceptions written in Vegas foreign policy, but the numbers here aren't getting any smaller and I've got some upset people on the other side of the street. We're gonna keep a riot breaking out here by any means necessary.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must I tell you how to do your job?!\" The bear growled in outrage. \"Do what you can to keep your citizens from starting a brawl, but you will not subdue those protestors with force! Vegas Law, under the ruling of Clemens vs. Lapin, legalized foreign assembly following the independence of the Vegas government.\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nIf I recall correctly, Mr. Simons, assemblies must be presided over by an ambassador with an acceptable standing within the foreign planetary government. You don't need to send me the list of participants for me to tell you that there is no foreign representative here! It's kids running amok like anarchists in the streets. Law prohibits such gatherings even in the Vegas public.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ambassador was unable to attend due to an unforeseen circumstance,\" Simons rubbed his temple. He knew this would be the hitch. \"The mayor of New Powys received a transmission from the ambassador this morning, and the assembly was approved despite his absence.\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nListen, here's what I'll do, we'll keep the lines held here just to keep New Powys bystanders from spilling into the protest. We'll urge the crowd to disperse with the Department of Law's protocols on minimum force. Sound good to you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all I ask, Marshal,\" Mr. Simons replied, relieved this was going somewhere, but his voice was not giving an inch in its fortitude, \"for the sake of those kids, but I promise you, if you spill blood on those streets I will bring the weight of the repercussions on <i>your</i> head. If you proceed with any form of civil rights oppression, The NPDL will not evade the consequences for its actions and you <i>will</i> be handing in your badge. You can be sure of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a good day to you, Mr. Simons.\" Marshal Luszinski ended the call with a disdainful grunt after the earpiece went dead. \"Bear shoulda stayed in the woods. Ain't got the stones to handle the urban jungle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what\u2019s the news, Marshal,\" his partner asked, \"a change of plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Animalus Embassy wants us to take this one nice and easy, so we'll give 'em that and take it nice and easy. But what I want is everyone who is a human in there to be rounded up. We'll let the beasties go, but I want those from Vegas facing charges on indictable offenses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so the same plan? Armored team's gonna hold this line for another thirty minutes, Alpha maintains the perimeter while Bravo team keeps the north end clear. We can set up men with canister launchers now and call in the K9 units; they will be here in five.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, do just that.\" Luszinski turned his attention to the army transport set down on the square. The building had no landing pad as an option for the pilot and the standby had been approved, but he needed some room breath. He caught the craft's radio signal and said, \"This is Police Marshal Lewzsinski, come in aircraft Tango-Alpha One-Five-Two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTango-Alpha One-Five-Two, here,\u201d the pilot replied, \u201cgo ahead, Marshal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be advised, there will be a police action on the square. Recommended you take to the air for further standby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Marshal,\" the pilot protested in jest, \"I had front row seats down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, One-Fifty-Two, at least you get the bird's eye view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that, Marshal.\" The pilot checked the cams to make sure no one was near before he gunned the engines. Rising above the commotion below, he yawed left to see that it was not yet out of control, but teams were on all sides poised to strike. Somewhat conflicted about what was about to happen, he let out a sigh to steel his indifference. \"Stick it to 'em, boys.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elijah Simons was at his wits end. With his claws gently running down into his chocolate brown fur he trailed his digits across his scalp all the way to the base of his neck where his paw came to rest. He closed his eyes and took measured breaths through his maw, brow furrowed in pensive thought. All the years he had spent as an agent for the ideals of Animalus seemed to have been wasted in a fruitless battle to sway the neanderthals of Vegas now that the progress that had been made was slowly regressing. Simons was thankful that the stress had not left him with more grey hairs. Everyday he felt as if he had been tasked with navigating a minefield set against foreign institutions, armed with naught but a jackknife to probe for the charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot finished with his calls, Simons dialed in the number for the interplanetary transmissions network. \"Operator, patch me through to Animalus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence a female voice replied, \"<i>Putting you through now, Agent Simons. This will only take a minute.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimons set his receiver down, pressing the auto-dial button because true to the operator's words, he was greeted by the holoscreen in front of his desk lighting up with the reception of a viable Animalus signal. The transmission had bridged the lightyears of distance between two worlds in a matter of seconds and now it was up to the other party to pick up as messages silently played across Simons' screen to proclaim success of the connection. Eventually the Animalus emblem graphic flickered away to be replaced by the holographic video feed of a lion sitting behind a desk. He was dressed in a suit and tie, the sandy mane swept back flat against his head in one of the few ways a lion could style his hair, though Simons also noted a sickly quality to the fur on his face and the eyes heavy with fatigue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eli, it's been a very long while, my friend.\" The lion seemed to speak with difficulty, his voice was dry and his breathing heavy, but he still held mirth in his tired eyes. \"I'm very glad that you finally decided to call. I take it that your time on Vegas has been a pleasant stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not a personal call, Luceos,\" Simons said, paying the lion's condition no heed, \"this is important. I must speak to you about your absence here in New Powys, Vegas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. What do you need to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about that shaky business with the organized student protest. The students had followed the proper actions to keep them out of the interests of the Department of Law, until that is, when they chose their public venue to be the square in front of. . .\" Simons hesitated to use the next word, \"a <i>soldiers'</i> funeral reception. No one took well to it and I figure that several cases of police brutality will be a best case scenario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion shook his head, smiling nonchalantly. \"I don't think the New Powys Department of Law will try anything that will bring Animalus down on them,\" said Luceos, coughing lightly into his fist. \"Vegas has proven time and time again that they're all talk, this is just the same.\"Simons frowned, taking that cough as a sign that Luceos Kahleigh, a hybrid familiar with otherworldly customs, knew better than to brush off the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might have been the case if an ambassador was present,\" Simons interjected, before Kahleigh could justify ignorance further, \"but you were not present, were you? If <i>you</i> took martial action for oppression of citizens under <i>your</i> express instructions, then that would put Animalus in the wrong, because Vegas law makes the contingencies on the freedom of speech very clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stopped smiling, his paws kneaded together in his unease and his gaze wavered. \"You're right, I know. It's just that things have been getting very hectic here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not looking for an excuse, Luceos,\" Simons stopped the lion with his level tone, \"I've heard of your reasons already. What might interest me, though, is why you did not find a replacement. Surely an ambassador of equal status would have been willing to fill your place here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you why,\" this time there was a fit of coughing. Kahleigh took a moment to fetch a pitcher of water and a glass from a compartment in his desk. \"Animalus is giving up on a peaceful resolution to the issue of the Vegas Coalition. Their \"Stratus\" is churning out new ships daily we hear, reinforcing the hold on the planets with intelligent life in their primary sector of the galaxy.\" The lion finally poured himself the water and gulped down the liquid to sooth his raw throat. \"As if their Orion satellites weren't enough,\" he spat , mulling over the subject as Simons watched and listened, somewhere between disinterest and concern. He knew the full extent of Vegas' expansionist activities since 4951 A.S. and how the Stratus, the Vegas starfleet as it were,  began to grow with the lifting of restrictions on power usage and the union of nearby mining colonies, coinciding with the bolstered numbers of draftees in the Vegas Starcraft Troopers. It was nothing new for a newly independent planet government to take measures to protect its interests, but the problems started when the Vegas Coalition was formed. The planet of Vegas would become the hub for any and all colonies within their zone, the Stratus constantly patrolling and deep scanning with thousands of soldiers on standby to reinforce the inaccessibility of the borders. The worst was to come, as their stellar territories expanded outwards, Vegas laying claim to entire star systems, five hospitable worlds were discovered, three with intelligent alien lifeforms. Everyone was barred from landing on these worlds. Only Vegas research personnel and the now infamous VSCT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was no one willing to take my place,\" Kahleigh finally sighed, dropping the rant he had building up on his tongue, \"they adamantly refused to set foot on Vegas soil. And I suppose they want to keep a better eye on the troubles here,\u201d he added after a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimons nodded in understanding. Simons looked upwards as he allowed himself to stray on a tangent: \"When it comes to your frustrations with the restrictions Vegas has had on communication with their discovered intelligent lifeforms, I might have some good news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKahleigh was looking away for a moment, but Simons' words snapped his head back to the hologram leonine face, sickly as it was, alighted in interest. Before the lion could press for answers, the bear raised a paw and said, \"But I do not want your quandary over the issue to derail us from the issue at paw.\" The grizzly leaned closer to the hologram, his eyes narrowed in an intense stare that was not going to allow any more banter. \"I first want to discuss the options available to us that might just let New Powys see the errors written in its book. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion smiled, looking a bit more hopeful with the promise of good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, then let us discuss.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Civilian liberties never felt better when the brass started to wax politics. The project was working under the title \"Nickel Plated Fist\", and from what Hazard had gathered the pay was good, the guns were big, and there were things the government wanted dead. Fair enough. Then the man started going into things that were less fathomable, such as building a solid image around fourteen or so men to be recruited, public relations committees dedicated for further integration of worldwide militarism, deals with R&amp;D firms, personalized armors and vehicles, and then protocols for joint efforts towards establishing conditions for effective engagements. It all sounded very familiar to Hazard, which might have caused him to inadvertently let his discontent show on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it always came down to politics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said only minutes before that Vegas was no longer going to rely on figureheads, but the goal was obviously one of putting together another similar to Valkyrie Squad. Right now, it seemed that they wanted a good story to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did all of this start?\" Lewis had found a good moment to grab Hazard's attention, \"Let's see, we've got a nice little record compiled right here. Documentation starts upon your admission to the North Point Military Academy at the age of fifteen, 4946, entered military service in 4948 and completed the citizen requirement of two years in 4950, right after the S&amp;D operation Broken Wing . . . injured in the line of duty, blah blah blah . . . yeah, then you reenlisted a year later to serve four active years in the Starcraft Troopers over your next fifty years of existence.\" All the while he was thumbing through a graphic panel folder contained Hazard's full operational record and Lewis' uninterested and curt summation was be an expected reaction to the sheer numerical statistics included with limited first-hand specifics. \"After that, there's not much to talk about, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Blake nonchalantly replied to the statement, \"There's always Pan-Tang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis sat back with a grumble. \"Yeah, there's always always that and further ATI training for outpost duties in the territories of Tau Ceti, 1194YBP , HG44574, yadda yadda . . . all the fucking planets the millions of troopers circle on a monthly basis. With every goddamn action taken by VSCT battalions recorded as numbers rating. . .fucking-\" he had to look back at the screen to even believe he read it, \" 'adherence to protocols', 'execution of appropriate maneuvers'. No surprise that not one Trooper received any medals for recognition of valorous action at Sulzdrad, Tiancong, and Nocturne City. Not when valor is rated somewhere between zero and a hundred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Troopers don't have that kind of a rewards system; they're all expected to act as a single unit after Pan-Tang,\" said Captain Blake <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Well, shit.\" Santelli felt like thrashing Hazard some more. \"I'd say the scope of it is somewhat impressive, but you know the devil is in the details, and let's face it, colonial patrol in the VSCT does not have a lot of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpassive as ever, Hazard swung his chair about to look at the old man, waiting for the punchline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantilli crossed his arms, smug satisfaction written on his crusty and wrinkled face. \"So, let's just say your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is for shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard was fully aware that he was only getting express consideration because he had once been with Valkyrie Squad and the only one left who was physically independent and capable, mentally stable, and not dead. The last one was especially important because five of them were already disqualified, and while Santilli was alive, he was not kicking. Santelli's acerbic attitude could be explained with the resentment he felt for getting cut out of a deal he would have been extolled for accepting years earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that the Major was taking his \"Nickel Plated Fist\" idea seriously, and while there must have been plenty of soldiers with credentials better than Hazard's, the man definitely drawing the line at commissioning inept goofs. Old Man Roller, as Lewis had called the old man, could have fitted himself into powered android armor to give himself an edge, or received cybernetic prostheses, even limb amputation and regrowth methods as part of life-extension programs could have be used at his behest to stand him up again. However, Santelli wanted to ride into simulated glory on his wheelchair with a rocket launcher set on his shoulder in a fashion that spoke to his humor for anachronism. It had become the most widespread quasi-joke in history, one that was only likely to amuse the citizens on Vegas. The 110 year old douchebag rides into battle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter, Lewis,\" Major Gormann replied, \"Haze Hazard has proven his worth for a place in this team through dedication to his country in war and peace, going beyond the minimum requirements of Vegas citizens, and serving four years in the VSCT by voluntary induction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard had sat there and listened to this man prattle on about his team like it was a big deal, likening it to a spiel a two-bit movie producer trying to hook a big fish actor to star in his low budget, no talent, money laundering scheme. Perhaps that was a gross exaggeration, but Hazard was sick of dealing with being yanked around by a lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your answer kid?\" Lewis asked Hazard, more interested in getting this meeting over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard exhaled as he thought on it for a moment. By all intents and purposes, this should have been a delectable offer to Hazard, who was essentially a nobody at this point with not much of a career choice left to himself. However, he just couldn't muster up enough willpower to care anymore. Another battle beyond the stars? Another fifty years? More bullets flying overhead, punching into his vest? More hellish alien war cries, screams of pain, deathly moans? All of it to be endured by himself alongside men and women who were not his brothers and sisters like those of the 45th. Maybe they would have told him it was a mistake to let this go, but he was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is that, just a straight up no?\" Lewis asked, chuckling slightly at Hazard's simple answer. Hazard shrugged before nodding in a way that said \"pretty much\".

Hazard stopped, hand hovering centimeters away from the door handle. He turned back and looked at the Major with curiosity in his gaze. The Scirinian race?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we didn't tell you that did we?\" Lewis said as with mock realization. \"Why don't you sit back down, we weren't entirely finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Hazard made for his seat again, somewhat eager to hear about the </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out in the streets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCats were on the run when dogs bared their teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDogs of many breeds pulled on leads, snarling as they looked on into the crowd, unfazed by those bearing inhuman qualities. They knew what to look for when the commands were given. Their eyes scanned to and fro to catch glimpses of their targets. They could smell them somewhere in there, among the musk of many different creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marshal was pleased by the police dogs' display of skill and dedication to their role. There was no confusion in the presence of wolves. Wolves heads placed upon bipedal, human bodies no less. They were all secondary to the natives of Vegas, shrinking somewhere into the hairball as the armored teams put the squeeze on the hybrids. They had been cooperative so far, moving outwards from the advancing human wall with only a few taking swipes with clawed paws at the bulletproofed shields, offenses easily remedied with a coercive shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe K9 teams had the crowd flanked from one side, holding off on letting the dogs loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard was somewhat curious about this news. Since its discovery back in 4776 A.S., nothing alien to Vegas besides humans and offshoots thereof had ever set foot on its soil, with the exception of the chaos that occurred during the 4949 Crisis. Ever since then, Vegas had been gripped by mass xenophobia and wouldn't have anything extra terrestrial remain on Vegas or its new found protectorates, and the most ambitious declaration, no alien spacecraft could even <i>pass through</i> the Vegas Coalition's astral territory. It must have been the golden rule that made Vegas citizens look like the biggest society of racists to ever exist since the turn of the fourth millennium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, Scirinians hailed from a planet within Vegas territory and the inhabitants had been observed and communicated with extensively. Hazard knew very well and remembered his time spent on the planet occupying an island named The Emerald by the Troopers he'd been with. They all quickly learned, especially the scientists the Troopers were assigned to escort, that the Scirinians were a hard, disciplined race that was quite insightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard was glad that Vegas and the Scirinians were still on amiable terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the picture Hazard held in his fingers almost seemed like a bastardization of what he held in his memory. In it stood a male of the species, about average height at 2.3 meters tall, maybe 120 kilos of sinewy fibers gripping the lithe frame of a humanoid alien. He was canid in appearance most notable in his visage and of course the fur that covered the exposed portions of his body. The coverings were body armor; paldrons, chestplate, codpiece, arms legs, all colored red in the protective plating sections with black underneath for the joining sections and ballistic padding. It was incomplete with missing gloves and boots, exposing the coarsely furred hands, digitigrade feet, and his wicked Scirinian bladetail. Interestingly, they had him suited in a helmet, perhaps the most complex design on his person, except for the heavy rifle held in his dextrous fingers, the claw-like nails on the tips making the human weapon seem uncomfortable in his alien grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this was was Lewis meant earlier about changing times. Really, it could have worked both ways. Whether for them or others, progress was for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Come on Hazard, get your mind out of the gutter,</i>\" Santelli's voice growled in his head. Hazard looked down the stairs ahead of him to see the old man near the bottom, doing a neat balancing act trick to descend the stairs in his wheel chair by himself. He had a sort of complacent smile plastered on his face and had become more friendly after the meeting had ended with Hazard refusing the call a second time. \"<i>Gotta say a few words to the friends and family of Valentine and Nikula. Your presence would be appreciated.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard followed Santelli as he rolled onto a podium that faced the hall still milling with people. They didn't all at once notice his presence immediately, and despite all his show of lung-power before and his telepathic faculties, he reached into his coat and pulled out a black, metallic object. Hazard saw this from afar, eyes widening at the sight. It was only a split second decision that made him lunge for the wheel chaired man, intent on wrestled the gun form his feeble old hands. But Santelli saw the movement and sent Hazard a brainwave that he would not expect. Suddenly, Hazard lost control and spilled across the podium, arms barely managing to brace his head for the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive shots shots rang out and there was a series of shrill cries in the whole room. Hazard tried to move, his unresponsive muscles finally rolling his head to the side enough to see the smoking barrel of the pistol in Santelli's hand pointed heavenward. Santelli had fired his pistol into the air and everyone had his undivided attention. Hazard was starting to feel his senses reboot themselves. He was completely taken aback at what Santelli had done to him as he shakily got up to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention everyone in the room, my name is Sergeant Santelli of Valkyrie Squad.\" Reserved at first from the initial fright, the applause began to ring out, growing louder with every second before dying down after many seconds. \"And this maggot to my left is Haze Hazard, former soldier of Valkyrie Squad.\" Applause was more immediate this time, only not as much of a volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, people,\" Santelli continued, \"I just have a few things to say before my two friends lying down there will be interred.\" Santelli took a moment to flag down someone to get him two glasses of white wine, one of which he offered to Hazard who eyed it dubiously taking it only when Santelli said, \"<i>A sober man in an untrustworthy man.</i>\" Hazard shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were all young once with dreams of women, firing big fucking guns, serving the planet in a way that matters, making a difference, and all that shit. Well, I'll tell ya, straight from the mouth of this old-fashioned, honest-to-God, gun-waving patriot, that the way these two lived and die, along with all the other of Valkyrie, show that there's no limit to what a man can do if he really wants it. They lived their lives toting around LAW cannons in the special forces to the end of their careers, going out of this world wasted, over-dosed, and knuckle deep in cooch, all when they were ripe in their eighties. And what a way to go! I'm tellin' everyone this because I'll tell you right now how much I hate solemn funerals. When I die, take me into another room and burn me. Then my family and a few good friends should get together, have a few good belts, and talk about the crazy old time we all had together. I have no doubt these two motherfuckers wouldn't have had it any other way either. They were in charge! And I'll drink to that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was beautiful, Santelli, you sad, dirty old man. Hazard rubbed his aching head with his free hand. That was so painful, Hazard hoped that the clapping was only sympathy for a raving lunatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now drink it, you asshole,\" he jabbed Hazard's hip with his elbow. Santelli had already gulped his wine down. He then wheeled over to podium to pick up a entire bottle of the stuff leftover, wheeling back over to Hazard who had just barely touched the alcoholic beverage to his lips. \"After this, we raise a toast to a fellow Vegas man returning home at last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a very loud crashing and Santelli was no more. Hazard could feel the air rush past him, the noise setting his hair on end. A gasp rose up from crowd, murmurs of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne voice called from the crowd, \"Haze, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened rather quickly, Hazard still held the glass to his mouth as his eyes panned up to a square hole in the ceiling ten meters above, then trailing back down to observe the huge industrial fan laying parallel with the ground where Santelli and his chair used to be, now just a pair of boots sticking out from underneath, pieces of bone, meat, and metal tubes jutting out from the impeller blades, and a huge pool blood growing in size until it spilled over the small stage. Hazard didn't need to answer them because they all began to retch as the horror started trickling down the side. Hazard simply let the wine glass spill from his hand, creating a clear splotch in the advancing red that pooled around the soles of his shoes. No one would be toasting now, so he figured he might as well make his way back out. Though he probably should have had more consideration for the janitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Hazard, would learn that three of Santelli's bullet's dislodged the main supports for the ventilation fan in the ceiling. That resulted in the rather undignified end to a legend, so called. Accidentally hoist by his own petard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been three days since that development, so Hazard paid little mind to the news-feed as he adjusted the tie he was obligated to wear to the interview. It was a relatively cool, 96 degree day on the planet Vegas and he had a new job to do.</span></div></div>",

It rode on the radio waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hybrids hissed and spat like animals at the police dogs closed in, baying all the more and pulling at their leads. Then the order was given and they were let loose. The hybrids recoiled at the lunging quadrupeds enough to part ways for them to duck between legs and weave around the crowd. One of them, a German shepherd breed, went took off like a rocket when his eye locked on a target, his barks not enough of a warning for the human girl in his sights. She had little time to try running in fear before he came in from the side, powerful jaws snapping onto her forearm, teeth sinking in with bone-crushing force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp jerk from his neck muscles and a toss from his forty kilogram frame brought the young woman to the ground with ease. She screamed in fear and pain, at the mercy of the canine cop. All the hybrids stepped away from the assault, afraid to do anything as the police moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>Ev</b>'ry<b>where</b> I <b>hear</b> the <b>sound</b> of <b>mar</b>ching, <b>char</b>ging <b>feet</b>, boy</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next dog that charged was a big sixty kilo rottweiler, barreling through the crowd to get to a heavyset human male who was pummeled to the ground in one forceful motion by the heavy canine. The cameras caught him cowering with his arms over his head to protect himself from the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Cause <b>su</b>mmer's<b> here</b> and the <b>time</b> is <b>right</b> for<b> figh</b>ting <b>in</b> the <b>street</b>, boy</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard caught glimpses of the updated report on the riot from days ago in the mirror's reflection, but he was more concerned with not nicking himself while shaving using the primeval method of steel razors and lubricating gel. He would have had it done yesterday at the barber's if he felt at all comfortable with letting someone close to his throat with a blade. So, he left it to the last minute to go clean shaven with his new flattop cut. Once done, he rinsed the last of the gel from his face and gingerly ran his fingers across the surface of the skin, appraising his work and noting all the good three days of sleep did for the lines under his eyes. The angular jaw was once again visible, the lines of his chiseled face imparting that formidable exterior that was fitting for his new job as a security agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing his used razors away while carelessly dropping the towel draped around his shoulders to the floor, Hazard checked his attire in the mirror once more. Grey shirt, black pants, polished shoes, red tie. And his name tag with the logo of his current employer, Sharp Edge Securities R&amp;D, displayed across the heading. He looked positively spiffy\u2014if he would say so himself\u2014and looked out of place in his new studio apartment. Not in the best of shape itself, but the rent was cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>But what can a poor boy do<br>\r\n'Cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard turned off the TV screen just as some bear-hybrid from the Animalus Embassy started to voice some nonsense. He had other things to worry about. Like breakfast before he went to his new job. . .and the time it would take to get there by transit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Cause in sleepy London town<br>\r\nThere's just no place for a street fighting man<br>\r\nNo!</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&amp; #62;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard had essentially been hired on the spot when he called in, his first interview merely dedicated to uploading his retinal files, psych. evaluations, drug screening records, and whatever else that would finalize his employment. From there on, he was immediately given an assignment in the field with some of Sharp Edge's researcher. To get ready for the day ahead, Hazard just needed to pass through some retinal scan access doors and give a few wordless salutations to fellow employees on a trip to the loadout chamber. There he slipped on a grey and red Sharp Edge company jacket, donned a similarly styled cap, and snapped a web belt fitted with holster and pockets for the standard issue weapon to security guards, the Lightning Hammer electro-pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, he was exiting the elevator that took him up to the top floor of the tall building. The last three stories were in fact a single hangar, besides the few small offices to the rear. It was outfitted with mechanized supports from the ceilings and electromagnetic lift pads on parts of the floor to such an extent that Hazard would have ventured a guess that it might have once been intended for storage and maintenance of what else but military air- and spacecraft designed by Sharp Edge themselves. There were only three vehicles in there, however, and very little human activity to speak of, only work droids tending to a docked cargo aircraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo despite the noise that was being made by the motorized work lifts\u2014pulling cargo out, stacking other boxes in, performing general maintenance on the large aircraft\u2014it was not enough to drown out the music that was coming from the smallest craft, and loud enough to be heard all the way from other side of the hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hey!</b> Think the <b>time</b> is<b> right</b> for a <b>pa</b>lace <b>re</b>vo<b>lu</b>tion \u266a\u266b<br>\r\nBut <b>where</b> I <b>live</b> the <b>game</b> to <b>play</b> is <b>com</b>pro<b>mise</b> so<b>lu</b>tion \u266a\u266b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the craft, Hazard could see that there was a younger woman sitting on the edge of the floor inside where the sliding door opened with her legs swinging leisurely underneath. She seemed to be busy looking at something on a small digital device, obviously not in charge of the music playing because she had on a pair of headphones arcing across her long chestnut hair. The woman noticed Hazard's approach and looked up at him with hazel eyes. A knowing smile spread across her features and she removed the headphones, grimacing a little at the sudden volume of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, guy. Are you. . .? Ah, you <i>are</i> Haze,\" she took notice of the name tag. Hazard could barely hear her, but could make out the words from her lips. He gave her a bored expression before nodding in the affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, then what can a poor boy do</i> \u266a\u266b<br>\r\n<i>Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band</i> \u266a\u266b<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Control. . .<i>control called</i>,\" she raised her voice over the music, \"saying that they updated your status, not two minutes ago\u2014couldn't get a hold of. . .\" Tired of yelling over the racket, she snatched up her headgear and screamed into the built in mic, \"Devin! Would you <i>please</i> turn that down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Cause in sleepy London town</i> \u266a\u266b<br>\r\n<i>There's no place for-- </i> \u266a--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whoever she called killed the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it from the beginning: \"Control contacted us\u2014instead of you because you don't have a communicator\u2014and they want you to report to the tech. lab on the fifteenth floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" came a younger male's voice from inside the aircraft, \"You have your noise cancelling frequencies, why can't I have my rock 'n' roll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just needed to explain something to Haze and he doesn't have headgear, alright?\" the girl said to the hidden person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haze? Who in the world are you\u2014oh! You mean Hazard's here; we've got our escort?\" A scuffling could be heard as the person got up from, what could be assumed, lazing in a supine form, perhaps with feet propped up somewhere. A man younger than Hazard stepped out from inside the aircraft, teetering on the edge of the fuselage. \"This means we're taking off, right? Let's go, let's go, go, go! I wanna be outta here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, Devin. Haze has got business to finish up downstairs,\" The girl informed him. \"By the way his is Devin Bennings, Haze, and my name is Annika. Annika Staley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard gave a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've just been looking forward to getting out into the wastes, you know?\" Devin sat down cross legged behind Annika. \"What's it you've gotta do, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He needs to see technicians in the labs,\" Annika told him with a roll of her eyes, \"I told you this just minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again, I don't really pay attention to newsflashes,\" Devin shrugged, before looking a Hazard again, \"But hey, tech lab; that sounds good right? You're getting new gear or something, maybe even a performance upgrade.\" He clapped his hands down onto his legs as if emphasizing something. \"Gonna need something to keep up with us now, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard raised an inquisitive eyebrow, but Devin did not elaborate, he only let a mischievous grin play across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head on over to the labs, man. We'll wait for you till then okay? The pilot's still going over his logs with a magnifying glass,\" Devin finished the conversation, getting up and moving back into the aircraft. Annika was already back to her little device, headphones over her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>--a street fighting man</i>\u266b<br>\r\n<i>No!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&amp; #62;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hazard's floor eventually came up and he exited with a few more bodies dispersing into the hall with him. It was easy to find the lab he was looking for because there only two in the immediate area, both adjacent to each other. Hazard entered the first one, and met with the site of a wide open space of white polished floor reflecting the translucent lights from above. There were only two tables on either side of the room with a plethora of bottles and stainless steel devices scattered about their surfaces. There were two other furnishings present, one appeared to be an operating table\u2014fixed to the floor, made of steel, heavy, adjustable by hydraulics\u2014and the other was once desk situated comfortably in the corner with various items organized atop with care. Behind it sat a vaguely ethnic man dressed in a lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Hazard entered, the man looked up for a moment before getting up from his chair and walked over in a relaxed manner. \"Haze Hazard, I presume,\" he acknowledged. Hazard gave no reply, leaving the man to inspect his nametag to confirm.  \"My name is Michael Zhou and I will be your physician for the time being. I've just been reviewing your physique and psyche records, and judging whether you are ready for the neural augmentations that Susanne Daega herself requested that Sharp Edge install into your subsystems, along with reequipping you with the specially issued armament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard scratched the back of his neck in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will explain: It's actually owing to the unfortunate death of Sharp Edge's last chief of security, Joseph Valentine, that this package was sent to you. It was essentially a perk for him undergoing life extension while already serving diligently as Sharp Edge's security chief for several decades.\" At this, the physician shook his head forlornly. \"The alleged circumstances surrounding his death were very surprising, however, I assure you that he was nothing less than professional in his duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine worked for Sharp Edge? Vegas really was a small world. Hazard couldn't help but grimace at the idea that he had acquired his employment only because Sharp Edge had drawn the connection between him and Valentine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said,\" Michael Zhou continued, \"Valentine took a leading interest in human enhancement bioengineering back when Sharp Edge was a leader in the development of military arms. That interest carried over when Daega Industries became the holding company of Sharp Edge's R&amp;D division and merged security service deparments. The enhancements are still essentially prototypes in the testing phase  that is about to be rolled out worldwide, as long as the subjects don't turn green and grow a pair of antennas, if you pardon the expression,\" the physician chuckled. \"Installation and use may carry certain risks of which we may not be aware, but the benefit is that you would be bring in funding from Daega Industries. The director's of Sharp Edge have taken an interest in your background, and should you perform well, are considering to elevate your rank to an officer of security and hope you will work towards the position of Security Chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will try to keep this brief in case you decide to refuse; the primary installation is a device, implanted in the brain, that is meant for  telecommunication for field agents, but by the nature of what Daega Industries requires in experimental data, it can, and will be used as a remote observational device. What you see, they could see as well, however, this contract of consent that you may sign when ready, stipulates that monitoring can only be conducted by Sharp Edge Comms. Control and all transmissions are to be shutdown when you are not on duty. That is it, in a nutshell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard nodded, intrigued by the idea of radio\u2014he assumed\u2014communication without the need for a dedicated device or earpiece. How it would work was a big question building on his mind. Would it work like Santelli's pseudo-telepathy? When the doc mentioned devices resulting from human enhancement bioengineering, it seemed to imply something that would not rely on individual perception, but rather a proper feed of electronic data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before we get to that business, simple things first; we will start with the armor, which Sharp Edge will go ahead and reassign it as your mandatory uniform. And really, no need to protest something lighter and more flexible than those vests we sometimes have you wear,\" the physician said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard frowned at the idea of opting out a ceramic thermo-ballistic shield vest for experimental body armor, especially given the key words 'light' and 'flexible', since quality was sometimes distinguished by weight and bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is that the armor needs to be personalized and I will need you to strip down for the laser body mapping we will need to do, because the armor itself is of a rather peculiar design and needs to be refitted to your exact body shape. Our laser rig here is the perfect tool to clock your exact dimensions that will be applied to the armor. This may seems excessive, but I assure you, with the materials it is made from, it is best not to be perfunctory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard shrugged, figuring if that was the case then he could probably fit a vest over himself in a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The papers for you to sign are on that table over there,\" the physician pointed, \"you can leave your weapons and clothes there. I'll be waiting at the operating table once you are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard only took a short time reading over the papers. Aside from the signer's acknowledgement of health risks involved, there were several pages worth of specifications for the modifications that he would be undergoing. Lines upon lines of eight piece words (five-dollar words to natives of Vegas) talking about the chemical compounds involved and surprisingly enough, excerpts of encoding data for molecular programming applied to a colloid. Things that were beyond the understanding of a Trooper. The basic functions seemed harmless enough and Hazard's name was signed on the line withing five minutes. The doc waited patiently as Hazard removed his belt, jacket and shirt, shoes and trousers last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to begin?\" Michael asked. Hazard nodded. The physician motioned for him to lay on the operating table that Hazard had seen upon entering the room. Now lying down on it, he began to note the impressive number of gadgets suspended over the operating table, all the metallic arms built into a large revolving apparatus. He didn't even know what half of them were meant to do, only finding the one that would do the laser scan once the lens powered on just above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please spread your arms for me? Thanks. Now, close your eyes, and don't move, don't breath, and think happy thoughts. We'll start with your head so the laser doesn't sneak up on you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard felt the arm buzzing electronically around his head as the laser began pulsing, moving from one side of his head to the other is a semi-circle fashion. It was going rather slowly, though that was probably for the ludicrously accurate image that it was taking of his skull. He could practically feel the burn of the intense light and thought that they were getting an MRI of his brain while they were at it. Once it started to pass over his eyes and the sensations were threatening to make hazard blink, Michael began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing, actually, that I forgot to inquire about: the neural augmentation procedure itself is minimally invasive except for some of the accessories that come with the modifications that require electrodes to be embedded into your bones. Those would tie in with protocols to keep you in house until your incisions would be fully healed. However, we are aware that you have been already tasked with escorting a duo of Vegas University interns. The choice ultimately fall onto you whether you want the full package and get a reassignment to patrol or guard duty in-house, or we can simply leave the more invasive procedures for a later date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard shifted around in thought, not really holding a preference to the dull routine of patrolling halls in a building or chaperoning two interns for a field study. Sharp Edge must have had little for him to do following an apparent near bankruptcy from the past, that or they were already playing favorites. Neither would surprise him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hazard eased his eyelids open, the rig moving just a few centimeters below his eyesight, burning the hair off his chin. He shifted his eyes to the physician who was waiting patiently with an amused smile, then gave his answer with two deliberately slow blinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the physician said and crossed something down on the clipboard in his hands. \"It should only be . . . about ten more minutes before this finishes, and I'd say three minutes for the implants, then we'll get you into your new uniform and you can head back up to the hangar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so hazard endured a few more minutes of the uncomfortable tingling spreading from left to right then back again across his body. He was particularly glad that the pants he still wore made the stinging more tolerable when the laser got to his midsection. About the same amount of time passed for the laser to finish with his legs as it did with his torso, after which he was finally instructed to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that wasn't so bad, was it?\" Michael said. \"And we got a nice 3D image of your structure for the machines to assemble your suit to perfection. In fact, it should be done by now. But first, we'll get the neural implants  installed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard popped his neck and scowled in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it's just an injection, really,\" the physician assured, messing around with the machine above the table. It looked like he was placing a transparent canister full of blue liquid into some receptacle on one of the devices. If Hazard would venture a guess, he'd say that was the colloid solution for the implants. The physician then moved around to stand in front of Hazard, reaching behind his head to guide one of the rigs to the left side of his head just in front of his ear. \"Let me just place this in a good spot . . . calibrate the PSI for the correct depth . . . good. Now hold still because this might sting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for the physician, Hazard wasn't the reactive type, because that was more than 'sting'. The loud 'ptsst' was followed by a pain that felt like a 2x4 giving him a solid whack across the temple and actually managed to make Hazard grimace, sucking a sharp breath in through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, the pressure should dissipate shortly.\" Pressure meaning that which was giving Hazard one hell of a migraine. He felt like hooking the physician. Machines continued to buzz around Hazard's head, only a sort of magnetized scanner this time. No more lasers. True to Michael's words, the throbbing pain eventually ebbed away, the feeling almost tangible as it drained into nothing at the center. The next few minutes were spent with the physician looking over a portable monitor displaying the scanner's readout, and then he looked at Hazard and nodded in approval. \"And we are done. I see no initial signs of rejection to the augmentations, so for the moment I'd chalk this up to a successful installation of the Daega Industries' CommLink Tool and Looking Glass System, that is until further observational field testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe treated this like it was a basic update to his personal computer. Still, he seemed diligent enough and quite knowledgable about the procedures, despite their apparent simplicity. Certainly, Hazard wouldn't have trusted himself to jab something into his own skull. In the end, gave a slanted smile with a thumbs up to show that he was good to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't keep you here any longer,\" Michael smiled back, \"though once you're clothed again, be sure to stop by the lab down the hall. The quartermaster of Sharp Edge is there to brief you on your new equipment. As for your augmentations, they won't be online until you are in the desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&amp; #62;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&amp; #62;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&amp; #62;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnika and Devin were still lounging inside the aircraft. The only sound emitted was the hum of the engines and not the music from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pilot is warming up the turbines. That means Hazard is on his way back down,\" Annika announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet,\" Devin replied, paying more attention to his liquid-crystal datacube. Something had caused the speakers of datacube's dock to malfunction and Devin was grumbling to himself as he carefully navigated the electrical guts of the thing to find whatever it was he managed to burn up. So, for the moment, Annika's ears were given a respite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you even listen to that ancient music?\" Annika asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, it's good stuff,\" Devin answered simply. \"What more do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnika rolled her eyes. \"Nine-thousand years of music industries and you can't find something closer to your generation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin scoffed at the remark without breaking away from his task. \"This generation, the music, is good, I guess. But if you have a good ear and open mind, you'd see that the trends from today have been around before, so I'd have a much larger variety of songs and artists to choose from by digging through the old albums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's true,\" Annika had to chuckled at the logic, \"then I'm sure one of those 'comeback trends' catering to your music tastes would have shown up earlier than the 20th century. I mean, come on, those old digital files are so lossy they sound like white noise compared to today's mastering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin yelped when he accidentally burned himself trying to solder one of several melted components in his dock. Probably due to over-amping the system for the volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he admitted as he sucked on his injured finger, \"I did find a few decades of recurrence\u2014some golden ages of rock 'n' roll throughout the millenia\u2014but, I'd say it's good to start at the basics you know? Go from the start of music history and work my way up.\" He turned to grin at her with a playful wave, \"And I have several years of my playlists duration to go through and  I haven't listened to a single song twice, rather building my music taste chronologically. Besides, I want to make that 1900-2900 collection that I bought worth the purchase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnika shook her head in bemusement. \"I hope Hazard can stand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as if on cue, Hazard's footsteps quickly approached. He was now in his new armor comprising the colors yellow and black. The quartermaster himself was favoring to call it a bumblebee color scheme. Only parts were yellow like the pads on the back of his fingerless gloves, the forearm guards, elbow pads, stripes down both shoulders, kneepads, the shin guards on his knee-high boots, and the helmet strapped to his belt. His vest was form fitting, only had tee sleeves, and was very light. It looked as of it were made of nylon woven in a hexagonal patterns broken by the fringes<br>\r\n and the loops that tied in with the loops of his black cargoes, combined with a belt buckling it all together with the Sharp Edge logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Haze!\" Annika greeted the agent of Sharp Edge. He was right up to the craft within a few strides, throwing his pack inside before hauling himself up. \"Ready to go? I'd say that was pretty quick, considering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Devin cried in triumph as the tunes started to flow. \"Just in time for take off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnika sighed in exasperation.</span></div></div>",

Devin and Annika sat down in the seats and strapped themselves into the seats while Hazard was content with holding onto a handle by the door like a gunner. The turbines of the lateral thrusters whined away at the rear of the aircraft, revving up to a roar. The EM locks disengaged and the craft jerked into motion, coasting to the center and lining up with the bay doors. Hazard braced himself as it took off, the hangar shooting by and the ground opening up to the city below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haze, don't you think it'd be a good idea to close the door?\" Annika's voice could barely cut through the music let alone the wind ripping across the open fuselage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard watched the curved cityscape of New Powys shrunk into the distance and the fields of green grass dominated the sights. The blue skies turned red and the green beneath shriveled into scorched shades. Smoke rose from the buildings and fires blazed like blemishes on the of a forsaken city. In the distance a great  structure blotted out the light from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, a storm is threat'nin'<br>\r\nMy very life today<br>\r\nIf I don't get some shelter<br>\r\nOh, I'm gonna fade away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWar, children, it's just a shot away<br>\r\nIt's just a shot away<br>\r\nWar, children, it's just a shot away<br>\r\nIt's just a shot away. Yeah!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory forced its way into Hazard's mind. Somehow he was back down in those streets with the rubble of destroyed buildings all around, every now and then the sight of an alien spaceship visible, suspended above the planet's surface, immense in its girth, tall and erect in its design. The copper smell choking the streets, smoke burning his eyes, that slick feeling under his boots . . . flesh clogging the treads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard shook his head, trying to clear the images. Reality sunk back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'<br>\r\nOur very street today<br>\r\nBurns like a red coal carpet<br>\r\nMad bull lost his way<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWar, children, it's just a shot away<br>\r\nIt's just a shot away<br>\r\nWar, children, it's just a shot away<br>\r\nIt's just a shot away. Yeah!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We are exiting New Powys airspace; I suggest that those doors be closed.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second announcement brought Hazard back. Finally, he grabbed that handle and slammed the doors closed on those clear blue skies. And the aircraft took of like a rocket into the vast deserts of Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rape, murder!<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">It's just a shot away<br>\r\nIt's just a shot away</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Rape, murder!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The aircraft was touching down and the twin turbojets sent a massive wash whipping around the fuselage that immediately assaulted its passengers with a blast of kicked up sand once the door slid open. In preparation, Hazard had donned his bright colored helmet to make use of its drop-down ballistic visor. His pack was already strapped to his back, plasma gun replaced to hang by his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin and Annika fared a little better once they pulled up the goggles and scarves of their desert gear. Hazard gestured them forth, Annika pushing forward, followed by Devin, then he jumped down himself. The trio rushed out of the buffeting jet wash and the ensuing dust devil that roiled around the vectored thrust. A few meters from the aircraft, the gusts had lessened and Hazard looked back to watch the vehicle take back to the blue skies in a wide arc, turning back to New Powys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard and his two charges were set down on the edge of a plateau looking over a vast wasteland to the east. It was mostly sand dunes, but crags still jutted out from the sands, some raising the desert ground only to give way to cliff faces and even chasms. The scorching hot landscape radiated heat though his boots, the noon sun beating down from above. Hazard had the cooling system in his armor to thank for some comfort in the situation, because he was aware just how long they would be trekking through the exhausting landscape ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word spoken, the trio began to move, venturing upon more gradual footing that would safely descend the plateau. Bodies weighed down with heavy rucks, their boots slammed hard into the rocky earth to keep their footing on the raised surfaces while dodging fissures that could catch a foot. A trip or a slip would lead to a fall that would topple them over the eroded path down to the ground thirty meters below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed few quickly in silence as the trio leveled out on the sands and continued to march eastward. Devin and Annika had left their masks on, but had to remove them as the heat started to get to them. Long sleeves and long legged trousers were taking their toll as sweat already began to mat the fringes of their hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin breathed heavily as he pulled out the translucent cube he had been playing music from on the flight over. Lights flashed from it and he read a digital display that materialized on its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. Today's weather: hot and sunny. The rest of the week is, you guessed it, hot and sunny.\" He spoke in a mocking impersonation of a weatherman. \"Average temperature is three-hundred-twenty-one degrees Kelvin. In other words: fucking hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard  suddenly heard a buzzing and electronic chirping, even felt it as if it was coming from his head. Which it was, he realized. Annika and Devin were aware of something else as their earpiece radios gave off electronic rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a call coming in from Sharp Edge,\" said Devin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good day, wastelanders,</i>\" a nonchalant, male voice greeted Hazard in his mind, not with the greatest of clarity, but he was impressed nonetheless. \"<i>This is Sharp Edge Control, requesting an update on the expedition progress.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard had yet to be informed on how to reply, so Devin was the one to follow up. Unlike Hazard however, he and Annika were listening in on earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy that control. We confirm our coordinates in Cortez Desert sector at latitude North forty-two degrees and twenty-six minutes, West one-five-one degrees and fifteen minutes, putting us a good fifteen clicks away from our destination. I estimate out arrival in two hours, two and a half tops. But if control feels like activating our nanotech mods, I think we can shave off an hour, an hour and a half. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's affirmative, Mr. Bennings</i>,\" the operator said, somewhat mocking. \"<i>An essential part of this expedition is a practical test of your mods and their effects on the human body while under strenuous activity and function in adverse conditions. This transmission marks their activation to your contextual commands. Though keep in mind that from the moment you start using your mods we begin to receive the data Sharp Edge wants, so it's best if you to concentrate on your research into the varangel lizards and carkians. Just let the data accumulate passively</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget about <i>Miss Staley's</i> botanical research into Vegas' desert flora,\" Devin smiled as he chided the operator, trying to divert the responsibility elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Of course we haven't forgotten. And while we're ahead, Annika, Sharp Edge personnel want to apologize that the conditions in which we've placed you do not accommodate the full range of utilities attributed to your mod. After all, we are aware of your varsity swim team record. Research in one of Vegas' aquatic sectors would have felt closer to home, more fulfilling, don't you think?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe next time,\" Annika giggled at the operator's sincere consideration. At the tone of conversation he heard, Hazard would venture a guess that they actually knew the man speaking on the other side of the transmission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And Haze, the comm link is functioning normally; pinging was immediate and pinpoint accurate, all connections are good which means there is no rejection, no immediate tissue buildup. Physician Dr. Zhou has given us the 'go' on activating the visual enhancements. We are engaging it now. You might be feeling an electrical pain behind your eyes, which is normal when the bioelectric load is ramped up</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an understatement that came too late. Lights flashed in Hazard's field of view, a sharp pain running through the back of his head to his eyes like a railroad spike driven in by a hammerblow. It hurt so bad that it made Hazard stagger and his vision flash red. Hazard managed to handle it quite well and did not cry out, but his pain must have been obvious as Annika and Devin turned to approach him with concern when they saw him sway unsteadily on his feet from the sensations. He waved them off to confirm that he was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our military-type has upgrades of his own?\" asked Devin, feigning incredulity. \"Do share the details, control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's a neural telecommunications implant, to say the least. The basics of the engineering is microreceiver exostructure in the the sulci of the the brain with an endostructure of mechano-carbon threads woven around the surrounding axons for packet routing. That's all I can really say about that. Anything further on the CommLink or his vision enhancement is classified and not disclosable at this time</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin scoffed the the rebuke. \"So your clearance outranks ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It does, but not when it comes to your augmented systems. That falls to your physician. Which brings me back to you, Haze. The Doc might have mentioned that your implant does not have an output source. That, however, can be accomplished with the transmitters built into your helmet that we have routed to your CommLink. The headset is disabled, but the extendible mic under the left cheek is still operational. Use it to communicate with Sharp Edge if the need arises</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a stretch. A glorified replacement for a satellite radio.\" Devin tapped his own for emphasis. \"I have a feeling that our Vegas Trooper just might be the third wheel on our bike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>As simple as it might seem, Haze's mod is top of the line, right off the R&amp;D prototype shelves. Sorry Agent, you won't be seeing any upgrades. Devin, you on the other hand are only level one on your leg enhancement.</i>\" The operator laid him low on the practicality of their individual mods. \"<i>And you should not worry about Agent Hazard slowing you down. He's fully capable of carrying his own weight and more. What you should do is take it easy out in Cortez and conserve your energy so he won't have to carry your weight as well.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin chuckled. \"Don't worry about it. Hey, put in a good word with the Doc to send for an upgrade canister, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm sure that if this expedition goes well, the good doctor would be very much obliged</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, control,\" said Devin, \"and I promise to go easy on the grunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Much appreciated,</i>\" the operator replied. \"<i>Stay safe, you three. Until next time, this is Sharp Edge control signing off</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went quiet and Hazard's mind got the chance to clear itself and his vision finally stopped swimming around and focus. He resolved to get used to such a direct form of what was essentially telepathy. Dealing with psychics definitely felt more ... natural, in a way. This was, however, less unsettling to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Haze?\" Annika walked up to Hazard again, \"If this is the first time working with augmentations, it really can drain your energy. Maybe you should down a meal? A candy bar?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard shook his head. He tightened the strap holding his plasma gun to his hip and hefted his ruck to reset the weight on his back, ready to double time it with the both of his charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin gave a wry smile. \"I still say you got the raw deal. I mean, you could be packing their Combat Arms enhancement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that over, the trio continued forward, only faster this time. The dune they were ascending was probably impeding their speed, but Hazard was sure that whatever enhancements the Annika and Devin had they would become apparent once they would crest the incline. At this moment it time he had the initiative and chose to. . . . . . . . . .</span></div></div>",

Not to mention those augmentations that Devin and Annika had been tasked to test out in the scorched wastes, but he assumed that it was best to trail from behind and match their pace from the rear rather than the other way around. He had yet to see what their new systems were all about, but caution was the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the upward slope of the sand leveled out, the two students began to hustle. Hazard followed without any problems, his armor minimal and allowing swift movement. The sleeveless design would probably result in a few burns from Vegas's K-type star, but they would be minimal thanks to his gloves, forearm guards and elbow pads, plus he didn't mind much. Annika and Devin on the other hand were bundled up against the harsh sunlight as well as an independent cooling system underneath their khaki gear, similar to Hazard's integrated heat exchange. This short while in Cortez was already was already making him feel the heat. He was keeping up without a problem, but not without a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pace had finally begun to speed up to a long-distance lope when Hazard spotted an abrupt end to the sandy ground as an outcropping jutted out and fell off. Annika halted, Hazard halted just behind her, and Devin...did not slow down. Leading the charge Devin leaped from the top with inhuman power, launching high into the air. His befuddled companion and guard had time to run to the ledge in time to see him land onto the ground below with all the grace of a drunken goat. He landed on his feet but his legs buckled immediately on the unsteady sand and his head smacked into the hot ground, his body coming to rest splayed out prone. Hazard stared for a moment from atop the outcropping at the youth now laying still on the ground. Hazard was ready to reevaluate his earlier sentiment and chock the greatest danger out in the desert as the students themselves. Devin's stirring and pained groans, however, assuaged his thoughts of a failed escort after less than twenty minutes on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnika stood a moment as well, breathing out in an audible sigh of exasperation, as if this was not the first time something similar had occurred. Leisurely, she started making her way along the outcropping to find a more gradual descent. Some jutting rocks providing the steps down, she began jumping from one to another with a cat-like agility and sense of balance. Hazard followed, slowly with unease as he slammed his boots down into the stone to ensure his footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Devin, you idiot!\" Annika scolded as she approached her fallen friend, \"could you please think before launching yourself over a fifteen meter drop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin had worked himself to sit up by then, knees drawn in as he held his left ankle. \"Ow, that sand is hot,\" he complained before addressing her rebuke. \"I thought the damper algorithms would let me handle that drop. It must have been the unstable surface of sand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not exactly a gymnast either, you know, and your legs have not been put through that kind of stress yet, but for the sake of your pride we could just chalk it up to the fact that the heuristics is your mods have not adapted.\" Her tone was derisive, but Devin nodded sheepishly regardless. \"So, what's with your ankle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not broken, or anything, probably just sprained,\" Devin offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'd be bawling if it were a break,\" Annika teased as she moved his hands away so she could pull his boots off and pull up the trouser legs. \"Hey, Haze,\" Annika called back, \"could you please get a first aid kit? There is one in each of our packs. The moron needs a cast. Would you like a painkiller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would you be sweet of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard, out of convenience opened up Annika's pack as she was kneeling down. He searched through it until he found the white plastic container with the characteristic red cross. Inside he found ten capsules of adrenal stims and only three capsules of painkillers. It came as a surprise to Hazard, especially when his familiarity with both drugs came from the military. FenDex stims and Deonis painkillers\u2026 were military grade, and shouldn\u2019t have been within reach of civie fingers, which included his own now. At least he had experiences with such, though he couldn\u2019t imagine that either of the students bantering before him could handle a synergistic drug as effective as FenDex. Ignoring the stim caps, Hazard pulled a painkiller ampoule free of it packaging handing it to Annika who wasted no time jabbing it into Devin\u2019s calve, snickering at his surprised yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch, doc, be careful of the bones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should call in an extraction,\u201d Annika mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, not this early.\u201d Devin stood up, shaking his leg, testing the soft cast, feeling the spreading of numbness sooth the pain in his ankle. \u201cI\u2019ll live to finish the assignment. I\u2019ll be a trooper.\u201d He gave hazard a lopsided grin and a thumbs up. \u201cRight, Haze?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard returned the gesture, a wry smile tugging at the corner of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter how mangled it gets, they can put it back together,\u201d Devin continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but we\u2019ve got miles of desert to cross. Maybe you\u2019re thinking that we should have landed closer now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrist, yes I am.\u201d \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard kept the medkit on hand, just in case Devin's resolve faltered. Pulling the sling on his plasma gun, he strapped it to his back and strapped the kit to his hip and the trio continued into the desert. Devin limped for a quite a ways, but whether the drug on his mods kicked in, he was soon chugging along like a marathon runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's... gonna be... boring... out here...</i>,\" Devin huffed, his voice coming through Hazard's head, \"<i>You've got me as your DJ on radio O-L-D-S. You know what that spells. We play only the most ancient of caveman music.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear Annika groan as the rock n' roll continued to accompany their trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a while that a solar tower could be seen in the distance and Hazard figured for a while that it must have been their destination, when in actuality it just happened to be three kilometers from it. And now, he realized the importance to the university students that the three of them venture on foot. Every now an then he managed to see glimpses of life scurry about the rocks, something rarely seen on Vegas besides the human presence at the valleys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, standing at the edge of rather disgustingly dark pool of what could be assumed to be water, Hazard could often see small reptilian things slither from atop the edges of the overhanging rocks surrounding the depression they were in. It was obvious that the things were aware of their presence, and interestingly enough, he had a feeling that they could detect his line of sight as well, the way they managed to disappear in the corners of his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, my ankle is starting to hurt again,\u201d Devin complained as he sat down to rub his injury. \"How about another dose doctor?\" He smiled sheepishly at Annika who ignored him, focusing more on recording a journal on a similar translucent blue block that Devin had his music on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbove the Valazquez aquifer, situated just southeast of the eponymous solar tower site, defunct of operation since 4988...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...First on site and here we are, lucky enough to get a glimpse of the rare <i>Lapis equalleonis</i> strain of Vegas desert flowers. Resilient against hazardous chemical environments, though very sensitive to physical stimuli, and extremely poisonous. . .when ingested,\u201d Annika warned in her personal narration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazard scanned over the pool and saw the yellow plant that just happened to be nestled right in the middle of the nasty muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Places like these create plants of a very strange nature as water pressure from underwater reserves often pushes mineral deposits up, resulting in acidic pools or tar pits, like here. Given the importance of water to carbon based organisms, it was an eventuality that something managed to survive in these adverse conditions.\" Annika sighed and added,\"Expand on these details, Anni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnika pocketed the blue cube and looked out into the pit. \"Well, no time like the present. I'd like to get started on testing those chemical properties.\" She swung her pack down and began rummaging around for some equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a minute, Anni,\" Devin called from his position on the ground. \"I was kind of thinking on the idea that, ahem, as our guard, Haze would <i>guard</i> our wellbeing by fetching that flower. After all, the carkians can and have been known to take refuge in there kinds of places, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit being a baby,\u201d Annika said, not looking up, pulling out specific boxes and bundles. \u201cI think we're capable of getting it ourselves. Though since you don't have to since you're injured...\"</span></div></div>",

However, if truth be told, he is a Prince, as he is of the Royal Herogan bloodline, though he doesn't call himself one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Herogan/Moniter lizard mix. However, due to what happened to him, he looks more like a croc/snake hybrid. (Think Brontasourous only carniverous)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccupation: Is the leader of a nomad group that travels to Grass City to stay for the summer, as that is where his wife lives. He used to be a soldier, but after his experiance as a prisioner of the Spidarians who destroyed Earth and Herog, he was given a medical/honorable discharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize: Currently about fifty or so feet fro the tip of his tail to the tip of his nose<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: A year younger than Zena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSexualality: Mostly straight, though, if he was desperate enough, or if there wasn't anyone else avaliable for the person when they were going through a mating urge, he will have sex with another man, but very rarely does he do this, as he prefers women as his lovers, which is every women in his group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife story: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn of a Herog father and Moniter lizard hybrid mother, Crog followed in his father's footsteps and became a soldier. However, after training, he was sent to Web, as part of a strike force. However, the squad that he was part of was captured by the Spidarians who had destroyed his ancestors' homeworlds. When it was discovered that, for some strange reason, he was immune to the effects of Spidarian venom, the leader of that faction decided to keep him and his squad alive, and subjected him to various expariments. One of these expariments caused him to grow to a rather large size, 40 feet, even larger than crocs and snakes of a simmilar age. At that point, the leader decided to tourture him in an unspeakable manner, and forced him to eat his squad mates alive, or they would die from the effects of Spidarian venom. After watching two of his friends die in that manner, he reluctantly ate the other two, to spare them of that one death. After that, as if to tourture him some more, the only thing that was delivered to his cell as food was the remains of humans, which he refused to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this captivity, there was a prisioner in the cell next to him, a woman of some sort. When the guards were not around, she would try to encurage him, telling him that some friends of her's would come to realese them. And someone did come, a force of Spdarians and their human allies, who came to free the female, who was the Queen Spidarian known as Jody. She told them that there was also another prisoner, but when the cell was opened, she was shocked, as Crog was nothing more than skin and bones, because he had refused to eat the flesh of humans, and just wanted to die anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their escape, during which the daughter of the enemy Spidarian Queen, who had been planning to defect, was killed, Jody set to nursing Crog back to health. Sometime later, a squad of soldiers, lead by a wolf named William, who was a friend of Crog's back in basic, came upon the camp, and was about to fight them, when he heard the voice of his friend, who had been captured more than four years prior. When the man checked his friend, he was shockedat the profound changes that Crog had gone though. However, the man asked a very important question, where was his younger half-brother. This was one of the men that Crog had been forced to eat alive. Needless to say, William was angry when he was told, and attacked Crog, calling him a man-eater and a caniabal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning to Animalus, Crog went to the Commander, who was both William's and the man that he'd been forced to eat's father, and asked to be discharged, not only for the physical trama, but the mental and emotional suffering that he had been forced to endure. It was with a heavy heart, that the commander, who had been in a simmilar situation as Crog had been, in which he was forced to kill a squad mate so that he could survive in a starvation situation, which was got him married to the boy's mother as a result, granted Crog his request, saying that he was the best damn soldier that he had had the pleasure of commanding..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he let the base, he went to his hometown, and went to a tasting house, where his high school sweatheart, who was the granddaughter of the leader of the human expaditionary force that re-discovered Animalus, worked at. Bespite her own shock at his apperance, she married him, and her own lovers, the youngest of which was eighteen, also fell in love with the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later, his youngest wife/lover, a red fox named Zeoy, came to the house with a large grey wolf that everyone had heard about, the famouse Swallowing Zena. The young fox asked him to give the highly dangerous theif a chance, a chance to change her ways. He allowed the woman the chance, with the understanding that he would kill her if she harmed any of his lovers. Over the next several months, he watched the woman change, saw her change from the most dangerous person alive, into someone who genuenly cared for others, especially his newborn sons and daughters, and started to develope feelings for her. However, deep down inside, Crog knew that her past would eventually come back, and since he was harboring a fugative, he would be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally happened, and Zena was arrested, Crog did everything within his power to get her sentance to be reduced as much as possible, from asking the Commisioner of the Wild Beasts to drop the various charges of kidnapping, murder and caniabalism against her, who had been planning to drop them anyways, to seeing if the various people she had robbed would be willing to settle out of court and so forth. Of course, there was still a large amount of evidance against her, and despite pleading guilty in hopes of getting a lighter sentance, she was still going to spend the rest of her life in prision, unless Crog did something that was unheard of, marry her, and see that she was placed under house arrest, and put into his custady. While this sort of thing was not unheard of, Zena was the last person that a man would even WANT to have as a lover, let alone as a wife, as she tended to assult, or kill, any man she had had sex with, especially outlaws. However, Crog had seen the real Zena, and believed that she didn't deserve to be in prision.Needless to say, the judge, who had been looking forward to seeing her behind bars for the rest of her life, was so angry when he heard Crog propose to her in the courtroom and heard the woman say yes, he broke his gavel as he slammed it on the podeum, making the marriage official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by doing so, Zena effectively became Crog's prisioner, and for the next fifteen years, Crog wished that he could of found a way to have truelly married her out of love, as he had not planned on marrying her in that fashion. It was also during this time that the side-effects of the expariments done to him, as well as the emotional torment, took their toll, as he would grow between six and ten feet each year, and the nightmares of him eating those men pleagued him, but he was afraid to talk about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened, his past came to haunt him and his children were kidnapped by those who had tourtured him. Realising that he would need the best of the best to get his children back, he went before a judge, anhd struck a deal to secure Zena's release from his lands, so that she could help him get his children back, and his request was granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the rescue mission was a success, and not only did Crog ensure that Zena was pardoned, he also ensured that the two of them became immortals. When he was two hundred years old, he faked his death, which wasn't easy concidering that he was about two thousand feet long. Thankfully, Jody showed up with the reversal to her nefarius sister's expariment, but it would take time, and the smallest that he'd ever get would be fifty feet, but this was something that he could deal with, as he and Zena decided to travel the world, though she would go to towns when they needed something. When they were about four hundred years old, Crog was at the fifty foot length that Jody had told him about, which made him happy enough that the two of them traveled to Grass City to stay there for a while. However, after living there for several months, he felt the urge to travel, and left, after promising his wife of more than three hundred seventy-five years that he'd write her every chance that he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortanatly, he never did. During a fight with some caniabal slavers, while trying to rescue a group of nomads, which he succeded in doing, he was struck with a blow that gave him amnesia, making him forget about most of his life, except for the feelings that he had of people. Of course, he was still a natural leader, and the leader of the group, who had been baddly injured in the fight, asked him to watch over his family, before he died. For the next eight years, as he lead the group, Crog had one question on his mind; Who am I? All that came to his mind was a large grey wolf, whom he would tell the children stories about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, the group decided to enter Grass City, where it was said that a large grey wolf lived. During a chance stop at a tasting house, he met up with Zena, who promptly slapped him, restoring his memories, making him remember his promise to write her. Needless to say, she only let him leave town on the condition that every summer that he would come to spend the season there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, for the past sixty odd years, that was something that he has yet to forget to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where is Crog, the former soldier turned nomad leader, at?</span></div></div>",

He always carried three things on him: A large, deadly, and very accurate pistol, and two large hunting knives. He carefully cocked the pistol and aimed carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oops.\" He said quietly. He screwed a silencer on to the pistol, and fired.

The bar in question had a warm atmosphere created by the wood pannels in the walls and partially dim lighting.  With slow almost bluesy music the bar almost lulled Carmine into a complete sense of security, though, being a bounty hunter he knew that you should never let your guard down.  Though, there wern't many people in the bar in question as it was the slow part of the day, just a jackal, some kind of bird, a nicely dressed female badger, and a rough looking human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it be?\" asked the Boar bartender, wiping one of the glasses with a questionably clean rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gazelle, preferably a young one\" Carmine answered, peaking at the mirror behind the Boar, making sure that he could easily see the door in the reflection.  While the Boar prepaired the Cheetah's drink, Carmine notice the human setting the glass on the back of his raised hand and ballencing it.  The man's gaze looked almost sedated, his smile wide but calm, not to mention that a huntchback had a better posture than he did.  Still Carmine watched, but it seemed just as he blinked there was a single clink sound and the man's hand was now wrapped around an upside down glass.  Carmine couldn't help but chuckle at the man's supposed 'speed', but you then spotted something on the top of the bottom of the glass, a small coin.  Did the man put the coin on the glass during the really short time that he blinked?  Carmine scooted closer to the scruff man to observe his trick, noticing how the man's head was so far forward that the ears were at the same height as his shoulders.  Then, he did it again, the glass quickly flipped back in it's upright position, sitting on the back of his closed fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressed?\" The man asked, opening up his closed fist to drop the coin onto the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little\" Carmine said crossing his arms, trying not to feel impressed by the man's trick.  The boar handed the cheetah his drink before retreating to the veiwing screen underneith the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I must be something to impress a cheetah\" the man said with a snicker as he rolled the coin across the fingers, \"it looks like you have a little bit of money, mind if you share the wealth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmine snickered, \"oh really, you saying that you want me to put up a wager?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet, that I can face this glass and throw this coin behind me and still get it to land in this exact glass without touching the glass or the coin once it's left my hand.\" the man bet, \"and if I win, you give me a few gold peices to pay for my drink, if I lose, I owe you a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah couldn't help but snicker, he couldnt wait to see this, he said, \"alright, bring it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tossed the coin fairly hard behind him, the metal disk bouncing off the back of a near by chair and landed on the top of the ceiling lamp just above the two.  The coin then slid off and landed in Carmine's drink with a wet 'ploink'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whops, sorry\" the man appologised picking up carmine's drink and pouring it into the intended glass, \"though I do agree that it's still in the rules, and that you owe me a drink.\"  Carmine couldn't help but smile and handed the man a few gold peices before realising that his bag was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I like to help myself\" the man said holding Carmine's bag of gold and taking a few peices from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There better not be any more gold peices missing\" Carmine threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled saying, \"don't worry, I only take my winnings, no more no less.\"  The man gave Carmine a bigger smile and Carmine's heart jumped a tiny bit.  He recognized the man's face, there was a very large bounty on his head.  His name was Rick O, Chet, also known as 'The Luckiest Cheat Alive' because of how he seems to win almost every game.  People knows he cheats, but no one has ever caught him cheating.  Good old Rick is also known as the 'Gunslinging Prophet' for predicting someone elses next moves.  Though people just mispronouce his name as Ricochet because of how he ricochet bullets into his enemies.  What ever they call him though, all Carmine knows was that he's good at staying alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Carmine going to do?</span></div></div>",

Though all Carmine could tell is that it left most of the citie's residence lazy and fat, and sometimes very fat.  That was why security companies have been on the up and up lately, being able to protect their clients while the clients didn't have to do anything, except growing even more lazy.  Carmine only smirked, thinking that with his speed and sneakyness that he could easily bypass any 'security system' he encounters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can easily hang around here for a while\" Carmine said as he turned in his weapons and entered the 'advanced' city, though seeing a lion just as tall as him but five times as wide with fat, waddle past him playing around on his 'twitter book' page with fingers as thick as sausages, made the cheetah add, \"hopefully not too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, within hours, the cheetah assasin began thinking about that one foxy lady that he left at the casino.  Although he was renting a woefully small room with all manners of We Fi, Redtooth, and other interweb access, he was really thinking about her.  He couldn't admit to himself that he liked the spunky fox, he found her attractive not only in that, boy looking at pretty girl in a magazine kind of way, but also in a personal way.  Though he wouldn't say that he 'loved' her though, that would be just a tad bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah took a few days off to recooperate and get familiar with the new city.  Not to mention see a moribidly obese female chicken anthro that he could imagine easily being the centerpeice of a massive feast.  Carmine wanted to go to the nearest bar, but he was also running a little low on money.  So, what was he going to do?</span></div></div>",

If I can reinvent myself here, she might think that I died out there in the Wilds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Carmine was at a local museum, checking out a help wanted sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we could use a temperary guard,\" the owner of the place said. \"We've been getting reports that a highly infamous thief is in the area and if your referances are this qualified, you just might be the man I want to guard this 200 karat diamond that was discovered rather recently on Web. The Queen herself had it sent here as a token of friendship between her planet and ours. Its value is in the millions, but more importantally, from what I hear, she sent it here because our town has the best security systems on the planet. I wish you luck when you come in tonight. Your shift will start at 11:00PM. Try not to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Carmine said. \"I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked back to the hotel, Carmine chuckled. On his referance sheet he'd said that he was a reformed thief who'd worked for Zena as a security consultant, as it was a well known fact that sometimes she'd give former thieves a job as security consultants. Needless to say, it would be a smart way to pay her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as he came to the place, and put on his uniform, and picked up his nightstick and tranqualizer pistol, he chuckled as he looked in the mirror. In this outfit, no one would think that he was a murderous bounty hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be an interesting time,\" he thought. \"I doubt that Zena will look for me as a security guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done putting his outfit on, he walked over to the diamond and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see way someone would want to steal you,\" he thought. \"You are just wonderful to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking in from the roof was a man dressed in a black outfit, who had his own plans for the diamond.

Carmine sighed, he didn't want to deal with these kind of shenanigains, but then again if he helped put a criminal in jail then he might get a raise.  That was when he saw who the intruder was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intruder seemed to be related more to a tall stick than a human, with a pressed black suit and black top hat that added to the person's height.

The Escapist had the diamond sitting on a flashlight, making the entire display room look like a disco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is pretty\" The Escapist commented, but he was now sitting on a large box, \"now that I've set the mood, it's time to do a classic trick, cut the cheetah in half.\"  He flexed a saw in his hands looking at the cheetah with a more evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what was Carmine going to do...</span></div></div>",

The Aerail, to be precise. He could very easily jump from strut to strut without exerting too much force to quickly and efficiently move around the city. He had a safe house in one of the Pillar stations, that kept the whole network levitating a hundred or so feet above the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks passed, and gradually, from different places around the city, he had set up his own Dojo, for honing his swordplay skills, a living quarters, a library, for he enjoyed many scholarly pursuits, much in contrast with his bloody past. His now permanent home took up three pillar stations and the Dojo, a separate area, took up another two. One beautiful day, as he was descending a clock tower in the far northern half of the city, near the north gatehouse, a hand reached out and pulled him inside, and he suddenly felt his mouth meet another. He opened shocked eyes to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis. Had she known he was here? No one else did...<br>\r\nHe quickly forgot about anything else and realised that he loved Alexis. The short time they had spent together had been the best time of his life. All too soon Alexis pulled away and hugged him.<br>\r\n\"Carmine.\" She said with a slight smile. Then she suddenly hugged him fiercely. \"I've been looking for you so hard. Oh, Carmine.\" She was almost crying. He didn't need to be told, he knew she felt the same. Gently he wrapped his arms around her. She was crying freely now.<br>\r\n\"I... I got Rick.\" Carmine reeled. \"I spent the last of my money on a Sniper. I picked a lot of money off the floor in the casino. I got him from four miles away. He was walking along... just, there. I got my necklace.\" She smiled tearfully, and jangled a beautiful necklace hanging around her neck. Carmine gasped, that thing was near-priceless! It was what looked like solid gold, set with a gigantic diamond and emeralds and rubies all along it in an intricate pattern. Carmine grinned from ear to ear.<br>\r\n\"What?\" She said, indignant. Again, Carmine grinned, held her close and kissed her passionately. A little surprised, she only took a second to kiss back.<br>\r\n\"Alexis, I want to show you something. I've been pretty busy, to be honest. I have my own place now, a little library, a Dojo... and there's still space for more, it's in the pillar stations.\" Alexis looked slightly disbelieving. \"C'mon, I'll show you, climb on my back.\" She climbed on Carmine's back, all the while glad that he was damn stronger than he looked. He adjusted his grip slightly and started climbing back the way he'd come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, they had climbed to the top of one of pillar stations, giving them an incredible view of the city and wilderness. Here they talked for hours, until it got dark, at which point they went back down, and inside Carmine's strange home, now, hopefully, their home.<br>\r\nAs Carmine was getting into bed later, it dawned on him that Alexis had nowhere to sleep. He turned and was just about to state that fact until before he could, she kissed him, and lay down on the bed. He shrugged and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Alexis wanted to...</span></div></div>",

He lobbed it at a police vehicle far enough away from the one Rick was in. It went up in a huge fireball. That got Zena's attention all right. Carmine was standing proudly in front of the burning wreckage. She growled loudly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind his back, he held two more grenades, ready to be cooked at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time no see, Zena. You look a little off your game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't amused. \"You're supposed to be a dead man, Carmine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed the other two grenades.

He leapt from person to person, slicing throats, slashing flesh, anything to spill blood. As soon as Zena ran in, she stumbled, then slipped. She waw having difficulty getting up. She was heavily twitching, trying to restrain her more animalistic instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony? What's wrong with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's addicted to human flesh. You've virtually knocked out all of her senses right now, but it won't last long. We're almost there, just hold on a bit longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. Zena was slowly getting up. She was looking at Carmine with bloodlust in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Tony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmine heard Tony shout \"Bombs away!!!\" Not from the mike, but from directly above them. Carmine looked up and saaw him in a helicopter hovering above. The helicopter had two enormous bags slng underneath, which Tony quickly slit open with a knife, and a half ton of snow dropped down upon them. The sheer force was enough to break Carmine's leg. Zena froze, her eyes wide, and didn't move. The helicopter hovered closer, and Tony grabbed Carmine and loaded him into the chopper. It pulled away, into the night sky. Rick was in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmine groaned. Why didn't she do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snow's her weakness. It's a psychological thing for her, don't ask how we know.

Now, imagian it to be about the size of a human, and capable of speech and you got a spidarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNative to the planet called Web, a spidarian has relatively, compared to humans, poor eyesight, and can't really stand bright light. However, they are agile, can climb most surfaces, and create webs, which can be used for a variaty of reasons. On Web, due to the high winds, they are used to capture prey, large non-sentiant insect-like creatures, and rescue travelers who are not prepared for the occasional high gusts. They have a hive mentality, in that, while they have their own minds, they are connected to their Queen, and if she dies, which is somewhat unlikelly, they can become suicidal, unless one of her daughters is given the rank of queen. Amongst the male members of the Queen's Royal Guard, there is no greater honor than voluntering to be the father of her children. However, there is a price for this honor, as the male tends to be eaten during the mating ritual, to increase the chances of the Queen's children, most of which are female, surviving to be born. *note, while common female Spidarians can do this as well, they don't normally do it, as it only increases the number of children born.* After the ritual is complete, the boby of the warior is wrapped in silk, and placed, admist songs for the life of the guard, his offspring, and the Queen, onto a funarary pier and burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note* There are humans on Web, many of which are decended of survivors of a shipwreck. In fact, they were the perverbial powder keg that kicked off a centuries long civil war. One side saw them as cattle and slaves, and the other saw them as potential friends and trading partners. After the war was over, with the help of Crog, Zena's husband, and Zena herself, and the rival queen was dead, and her followers switched their allegance to the other, who was her sister, and her daughters, as well as her sister's daughters, that allied with her, the humans were free of any slavery that they had been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBring on the spiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Important note* After checking and rereading my stories, which is what this interactive is based off of, I was able to find the name of the current Queen, Jody. While this isn't her actual name by any means, as human tounges have troubles pronouncing the various clicks, chirps, and squeaks of the Spidarian language, it is fairly close to it. Also, Jody is basically an immortal, and is, easily, several thousand years old, which is something to consider considering that your common Spidarian can live to be two hundred years of age.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, you are from the planet known as Char. What are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChargon: Dragon-like race of beings. A wide variaty of types, from those who breath fire, to those who breath poison gas, in a wide variaty of colorations. Meat-eaters. Used to capture Charzons to be livestock, and all vilages have their own population, with each chargon having their own personal charzons. They don't normaly wear much in the way of clothing. Also, there is easily a dozen female chargons to each individual male chargon, due to the fact that female chargons can only have one male offspring in their lives, which is why males tend to take multiple mates, to increase the chances of having multiple sons. Leadership of each group is, usually, given to the eldest son of the current chieftian, though the chargon must prove himself worthy of recieving it, otherwise leadership could fall to one of his uncles, older male cousins, or younger half brothers, all of which must prove themselves capable of doing the job. *Note, while the males may be leaders in name, they tend to defer to their mates when it comes to certain matters, and get advice from them.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharzon: Human-like race of beings. Tend to be mostly omniverous, eating fruit or tubers for the most part, with some meat added to their diets. Despite being on the bottom of the food-chain, and being an important part of a Chargon's diet, getting eaten is not a real danger for their species, as they can reform their body within a few hours, with the old one losing it's memory, dying, and becoming food for the predator's body to extract nutrition from. In fact, it was because of this ability that Chargons set out to capture as many as they could, severl millenia ago. After all, seeing as to how they could reform their bodies, it wasn't like a chargon had to get a new one everytime they ate one. Of course, since they are sentiant beings, just like chargons, the charzons started to make plans for escape attempts, with at least one of the group being the one who watched as the rest made their attempt, so that they could imform others as to what did, or didn't, work. Tend to be tattooed in a manner that helps camoflauge them from wild predators, yet stands out to a chargon. They are also marked for various things, such as which vilage that they are from, which family owns them, marks dictating how many times that they have had succesful matings with other charzons, if they have ever escaped, or if they had previous owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommon information: The charzons that are better tasting tend to be owned by chargons of higher ranking in society. However, common chargons can improve the taste of their charzons by following a few things, such as being gentle with them, giving them proper food, and basically treating them as if they were a part of the family, in a manner of speaking. In fact, to improve the quality of the charzons, and to reduce the chances of them just leaving the vilage, especially by escaping, laws were passed to protect them from abusive owners, with heavy punishments being given for doing so, like losing their personal charzons, and potentially being exiled. Also, unless they are given premission to do so, a chargon cannot eat a charzon owned by another, especially those owned by the cheftain's family. Of course, when it comes to breeding charzons, if owned by seperate chargons, fees are to be paid to the owner of the male for services rendered, the fee increasing especially when the owner is very high in sociaty. When it comes to deplomacy between seperate groups of chargons, the leaders tend to swap a daughter or two, along with the daughter's personal charzons, who are then to be mates with the eldest son of the other cheftain, with their charzons being allowed to mate with those of the other family, to mantain either a truce or an alliance. When it comes to war however, all males of fighting age, including the cheftain's eldest son, take part in the fighting. In fact, if the leader's eldest son can prove himself to be a capable leader in battle, chances are that he may get to lead the group when it comes time for the old leader to step down, whether from injury, old age, sickness, or, in rare cases, death, though most are still alive when they pass the title over to someone else, usually a male family member. *Note, while they may not be leaders themselves, the other male relations tend to be advisors to the cheftain, and must prove themselves capable of leading themselves, should something happen, and the eldest son of the cheftain in unworthy to take up the role of leadership, or if a temperary leader is needed, like if the current one is recovering from a sickness or an injury that will not prevent him from doing his duties when he recovers.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relationships between the two species tends to vary between something like farmer and livestock, to master and servant, to friends, and to, on occasion, lovers, though the two are unable to have children with the other, and this tends to be on the hush-hush, especially when the Chargon is the cheftain's heir, and the charzon is their personal property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, where you find one, chances are that you will find the other nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which Char are you?</span></div></div>",

Been shot, stabbed, strangled, and just about every other thing out there, all on numerous occasions. Has arthritis, a lifetime of injuries will do that.<br>\r\nPowers: Has an accelerated healing rate, which she had long before she became immortal, just for you to know. Has an immunity to various venoms and poisons, making her a walking anti-venom, or poison, factory, (she HAD to become immune). Has telipathic abilities, can make people see things that are not real, or as they appear. Can read someones mind, and be able to know their language, if they speak a different one than her, and speak it fluently. (last two abilities are not very common in many telepaths, not even foxes) Can swallow things larger than her head, hence her alies, Swallowing Zena, Can move her organs, and strech her stomach, which allows her to store a lot of things inside of her body. Very fast, very strong, and a quick learner. (All three of these were what kept her both alive, and one step ahead of the law when she was a criminal)<br>\r\nHome: Lives in Grass City.<br>\r\nFinancial status: Very wealth, though she tends to donate large sums of money to those who are less foutanate, as she knows what it is like to have no one to care for onesself, go hungry, as well as other things. Of course, this wealth attracts criminals like the plague. However, she has lots of live traps set up at her house, not to protect her money, or her valuables, but those who live with her, like her lovers and extended family members.<br>\r\nPlaces that she has been: Let's say that it is easier to say where she doesn't go to, and on Animalus, those would be mountianous areas with lots of snow. (Bad Memories.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife Story, thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn to a loving wolf (mother) and fox (father) couple, with two fox like sisters, the girl, who would one day be called Zena, took after her mother, and looked like a large grey wolf. From the time that she was born, to the time that she was eight years old, she lived near the town of Snow City, a place that was up in the mountians where it snowed for half of the year, with four months of rain, that was split by two months of sun. Had things contenued on as they were, all that would have been known was that the girl was the daughter of the then mayor of Snow City, and that she grew up, and died there. However, fate had different plans for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, when she was just eight years old, her family was out hiking. It was suposed to have been a simple family outing, like all of those before it. On this day though, an avalanch struck. The girl, and her parents, watched in horrer as her sisters were swept away before their eyes. Her mother grabbed her, and she, and her father, started running, trying to find someplace to wait it out. However, the girl's mother fell, and broke her leg, nearly losing her. Her father though, grabbed his wife and pointed at a cave, saying that they might be able to take shelter. However, as they got close, they saw that it was facing the wrong way. Realizing what they had to do, to save their only surviving daughter, the couple tossed the girl in as far as they could, and sealed the enterance with their bodies, just as the avalanch hit, killing the two of them instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, realizing that she was all alone, sat down in the dark, within touching distance of her parents bodies, and started to cry. However, after two days of crying, something in her woke up and said, \"Your parents gave their lives for you. Don't let their sacrifice be in vain.\" She then heard her stomach growling, but, after she checked herself, as well as what she could of her parents' snow encased bodies, she realized that the only things avaliable to her to use as food, were her parents' bodies. Seeing as to how she didn't want her mother and father watch her eating their bodies, she decided to eat their heads first. However, other than her teeth and claws, she had nothing to use to take them apart, or even cook them. Therefor, she made the decision to bite their heads off, and swallow them whole. Closing her eyes, so that she couldn't see herself doing it, she somehow managed to place her jaws over her mother's head, tore it off at the neck, and swallowed it whole, and did the same to that of her father's. However, she was in pain, not only emotionally, and from hunger, but because she was using some latient abilities, that had been passed on to her from her late grandmother, who had died some years before she was born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month or so of being trapped in that small, dark, and horible place, she was free, free to see the sun again. However, something was not right with her. She had become fearal, and her wolf side had taken over. She survived only on her wolf and fox instincts, staying away form others as much as possible, especially after she stole a meat pie, and swallowed it, along with the pan it was in, and was chased away from a small town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, she came upon a caravan of nomads, who were resting for the night. She smelled some food, that was in a pack, that was in the group's supply area, and tried to steal it. However, she dropped something, that caused the group to wake up. When they saw her stealing from them, they tried to capture that they thought was a young adult male wolf, as she was five feet tall by that age, as her mother, and her mother before her, were seven feet tall, by the time that they both died. However, she was caught by a middle aged wolf woman, and when the girl looked at her, instead of being scared, and afraid, she smiled, and said, hugging her, in a young girl's voice, \"Mother!\" She then broke down in tears, saying how lonely that she had been without her and father since the two of them died, and that she was glad to see that she was, at least, alive, once again. Needless to say, this caused the group some confussion, until a male grey fox, whom the girl jumped onto, and called \"Father\", read her mind. When the man told the others what he had found out about the insane wolf girl, who just kept ahold of him, and the wolf woman, calling them mother and father all the time, the group decided that it would be best to take care of her, as she had easily proven herself to be a formidable fighter, as she had easily beaten a few of the group's best fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one week later, just as the girl's mind was starting to heal, and she was becoming used to the others, and playing with the children, a group of outlaws attacked. The girl's \"mother\" and \"father\" told her to stay with the other children, and to protect them, as they went to fight the outlaws. However, they were easily beaten, and either killed or taken captive. But when the outlaws came for the children, they found themselves facing something that they hadn't counted on, a crazy wolf girl, who easily killed those who aproched them first. It took almost all of the outlaws in the group to finally take her down. Just as one of them was about to slit her throat, the leader, a highly venemous snake, showed up, and told them to not kill her, as she could be a valuable addition to their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, her life became a living nightmare. For the next twelve years, she was beaten, raped, and severly injured on countless ocassions. It was during one of these occasions, that she recieved the injury that would prevent her from having children later in life. The leader had somehow gotten her pregnant, during one of the times that he raped her, but the child died during birth. He had ordered her to be beaten, and by the time that the group was done with her, her body was badly injured, enough to the point that her body was forced to sacrifice her reproductive capabilities, and her eggs, in order to heal the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her muraculis recovery, she was forced to do something that haunted her for the rest of her life. The group had caught a Wild Beast officer, who had been tracking them for a while. The leader decided that the girl was to kill him, and ordered her to. However, the man was a grey fox, and she refused to do it. At this, the leader bit her, injecting his venom into her body. He told her that unless she killed the officer, with her teeth and claws, she would die, but, if she killed him, she would get the antidote. Seeing as to how she wanted to live, the girl was forced to kill the officer, trying to make his death as quick as she could. However, after she did it, and recieved the antidote, she was stained with the blood of the officer. After that, in addition to being raped, beaten, and being forced to act as bait to attract unaware travelers, she was forced to kill any adult male prisoners that the group had caught, or else she would die from the effects of the leader's venom, or those of any of the other venemous snakes in the group. She prayed that she would wake up one morning, dead, and find herself in Paridice (equivilent to Heaven) and not suffer anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, after she had turned twenty, the group had murdered some travelers, including a young boy, who had tried to attack the leader after he had killed the boy's parents. The leader ordered her to eat the boy's body, but she refused. Thinking that this was just another small rebellion on her part, he tried to bite her. However, she grabbed his fangs, and broke them at the roots, and, using one of them, stabbed him in the eye. Roaring in anger, and pain, he ordered his men to kill her. Unfortianatly, for them, she became a whirlwind of beath, using the fangs like daggers, tearing off arms, legs, and heads, with her teeth and claws, killing all of them. When they were all dead, she turned, and faced the leader, tossed his broken fangs away, and ripped him open, with her bare teeth and claws, a feat most concider impossible as croc and snake skin is highly impenertrible, and ate his heart and lungs, just as he had forced her to do to so many others. After that, she watched him die, and freed the slaves afterwards, and caplapsed, from numerous injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she recovered, and lead the others to a nearby village, She went to a city, and entered a large building, that was filled with worthless stones (rubies, diamonds, ect) looking for food. However, while looking at a wolf's head made out of gold, which seemed very familiar to her, she was attacked by a guard. Well, needless to say, one doesn't survive twelve years of rape and abuse by outlaws without learning a few tricks. As a result, she dominated him, breaking his arm and leg, and was about to kill him when something caught her eye, a painting. This painting had a wolf that looked exactly like her, only in an uniform, fighting a large number of outlaws. After questioning the guard, who told her everything that he knew about the woman, including her name, Zena, and said that the statue that she had been looking at was of her head. At this, the wolf, looked at the painting and, as if sencing a connection between them, said, \"I'm ZENA\" and placed her hands on the painting. She then took the statue from its case and swallowed it saying, \"I'm swallowing Zena.\" Then, she robbed the place, swallowing everything that she could, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, she encountered a group of outlaws, who had attacked a group of nomads, torturing the survivors. The sight of this caused her to fly into a rage, shouting, \"ZENA! ZENA! ZENA! ZENA!\" and she killed the lot of them. After checking on the survivors, mostly women and children, who were terrified at sight of the blood covered wolf, she left them the majority of her loot, except for the gold head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next five years, Law Enforcement officials cursed her as she seemed to strike out of nowhere, and rob the museums, many of which were thought to be impenitrible, but the nomads blessed her, as she would show up to save them, wipe out outlaw groups, and the Wild Beasts were hunting her down, and getting the outlaws she had missed. During this time, Zena found out that if she disguised herself as a man, she could travel with the nomads undetected, and she also found out that she enjoyed having sex with other women, as there was no memories of them raping her, only men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after one theft, she found herself being followed by a police officer from the city she had robbed, a young female feline type hybrid. Seeing as it had been a while since she had had some fun with anyone, she played her verion of \"Follow me and I'll follow you,\" in which she would lead the officer part of the way, drop back, and follow her, leading her on a merry chase for several days. During this time, she watched the officer, especially at night, and after one exploration of her camp, saw that she had no food or water, and put some near her to have in the morning. However, the next day, the officer, who had something of a fever, and was feeling weak from hunger and dehydration, started walking along a vine covered cliff, and slipped, and would of fallen to her death if Zena hadn't rushed out at the last second and saved her life. The officer, shocked that she had been saved by the person that was considered a thief, murderer, kidnapper, cannibal, and all sorts of criminal names, fell unconciuse. This gave Zena a moral delema, leave the officer and let her die, or take her with her, and risk capture. Well, despite the risks, Zena decided to take her with her, and take care of her. After all, the woman had done no harm to her, so there was no sence in letting her suffer. Besides, traveling alone makes one long for someone to talk to, even if the person is a reluctant traveling partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nurseing the woman back to health, and answering a few of her questions, as to why she had saved her, Zena, more or less, had the officer carry the supplies, and at night, would tie her hands and feet together, so that she wouldn't escape, or try to capture her. After a week together, the pair stummbled upon a sight that was all to familliar to Zena, the aftermath of an outlaw attack on a group of nomads. After searching for, and finding one survivor, who told them what happened before he died, Zena told the officer to drop the supplies, for they were about to hunt down the outlaws, and free their captives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they found them, the outlaws were busy raping the women that they had captured. While the sceen may have shocked the officer, Zena flew into a rage and attacked, and killed the outlaws, in manners remenicant of her fight with her captors. However, after all was said and done, after she had killed the leader, who was a younger brother to the snake that she had kill a few years prior, Zena fell to the ground, and lost consiusness. Thankfully the Wild Beasts showed up, as they had been tracking them for several days, as the police officer was the Commisioner's daughter, and took her to the hospital, where she was kept under heavy guard and restrained. After all, while Zena had been captured before, as well as sent to the hospitals after several fights, the woman had a habbit of waiting until she healed up, and escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, after a failed escape attempt caused her to break her back, she was watched by the commishioner himself, who had two, or three reasons, for doing so. One, he wanted to thank her for saving his daughter's life. Two, she was a high risk criminal, one who had a habbit of doing the unexpected. Three, acording to D.N.A. profiling, she was the granddaughter of the preivious Commishioner, who had two children, an illigitiment son, who was in the military, and a daughter, who was believed to have perished in an avalanch with her husband and three children. Since the son was still alive, and didn't have any missing daughters, this meant that the ledgendary Zena was a survivor of the avalanch that took the lives of at least four others. Needless to say, this gave the man mixed feelings, as the woman had once been his partner, and lover on occassion, and her granddaughter was now his prisoner. Seeing as to how she had only killed outlaws, and helped out their captives, he had been planning on asking the judge to go easy on her, and release her into his custady, so that she would be cared for by him. However, Zena wanted none of that, and took his daughter hostage, with her arm around her neck, indicating that, unless the man did as she said, she would snap the girl's neck like a twig. After opening up a window, she let the woman go and escaped once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later, she took control of a small group of slavers, after killing and eating their leader, who had tried to rape her. They had a few slaves with them, whom she protected from the others. After a while, they were traveling through the land of a former soldier, one who had been tortured, and experimented upon, by the faction of Spidarians who had destroyed Earth and Herog, her men captured two young women, a cat and a fox, both of which were under twenty.years of age. While the cat was terrified of her, the eyes of the fox were similar to her's, not by color, but by the story that they told, one of pain, sorrow, starvation, and other things. The fox didn't have to read her mind to know what she had gone through. She told her her tale, which, while not as blood-filled as hers, was similar, with one differance, someone had saved her life, and gave her a real reason to exist. This struck a cord in Zena, and she had a deal with the young woman, help her save herself from what she had become, and she would free her and the others. The woman agreed, and after setting her and the others free, the woman took them to her husband, Crog, who was of Herog decent, and asked him if the woman, Zena, could stay with them. However, due to the expariments done to him, the man, who was of the Herogan Royal Bloodline, looked nothing like a ten foot lizard. Instead, he had the body and head of a croc, with the neck and tail of a snake, and was forced to grow ten feet each year, and was easily fifty feet in length by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Crog had heard of Zena, and had half a mind to turn her in, when Zoey, the fox woman, told him about the woman who Crog concidered to be his main wife, who was six months pregnant at the time, and how the two of them first met, and how she had stolen a necklass from her, but, when the woman helped care for her wounds, as she had been in a bad fight with some of those that she had been with at the time, that she had been given a second chance by her, and gave the necklass back to her. She told Crog that Zena deserved the same chance that she had been given. At this, Crog made Zena a deal, as long as she didn't harm his wives/lovers, he wouldn't turn her in, but, if she did, he wouldn't hesitate to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several months, Zena's life began to turn around. She wasn't on the run, she wasn't hungry, she didn't have to seek out a mate, as Zoey tended to help her out with that, and, after she revealed to her that she couldn't read or write, or do much in the way of math, Zoey was helping her to become litterate, and to know her arithmitic. However, like with all things, it came to an end. Seeing as she was going to town anyways, to drop some anonomous mail off at the post office, as she had been writing to various newspapers telling them the real truth about her thefts that were put into the paper, as there were errors in their stories, she was asked if she could go to the store with Zoey, and pick up a few things, including baby powder. However, just as they were buying the items, as they were the last ones in the store, there was a special report issued over the telescreen (television only more advanced), telling people that athourities believed that she was in the area, and to be on the look for her. Well, when the storekeeper recognized that she was the ledgendary theif, Zena had two choices, run, and risk getting her friends in trouble, or stay, and turn herself in, and risk being sent to prison for life. However, just before she could make up her mind, the storekeeper's young daughter came out from the back of the store, saw her image on the screen, and asked if she was famouse or something. At this, Zena had chuckled, and told her that she was, and that she was waiting for her biggest fans to arrive, and sat down in a chair to wait for the police to come and pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, for the next several months, Zena's life was a living Hell. Due to the risk factor that she presented, she was kept in issolation, under twenty-four hour guard, with several hundred pound weights strapped to her arms and legs, to slow her down if she tried to run. however, to her, the worst torment that she had to deal with was the mockery, and ridicual, of the guards and other prisoners. After all, the uncatchable theif had been caught while buying baby powder, as the papers reported. About the only good things were Zoey's weekly visits to her, and her contenued tutalage in learning how to read and write, as well as being able to learn how to do math. Also, something amazing happened, the charges of murder and actual canibalism dropped, This meant that, while she could of faced a lifelong prison sentance, at least she would not of been executed. On the day of the trail, after pleading guilty to the various thefts and assults she had committed over the years, the judge had sentanced her to a total of 563 years and 9 months behind bars, which would of prevented her from ever seeing the light of day, except for one thing, Crog showed up. The man had found a loophole, as long as one wasn't convicted of first-degree murder, or another more serious crime, they could be placed under the custody of their spouse, and live, and stay, on the person's property, until the sentance was up, and proposed to her then and there. Well, Zena accepted, which meant that, after checking the lawbooks himself, the judge had no choice but to marry them, and place Zena under Crog's custody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even a cage made of gold is still a cage. After fifteen years of marrage, Zena was becoming depressed. As much as she cared for Crog's children, who called her and the other women that were not their mothers aunts, she wanted to have someone to call her mother. However, after seeing a doctor, she found out the whole reason that she could heal at an accelerated rate, her reproductive organs had changed, and gave her the ability to heal rapidly. She had nothing to really live for, because she was trapped, trapped on Crog's land. As much as she cared for him, and he cared for her, she couldn't really live her life to the fullest. She wanted to leave, leave Crog's land anyways. She wanted to see the world, and search for her family, as she had found out that she had an uncle, and a few cousins, some that were in the military, and at least one who had been in the same unit as Crog at one point, before one of them got transfered to another unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point, that Crog's past reared it's ugly head, when a friend of his, a spidarian who was loyal to the Queen spidarian that saw humans as equals, showed up. After some catching up, in private, the man told Crog that his Queen had been captured, and would be killed unless he gave the enemy what they wanted, Crog, as he was the reason that the enemy queen's daughter, who was going to betray her anyways, was accidentlly killed in a firefight. This queen wanted to make Crog suffer, and was planning to torture him by taking his numerous children, about forty of them, or so, and doing painful experiments upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by the time he got to his place, the children were gone, and the enemy queen left a message, Come and get them if you can. Needless to say, Crog had a contact in the military, and told them that now was the time to launch the entire fleet, but they needed to wait a week, as he and a strike force of a small group of commandos needed to distract the Spidarian forces, so that the fleet could catch them off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the trip to the Spidarian planet, which was called Web by those of human decent, Zena met up with a soldier by the name of William, who was a wolf like her. He was her long lost cousin. However, he hated her, because she was a criminal. Also, he hated Crog, because, when Crog had been held captive by the enemy Spidarians, he'd been forced to eat the man's half-brother, alive, or else the man would of died a very painful death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, during the trip, the two of them had several altercations, Zena's wilderness survival experiance against William's military training and experiance, with  both of them never giving way to the other, until someone broke them up. However, when they were asked why they kept fighting, they never said a word, not even to say that they were cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the planet, and made contact with those loyal to the Queen who was friendly to humans, Crog took both Zena and William, so that they could see what was going on. However, when the group got to a ridge, he had them stop to see what was going on. It was then revealed that the thing had been part of a trap, and some deception, to distract the enemy Queen, as the commandos, and Crog's other wives, who'd came along to get their children back, were captured by those loyal to her. At first, William was outraged at this, until Crog told him the reason for the deception. They were not just there to rescue Crog's children, but to free a world that had all but been taken over by the Spidarians loyal to the Queen who saw humans as slaves and cattle, and kill her in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter navigating through the various traps that had been set up in a secret tunnel that lead to the heart of the Spidarian palace, they carried out their seperate missions, which were to distract the queen, as she'd been poisoned when she had mated with, and eaten, the spidarian who had met up with Crog, who'd been the one queen's main mate, who'd raise her children, as he was steril so he couldn't have children. That Spidarian had poisoned himself, so he could kill the enemy queen in this manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day or so, the poison took full effect, and killed her, though a rock being shot out of Zena's mouth at her throat, that caused her to fall off of the web that she'd been on and splatter across the ground, sped things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Web was free form the rule of that queen, and its people began to really prosper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the queen who'd been saved gave Crog and Zena each a potion of immortality, and promissed Crog that she'd find a way to reverse her sister's expariments that caused him to grow like he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week after they got home, Zena found something for her in the mail, a full pardon for every crime she'd commited, and a special immunity for any thefts she commited in the future, providing that she followed certain rules. (Crog had made a deal with a judge, so that Zena could come with him when they went to Web, under the reasoning that since she Was a master at breaking and entering, her skills would be useful in rescueing his children.) That night, she celebrated her freedom, by robbing about twenty museums, especially those with items that were really stolen or were actually fronts for \"ligitiment bussinesses\" that were run by criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, and most importantly for her, She found out that Crog had adopted a child, one that looked like one that the two of them could of had, and that SHE was named to be the girl's MOTHER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she began to live her life to the fullest. She began to travel, went off-world, visited other planets, (and robbed a few places in the process, though she'd actually been helping out the athorities in the process, because sometimes they needed a reason to enter a suspect's house, which they could if it was an active crime scene.) and forming friendships with those of long-living races in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when she was a hundred years old, to avoid suspicion as to why she looked so young, because while Crog's surviving wives knew that she was immortal, the nighbors were getting suspicious, she faked her death, and went into the Wilds, and did what she did best, track down outlaws and break them up at any rate. Of course, she would show up on occasion, pretending to be her own ghost, and check up on her friends' relations, and go back into hiding, until Crog faked his own death when he was two hundred, and was over two thousand feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a while after this, that the Queen of Web showed up and gave Crog the antidote to what her sister had done to him, though it would take time to shrink him down to a more comfortable size, fifty feet in length, from the tip of his tail to the tip of his snout, about two hundred years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while after this, Zena told the Spidarian Queen about one of her own desires, to be able to swallow people without having to use her trick jaw to do so, so the woman gave her a slow acting version of the growth formula that had been used on Crog, but Zena didn't mind waiting, concidering that she had all the time in the world. Also, she was given a few things that improved her telepathy, and was able to make people see things in their minds that were different from reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this waiting that several advancements in technology were made, including portable view wraps and an improved safety pill, which, when swallowed, lated for the life of the individual who swallowed it. This safety pill made being swallowed by swallowers relatively safe, especially if the person was swallowed feet first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were about four hundred years of age, and Crog was fifty feet long and Zena was thirty feet tall, though she started to walk on all fours, for the most part, though she still can walk on two legs, the pair moved to Grass City, under a couple of alliases. There Zena started a new chapter of her life. There she met a young fox woman, who reminded her of Zoey, who had died of cancer when she was eighty. She also learned about the hardships that she had gone through. When the fox had been thirteen, her mother, father, and 'aunt', (the term most children tended to use when addressing their father's other wives) had died in a fire, and she'd been raised by her older half sister, and both of them worked at a tasting house, though she had just started. This fox was Ariel, and the two of them struck up a friendship that would last the rest of the fox's life. However, the girl's sister had a rare cancer, one that was untreatable, and she had, at most, two years to live, and the two of them lived on a bad side of town, her sister saving up their money, so that when she died her sister had something to live on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zena accidently sped up the rate that the cancer took the life of Ariel's sister. One night, during her sleep, Zena walked out of her house, and went to the apartment where Ariel and her half-sister lived. When she entered the place, still in her sleep, Zena went into the room where Ariel and her sister slept, grabbed the girl and swallowed her, while she was also asleep. However, something caused the girl's sister to wake up, just as Zena swallowed the girl. The woman, fearing for her life, and that of her sister, grabbed a frying pan and proceded to beat Zena with it, and put her into a deep coma before she realized that the wolf was really the woman who had started working for the tasting house, as Zena had been using an illusion to make her less fearsome, when she saw that a bracelet that the wolf wore was the same one as the woman who had showen up, and did what was concidered impossible, swallow a grown person, without killing themselves, or the person, in the process, had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next six weeks, she and Crog barely left Zena's side, both of them worried for the people that they cared about. It was also during this time, about fifteen hundred others were also in a coma, including the mayor, a croc, as well as the top doctor at the hospital, a ram. This was because Zena had been in their minds, at least partially, This meant that when Zena was put into a coma, so where the others. In this coma, the people were in a dream where they thought that most everyone was dead, but Zena managed to get them to work together, and survive, and face, the Wilds of their minds, and face their fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zena fianally woke up, and was informed about had happened, she was able to bring Ariel up. After that, she dropped the allias that she'd been using before, with the explanation that she had something of a criminal past that she'd been trying to get away from. A few months later, the owner of the tasting house where she was working as an entertainer and guard, who was a decendant of her step-daughter, gave ownership of the place over to her, and moved out of the city. Also, during this time, Crog packed up his bags and went to travel the world, but Zena stayed, because she had made a promise to Ariel's sister, that she'd take care of her when she was gone. A few weeks after her sister's death, Ariel moved in with Zena, and became something that was a mixture between a lover and a daughter to the four hundred year old wolf. Then again, Zena had had something of a habit of showing up at her place and swallowing her in her sleep, so she moved to shorten the distance that Zena would have to go to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also during this time that Zena took over the city's gangs, telling them to either do things her way or the highway. She also offered her services as both a security advisor/consultant, and tester, seeing as to how she had been, and was, the greatest thief to have ever lived. She would find a way in, get the things that she would of once taken, set them on the table, very carefully, and write down ways that the owner of the house could use to foil most theieves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something happened that changed her life again. A man, whom Ariel had been dating for a while, tried to rape the girl. However, Zena showed up before he got very far, and gave him two choices, leave, and there would be no trouble, or else. He chose 'or else', and got swallowed by Zena, and got brought back up, feet first, getting his arms and legs broken in the process, which was also painful for Zena, as her throat was sevearly scratched, but, while she could of turned the man around before she brought him up, as being able to move things that are in one's stomach is a very useful trick to prevent unsightly bulges from showing when you swallow things for a living, especially when stealing them, she would take physical pain over emotional pain every time, and she wanted to give that man the pain he had been about to give Ariel. After the trial, in which the man was sentanced to spend a minimal of twenty years, before he could have the possibiliy of parol, behind bars, Zena was aproched by an officer of the Wild Beasts. Despite the fact that she'd been a criminal, and had never been on the police or in the military, she was given the rare honor of trying out to become an officer of the Wild Beasts. She accepted, and breezed through the training faster than anyone had antisiapated that an average civilian, who was a former thief, could ever do. However, when it came to her partners, Zena said, \"Give me your two most disobediant officers, ones who are the most troublesome, who always disobey the rules and regulations, and everyone hates. That's who I want as my partners, for I want parners who will do whatever is nessescary to protect the travelers and the nomads of the Wilds. I don't want someone that I have to watch to make sure that they didn't trip on a root.\" Well, she got her wish. Her partners were a croc and a snake, both of which had been brought up on disiplinary charges on numerous ocassions, and had been close to being drummed out of the force on more than one ocurance, though someone whom they had saved had always managed to speak up for them, in a way that made the tribunal of the most experianced officers on the force change their minds and contenue to let them serve. However, they couldn't stand each other, something about the one doing the other's wife or girlfriend or something. However, during one of their arguements, Zena grabbed the pair, lifted them off of the ground, and after hog-tying them, hung them from a tree, upside-down, telling them that she'd only cut them loose if they agreed to follow her commands, and stopped argueing amongst themselves. Needless to say, they agreed to her terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Zena prefered to work alone, telling her partners, which included six others, to wait until she had taken care of the majoriaty of the outlaws before entering the fights themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ariel was seeing someone new, a black fox named Tom. Of course, after Ariel's last boyfriend had turned out to be something that Zena had to take care of, the former theif used her skills to check the young man out. After all, she wanted Ariel to be safe from someone who would try to take advantage of her. After her investigation was finished, Zena decided that Tom was someone that was alright for Ariel to date, except for one small thing, he was lazy, and didn't even bother searching for a job, as his family was wealthy. However, after one of the guards at the Hungry Wolf and Snake, the tasting house she ran, was severly crippled while fighting an escaped murderer who had entered the place, and had been rough with one of the girls, Zena gave Tom an ultimatum, after she'd been released from the hospital, as she had been stabbed by the man who had assulted her guard before she had caught, killed, and eaten him, and saw the black fox laying on her couch when she came home. Her ultimatum was this, \"Work for me as a guard, or don't bother seeing Ariel again, because I don't want her to have a boyfriend who is a lazy bum.\" Needless to say, the young man agreed to work for her, and a year later, he and Ariel married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, during their honeymoon, which was to one of the undersea cities, Zena came with them, as there was a few groups of outlaws that the Commissioner had heard of between the cities of Grass and Marsh, one large one in particular. Also, Zena had been able to track down a decendant of Zoey, the fox who had saved her life so long ago, who supossedly resided in an unrecognized settlement along the way to the undersea city that the couple was going to. Of course, this decendant was not of a child that Zoey had had with Crog, but of one that had been concieved when she had been raped when she was fifteen, long before she met up with Crog's main wife-to-be. Zeoy had asked her, on her deathbed, to track down her child, or those of him, as she had abandoned him on someone's doorstep, so that he could have what she couldn't give him then. Also, she had heard rumors of a young female wolf, who was doing what she once did, and could do, stealing things and swallowing them, more spacifically, swallowing things the size of her head, in the very city Tom and Ariel were going to for their honeymoon. (Coincidently, it was also the very place that she had made her first robbery, and stolen the Gold Head of Zena from, which she had kept all of those years.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the trip, she made a few friends, especially after she rescued the one, who was the other's wife, from a bunch of canibal outlaws, which was the major group that the Commisioner had asked her to take care of. She had wiped the group out in much the same way as she always did, by basically, ripping and tearing them to pieces, and eating them alive. However, the fight had done a number on her, and besides being severly crippled, she'd been posioned, as most of the outlaws were posionous toads and frogs. Thankfully, some of the prisoners/slaves, that she had rescued were crocs, and after making a litter, they were able to get her, and the others, to Marsh City, where she was treated for her injuries. After she recovered, the two that she had become friends with asked if they could travel with her, as they were all going to the same place anyways. She told them that they could, but they had to make a slight detour to a nearby settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in the settlement, Tom got involved in a fight with a wolf-like hybrid, when the man had tried to take Ariel for his own pleasures, and got his left arm broke, and lost his right eye in the process. The man was a multiple murderer and rapist, who had either killed or raped about twenty people, was highly dangerous, and had a very large bounty on his head for his capture. However, the thing of it was this, this was the person that Zena was looking for, as he was Zoey's thirteenth great-grandson. (By thirteenth, I mean that there is thirteen greats before the word grandson) Since it was her duty to capture criminals, Zena made the man her prisoner, and after giving him a safety pill, swallowed him for safekeeping. The next day, when the group left the settlement, Zena told them who the man was, and how he was related to the woman who had saved her life, and how she was sorry that he wasn't more like the woman that she had known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning the man over to the police in the undersea city, the chef of police asked her to help them out with a case of theirs, involving the young female wolf that she had heard about. As it turns out, the wolf was really a young teenager, one who was forced by the son of an ambassador to steal the objects. She was basically a mule, as it were, for him to transport her goods. However, there was something else, she looked exactly like Zena, not just the former theif Zena, but the Zena that she had named herself after. It was then that Zena realized that the girl was her cousin, several times removed of course, who was of William. However, because the man who used the girl as a mule had Diplomatic Immunity, the local athourities couldn't touch him. Zena, on the other hand, was an officer of the Wild Beasts, which meant that she could bring him in, as the Wild Beasts' Jurisdiction extended to, not just the Wilds, but the entire planet. Anyone who was a citizen of Animalus was under the Wild Beasts' jurisdiction, even if they were not on Animalus itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the place that the man was robbing, she found the man trying to rape the girl. However, Zena rescued her cousin, killing the man in the process. Then, just before the group left, she left something at the police department, the Gold Head of Zena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next forty years, Zena climbed up the ranks of the Wild Beasts, eventually becoming the Commissioner, and watched as Ariel, Tom, and Rachel, Zena's cousin, whom she had adopted as her stepdaughter, grew older, had children, and watched those children have children of their own. It was during this time that she also helped some archiologists uncover the spaceship of the ancestors, and learned of the planet's early history, and why the hybrids, like herself, had been created. Also, Crog would come to visit Zena during the summer, with the group of nomads he now lead, as he had saved them from some outlaws who had killed their leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortanatly, after being her friend, and lover, for forty-five wonderful years, Ariel died, due to complications from injuries that she had sustained in a fight with some criminals, which had taken Tom's life, a few years prior. Despite accepting her friend's death, things were hard for Zena, as she had been named mayor on that day to. During her time as mayor, the Commissioner of the Wild Beasts shared the role of leadership with some of the more experianced officers, and the owner of the Hungry Wolf and Snake let her employees, spaciffically the more experianced ones, run the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the next election came up, she didn't run for office, as politics were not really her thing, as she didn't quite have the patients to lay in wait as it were, like crocs and snakes did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during her first week back as an active officer of the Wild Beasts that Zena rescued a young woman, a born human, as her parents had been a wolf and a horse respectively, and she'd been born a human. However, her parents had been murdered by the outlaws that Zena had saved her from, so Zena took the girl under her paw, as it were. The girl's name was Julia. A few years later, when she was of age, Zena married her, out of love, as the girl helped fill a hole that was left in her heart when Ariel died. A month or so after they married, an ambassador, who was heading to another planet, Fleras to be exact, asked Zena to be an Honor Guard, as she had saved his son some time prior. Figureing she could use a bit of a vacation, she decided to go with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was because she had recently recovered from some wounds with a space pirate, who had took the lives of two of her partners, as they had been inside of her when the man had fired a laser at her stomach, which severly injured them, as they had been asleep inside of her as they had taken a room at a more recently built resting place in an unrecognized settlement, which didn't have very good beds, so she had swallowed them so that the three of them could get a good night sleep, when the pirate entered the place and woke Zena up. However, the wound to the stomach was not what had killed her partners, as they could of survived, except for one thing, the man also shot Zena in the throat, preventing her from bringing them up, and saving their lives. Because she didn't want her partners to suffer from the pain of being digested alive, as one's safety pill wasn't fully efective when one was severly injured, she had asked the settlement's enforcers to tie her down, and club her stomach, to give her partners a relatively quick and painless death, as opposed to being digested alive by stomach acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the trip, Zena had brought her various lovers, those who didn't have husbands and children at any rate, including Julia. The girl had been looking for the man that she wanted to to have as a husband, but despite the numerous guards at the tasting house, which she worked at, none of them were what she was looking for in a life long partner. Also, she had almost been raped by a man that Zena had let spend the night, a wolf to be exact. As a result, the girl had a slight fear of carniverous hybrids, especially canines, and spacifically, wolves, including Zena. As a result, Zena had to be carefull around Julia, as something as simple as putting a paw on her shoulder, when she wasn't looking at her, could bring on a panic attack, bringing out the small bits of wolf and horse that were within her, and cause her to fight Zena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this trip that Zena met up with a few ship rats, kids whose parents were crewmen on some spaceship. However, their parents had been the victims of space pirates a few years prior, and were also, basically, stowaways. Now, while an adult could face up to twenty years in a penal colony for doing so, children, especially those whose parents had been crewmen on a ship, especially those whose parents had served on the same ship as one, or more, of the other crewmen, were something of a special clause. If a crewman was willing to give up four or more months worth of pay, they could adopt the child as their own, otherwise the child could be turned over to the athorities of the planet that the ship last left. Of course as a member of the Wild Beasts, this meant that the kids would of been turned over to her anyways, so after Zena took them before the ship's captian, the children became her wards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a week into the juorney to Fleras, pirates, who followed the man whom Zena had captured, attacked the ship, intending to hold the pasangers and crew as hostages, to get their leader back, and took it over. Unknown to them though, the man was in a holding cell on board. Zena, however, lead a counterattack, and managed to not only retake control of the ship, but also forced the pirates to surrender, after she took those that she had killed while saving the passangers and crewmen to the kitchen and began to cook them, saving their leader for desert, as she had dragged him to the kitchen, and hung him on a hook, and rewired a camera in a manner which overroad every other camera, and forced the pirates to watch. She gave the pirates two choices, surrender to a man, or watch as their leader was eaten alive. Needless to say, they surrendered. After that, the pirates were turned over to the United Planets Space Navy, which was the navy that every planets' navy gave way to, as a planet's navy was like the national guard in a manner of speaking, when there was an enemy that was a threat to multiple planets, like space pirates, much like the Wild Beasts on Animalus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while after this, the ship landed on a former penal colony to pick up an ambassador that was heading to Fleras as well, as well as his son. The son, however, was something of a womaniser, in which he'd get women to fall in love with his good looks, and sometime later, slept with them, and just left them afterwards. He took one look at Julia and wanted her as one of his conquests, as it were. However, while Zena didn't exactly like womanisers, she didn't mind them too much. However, it was his attitude that made her fur stand on end, and cause her to bare her teeth at him, as it were. He had the same snooty attitude that most non-native humans had when it came to hybrids. However, one night, after the man, James, had tried to force himself onto Julia, when the woman had told him that she didn't want to have sex, when he was drunk, Zena had forced him to swallow a safety pill and swallowed him for the night. In the morning, she had gone to his father and told him what had happened. After letting the young man out, the pair had a very serious talk with him, and told him that his immunity would be revoked the next time he did it, meaning that the embassy would not grant him sancuary if an angry husband came for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had shocked the young man, especially when Zena revealed the fact that, according to Animalus Law, she had the right to have eaten him alive when he tried to force Julia to have sex with him, reguardless of his Diplomatic Imunity. However, she was willing to give the young man a second chance, providing that he followed certain rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months later, they were back on Animalus, and James had to face his first challange, dealing with the diets of the various hybrids, especially the drinks. Since hybrids can't handle alchool to well, they drank specially carbonated fruit juices, or, especially in the case of carnivores, blood mixed with water. He found out about this when he saw a bottle that was labled \"Human Blood\" right behind the carbonated grape juice that he had taken out of the fridge when Rachal made him some lunch on his first day on the planet while he was in Zena's house. He was even more surprised to see the elderly wolf drink it as he would a glass of wine, very slowly, and savoring the flavor. However, the wolf, who was Zena's distant cousin mind you, told him that seeing people drinking blood was something that he best get used to seeing, After all, things like wine were reserved for only highly special occasions, like the mid-summer celebration on the day that the planet celebrated the colonization of Animalus, the day when the Lovers' Flowers bloomed and had their seeds scattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also had to deal with getting a job, but when he told Rachal that he wanted to work at the Embasy, the wolf asked him if he wanted to be janitor, as they wouldn't let someone just become a guard without at least two years worth of expeariance, either as a minor servant at the embassy itself, or had worked as a guard at either a mating house, or a tasting house, or some other such place where things, or people, had to be protected, and also had to know how to handle himself, and hold his ground, during a fight. So James asked what was avaliable then, that would allow him to get the experiance that he needed to become a guard at the embassy. The answer that Rachal gave him was, \"Working at the Hungry Wolf and Snake, as a guard, will give you the experiance that you need.\" However, she also told him something else, that if he decided to work there, he didn't just have to be a guard, he could also be something of a servant, whether it was to those who were full-time dishes, or to Zena herself, part maintnance man, keeping the equipment at the place functional and up to date, and code, or, if he really wanted to make money, a dish for those who enjoyed the taste of male flesh. Seeing as to how Julia work there anyways, James decided to try it out, if only to be close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, while bathing in one of the large baths Zena had, James met up with his partner, a skunk named Hennry, who gave him something, a knife that had belonged to his late brother, who had been born human, who had been a police officer who was killed in the line of duty. The man told James that it was both for his personal protection, as well as the fact that he couldn't carry it himself while in the city, and because of the fact that he looked a lot like the man's brother. After seeing the pain in the man's eyes, James accepted the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when they were done bathing, Zena had asked the two to follow her to her private chambers, which were where she did her paperwork and kept her personal trophies, heads that represented the various outlaws and criminals she had killed or captured over the years, slaves that she had freed, and those that she had found, or rescued, and so on. It was also here that Zena kept some more, personal, momentoes, of her favorite lovers, like Zoey and Ariel.  However, that was not what she had brought them in for. In the room was the man who had killed Hennry's brother. The man was seeking forgiveness for what he had done, before Zena carried out the man's sentance, which was to be executed by her. After some soul searching on his part, Hennry forgave the man, and left the room, with James following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were eating their breakfast, James had heard a very distinctive *Snap* of bones breaking, which he heard again when he noticed Rachal biting on a bone, so that she could get the marrow out of it. Needless to say, he didn't bother ta ask what the snap had been, especially when Zena came into the kitchen and Rachal asked if she was just going to have a light breakfast, to which Zena more or less nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years later, after learning more about Animalus than most non-native humans did, and after he had married Julia, James became an ambassador between his home world and Animalus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was also when the planet, that was later called Char, was discovered. Anxious to have a colony of their own, Animalus patitioned the United Planets alliance for the chance to make the attempt, which, surprisingly, was granted. As a result, plans to find those who were willing to colonize the planet were created. The people who joined up tended to be nomads, who wished to blaze new trails, as it were, or minor criminals, who were given a chance to earn their freedom, the same sorts of people who had origianally settled Animalus all of those centuries ago. On board the ship that took the potential settlers was also, five hundred soldiers, five hundred police officers, and one hundred Wild Beast officers, which were lead by Zena herself, who was also the honorary leader of the colnists, as she was highly respected but the majoriaty of the people on board. Also, Julia was with her, and she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when they landed on the planet, Zena felt that they were being watched, and set off to find the source of this feeling. She quickly found what she was looking for when she saved a human-like creature from the stomach of a wild animal, that had tried to attack Julia, who had followed her. After reading the young man's mind, Zena realized that there were two sentiant races living on the planet, the human-like Charzons, and the dragon-like Chargons. After going their seperate ways, the two groups got themselves ready, the Chargons and Charzons gathering in force in the forests and hills surrounding the clearing, and those from Animalus getting ready for a celebration, with Zena and the soldiers, police officers and Wild Beast officers keeping an eye out for trouble, whether it came from within their own people, or with the locals, which everyone knew were watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night the leader of the Chargons, and some of his best fighters entered the clearing, and Zena went to meet them, with some of the croc and snake officers. The two leaders were sizing each other up, when Zena said that fighting would do none of them any good. She told them that a battle would be costly for both sides, as both would sell their lives to protect what they cared for the most, their friends and family. Peace, and trade, on the other hand though, would benefit both of them. These things had been on the mind of the Chargon leader, as he only wanted to protect his people, and would only fight if the off-worlders proved to be hostile. As a result, new friendships started to form between the two groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months later, however, duty called. A strange-looking cheetha landed on the planet, one that gave her an eirrie feeling. After reading his mind, she discovered two things, one, he was really a human who had been fussed with the DNA of a cheetha, and two, the cheetha that he'd been fussed with was the same cheetha who had been fussed with the captian of the spaceship that had taken the origianal hybrids to Animalus, whom she had spoken with several decades prior, after he'd been awoken from a cronogenic sleep of more than four thousand four hundred years, before the man had died moments later. After they told her their story, in which Zena was informed that they were not the only ones that this had happened to, but it was also worse for others, many of which were children, Zena agreed to help them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the month, she was on the man's homeworld, EarthTwo. She and the man, who was an expert in breaking and entering like she was, entered the place. While the cheetha-man went after the captives, Zena went for the scientists that willingly preformed the expariments. When she found them, they were disecting a young man, who was still alive. At the sight of this, Zena flew into a rage, and attacked them, knocking many of them out. She then stripped them, tied them up, and stacked them like cordwood. After that, she went to the young man, who asked her to end his suffering, as Zena saw that the boy would not make it. She told him that she would, and after he thanked her for freeing him from his captors, Zena gave gave him an injection of sleeping medication, and when the man had fallen asleep, she snapped his neck, which brought back painfull memories. Then, she gave the scientists a taste of their own mediciane, and turned them into the very things that they had once tried to create, gave them each a safety pill, and swallowed each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering up various documents, both as evidance, and hopeful that they had formulas that could be used to reverse the process, for the captives, not the naturally born hybrids, Zena set up expolsives, which she set off, after making sure that there was no one else, and burying the body of the boy, as he deserved a decant burrial, destroying the entire place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she went after those who were resopnsible for the whole thing, locating more than a few currupt public officials and police officers in the process, and brought them to face justice. However, there was one person that was on Animalus who was a part of it, as he had supplied them with the blood of hybrids, but he didn't know what his partners were doing with it. When Zena informed the man of what exactly his partners had done, and after showing him pictures of what had been done, especially to those who were children, the man was so remorseful that he asked Zena to see to it that his entire fortoune went to help those who had suffered because of what he had done..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen years later, the UPA, The United Planets Alliance, asked Zena to help explore a recently discovered planet, especially to see if there was sentiant life-froms on it  There was, with beings that came in every shape and size immagianable, from human-like creatures, to anthro-like creatures, to various types of taurs, to creatures resembling things from every mythology that Earth had, and then some, all between the size</span></div></div>",

It would have been something men would have gone wild over if any of them were allowed to see, but sitting in a chair near the foot of the bed was a sly and devious individual.  There was a moment of silence, signaling that the climax was over.  Zena, along with a few of her lovers poked their heads from under the covers and took deep breaths from there exhausting play.  That was when Zena noticed her unwanted intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE!\" She yelled in both surprise and anger as she and the others quickly covered themselves up, \"how long have you been there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long enough\" the intruder said as he got out of his chair, \"and please, continue.  Pretend that I'm not even here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!\" She yelled, but there was no other response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the once formidable thief need help with her guards to come and dispose of me\" the intruder taunted.  When he approached, the most noticeable thing was his professionally tailored suit, along with the top hat he wore.  It was also clear that he was some kind of wild dog, maybe a hyena if one considered his laugh.  Though what was most interesting was the fact that he wore a half mask that covered the upper half of his face and was warped slightly to make room for his large distorted smile that almost went from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just wanted to give you a few seconds to run away if you value your life\" growled Zena, already trying to probe the man's mind for his identity, but something surprised her, when she looked for the mans true face all she got was the image of his mask, as if the mask was the man's identity.  That and a name, \"The Escapist\", everything else was in a quagmire of abstract thought and indecipherable babble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't hold my breath\" The Escapist said with a 'Jackal Cackle', \"they are all indisposed at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I'm gonna tear you limb from limb\" Zena retorted, getting out of the bed, not afraid that she was stark naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Escapist tipped his hat saying, \"maybe next time, but I should be leaving, I have a museum that's having a five fingered discount.  Though, to make sure don't forget me, I've taken something of yours as a memento of my stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZena pounced, but landed on the floor as the thief threw a cloak over himself and seemed to melt into the floor, leaving the cloak behind.

The third, Julia, was still alive though, and had been her main lover for just over a decade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill that jerk,\" she said, with a growl. \"No one gets away with coming into my house and stealing MY LOVERS' BRACELETS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of her lovers said, \"Zena, where's Julia at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Zena asked, as she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly saw that Julia, the born human woman that she had rescued when the girl was just sixteen years old, was not among her lovers, that had been outside of her when they had been having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have just swallowed her when I wasn't paying attention?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorriedly, she carefully picked up her portable viewwrap (Think X-ray only more advanced, and safer) and placed it on her belly, and turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while her other lovers that had been inside of her were accounted for, Julia was not among them either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That son of a, I'm going to eat him alive,\" Zena said, as she pulled out a robe. \"No one takes my lovers against their will. No one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zena didn't mind sharing her lovers with their husbands and other lovers, she would not tolorate those who used them for their own selfish gain. Then again, she knew all about men, how there were those who were almost knight-like and caring, and how there were those who were on the other end, the sort she hated the most, rapists and abusers. Also, Julia had almost been raped before, by a wolf whom Zena had let stay for the night, but Zena had caught him in the act, and after a chase, which took them into the city, she finally caught the bastard. The only thing that had stopped her from eating him was the fact that he had surrendered, and by the rules of the Wild Beasts which she lead, she could not harm those who had surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the damage was done, as the girl had become afraid of carnivores, especially canines, spacifically wolves. As a result, even after over ten years afterwards, Zena had to be very careful around her, not just during sex, but on a day to day basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Julia was married, to a young ambassador, who was human whose homeplanet was a former penal colony, meaning that he had the blood of a criminal, which Zena didn't mind, and had three children, tripilites, a human, a dog, and a horse, which was unusually, concidering the fact that, while Julia's parents were a dog and a horse respectively, James, Julia's husband, was pure human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zena thought about what had happened, she let out a growl, and said, \"I'm going to enjoy eating him alive when I catch him.\"</span></div></div>",

Now awake, everything was still dark but she could hear her own breath and feel that she was tied to a chair.  Memories of her past rushed in, she tried to scream but couldn't by the fact that she was gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I had to keep you in the dark\" came a smooth and settled male voice, \"but I don't want you to know where my hide out is.\"  Julia then recoiled as the black bag was removed from her head.  She looked around, seeing that she was in a very small warehouse filled with props and other miscellaneous objects.  Though, she was even more frightened by her captor, the fact that he was a dog of sorts, and was smiling in a way that could easily be portrayed as a 'rape face'.  The Escapist looked at Julia, scared out of her mind, tears trickling down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry madam, I'm not going to hurt you\" sweet talked the Escapist, though that helped as much as trying to use a stick of chewing gum to fix a dam leak.  He then sighed, though still kept his ear to ear smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here, let me prove it to you\" the Escapist said as he untied her.  Julia, immediately ungaged herself and hid behind one of the props.  The Escapist shrugged before tossing an article of clothing at her saying, \"here, put this on, it's less revealing as the robe your wearing now.\"<br>\r\nJulia quickly took the garments, which was covered in shiny sequins, but didn't put it on just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm going to release you anyway\" chuckled The Escapist, \"I only took you to make a point Zena.\"  He held out the three large gold plated bracelets before linking all three of them together with a resonant 'clink'.  \"Your just a pawn in my plan to claim the title 'king of thieves' from your mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my lover\" Julia corrected as she still hid behind one of the props.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, so the young woman speaks\" retorted The Escapist, \"I'm glad you decided to revoke your vow of silence, because you do have a pretty voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me go\" Julia asked, her voice wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will in due time, but like I said, your a small part in my plan, and there's nothing like a prisoner to provide leverage.\"  Julia still hid, though even with his huge smile, The Escapist didn't seem to have any real sexual interest in her.  He then added, \"besides, I already have a girlfriend who can provide all the love I need, there's no reason why I should... play around with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia ignored him, wishing that her lover Zena would come and save her.</span></div></div>",

In all that time, it had told time through wet, dry, times of plenty, times of hardship, times of attack by outlaws when the bands were large enough to do so, and during times of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, to see it defaced, was to look at something that would never quite heal, like Zena's life. To see it reminded her of the time, and the life, that she could of had. She could of been just a tall wolf who lived in Snow City up in the mountians. She could of had children of her own. She could of even known, and used, her real name, whatever it was. However, because of an avalanch, that was something she could never have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zena,\" the doctor said, snapping her back to the presant. \"By mask, I did't mean the physical one, I mean the mental one. You must think as he thinks. You must know what he wants before he does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me to think as Swallowing Zena once thought?\" Zena asked, as she remembered that life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she had stolen to survive, but later on, she had stolen for the thrill, the fame, or infame. She could fool anyone into thinking that she was someone else. She could even fool the guards of the place that she was going to rob, right up to the point that she robbed the place before their eyes. Everyplace she went, the police cursed her, calling her the large wolf who ate peoples' valuables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there had been anouther side of her as well, the killer of outlaws and liberator of slaves. She would kill outlaws in vicious, and bloody ways, and free their slaves. She was praised by the nomads, because even when she didn't wipe out a group, the Wild Beasts, who were hunting her, took care of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a curse and a blessing. She was called the Uncatchable Theif by the police, and the Liberator of the Wlids by the nomads. Depending on who you talked to, she was either a hero or a villian, with nomads calling her a hero and city-dewllers calling her a villian for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the presant, she looked back at the duck doctor and asked, \"Well, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have to think like what you used to do back then,\" he said. \"Then yes, think like the theif that you once were, all those years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Zena just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that I don't like to think about that life,\" she said. \"It's not me, not anymore. I left that behind me the day that Zoey saved my life. I may use my skills to help test out security systems, and open up the occasional safe that a child accidently locks himself into, and track down criminals, but I'm not one of them, not anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Zena,\" the doc said. \"You've told me about what happened back then when you first started to see me fifteen years ago when you were the mayor, after Ariel passed away from her, complications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Zena said, as a tear rolled down her eyes. \"It is one thing to be able to hold onto a friend's hands as they pass into the afterlife and have to face the Judgement Beasts, but this, this is different. It's as if my heart was ripped out and eaten before my eyes. I just feel so weak, so helpless, so, so empty, inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zena, here is what I recamend,\" the doctor said, as he stood up. \"Go home, clear your head, and get some sleep. You will be able to think more clearly in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that as a doctor, or as a friend?\" Zena asked, as the duck grabbed his hat and coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have to say both,\" the man said, with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, I guess I'll follow your advice,\" Zena said, with a chuckle. \"By the way, is that one cousin of yours a Stork? I think that one of my employees at the Hungry Wolf and Snake is pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let him know,\" the man said, as he look flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Stork is a term applied to doctors who deal with pregnancy and artificial means of becoming pregnant.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pour me another glass Rachal,\" Zena said, an hour later, as she set down a large crystal glass that had a small amount of a blood-and-water drink left, on a table at her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that this will be your sixth glass that you've had,\" said an elderly looking female wolf, who looked exactly like Zena, except for the fact that her fur was getting lighter, and she was seven feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Zena said, as she watched the elderly wolf pour her a glass of human blood that was mixed with one part blood to three parts water, the highest concentration of blood-to-water allowed by law for safety reasons. \"It's just hard to clear my head when I think about what that bastard could be doing to her. You remember what that ambasador's son used to do to you before I rescued you and killed him all of those years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember it quite well,\" Rachal said. She had been raped and used as a mule by a tiger hybrid after he had killed her mother over seventy years prior. \"I also remember that you broke into the museum that he was in the process of robbing, when he was trying to rape me, and killing him. There is no doubt that you will save her as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that cousin,\" Zena said. \"It's just that, this guy's so good at what he does, it makes me look like a pickpocket in comparison. I need to figure out what his plan is. I need to know how he thinks. I need to know how he does his tricks.And above all else, I need to know where he is hiding and keeping Julia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know about how to help you to find him,\" Rachal said. \"But, as for his tricks, why don't you ask...</span></div></div>",

She couldn't even find a blade that wasn't dull or flexible, probably for use in her captor's magic acts.  In her wait she searched the warehouse out of curiosity, finding many things, most of which weren't magic supplies but stolen artifacts.  She was even surprised to find the insides of a giant clock, as if it was from a clock tower.  She jumped as she heard the door quickly open and close and the Escapist walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting my dear, but I thought you might be hungry\" apologized the Escapist as he placed the bag of food on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry\" Julia mumbled, turning away from her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's here if you want some\" offered the Escapist, sitting down in a chair and pulling out a large glass bottle of amber liquid.  A small glass appeared in his hand as he began poring and drinking the liquid.  Julia noticed that the liquid in question was a rare beverage known as Brandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought hybrids couldn't handle consuming alcohol?\" asked Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Escapist turned his head and replied, \"your right, they can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, your drinking it\" Julia pointed out.  The Escapist didn't answer her as he continued having his dinner.  There was silence from then on out, neither of them talking to each other until the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam BludFeather?\" Zena asked as she looked at the female Cardinal hybrid wearing a very glamorous if not skimpy dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how may I help the great Zena\" replied BludFeather, giving a bow to the large wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that my reputation proceeds me\" Zena replied with a slightly more cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, being a traveling circus we all fear being attacked by bandits, though thankfully you made traveling safer for all of us\", thanked the curvy cardinal as she sat down in a nearby chair, \"now, what confuses me is why a great warrior like you would come and visit a little entertainer like me?  Do you have a party you want me to perform at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need your help\" Zena confessed, \"someone's life could be at steak and I need to know how you do those magic tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to trick me into revealing my secrets?\" BludFeather asked slyly, though Zena gave BludFeather a viewer with all recorded pictures and video of the Escapist on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is The Escapist. This b@stard kidnapped my lover, stole my most precious possessions, and just stole the clock in the clock tower a few hours ago\" Zena informed the magician with a stern tone in her voice, \"he was able to do this apparently with the assistance of the same tricks that you used in your show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludFeather looked at the pictures surprised and started replaying the videos over and over again.  \"This guy is amazing, his misdirections are so subtle, the deceptions are astounding, not to mention the forethought and planning is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you tell me how he's doing some of these things or not\" interrupted Zena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBludFeather crossed her legs and sighed, \"kind of, at least not without in depth study and review.  Though what I can tell you is that he's controlling you like puppets.  For example, the clock probably isn't even real in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Zena asked, immediately wondering if this woman was crazy, \"that clock has been there for thousands of years\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm saying is that your criminal stole it a long time before you even got there\" BludFeather then pointed at Zena when she was rushing down the tower, \"and when everyone's sight was misdirected to you and the Escapist at the bottom of the tower, he probably remotely caused the fake front of the clock to fold down and probably self destruct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it was gone the entire time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and the problem is, it's hard to tell what's real and whats fake without knowing how he prepared it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give me some good advice?\"</span></div></div>",

However, there is a catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of catch?\" Zena asked. \"I'm not going to have to be a part of one of your magic tricks am I? After all, I do my own tricks as a part-time preformer at the tasting house that I own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" BludFeather said, with a chuckle. \"However, it is some thing of a family matter.

To make sure that my son and I, and the rest of the troupe, survived, he took several very powerful, and loud, smoke bombs, the sort of which one uses to cover an enterance or departure when one's segment is over, and set them off, just as the brigands were right on top of him, causing a very large avalanch that not only blocked the pass behind us, but swept them away, along with my husband. Good Judgement Beasts, how I miss that turkey, how his beard and snood were just so, and his tailfeathers, and his spurs, oh, how I loved him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, does your son take after him or you when it comes to looks, if you know what I mean?\" Zena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He takes after his father,\" BludFeather said. \"Why do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while since a turkey has worked for me as a dish,\" Zena said. \"If he doesn't mind being treated as if he was a part of some Thanksgiving feast from that Old Earth country called the USA, he could make a lot of money if he worked as an alternative dish for those who like male flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" BludFeather asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Zena said. \"Then again, there are not many turkey hybrids in Grass City.

In exchange for my help, you have a chance to work for Zena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Zena said. \"If you have heard of me, you know that I won't hire someone unless they let me swallow them first. Of course, it is your choice as to what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Jack decide?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please note, since there isn't enough space to fully explain it, If Jack decides to let Zena swallow him, he has to strip naked, and bathe in some warm water, while wearing a special see-through cloth outfit, which can survive stomach acids and let someone taste the skin underneath fur, feathers, ect. (Don't worry, his mother won't be there, and Zena prefers women over men anyways.) After thirty minutes, Zena swallows him, headfirst, and lets him back up, headfirst, which due to how she can move things around in her stomach.*</span></div></div>",

The cards didn't look normal, unlike those with colorful backs his had black backs, like a negative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Julia said, looking away.  She then felt something tap her back, it was a card, the queen of spades to be exact.  She picked it up and saw that Zena was drawn in the card's style as the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, there's a pattern for my chaos, raping isn't part of it though\" the Escapist declared pulling a card from the deck, \"I pull four cards, Spades mean I have to steal from a crinimal, the number on the card is how many people I steal from, but a face card means their rank, I drew the queen of spades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the king?\" Julia asks, looking at the card deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me\" The Escapist said as he pulled out the King of Spades but only showed it to her for a breef moment, \"and yes, that means I have to steal from myself.\"  He shuffled the deck again as he continued, \"clubs represent people in the person's life who I will kidnap, same ranking go's, but if it's the king of clubs that means I kidnap the person in question.  I drew the ace of clubs, one person.  Diamonds represent the number of possessions I have to steal that are close to that person's heart.  I drew the three of diamonds, as in her three bracelets.\"  He then gave a deep chuckle as he showed her the ace of hearts.  \"Hearts represents the person's life, how many times do I poke into their personal life, as in mess around with their minds, twist their souls.  The numbers represent the same thing, how many times do I do it.  Face cards are special, the Jack of hearts, also known as the one eyed jack, means I have to cause the person to mutilate themselves, weather it's a simple cut or gouging their eye out isn't a preference.  The Queen of hearts means I need to make them turn over a new leaf, means I need to change them mentally, how or what is something I decide.  The King of Hearts, the suicide king, means I cause them to attempt suicide, weather they live or not is out of my control.  I drew the queen of hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a monster, how can you do this to people?\" Julia cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any harm done is done to themselves, and don't worry, what I'm going to do to your precious Zena is going to help her greatly.\"  The Escapist then pulled out a Joker, \"and by the way, just for clarification, the Joker means that everything is voided, I can do whatever I want to the person in question, which means I can do absolutely nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wild card\" Julia said, \"but why do you follow these cards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, I can only do what I am dealt with, which is more fun than picking out a custom hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack fell to the ground as he was upchucked by Zena, saliva dripping all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste quite good\" Zena said with a smile, \"you would become an excellent dish.  You would be a great addition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm glad to hear that\" Jack said with a smile, \"I...</span></div></div>",

If you want to, you can just preform tricks, magic, and other such things on the stage that I have at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Zena said. \"If my guards or girls have some talent that they are good at, like singing, dancing, magic tricks, acting, and so forth, they can double as entertainers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" Jack asked, as he took the outfit he'd been wearing off and put on the clothes that he'd been wearing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two reasons,\" Zena said. \"First off, one can't be a dish every day, as it could wear a person out, meaning that they won't taste as good, so every few days, I take them off of the day's roster of avaliable dishes for the clients to chose from, and have them either watch the children in the play area, preform minor servant duties, like making sure that the day's dishes have something to eat before they are served to the clients, or helping me get dressed for my sceens in the plays I preform in, and so forth, or, if they have a talent, have them preform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is the second reason?\" Jack asked, as he pulled up his special leather leggings, that could withstand being scratched by his powerful talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to entertain the clients,\" Zena said, causing Jack to stop what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Zena said, with a smile. \"Since it takes thirty minutes for someone to maridnate, as it were, before they are ready to be served, by one of the guards in the soaking area, who presses a button that creates a suction vacumue to turn on, and send the person through a tube to a table in less than a second, the clients have to wait. The shows though, which are in thirty minute segments mind you, help them to enjoy themselves until their 'dish', as it were, is served.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I get paid for preforming?\" Jack asked, with an interested look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Zena said. \"You will be given a decant hourly wage, all the money that people throw at you at the end of your preformance, though we tend to suggest that the clients put it in a tip box, as it were, and, should you decide to try out for, and become, a dish, you be paid on a mixture for commision, the number of times you are served that is, the types of sauces and spices, and whatnot, you are served in, tips that the clients give you, both the ones you are served to, and those who apreciate your words when they are waitng for their own dish to enjoy. Also, and know this, the more exotic your flavor is, the higher your price, and how much you are paid, is. In fact, I have a convict, who is working for me, who is making a lot of money. Do you want to know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy's half wolf, as hias arms, legs, head, and tail will tell you, but he is also half lizard, and other than his head, limbs, and tail, he has the body of one. And since lizards keep on growing, sometimes swallowers can't comfortably swallow them, and that thing costs the most, meaning that this guy is quite popular with them,\" Zena said. \"Of course, he does have one minor problem, he has a never-ending mating urge, meaning that there are times that I have to look the other way when he and one of the girls are in a private room. In fact, it was this condition that got him arrested, for attempting to rape my Julia. Thankfully, I've been able to help him with his, condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll see about coming to your tasting house in the morning,\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember,\" Zena said. \"It's the place that looks like a wolf's head covered in snake scales, with the machanical mouth that is open when the place is open for bussiness and closed when the place is closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that how the place got it's name?\" Jack asked, with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Zena said, as she left. \"That was how it got its name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zena walked home, she looked over in the direction of the tasting house that she owned. It had been built and owned by her stepdaughter, over four hundred years ago. Over the years, it had pased from one decendant to another, until it was given to HER, when her one step great (about seven or so times repearted) -granddaughter,  decided to leave the city, and gave it to her because they were distant relations, because she had thought that Zena was a cousin of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked up at the stars, and, looking at one in particular, said, \"Zoey, Ariel, watch over Julia until I can save her.She means a lot to me, just like you guys do. And someday, when my time comes, and I have served my time in Digestion, and I am allowed to enter Paridice, I hope to see you there, waiting for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home, she went up to her room, and, after swallowing a few of her lovers, not only to make room for her, but to help settle her nerves, got in bed, and went to sleep, hoping that she would catch the Escapist the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We interrupt this story for this Thanksgiving Special,\" Zena says, as she breaks the forth wall. \"Now, while Animalus doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving, that doesn't mean that we can't throw a party or two!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Right!\" The Escapist says, as he and Julia apear in a flash of smoke. \"I love a good party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure that you behave,\" Zena says, as she looks at the masked man. \"I'm still going to get you for ruining my robe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, you'll have your work cut out for you,\" the man says, while he laughs. \"You don't even know what I really look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really,\" Zena says, with a wicked smile. \"Your creator, Walson, has been talking to my creator, alockwood1, and has told him a few things that will surprise the readers, which he was kind enough to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you won't tell anyone what I really look like,\" the man says, with a nervous laugh. \"After all, my mother would kill me if she found out that I was a theif.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secret is safe with me,\" Zena says. \"For the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" the man says, as a carving fork and knife appear in his hands. \"Let's carve the turkey up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jack, a turkey hybrid, says, \"I hope you guys arn't talking about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Zena says, as she pulls several large wild turkeys out of the oven. \"That would be canibalism, and canibalism for non-survival reasons, or as part of a funeral, is punishable by being eaten alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sets the turkeys on the table, where several other people from the various threads in Planet Animalus, including two cheethas, a snake, a fox, a bat and human couple, and a few others, are sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escapist, will you do the honors?\" Zena asks the masked man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the man says, as he carves the first piece, sets it on a plate, and hands it to Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Julia says, as she sits down. \"Of course, Zena is still going to get you for kidnappig me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh time will tell,\" the man says. \"Only time will tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the end of the Thanksgiving Special.

She let her lovers out of her stomach before getting dressed and checking the news in hopes that the Escapist had made his move lately.  Unfortunately he did not, or at least, not that the media knew of, though the \"Turkey Dinner\" advertisement for her tasting house turned out quite well.  Though, another advertisement caught her eye, one for a restaurant called \"The Jackal Cackle\", 'looks real, tastes real, but is it?'  The restaurant was apparently all vegetarian but claimed to have the look and taste of real meat that can compete with the best tasting houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did this restaurant open up?\" Zena asked one of her guards who looked at her with a slight nervous expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a month ago madam\" replied the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, have you gotten a chance to try it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I walked by once and they were giving free samples, I didn't exactly try it though and...\" the guard then saw Zena giving him an evil stare, \"yes madam, I tried it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo?\" Zena asked once more getting aggravated on how hard it was to get her guard's honest opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good... really good\" the guard finally confessed in an almost upset tone, \"I had a hard time swallowing because I thought I was at a tasting house, but it wasn't real meat.  That, and apparently it's all natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sounds too good to be true\" Zena said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, not to mention the prices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was thinking that this could lead me to The Escapist\" Zena corrected him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo</span></div></div>",

Though she kept the idea of breaking in on her mind as she looked at the restaurant and mentally pointing out good places to break in.  It looked like a tasting house on the outside, with the store's name \"Jackal Cackle\" on the outside with a laughing wild dog next to it.  It wasn't a hyena though, but the smile was the Escapist's.  Walking in, Zena couldn't help but become overwhelmed by the almost intoxicating aroma of succulent food.  The place was quite packed with both humans and hybrids alike, not to mention the vast diversity of different foods.  She heard one of the platters sizzling as one of the waitresses passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot food?\" Zena said to herself as she looked at more of the dishes, \"some of these platters look better then some of the artwork I've stolen\" she added to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZena turned around to find a tall and almost impossibly thin human, he didn't look boney, just stretched into the stick like figure he is now.  The clothes were finely tailored but worn in, while it's fit was close to perfect.  Though, there was a hidden accent, something that she heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you?\" Zena asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, but welcome to my restaurant,\" the man introduced himself, \"I am Lupine Houdini, the owner of this fine establishment.  Please, have a seat.\"  Lupine motioned Zena towards a large plush mattress with a table in front.  There was also a projector that projected the menu on the wall, though, looking at the food with it's compared prices, Zena was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you sure keep the prices cheap\" Zena said with slight suspicion, \"where do you get the money to sell all this at such low prices, what's your secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An old earth crop called soybeans\" replied Lupine, \"it's kind of like a tasteless eatable canvas that you can paint flavors on.  Not to mention make it look like almost anything you want without the price of using actual meat.  Completely vegetarian, but still has the nutrients to make one strong like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" Zena said with a mixed impression, she can't help but feel like she knew the man before, but couldn't connect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then</span></div></div>",

Though she quickly went back to her meal and took a quick taste of the blood.  Indeed the blood tasted like that of a human with wolf and horse parents.  Zena thought she had him, but... she tasted again... there was something off about it.  There was another taste that was so minuscule, yet was enough to put doubt in Zena's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called for Lupine, \"Sir, may I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes madam, is something wrong with your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Zena said afraid of the answer, \"is this blood really from a human with a wolf and horse parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellll...\"</span></div></div>",

Not because I couldn't but because I wouldn't even go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place that the Escapist was refering to was Snow City. She had been born there over four hundered and eighty years back, back when she was mortal, and innoscent. However, after the avalanch killed her parents, the bandits that had captured her left it before the winter months came back there. After she freed herself, it, and other mountian cities, were the only places that she never robbed. She could of robbed them like every other city, including the domed undersea cities, one of which had the museum that she first robbed. Of couse, times had changed since then, as that museum had been turned into a hotel when she visited the city well over seventy years back, as part of Ariel and Tom's honeymoon. In fact, they had stayed there, in the very room that the Gold Head of Zena had been, before she stole it, and took the name as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she avoided Snow City. That much hadn't changed. She had lost so much there. The memory of seeing her parents' frozen bodies was in the back of her mind every time that someone even said the word \"snow\". The closest that she had been there since then was ten years ago, when Julia wanted to get a Blue Mountian Lover's Flower, the rarest type of Lover's Flower out there, as it grew in the thin rocky soil of ther mountians, and the Blues were the rarest of the colors anyways. Thankfully, two days away from Snow City, as they were traveling on foot there, Julia had bought a Mountian/Valley cross, It was enough for her that the two of them, and James, who had come along, went back to Grass City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does he want me to go there?\" Zena asked herself.</span></div></div>",

Everytime Snow City requested the assistance of one of the Wild Beasts, she would send one or more of her higher ranked officers to do the job. Everytime an officer asked why she didn't go herself, she'd just tell them that she had a very bad experiance there as a child, though everyone knew how her parents had died.

It is not plesant, as their venom was evolved to kill their prey within an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious about that?\" the man asked, his breath quickening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why are you asking about that?\" Zena asked, with worry as to what the answer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the officer said, \"Because....</span></div></div>",

Zena's hair stood up as she pulled the screen out to see the Escapist's familiar smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an unregistered number, how did you find it?\" Zena grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's quite a easier than one thinks\" the Escapist commented, \"I basically called all the communication screens that weren't listed, including the ones that don't exist.  I must admit, it took me a while.\"  The masked wild dog gave a wry cackle before showing a gagged Julia shackled to a cave wall wearing a thick coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Julia is fine by the way, though she 'is' getting kind of cold and she 'really' misses you\" taunted the wayward magician as he held up a canine like skull, \"and I think someone else misses you too.  You know where she is, so you better come in person or she might not make it through the winter.  Tootles!\"  The screen flashed off with Zena grinding her sharp teeth together angrily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZena knew what she must do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harsh cold wind blew across the cave entrance as Julia struggled against her metal restraints, she couldn't help but look into the camera that was pointed at her.  It was strange, Julia couldn't remember being shackled, but she did remember the Escapist walking up and turning into the camera that stood before her.  It was highly unlikely that the Escapist was a robot, though that made her doubt if she ever saw the 'real' Escapist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't know was that the 'real' Escapist was in front of a green screen so that he could put his image in front of the image taken at the cave.  It was an old trick, but it still worked, especially on communication screens like the one Zena had with a lower quality screen.  Or at least, he thought she did, last time he checked she didn't get a new one with the SHD screen (super high definition) with RedRay player capabilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was done, he needed to find out a little more about this \"Toymaker\" character.</span></div></div>",

However, it was enough of a resembalance to the long dead wolf woman that it stired up a feeling of anger in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get him, I'm going to enjoy tearing him to pieces before I eat him,\" she said, with a growl, as she looked to see the toy-making conman, and his friend, watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" she said, as she walked over to them. \"I'm going to give you one warning, if you try to pull any schemes in town, the only way that you will be leaving will be through the septic system. As for your friend, he'd better watch his tail, as I am quite partial to roasted scorpian. You get me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the pair, especially the toymaker, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she went home, and started to pack a few things, several days worth of food, several bottles of painkillers, and, most importantly, some warm clothing. She was going to the mountians, to the cave, to rescue Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We interupt this story for this Christmas Special,\" Zena says, as she breaks the forth wall. \"Now, while Planet Animalus doesn't celebrate Christmas, we do give each other gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have that right,\" The Escapist says, as he, Julia, and a few others, including a young man with a few snake like features, show up. \"Besides, there is nothing like having a good time with a few friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have that right,\" The young man said. \"I just can't wait to tell people my story. After all, I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's save that for the story,\" the Escapist says, as he gives the young man a presant. \"After all, I have a few secrets of my own, which Zena has agreed to keep quiet about until the time is right. The same should go for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right friend,\" Zena said. \"By the way, welcome to the family kid. You will have a whole lot of fun. Perhaps you should say hello to some of my lovers. They know how to keep one content in any manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a bunch of young women crowd around the young man, and start asking him a few questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Escapist,\" Zena says, as she looks at the masked jackle. \"I didn't like that thing with that skull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it certainally got your attention,\" the Escapist says, as the young man runs past them screaming, with a bunch of women following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the deal with these women?\" he yells, as he heads up the stairs, trying to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistletoe,\" Zena says, as she looks at where the young man had been standing, and notices a green set of leaves. \"How nice of you to bring that here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?\" The Escapist says. \"Tis the season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have that right,\" Zena said. \"Of course, I think that it was next to some Lover's Flowers when you picked it up. You know very well what happens to those who breath the scent of one in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the Escapist said. \"Though, I do hope that you arn't thinking about kissing me. After all, I already have a lover of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Zena says. \"Of course, I wouldn't mind some alone time with my Julia, before the special is over. After all, I have a gift to give her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problem with that,\" The man says, as he gets out a red pointy hat with a cotton ball on the end. \"Mind if I play Santa for the kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go right ahead,\" Zana said, as she wrapped her arms around the human woman, and brought her close to her body, and walked to a certian room. \"After all, all good little boys and girls deserve a toy from the big guy in red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the man changes the outfit he has on to the color red, makes himself look heavier, puts on a white beard, and picks up a bag full of toys, which a man known as the Toymaker, had given them, with the guarentie that these ones wouldn't break for several years at least. Then he walks over to the living room, where a bunch of children, of all sorts of species, are waiting, and starts passing them out, saying \"Ho! Ho!\" the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerry Christmas to you readers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial over, it is to have no connection to the rest of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now that Zena is on the way to Snow City to rescue Julia, whose point of view to you want to follow?</span></div></div>",

Take caution\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOros walked to the other side of the cave towards a rock.  There was a bit of silence then Oros took a swing at the rock and blew it to pieces.  On the other side there was a small metal hallway with a hole on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kid was walking towards the hallway Oros stopped him and said \"Kid... You are relieved of your duties\" He then sent the kid rocketing to the other side of the cave and he hit the wall with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOros then jumped down the hole into the research facility which housed project grilios a multitude of bio organic weapons (in other words man made creatures) and experimental weapons (new guns and physical weapons)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** **********************************************<br>\r\nOn a side note people the entire cult would like to wish you all a happy new years welcome to 2010 old earth</span></div></div>",

He turned around to come face to face with a falling reflective cyclentrical object that emited a large explosion that caused Oros to be plumeted into a white ringing void of his own senses.  While Oros was impared, The Escapist quickly yanked out what looked like a thumbdrive from one of the computers and wrapped his hand around it before making it vanish.  There wasn't much time left so he quickly took a few other objects like an object that looked like a suitcase, a spool of harmless looking thread, and a strange helmet of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOros chuckled as he suddenly grabed The Escapist by the throat.  \"I thought I had a little more time than that\" The Escapist choaked.  Oros smiled saying, \"I may not be able to hear you, but my glasses protected my eyes enough for me to see you sooner.\"  Oros couldn't tell what the Escapist said next, but he soon began grunting as the Escapist suddenly gained a ton of unseen weight before falling backwards with a metalic clang.  Oros, without much hesitation, took his advantage and threw a large machine at the fallen Escapist, pinning him under the large chunk of metal saying, \"that should hold yah.\"</span></div></div>",

        "created":1254707040,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">*Important Note* Planet Animalus is based off of a series that I wrote, and it was my longest piece of work yet, 19 of those 70-page spiral notebooks. So, if the rules seem a little complicated, it is because of how I had wrote it when I was using pencil and paper, so bare with me please. Thank you for understanding. PS Zena is my main character throughout the series, check her out if you want, look under the Wild Beasts section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first chapter tells the basic history Of Animalus. However, your person may live at any time, though aliens can only exist after 4000 AS (Years after Animalus is settled.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, just in case you don't quite the rules when you read the intro chapter, here are the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sex is allowed, but try to keep it casual for the most part, gay/straight/bisexual are all allowed, and one can have multiple lovers/spouses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. When it comes to hard vore, that is either for the funerals of the dead, self-defense, or survival in starvation situations.<br>\r\n*Please note, when it comes to funerals, the body is to be served in small portions to each of the mourners, and if the family member or friend of the deceased is a human/herbivore hybrid, they are given tofu that is flavored with the person's blood instead.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Hybrids can't drink much alcohol, so it is either specially carbonated fruit/vegetable juices, or a blood-and-water mixture, which has a maximum of a 1 to 3 ratio, in which the largest concentration of blood to water is one cup of blood to three cups of water, as straight blood, or half and half, can cause carnivores to become a little, blood-thirsty, as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Other than crocs and snakes, most hybrids are humanoidal. However, all are mammalian enough to give birth to live young and produce milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Aliens are allowed only after 4000AS, with aliens that are mentioned in the intro coming only after said date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*This rule also applies to those who had been transformed by certain nefarious scientists back on EarthTwo, who can look human, but have features of animals, like a little girl with the ears and tail of a cat for instance.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBios are needed for any alien race that you create. I want to know where they are from, what they look like, and what they can do. Also, I want to know the relationship that their world and Animalus have with one another, Are they friends and allies, just trading partners/neutral, or are they enemies and fighting each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please note, Animalus is not to be conquered, or anything of that nature, If they tried that stunt, they would face the entire wrath of the entire planet, and Zena is one fighter who won't surrender, and she just won't die anyways, as she is immortal. Besides, Animalus has a lot of friends, who are very powerful.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Hybrids of all sorts can have viable offspring with other types of hybrids, as well as humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. If you want Zena in your story, like if you are an officer after her when she is a thief, or some such thing, you can't kill her. Also, as her bio says, she prefers women over men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Weapons rule. Weapons are allowed, especially when in the Wilds or in unrecognized settlements. However, should they enter a city, they are expected to be turned over to the local authorities. Those who fail to do so could face up to five years in prison. Besides, most hybrids have natural weapons, like teeth, claws, horns, ect. There is one exception to this law, humans. Since they have no natural weapons, they are allowed to carry a long knife, which has a handle the length of their fists, plus the guard and pommel to keep the hand from sliding up the blade or falling apart, with a blade that is equal to the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinkie. (make the call me sign to get the idea.) This knife is to be worn on a belt in plain sight while in public or in an establishment of any sort. Failure to comply with this law could get the human arrested and sentenced to five years in prison, as concealing a weapon, of any sort, is against the law. Please note, weapons can vary from blades, to clubs/maces, to firearms, to laser-type weapons, as the settlers did colonize the planet at around 6000 A.D. They just use more environmentally friendly technology, and never made a phone call to Earth, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Someone just asked me a question about magic, and if it is allowed. My answer is this, no, there is no magic allowed. However, that doesn't mean that there are not aliens who don't have strange technologies and abilities out there, if you catch my drift. All that I ask is that you give me a bio of the person's race<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Someone just asked me if things like dance clubs are allowed and here is what I have to say, if it exists in the USA or most \"modern\" places, like Western Europe, Japan, or anyplace that has been influenced by Western culture, chances are that something like it exists on Animalus. However, try to keep things like strip joints to a minimum please, my tasting houses and mating houses border enough on the erotic as it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. I don't mind nudity, providing that you are not too descriptive with things like breast size, vaginas, asses, ect. If you say that the woman has a nice looking set of breasts, and ass cheeks, I'll allow it. But if you get into how wet the woman's vagina was or how big a man's penis is, forget it. Heck, I just might delete it, and not even bother to try and edit it. *Note, this also extends to sex scenes as well. If I don't like it, I'll delete it.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. People can be angry with their lot in life. In fact, they may not necessarily remember that what their ancestors had done, especially the scientists, was to save their lives. Heck, they don't even have to like things like tasting houses, mating houses, or even those of other species/races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. The meat that carnivores, omnivores, and humans eat comes from \"wild\" animals, which are just plain old, non-hybrid, animals. People can get this meat in one of two ways, hunting in the Wilds or from the farms that are nearby. *Note, these farms are, more or less, owned by the city, with a portion of the taxes going to ensure that they, and all other food producing, and storage places, are kept up to code and maintained.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. The nomads very rarely marry someone. Basically, a woman's children could have different fathers and vice verse. Of course, they do keep track of who's whose child, so that half-siblings don't accidentally have sex with each other, or those who share the same blood at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. Money. No units of money are to be mentioned, so no dollars, yen, pounds, euros, whatever. If you need to say a units, just say units, or, if you are in the Wilds or unrecognized settlements, pieces of gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16. The religion on Animalus is based off of Judaism/Christianity/Islam, or some such religion that has one god. The person is called the Judgement Beasts, a being with the head of a lion and the head of a ram. When a person dies, their soul appears before them, where it is said that the Judgement Beast lists every deed that one has done, both good and evil. After that, they decide if one goes straight to Paradise (Heaven), or if they need to stay in Digestion ( a lighter version of Hell as it were) for a while before they can go to Paradise. Of course, if someone was truly evil, they ain't getting out of the Beasts's stomach, which is were Digestion is, ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any further questions, e-mail me and I will answer them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nEnjoy my first interactive guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, here is a list of things I've made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"56\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"...
