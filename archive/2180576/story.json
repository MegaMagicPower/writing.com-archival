You were nervous, going to a school full of students with powerful quirks was intimidating... add on the fact that they were all gigantic compared to you and it made things even worse. Your father, a pro hero himself, placed you onto his shoulder and got into the car, ready to take you to your first day at UA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you excited?\" Your father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...

Aizawa had helped you train in areas such as fitness and stealth, both of which had you outrunning his feet or climbing him. You passed the written exam and it was decided you would get a week to test out if you could make it in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon scooped into your dad's palm as he had a small smile on his scruffy face. \"You lost in your thoughts again squirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head you grinned. \"Heh sorry, I'm ready to be a hero dad. I'll knock the socks off my classmates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa looked amused and snorted before lowering his capture weapon and pulling down his collor.

A b.o smell was flowing through the muscles as sweaty fumes were emitted from your giant dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa smugly grinned as he pulled up his collor, bouncing his pecs to feel your tiny body. \"I told you taking a shower wasn't a smart idea. Not only does it waste time but it's all for nothing if your going to smell like sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher began walking to class, bouncing his pecs to squeeze you with his sweaty and tough pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

Curious, the hero peeked in, \"What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lady Midnight who turned to the black-clad professor. \"Oh great! We were just about to come look for you. We were just about to have a quick meeting about your son and the stuff and stuff about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnipe nodded, leaning against the wall with a relaxed aura surrounding him, \"Yeah, he's not gonna be out on the battlefield and the likes, but he'd be excellent for recon and undercover stuff. While he may be in 1A, Nezu reckons that we should give the lil' guy a different curriculum; which you already know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to be sure that everyone was aware.\" Principal Nezu's voice seemed to appear from nowhere as the small mammal wandered in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were astounded by this yourself. While you still attempted to do your best in fighting the slides of sweat oozing from your father's chest, you were rather embarrassed yet still grateful that the teachers had a lot of care for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the little man, anyway?\" Present Mic piped in, a wide grin on his face. Aizawa shook his head, already annoyed by the other hero's presence in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in the car. I was just... Going to the toilet before taking him in. I can't leave him alone in public and there's no way I would take him with me to the bathroom.\" The shady teacher stated with an awkward chuckle, though the lie was mostly unnoticed by the rest of the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the meeting adjourned, Aizawa decided to check up on you while moving down the hall. As the fingers reached down, you grabbed them quickly and hauled yourself out of the sweaty region. \"You right there, squirt?\" He teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed in annoyance, your clothes and skin coated in a light layer of sweat and B.O. \"That was gross dad.\" You complained, looking away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep up the bratty attitude and you know where you end up.\" The father warned with a stern look as he approached the class. You gulped lightly, your eyes momentarily flicking down towards the thick, airtight boots that your father wore so frequently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" You said quietly, Aizawa nodded. Now should he get you to meet all your classmates on the first day... Or should he wait till things are more settled with your schedule and such...</span></div></div>",

That being a member of the League of Villians. Determined to change the world and get rid of All Might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour life had once only conceived of looking through garbage for scarps and dodging the shoes of giants that didn't even look down at the your inch tall form on the sidewalk. Since you were little you grew up on the street, probably abandoned since your quirk was seen as useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeroes were a bitter topic since you never could be saved because they couldn't even see you. A lot of of fights happen in alleyways and everytime a hero broke it up, you tried to get thier attention. They either didn't see you, or even in some cases tried stepping on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis life of brooding and hatred was given light when you were noticed one day, when you were about twenty. A figure made out of mist in a suit had actually spotted your inch form huddled up against a wall. He soon offered you a misty hand to climb on and asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of heroes?\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYour new life then began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new home awaited at a bar, with plenty of alcohol and warmth. The misty was known as Kuroguri, and he introduced you to the figure called All For One and Sensei. He offered you a spot in the league, and you accepted right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour quirk was finally given a purpose. It turns out that from living on the street your good at climbing and sneaking. Your position in the League of Villians was that of a information gatherer, using your size to sneak into agency's and gather not so well received info and releasing it to the villians and public. You had ruined the career of ten heroes by recording thier records of illegal deals. It was frustrating for them because you were never caught and they couldn't figure out what kind of quirk you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoyed relaxing at the bar. Kuroguri usually gave you free drinks, though he only had to use a full cup that was like a bath to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShigaraki was somewhat accepting of your residency. He often treated you as a pet, carrying you with special gloves and making you watch him play video games. But you didn't mind it much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll For One was someone you admired and felt intimidated by. A figure so powerful that you felt even smaller.

This didn't affect the love your family had for you but it did lead to complications such as being stepped on or squished beneath a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older brothers Tenya and Tensei took the role of big brothers seriously as siblings naturally do. Tenya did look after you more as Tensei got busy with work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenya usually carried you around mostly in between his pecs and kept you there for hours sometimes. There were awkward situations such as when he accidentally sits on you or finds you stuck to his sole. He was always remorseful so you were never upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it was frustrating how protective Tenya could be. He wanted to keep you safe so he always told you not to be a hero and rely on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you now?</span></div></div>",

Seeing as you were only an inch tall you never really had a room of your own, staying in your parents and brother's room as you got older. You've spent the last few years staying in Tenya's room, you'd usually be napping or reading his books if he ever left you here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, your big brother has been gone for a while and you really weren't feeling like taking a nap. Walking over to the high ledge, you grabbed the blanket and began slid down to the ground far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon landed and now had the furniture looming over as usual. Iida's desk with his books, his pairs of running shoes, and muscle shirts all surrounded the huge room. Now what should you do? Maybe climb up and see what he's been reading, or try and get to the kitchen to eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground suddenly began to have slight shakes, the sound of footsteps approached the door before it opened up. Iida walked in his large bare feet stomping the ground. He wore a pair of dark blue sweatpants, his large muscular torso uncovered and showing his strength as sweat dripped from his huge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIida wiped sweat from his forehead, just getting back from a workout. He did wish you had been with him, but he figured you need a rest. \"I'm back otouto, I'm sorry for taking so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to the center of the room. \"I'm right here big brother!\", you called up to your towering bluenette sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIida began walking into the room, his feet making the ground shake like tremors. His muscular body soon loomed over you and his glasses face was blocked by his pecs. He then...</span></div></div>",

He sighed and opened a drawer, pulling out a neatly-folded, clean sweat rag. Beginning to wipe the sweat from his dense abs, Tenya began to feel concerned, turning himself around to look behind his massive form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon his lack of concentration, he dropped the fabric, the rag falling to the floor right towards you. You attempted to run would the way, but was caught under the thick, heavy blanket of lightly, sweat-dampened fabric.

You however learned not only to live at this size but also appreciate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once worked at an office which was hell as it is, but it was extra tough as you had to run around a keyboard to type. Many of the higher employees made fun of you, they had thier own rooms and suits while you worked in a row of five others and wore wrinkled clothes. They would step on you and even sit on you while insulting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, don't dirty my shoes bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're awful at work but you do make a nice seat cushion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it this way, I'm just stomping out competition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, but being treated like a bug actually excited you and you enjoyed being degraded for your size! You figured that rather then just well groomed businessmen, you could be a bug to many others. So you quit and gave a goodbye, only to be answered with a loafer's sole. You wouldn't have it any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe service Tiny Help was founded and advertised as a way for men to relax or let out thier frustration.

The abs pushed against the shirt and you couldn't even see his face as it was blocked by his huge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looked down over his pecs at you, laughing as he put his hands on his hips. \"Why hello there citizen!

Arriving in the backroom, All Might sat his firm butt on the couch getting it to creak from his weight.
