            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're a female Pikachu who belongs to a human trainer, Ash Ketchum. However, even though you're female, you still had the tail of a male, no heart-shaped tip. You never understood why, but you honestly didn't really care anyways. Though the two of you had a bit of a rocky start, the two of you warmed up to each other and became close friends, though a part of you wishes you could become closer than that. You realize however that because the two of you are of different species, the two of you will probably never have that kind of relationship. Nevertheless, you remain faithfully loyal to your human friend. No matter the situation, you always try your hardest to make Ash happy and to protect him at all costs. You don't know what you'd do without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sunny day in Pallet Town. The two of you had just returned from your previous adventure. You were resting on Ash's bed as he was getting his usual everyday clothes on. You had to admit that, for a human, he looked pretty attractive. You're honestly surprised that he hasn't found a girlfriend yet. Oh, how you wish you were that very girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, trying to get rid of such thoughts, and decide to think about your previous adventures. The two of you had unbelievable adventures while traveling with a few other friends, such as Brock, Misty, May, and Dawn. Oh, and Tracey, you add on. Over the course of your adventures, many unexpected things have happened, from being ghosts, to Ash turning into a Pikachu, to even encountering many of the rarest of legendary Pokemon. Yep, you've certainly had some crazy adventures, but you honestly wouldn't give it up for the world, as long as you were with your human friend. You then remember a couple of peculiar events that happened in your adventures. When you were in Johto, you and Ash were accidentally sent into another dimension. While you were in this dimension, it had an unbelievable effect on you. You were enormous! When you found Ash, you couldn't believe how small he looked to you. It felt very odd. Though you usually had to look up to see the face of your trainer, you had to look down to even see him at all at this size. But at the same time, it felt cool. You felt that at your new size, you would be able to protect him from anything that endangered him. Unfortunately, this new feeling was short-lived, as you were shortly returned to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the only time you became bigger though. While you were traveling through Sinnoh, a Mismagius had put you and your human friends to sleep and trapped all of you in a nightmare. As you and your friends fought to escape the nightmare, Mismagius turned into a Rayquaza and hurt Ash. When you saw that, you became greatly angered and wanted to be able to protect him, even at the cost of your life. But then you felt something weird, a warm feeling in your belly. You suddenly started growing, along with Brock's Croagunk and Dawn's Piplup. The three of you grew as big as Rayquaza and easily defeated it and Mismagius. You couldn't believe how strong you were. This new strength you received from your incredible amount of growth was simply amazing. It too, however, was short-lived, as you shrunk back down to normal and the nightmare ended. After several dangerous encounters along your adventure with Ash, you wanted to become stronger, so strong that you could always protect Ash from whatever may try to harm him. The thought of becoming a giant Pikachu was enticing. But defying reality isn't something that can be done easily, especially by such a little Pikachu like yourself. You kept thinking and thinking about some way to become bigger, but nothing came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu? Are you listening buddy?\" Your thoughts are interrupted as you hear the voice of your human friend. \"Pi?\" you say, feeling a bit confused. \"How would you like to go outside and train today? The weather's perfect.\" \"Pika!\" you cry cheerfully. You always loved training with Ash whenever you could. \"Alright then. Let's go!\" You nod and jump onto Ash's shoulder, you're favorite perching spot. Ash heads outside and walks into an open field. \"Are you ready Pikachu?\" \"Pika!\" you shout happily and hop off Ash's shoulder. But when you land, you feel something weird. The ground feels odd. \"What's the matter Pikachu?\" Suddenly, the ground collapses beneath the two of you. \"AHHHHHHHHHHH!\" \"PIKAPIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!\" The two of you scream as you crash into the bottom. \"Ugh. A pitfall? Then that could only mean...\" You already knew who was to blame for this. \"Is that the cry of a twerp I hear?\" \"It's speaking to me loud and clear.\" \"Team Rocket! What are you up to this time!?\" \"Grrrrrrr! Don't interrupt us during the motto twerp!\" Team Rocket, Jessie, James, and a talking Meowth, have dedicated their life to stealing you, though they haven't once been successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want!?\" \"What else? Get Pikachu Meowth!\" \"Gotcha!\" Meowth suddenly pulls out a giant pair of pliers and grabs you with them and stuffs you inside a small cage! \"Pikachu!\" Your trainer shouts for you worriedly. You begin charging up electricity for a Thunderbolt. \"Piiiiiiiiikaaaaaaaaaaaaaachuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!\" You shock the cage, but nothing happens. James laughs. \"This cage is 100% Pika-proof! It absorbs all of your electricity!\" You growl as you try to think of something else that could work. Ash quickly climbs up out of the pitfall. \"Let Pikachu go!\" Jessie smirks. \"And what are you gonna do about it twerp? You don't have any Pokemon with you!\" \"Huh!?\" Ash looks at his belt and realizes that he left all of his other Pokemon at home. \"Oh no!\" \"Looks like we win this time twerp.\" \"No... Pikachu...\" You begin to tear up. You quickly begin to realize you may never see Ash again. \"Pikapi!\" you shout, calling out to him. \"I'm sorry Pikachu...\" You feel greatly saddened. If only you were bigger... You keep saying in your mind that you wish you were bigger over and over. \"We'll be taking your Pikachu twerp. See ya.\" \"Pikachu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue saying in your mind \"I wish I were bigger\" over and over and over... and then you suddenly feel a warm feeling in your belly. A strange feeling overcomes you, but it feels oddly familiar... Then you finally realize that you're actually growing! You grow bigger and bigger, and the space in the cage becomes smaller and smaller. \"Oof!\" James whimpers as he carries the cage. \"Did Pikachu gain weight or something!?\" You still continue to grow, starting to feel cramped as there is no more space for you, but you don't care. All you want is to be back by your best friend's side. James grunts and finally drops the cage from your ever increasing weight. \"What's going on!? Why did he suddenly get so heavy?\" \"Huh? Pikachu?\" Ash stares at you with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt as the cage gets tighter and tighter around you, and even though it feels painful, there's only one thing on your mind. Getting back to Ash. You grow and grow and grow until the cage shatters. You land on the ground and you continue to grow as Ash as well as Team Rocket stare at you in awe. \"Pikachu? What's happening to you?\" You grow and grow and grow until you reach around what you believe to be 50 feet. You look down at angrily at Team Rocket who are looking up at you, quivering with fright. \"PIKACHU!\" you roar at them angrily, causing them all to whimper, James most especially. \"I-I-I-I-It's enormous!\" \"No, it's Pikanormous!\" \"Meowth, I don't think now would be a good time for your horrible puns!\" \"PIIIIIIIKAAAAAAAA...\" You twist your back a bit, then... \"CHU!\" You swing your giant tail at Team Rocket, swatting them away like flies. \"Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!\" You walk over to Ash and look down at him as he looks up at you, amazed. \"Pikachu... How did you do all that?\" You simply smile and give him an affectionate lick with your huge tongue, making him laugh. \"Hey! Cut it out! That tickles!\" You giggle as you pick Ash up carefully. \"Wow Pikachu... How did you get so huge?\" You honestly have no clue how you did it. But now that you're so big, you can have fun with your best friend in new ways. But then again, you may want to ask a professional about it, like Professor Oak. Then again, you could try figuring it out on your own and grow even bigger.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Isn't Pikachu such a little cutie? Of course he is. But what if he grew to gigantic proportions? Think he'd still be cute? Or perhaps intimidating? That's up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this interactive, follow Pikachu as he experiences one of his (or her) biggest adventures ever. Quite literally. The Pikachu in question can be Ash's Pikachu, Richie's Pikachu (Sparky), or a wild Pikachu from Kanto's Viridian Forest, Hoenn's Safari Zone, or Sinnoh's Trophy Garden. I have a few rules you must follow however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This interactive will have growth only for Pokemon. There will be no other kinds of transformations of Pokemon nor any kinds of transformations for humans, except maybe human-to-Pokemon transformations. This includes transforming into anthros! This is a non-anthro story! Shrinking is allowed for giant Pokemon but cannot exceed past the Pokemon's original size. Growing is also allowed for humans-turned-Pokemon, and I encourage it as well.<br>\r\n2. This interactive will obviously be about Pikachu growing large, but a few other Pokemon may grow as well (such as Buneary, Piplup, or the Pichu Bros.). Pretty much any cute Pokemon are acceptable. Try to keep the number of giant Pokemon around three or less so that other writers don't have to manage so much at once. Also, try to have the Pokemon interact with their environment (humans, buildings, other Pokemon, etc.).<br>\r\n3. No one-line chapters. Each chapter must be somewhat descriptive. This is a story after all, isn't it? The only exception to this rule are the \"setup\" chapters.<br>\r\n4. Please use comprehensible English spelling and grammar to the best of your abilities. I don't want chapters full of nonsensical gibberish that no one can understand.<br>\r\n5. To satisfy the Pikachu gender debaters, I will provide an option for Pikachu to be either male or female.<br>\r\n6. Regarding OoC (Out of Character), all humans may not be OoC. Pokemon may be slightly OoC since a Pokemon's personality can be somewhat debatable. However, that does not mean you can make Pikachu (or any other Pokemon for that matter) suddenly evil and start killing people.<br>\r\n7. On that topic, willful killing is not allowed. I will permit accidental deaths to non-important humans, but only as long as their deaths aren't too graphic (i.e. blood, screaming in agony, etc.). Eating fish is okay though.<br>\r\n8. Pikachu can grow in any way you want (except just randomly), but keep it consistent. If you plan to add more giant Pokemon, use the same method that Pikachu used to grow. Also, the Pokemon cannot just suddenly grow to ridiculous heights (i.e. Pikachu suddenly growing bigger than the planet).<br>\r\n9. While we're on that topic, don't make the Pokemon grow too huge. Try to keep them at reasonable sizes. If you MUST make them that large, please shrink them down to a more adequate size later (3 chapters at most).<br>\r\n10. No genitals or sex. This isn't a XXX porn story. You can find those elsewhere, such as in my alternate version of this interactive.<br>\r\n11. You can decide whether Pikachu (or any other Pokemon) speaks just Pokemon language or translated to English. Whichever one you decide, make sure you keep it consistent. Also, remember that humans cannot understand them, though their trainers (if they have one) might be able to. That is up to you.<br>\r\n12. You can use whatever point-of-view you want, whether it be Pikachu's, it's trainer's, another Pokemon's, another human's, yours, or even third-person/narrative. Just keep it consistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that about covers it. This is my first interactive, so I'll try to be very lenient with new additions. If I feel that your addition is unsatisfactory, I'll try to modify it to the best of my abilities so that it follows the above rules. If I cannot, then I will simply delete it. That doesn't mean you can't try again though, as long as you actually try. Please don't be afraid to add. I don't just want people reading stories, I also want them making one. As long as you follow the rules above, you can do anything you want, no matter how crazy it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, enjoy playing with this supersized cutie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if you feel that this story is too restrictive, try this version of it: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1520630/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1520630/</a></td>",
