            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The townhouse at 8422 Fordham Ave had a lot going for it. It sat at the alley break between two townhouse blocks, a split-level three story home plus a basement access garage. Having only one neighbor on the west wall allowed for a unique interior, with the living/dining room having an elevated ceiling with overhanging second floor balcony. The kitchen had a breakfast nook that jutted towards the alley and the front yard was marginally wider by three feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as locations went you couldn\u2019t get better in the city. Being at the corner of Fordham Ave and 11th Court placed it two blocks down from the dining district. Most of the area townhomes were quaint, red brick and copper color trim affairs. The interior of 8422 used peach, orange and beige accents along most walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing from the bottom up, the basement included a single car garage, laundry room and small den. On the ground floor was the main entrance, kitchen, dining table and living room. The second floor contained two small bedrooms and a short office. The third floor contained the master suite and another small room that had been converted into a bedroom. Each floor also had a bathroom to some capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the home had a lot going for it vertically, horizontally it left a lot to be desired. Despite the small floor space the house was the definitive model modern townhome that provided some luxury but only for a renting couple or small family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8422 Fordham Ave had not been designed to have five residents. Yet five women ended up living there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original tenants were the Durant sisters; the oldest, Audrey and her twin sisters Reagan and Phoebe. Audrey was the first to look for the listing but couldn\u2019t afford the price solely and agreed to let her sisters live there, who were still in university downtown. Before long not only was the Durant sisters\u2019 cousin, Ixchel Park, asking to move in but Audrey\u2019s former college roommate, Uma Ferro, had needed a place to crash. That was two years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese five ladies were quite different people but had more or less gotten used to living together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey Durant was the oldest occupant at 26. She was also the tallest, the primary breadwinner and the most serious much to her chagrin, as she felt she had to take care of everything. She wore glasses for green-eyed farsightedness and had a copious amount of bushy blond hair, much like a decades old fashion trend. She was fair skinned with the occasional freckle. Although she stood two heads taller than her twin sisters she never really had a thin physique growing up. It was kind to call her chubby or plump as her body settled into an apple shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she wasn\u2019t stressing herself out with earning money to pay for bills, getting to work on time and keeping the house afloat she had mildly antiquated interests. She liked her sappy romance novels and the chance to have a bubble bath, she preferred the stage compared to the movies for theater and she had attempted to keep a garden in the front yard as she knew a lot about flowers. Although she could get easily riled up as most of her other housemates found most of her tastes boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan and Phoebe, the identical twin Durant sisters, of course had matching features. While some of their facial features and skin tone matched Audrey their physiques were quite different. At 22 the twins were just under the average height for an American woman, with slender necks and small shoulders. Both had reddish hair with naturally blonde highlights. Both were hip heavy, having developed wide hipped pear shapes in late middle school. As they grew older the twins had a pair of fine booties to match, making them very attractive and popular but for vastly different reasons once you got to know their personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was the oldest twin by two seconds. She was fierce, mischievous and very standout. If you called her the evil twin she would wear the moniker with pride. She was too clever by a half when it came to nearly flunking out of school because of an academic career of getting associated with trouble but (thus far) she was still working on her acoustical engineering degree. Yet her penchant for calling others out and wanting to have the last laugh or last insult at all times often left her with her foot in her mouth. She also wasn\u2019t brilliant by any means, although she foolishly though herself smart, getting by from guile alone. She\u2019d had plenty of boyfriends and left plenty of broken hearts along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was the youngest twin by two seconds. She was very much the baby of the family, bubbly but na\u00efve and way too much of a ditz. While she was kind and friendly she was far too gullible for her own good, such was the case with being the good twin. She was also prone to klutziness and generally making a mess of things despite her best efforts. Her simple mind meant there wasn\u2019t a conceited bone in her body, although some found her blind optimism a bit grating after awhile. She was looking to get into modeling and was pursuing an acting degree from the same university as her sister. She\u2019d had plenty of boyfriends and suitors over the years but was a hopeless smitten kitten that couldn\u2019t tell a decent boyfriend apart from a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling the twins apart came down to their body language, fashion, and attitude. Reagan favored darker colors and often kept her hair just shorter than her twin, while Phoebe favored brighter colors and was the girly-est of the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next closest relation to the Durant women was their cousin Ixchel Park, who also went by Chel. While the Durants had a mix of Euro-Caucasian ancestry Ixchel was the offspring of a multiracial marriage. About 43% of her genomes came from Central and South American while 39% was Asian by way of Korea with a smattering of Chinese, with mixed American and European as the remaining slurry. Despite her origins as a child of her mother\u2019s second marriage she was closer to her Durant cousins than her multiracial relatives, as they were of the same generation and had spent quite a lot of their childhoods together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel was 23, the second youngest of the household not accounting for the twins, with dark skin, grey eyes and long deeply dark brown hair. Her genetics left her moon faced and somewhat pudgy, as her body was entirely made up of rounded curves. While she had an even balance of introverted and extroverted tendencies she preferred the company of family and friends she already knew. Ixchel was very nerdy, both a band geek and a pop-culture obsessed otaku who used the cramped office for remote working in her programming job for a medical-tech company. She liked a lot of genres from fantasy to sci-fi to mysteries. And although she was loath to admit it, she had inherited a bit of cooking skill from her biracial father and had an index of Mexican and Asian fused dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only occupant not to be related by blood or family was Uma Ferro, Audrey\u2019s roommate in college. Both had attended on scholarship but whereas Audrey\u2019s was academic Uma had been under a sports scholarship. Uma was 25, black, and thickly built, voluptuous with athletic muscle mass. She had hazel eyes and liked to bleach the tips of her dreadlocks. Originally she had been a long distance track runner in high school, before drifting to lacrosse and her volleyball scholarship. Although a strong competitor she had yet to break into any big leagues, mainly for two reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma could have a gruff, almost abrasive personality towards any perceived opponents. But mostly she was a raucous partier ever since college, being primarily responsible for helping Audrey get out of her shell. Uma never met a drink she didn\u2019t like, a party favor she didn\u2019t want seconds of and a groove she couldn\u2019t drop a beat too. She\u2019d grown wilder during college, looking for fun even if that meant her grades or training diligence suffered for it. At her worst, Uma could be considered a moocher since coming to live with the other women of the house. She didn\u2019t have a steady job or a reason to return to school and while she trained constantly (or so she claimed) she no longer had a clear goal in mind to shape her drive. Her appetite was something fierce, the product of when her metabolism was hyperactive to fuel her adequately for all her team sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAltogether, while the female residents of 8422 Fordham Ave came from various walks of life and had such differing perspectives, they wouldn\u2019t still be living together if they didn\u2019t like each other. They got along fine; although like many families especially for an arrangement of twenty-something adults there were plenty of disagreements, outbursts and drama on any given day. Nobody ever got the privacy they hoped for with a townhouse that small, as each woman\u2019s sheer force of personality, lifestyle, and the baggage that came with it left the house stuffed to the gills enough already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was before they all got really freakin\u2019 fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPick a focal character:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The past few years had almost made Audrey Durant snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she had been close to her sisters and cousin when they were kids that was back when, as the oldest, she could maintain her authority from age alone. Back before they lived together as adults. Audrey had thought they would be fine on sharing rent, after all they were family. That was before she realized that sisters were meant to go out into the world on their own after they grew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wished they would go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters were just horrendous, treating her like she was mom. They were adults that could pick up behind themselves and do something with their lives. Maybe, just maybe, Audrey hoped, Reagan and Phoebe would get somewhere in life once they completed college. But their combined work ethic left little to stoke these hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cousin Ixchel was practically a saint compared to the twins. She actually had a steady job and contributed to rent. While she wasn\u2019t out to make Audrey\u2019s life miserable she had gotten far too cozy at the townhouse. For all her genius she could be a bit of a scatterbrain sometimes. Audrey found all of Ixchel\u2019s favorite books and movies mixed up in places they shouldn\u2019t be. Ixchel could get tunnel focused when she was working on a difficult problem, tuning out the rest of the world and barging in unannounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Uma. Audrey may have caved in too easily when Uma needed a place to stay but she was her best friend. Audrey had to mature quickly, being the oldest of three girls, and it was Uma who had taught her how to have fun again. Once having an outsider\u2019s perspective, it was Uma who kept Audrey\u2019s spirits lifted through life\u2019s little challenges. Yet she had a knack for never volunteering and avoiding most of the work. This living arrangement was starting to feel one sided, with Uma being all take and no give. That was before Audrey factored in the foibles of five women living together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen was the last time she could have a private bubble bath? Audrey couldn\u2019t remember. The townhouse\u2019s three bathrooms and five residents meant there was always going to be inconvenient overlap when trying to freshen up. Sometimes it was Ixchel barging in, as mentioned before, watching a gaming stream on her phone or listening to her work boosting music. Or it was Phoebe forgetting about closed-door policy, yet again, even if she apologized for it and could Audrey please pass her the deodorant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr Audrey never got to use the bathroom whenever Uma was washing off her post workout sweat or Reagan inconsiderately ignored every knock on the door to hurry up because get off her back, she was still getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Audrey got a chance to take a break she could still hear whatever her roommates were up to thanks to the thin walls of the house. Plus, to add insult to injury, there were the constant cracks about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey hadn\u2019t always been fat but being naturally big boned and tall she had never really been thin either. She was the frumpy, dumpy shaped older daughter who filled out too much where the twins were blessed with hot bods. Audrey\u2019s blonde hair always got out of her control. Her budget was stretched thin so she rarely got new clothes, so most of her apparel was getting frayed and a midge snug. When she wasn\u2019t finding it lost in someone else\u2019s hamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she cleaned her glasses, Audrey felt like she wasn\u2019t living her own life. Everyone left her to do most things. She was far too pragmatic for her own good, as her roommates had become accustomed to Audrey handling the bills and domestic needs. When was she going to have the chance to live her own life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out it was going to be another stressed out day for poor Audrey.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had laid down what she believed to be fair and basic house rules for everyone when the moved in. A rotating schedule where everyone pitched in on short, simple tasks one or two days a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet two years on and most of the chores had been left to Audrey. Just because she was the oldest shouldn't mean she had to be the only one who took this seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Phoebe had been hopeless when it came to even the most basic of chores. Uma and Reagan could shirk out of duties like nobody's business. As in, nobody did the household business. Even Ixchel could be tied up with her job, which was frustrating for Audrey because her cousin could work from the townhouse, couldn't she take a moment to lend her a hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help the Audrey needed to go shopping for new clothes but sadly she couldn't prioritize that on her task list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's clothes showed signs of having seen better days.

She had mowed what little grass they had in the front yard, as the landlord was too cheap to have proper maintenance for the townhomes. Then she had been doing the dishes, during which she had asked each of dear sisters, cousin, and best friend to kindly get their laundry down the chute if they needed it washed. Audrey thought she had been clear. She shouldn\u2019t have had to go searching for hampers. Nor been blessed with the column of week old laundry that had piled up below the chute, jamming it with a tower of soiled clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone is so lucky that I do this!\u201d Audrey fumed over the rumble of a dryer load as she scrubbed to work out stubborn stains before the pre-wash. She suddenly felt sorry of her parents when she and her sisters had been kids. Love meant learning about others more than you wanted too. You could get no worse of dirty laundry than dirty laundry and Audrey had seen all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Reagan\u2019s skanky underwear to Phoebe\u2019s childish throwbacks, to Ixchel\u2019s mind-breaking shirts with references Audrey didn\u2019t understand, to the unfortunate aftermath when Uma was going commando.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaundry was once a week because it took Audrey that long to get the smell out of her mind. The combined odors of five women could be too much sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey knew more about everyone\u2019s fashion statements and intimates than she cared to, week after week of being the only one to do laundry. Well, that wasn\u2019t fair. Phoebe had wanted to surprise her and finish the laundry before her older sister was forced to finish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly that had left the colored dyes bleeding into the whites, bleach mixed in with the darks, Audrey\u2019s favorite floral print shirt five sizes too small, and for days afterwards no pairs of socks could be partnered together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo laundry was Audrey\u2019s expertise. She knew the lifespan of every article of clothing from its date of purchase to when it finally gave up the ghost. It gave Audrey textile-based intel on each of her roommates. The double-duty dirty laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, the laundry was painting Audrey a very different picture. From frayed ends and stretched seams, the telltale signs that one of the women in the house was gaining weight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sighing with an air of frumpiness, Audrey begrudgingly pulled a rather stretched tank top from the machine and inspected it.<br>\r\nBiting her lip nervously, the stress prone blonde let her eyes survey the poor overworked garment, recognising it distinctly as hers but somewhat more bedraggled than even she liked to keep her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plain white fabric assumed its usual array of stains and marks that came from Audrey's mundane daily routine of cleaning, cooking AND working to keep the townhouse afloat but other things were becoming apparent from the simple garment in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe printed pattern that adorned the general chest area had, as to be expected, suffered with age sporting cracks and fading from repeated washes of a t-shirt kept too long before been replaced, but it also showed signs of been stretched.<br>\r\nLines that were once straight now bowed along their length whilst patches of colour had been spread so thinly in places that the white material underneath was visible.<br>\r\nAlongside the mutilated pattern, the hem of said shirt was also looking rather sorry for itself with a distinct wrinkling running the entire circumference of the shirt making clear indications that the material had been overtaxed and then shrunk back to its usual size from repeatative drying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed again as she tossed the shirt into her basket of clean clothes ready to fold.<br>\r\nSure, she didn't love the stretched garment excessively, she was more fond of the fact that it had fit her comfortably since starting college.<br>\r\nShe'd even met Uma whilst wearing the damn thing.<br>\r\nThe spark of memory brought a smile to the blonde's face as she remembered that night, grabbing the shirt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only a doey eyed freshman and had no friends but, all the same, found herself tottering around somebody's house party trying to mingle.<br>\r\nEntirely unsuccessful as she was no social butterfly like the twins were, Audrey eventually found an open door and staggered out into the open, gulping in fresh air to calm her nerves.<br>\r\nFeeling somewhat better for the rush of oxygen, Audrey found herself ready to return and hopefully make a friend or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until she walked square into an unsuspecting guy smoking and took his tab square in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore from the shock than actual pain, Audrey had flown backwards, patting her shoulder with gusto in an attempt to put out a non-existent fire that had burnt a small hole in her shirt.<br>\r\nOblivious once again, her flailing led her to crash into the back of who would later turn out to be Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing to herself with the memory swimming through her head, Audrey poked her finger through the now wider hole in the shoulder of her shirt.<br>\r\nA small portion of the hole retained its charred edge but most of it had disappeared as the mark widened over time.<br>\r\nPlacated on the matter of the shirt, the dumpy blonde proceeded with sorting through laundry, for a short while at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For god's sake\" chuntered Audrey under her breath as she pulled a pair of leggings, also belonging to her, from the machine and inspected a rather unsightly line of holes running up the inside of both legs.<br>\r\nOk, Audrey was rational and a big girl (in terms of age), she didn't need to sugar coat the fact that she had obviously chubbed up a little bit lately.<br>\r\nShe could have happily gone without the sudden realisation that her thighs were rubbing together slightly more than usual though, the obvious culprit for her threadbare leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, it wasn't ENTIRELY her fault.<br>\r\nThere had been plenty of times when she had cooked a meal for the house with full preparation for five portions only to not have all five girls appear at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Aud, boxercise class tonight!\" announces Uma, passing through the hall with the stink of school gym already following her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Insert random boys name here* is taking me out tonight\" cooes Phoebe as she skips out the door with her ass hanging out of god knows what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm streaming tonight, sorry Audrey\" mutters Ixchel from her gaming throne in her room whilst ushering the resident matriach away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Insert random boys name here* just broke up with me, I'm too sad to eat!\" cries Phoebe not two days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the picture, Audrey lived with difficult to pin down individuals who couldn't respect a dinner schedule if it hit them in the face.<br>\r\nLord only knows where Reagan was in all this, as the most rambunctious twin often just ghosted completely or acted like a child when asked a reasonable question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say and, as one who hated to waste anything given the financial state of the household, Audrey found herself taking one for the team on a semi regular basis.<br>\r\nSeemed the majority of the time she was taking something for one team or another, but this particular situation dictated that Audrey served to make use of the excessive meals that she had lovingly prepared for the household.<br>\r\nThis combined with her very sedent job and the tatters of her metabolism that had been ripped apart by stress as she had aged led to the sorry state the blonde found herself in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her own world, Audrey was completely unawares of the presence of Reagan behind her, observing her sisters exposed back caused by an up-riding top along with the chubby hips and rounded behind that adorned the blonde's bottom half.<br>\r\n\"Woah there Aud, glad I realised it was you, was about to man a harpoon or something\" sniggered the rowdy red head, making a very obvious snipe at her sisters weight.<br>\r\nHaving had about enough, Audrey stood up from the basket she was knelt over, roughly tugged her currently stretched top down to cover herself and marched towards the door currently blocked by Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeething as she passed the skinny red head, Audrey thought about giving the young lay about a piece of her mind but came to her senses a little before talking.<br>\r\n\"Well seeing as you're so proactive how about you finish up the laundry?\"<br>\r\nLeaving her sister dumbstruck in the doorway, Audrey couldn't help but smile to herself. She didn't often go full mum but sometimes it did have its perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do this, I'm seeing Sam in an hour!\" shouted Reagan<br>\r\n\"You dumped Sam\" called back Audrey as she grabbed her coat and purse<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" muttered Reagan, not too subtly \"well I'm meeting some friends in an hour\"<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't do the laundry you'll have to explain to them why you smell like an open sewer pipe\" taunted Audrey as she opened the front door and stepped over the threshold<br>\r\n\"That's so not fa...\" started the fiery twin, losing ground quickly at this point.<br>\r\n\"Bye Reagan!\" shouted Audrey as she closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuming herself, Reagan stroppily paced the hallway as her cousin appeared.<br>\r\n\"Did Audrey just leave?\" asked Ixchel, scratching her bare upper arm as she spoke<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" muttered Reagan, suddenly having an idea \"hey, you understand technology right?\"<br>\r\n\"Not a chance Reagan, I heard Audrey\" interjected Ixchel, before turning tail back to her room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, left dumbstruck, Reagan wiped out her phone and hit up her bank.<br>\r\nScrolling over the statement, a smile slowly formed on her lips<br>\r\n\"Totally can buy a new outfit with that, problem solved\" purred the red head, heading to the door herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phebs, Aud said do the laundry for her!\" shouted Reagan up the stairs as she slammed the door behind her.<br>\r\n\"Awww what?!\" moaned the other twin, half way down the stairs<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a hub for some of her essential purchases. After telling off Reagan, Audrey was feeling more keen overall despite her predicament. A slight weight flux aside, she had long been overdo for a new wardrobe. All she did for the townhouse and her flatmates regularly left her needs unfulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made it to the Clothworth outlet, Audrey began to browse the racks for clothes that would look good. Somethings good, somethings practical, somethings that would look nice on her. Like date nice. Downright sexy even; a girl could dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter squirreling herself away with a haul to try on, Audrey found that she had misjudged just how much weight she had gained. It wasn't just age and fatigue that had ruined her clothes. Her first try-on options, from floral prints to cashmere, had only been selected one size larger that what was Audrey's usual size. Clearly, at the extent of that muffin top staring her back in the mirror as she tried on some teal shorts, she must had gone up two or three sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*\" she groaned, \"only the twins can pull it off.\" Few of her first picks survived the first try-on, greatly limiting Audrey's options as she went to return the clothes in order to find ones that actually fit her. Audrey's physique had always been big boned but there could be no further doubt that she had graduated to plus sizes. Her selection wasn't as large but there was still plenty of things Audrey found that suited her practical yet stylish interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing none of the other girls were here, as any of Audrey's roommates would have provided commentary on the thin veneer splitting her 'mom/grandmother' fashion sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this actually turned out,\" Audrey complimented her appearance with a jeans-blouse with a bit of embroidery that fit nicely over her plumped curves without pinching. And once she found a fitting sweater she sported quite the pair of sweater puppies. Her bra size must have increased too, although Audrey always felt embarrassed shopping for intimates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking out with her new clothing purchases hurt Audrey's wallet more than she cared to admit. However, the experience left her feeling better now that she had a new wardrobe she could enjoy, as she took out four bags of clothes. Of course, she had made sure most of it was easily machine washable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had some funds left over, which was handy considering...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been awhile since Audrey had gotten to shop on her own. She had to purchase things for the townhouse frequently as she inevitably ended up handling most of the finances and domestic needs. It had felt good to shop solely for herself and she had gotten a good deal out of it. The niggling insecurity of her frame filling out a couple clothing sizes was drowned out from the euphoria of responsible shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why, on the way out of the boutique, the speckled blonde was intrigued by the window sized posters adorning another storefront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CLEARANCE SALE!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING MUST GO!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLIQUIDATION VALUE!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey couldn't remember when the small appliance outlet had opened in the mall but clearly it was another sign of brick and mortar retailers losing out in the digital age. Call her more old fashioned than her generation suggested but Audrey valued being able to physically inspect her merchandise before spending money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked into the store to notice the inventory at slashed prices, her eyes immediately shot to a new toaster. The townhouse had an aged toaster that undercooked the toast. But this one could hold six slices and came in peach! When Audrey read the price tag her jaw hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a steal!\" she whispered excitedly to herself, forgetting that the store was closing and directly advertised at the savings to be had. She couldn't let an opportunity like this slip her by. She had always wanted some of these cooking gadgets and the time to be saved would more than pay for their original value!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could somebody help me with the door?\" Audrey called out, hours after she had left for the mall as she returned to 8422 Fordham Ave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it,\" her cousin Ixchell said, opening the door only to have three boxes thrust into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daym, girl,\" Uma took in the scene, having enjoyed the quiet with Audrey out shopping and the twins both absent. \"What is all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you're here too Uma,\" Audrey remained oblivious of her roommates' reactions. \"Can you carry this bag, they had to double bag it on account of the bulk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you want,\" Ixchel asked, confused, as she read the boxes thrust into her hand. \"A 'Mach Liquid' blender, a 'Bronzehead' pan and an omelette maker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just unpack them in the kitchenette,\" Audrey instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel and Uma didn't know what to make of the haul Audrey had to pull from the car. This was the same frugal, practical minded blonde that had been doing the laundry that morning, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got such a good deal on all these!\" Audrey said excitedly, preening as she showed off what she had purchased. \"We can start cooking not only healthier but much quicker too!\" One of her most prized purchases was the electric grill. \"Remember when these were on infomercials all the time? I got it for less than the monthly installment price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma eyed the machine critically. \"For a 'Geoff Forgeman Grilling Machine'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel also looked at the box. \"That doesn't sound right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it's not exactly the same,\" Audrey downplayed the concern, \"but I cannot believe the savings to be had with that appliance store going out of business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma checked the packing flyers. \"Since when did the Garden Heights mall have an appliance store?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, it just went out,\" Audrey hummed, arranging her new kitchen implements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" Ixchel scratched the back of her neck. \"This seems like too much to get.\" Her own immediate family had numerous siblings, branches and generations living in close proximity. And while cuisine was a big part of their blended cultures, even that entire brood didn't need the amount of cookware Audrey had just splurged to get. There was only five of them in the townhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, gals, this is for all of us. Look, Ixchel,\" Audrey thrust another box at her cousin. \"A Smar-Tec basket steamer! With a built in timer and release in case you forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that actually is useful,\" Ixchel marveled at the device, only to shrink back after noticing that Uma gave her a look that screamed 'Seriously?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who wants to help me test these out?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, we can barely all fit in the kitchenette as it is,\" Uma stated the obvious fact, as the three women were nearly crowded out of the room to make space for all the new appliances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's smile turned cringeworthy for only a moment. \"We'll make room! Somehow.\"</span></div></div>",

The twin redheads were befuddled, although the house did smell good from the cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the Taco Thursday night special at Aubelito's?\" Phoebe asked, owing to a frequent townhouse tradition of getting tacos for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey scoffed, \"I didn't get the chance to overhaul our cookware and not test it out! Tell you what, while the roast is cooking we can use these freeze moulds for homemade sorbet or jello shapes for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan sighed, although Phoebe was instantly on board the moment gelatin was mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this side makes waffles while this side presses crepes!\" Audrey explained eagerly at the start of breakfast the next day. \"Using fresh fruit this make for a light and healthy meal, since I only use egg whites in the batter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that like it's a good thing,\" Uma said, eying her waffle suspiciously. \"But that is the blanchest waffle I have ever seen. It's whiter than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, give it a taste at least, Uma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTh athlete bit her lip then took a forkful. \"Huh,\" she chewed. \"That's actually not too bad when you add syrup. Lemme try the other thing too, I need to carb load before my workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey smiled, passing over the first crepe. \"And the cider press I got can also be used to make syrup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You figure out how to make licorice syrup, Aud, and that might just pay for itself,\" Uma replied, far more appreciative of the new cookware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This roller case is just like the ones you see at the gas station,\" Audrey showed Ixchel before lunch. \"But it's so versatile! We could sear burritos and keep corn on the cob warm too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Ixchel took a whiff of the cooking oil. \"Is this Glip-Away not supposed to have a scent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Audrey turned from where she was preparing a broiler. \"Oh, Glip-Away is an imitation fat cooking oil. I got so many devices the store threw in 2 gallons worth of that stuff, it's from the same company as half of the new appliances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever before had Audrey shown such enthusiasm for cooking. It was normally a pain to get all the ladies in the townhouse to actually meet for dinner and not eat out constantly when that could cost a fortune. Few had ever appreciated Audrey's cooking in the past. However, over the next few weeks Audrey eventually won out each roommate to what these labor saving cookware devices could provide. Since most could be programmed for automatic cooking, Audrey no longer felt that cooking was a chore. It was actually kind of fun to try new things now that she had an array of kitchen gadgets. The other women of the house tapered off on eating out, so when Audrey and Ixchel were done with their jobs, Uma her workouts, and the twins with college, nights at 8422 Fordham Ave. was a veritable smorgasbord of as seen on TV options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured Audrey for a literal basket case once she got you this Smar-Tec basket steamer,\" Uma said over dinner one night when Ixchel had created the menu, \"but these dumplings are killer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way my aunt taught me to make them was such a chore,\" Ixchel replied. \"And these are done in a flash, ready to enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although some here have been enjoying it too much, ya think?\" Uma said with a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ixchel was confused be the statement, although a brief scrutiny of Uma's posture led her to believe it was a projective statement. \"Indeed, I guess some of us have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach woman was critical of how pudgy the other was getting while oblivious to their newfound plumpness. Uma noticed that Ixchel, always on the chubby side since she had known her, had put on a few since Audrey had been cooking up a storm with her clearance sale appliances. Overall she looked more doughy from breast to stomach, the most telling change being under the hem of her skirt. Her pillowy thighs spread out over her seat, notably thicker than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel, meanwhile, noticed that Uma didn't look the stellar picture of fitness currently. All of this 'carb-loading' had left the black, hedonistic athlete with a hint of a gut. Fat was having trouble finding a place to settle on Uma's toned frame, most of it settling around her middle to add a small roll to her zip-up jersey. It remained Ixchel of when she and Audrey had tried for swim team a few summers when they were kids. Some of the girls were bigger like them, husky athletes, although Uma was getting rather husky if she kept up this diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, someone really likes Audrey's cooking,\" Uma replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must help those that are getting, what's the term,\" Ixchel teased, \"bulked up before they get cut and ripped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Uma asked, half a dumpling in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you too better not be hogging all the dumplings,\" Reagan said as she came back for seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite you're whining, Red,\" Uma said with mild scorn. \"Audrey and Ixchel can make more if we run out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, these are tasty!\" Phoebe said as she too refilled her plate, while Reagan was making sideways glances at the other housemates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst, sis\" Reagan whispered. \"Check out tubby and chunky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Phoebe asked, loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssh,\" Regan chided, softly telling her twin to look towards where Uma and Ixchel sat in the breakfast nook. Once Phoebe noticed what Regan indicated they shared a private giggle as they made their way back to eat in front of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uma and Chel were looking so porky!\" Phoebe whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Regan snickered. \"Keep it up and they'll be a pair of butterballs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd tell me if I was getting fat, right Regan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, probably,\" Reagan replied, content in savoring the taste of the dumplings. It would be funny to tease her younger twin about plumping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins looked to have stayed the skinniest in this whole endeavor. However, while their stomachs remained flat there was a particular feature the two shared tailor made to store excess calories. Both Reagan and Phoebe were looking packed in the back of their jeans, each of their rears getting outrageously bodacious. As the Durant twins favored their best asset, any signs of weight gain were clouded by the usual feeling of tightness whenever their butts would grow more shapely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegan, eventually, had to adjust her sitting to try and dig at where her thong was biting into her fleshy ass cheeks. \"I swear, Audrey may have gotten a handicap at cooking but she's lousing up my laundry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's really itchy,\" Phoebe replied, as she tugged at her bra which felt tighter than she had remembered. It was a subtle difference between the two pear shaped twins, but Regan had definitely filled out her butt more than Phoebe had, as the younger twin had some of her newly acquired fat settling in her chest. And these dumplings they gorged on would only add to this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the four housemates might poke fun at who had plumped up the most while remaining oblivious to their own, but each of them would agree that there was one person with the most signs of loving Audrey's cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad everyone has been enjoying these dinners at home,\" Audrey said, after getting another plate. \"These appliances help with eating healthy. I think my weight is going to turn around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins, who had the first look of Audrey sitting down, had to stifle another snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was looking more jovial and upbeat than she had for ages, but 'slimming down' was not the word any of her housemates would use to describe her. Perennially the biggest boned of the bunch, Audrey was an apple shape that was looking more juicy than it had any right to be. She had yet to grow out of her clothes but they were looking tight. Audrey would taste everything she cooked as she tested each new device and the results were obvious to all but herself, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was catching in this townhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Audrey now had a noticeable bulge to her belly at all times, even between meals, and her chest and backside were looking extra weighty. Her face looked a bit fuller as well. No double chin or love handles just yet, although for the more sardonically minded of the house they figured that would come in time with Audrey's shift in lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Audrey talking about?\" Ixchel asked in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma leaned to look out into the living room. \"About how good this 'eating healthy' is doing for her. Helping her gain more than a few, it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ixchel said with lost irony. \"She's in denial as much as the twins are with their bigger booties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only because they make it look good,\" Uma said, absentmindedly scratching herself around her new plushness.</span></div></div>",

in size more than she'd hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calm serenity washing over Audrey was quickly shattered, however, as her phone angrily buzzed inside her bag.<br>\r\n\"I wonder what this could be\" asked Audrey of herself, foolish naivety clouding her judgement just enough to forget this was probably a disaster.<br>\r\nAnd what a disaster it was.<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" muttered Audrey as she shoved her phone back into her bag after reading the panicked message from Phoebe begging for her to come home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even an afternoon to myself\" grumbled the blonde as she marched off to deal with the next problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" shouted Audrey as she stood at the top of the stairs to the basement, looking down at what could now only be described as a swimming pool \"what happened?!\"<br>\r\nTrying to not lose her cool as she looked at Phoebe, Audrey slowly made her way down the stairs to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" howled Phoebe as she stood ankle deep in water pouring out of the washing machine from all sides, as the tears slowly rolled down her cheeks having smudged her mascara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, lets just calm down\" assured Audrey despite her anger, gently cuddling her youngest sister without stepping into the standing water \"why did you stay down here when its clearly flooding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" sniffed Phoebe \"I just thought it would be best if I...\"<br>\r\nAnd so the tears came afresh as Phoebe rather pathetically nuzzled against Audrey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, go upstairs and get yourself changed because you're going to catch a cold if you stay in those damp clothes much longer\"<br>\r\nAudrey didn't dare ask why Phoebe was completely drenched when the water was only a few inches deep, the more ditzy twin had a tendency of causing anarchy where ever she went, albeit less maliciously than her twin Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Phebes honey?\" called Audrey before the redhead could escape the basement completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" sniffed Phoebe as she looked back down, looking like a deer in the headlights ready to be mowed down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Reagan?\" asked Audrey flatly, realising all too well that Reagan had no doubt skipped out on helping just for a change<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She, erm, went out I guess?\" replied Phoebe, looking confused \"she said you wanted me to do the laundry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey shook her head, mostly to herself, before returning to address Phoebe.<br>\r\n\"Ok, thanks for trying sweetie\" smiled Audrey, trying to be as sincere as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" chirped Phoebe, nearly all remnants of panic disappearing almost instantly as she walked off to get changed, a trail of water marking her route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Audrey stood in the basement, completely aghast at the situation before her.<br>\r\nIt was beyond her understanding how Phoebe had managed to mess up the laundry so much, the machine had been deliberately picked for its simplicity on the off chance any of the other girls decided to contribute to the weekly chores.<br>\r\nMore so though, she was fuming at Reagan.<br>\r\nIt wasn't a difficult request, 'do some laundry Reagan', and yet here Audrey was, picking up from the fallout of yet another Reagan class nuclear fallout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hands on her hips and sighing deeply, Audrey rolled her sleeves and trousers up before heading down the stairs and taking a proper look at the now defunct washing machine.<br>\r\nUnsure of where to start, Audrey became quietly aware of the sound of shopping bags rubbing past each other, and, in the nick of time, managed to turn to see one bag fall from the step she had left it on and into the pooling water below.<br>\r\nSighing again, Audrey couldn't tear her eyes away as the blouse she had chosen so fondly slowly floated out of its plastic holder and made headway towards an opposing corner of the basement.<br>\r\n\"Yep, sounds about right\" grumbled Audrey as she turned back to the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Uma for the help\" smiled Audrey as she stepped to one side as her college friend delivered the last push to place the dead washing machine at the top of the basement stairs and into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it Aud, I won't need to hit the gym after that\" smirked the athlete, giving the machine a resounding slap as if to claim victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey laughed as she wiped her hands \"well, all the same\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two friends chuckled over their success, the front door flew open, crashing into the wall revealing the not so delicate door opener<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup bitches!\" called out Reagan as she lent against the doorframe whilst stretching herself to exhibit her new outfit to a less than enthusiastic audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I hope the guys respond better than that otherwise I'm taking this shit back\" grumbled the fiery redhead as she stepped into the hallway whilst casually kicking the door closed behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you didn't pay much considering how much of it there isn't\" spat Uma, equally unimpressed the with the older twin having had the run down from Audrey as they worked out what to do about the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet there isn't much\" teased Reagan with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit in question was indeed Reagan's taste.<br>\r\nComprising of a pair of fishnet stockings alongside a pair of red denim booty shorts cut so high a sizable bulge of ass cheek was hanging out of each leg, Reagan was all for exhibiting her best features.<br>\r\nHer top didn't go amiss in this arrangement, mind, and the redhead had settled for a far from concealing boob tube that barely sat under her boobs whilst a little warmth was brought by a thin leather jacket around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're happy\" asserted Audrey as she placed herself before her sister, arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Generally, yes\" mused Reagan, amusing herself more than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you shouldn't be\" continued Audrey \"I ask you to do a simple task and instead you disappear and leave your sister to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was fine with it, besides...\" started Reagan before finding her feet dangling off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what the hell!\" screamed the redhead as Uma lifted her and carried her down the basement stairs, sitting her on the first step before the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer initial rage fading, Reagan started to laugh as she looked at the mess before her<br>\r\n\"Jeez, has baby twin started wetting herself again?\" chuckled the redhead as she looked behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" shouted Phoebe who had returned after hearing her name and was now stood at the top of the stairs, toweling her hair as she stood in her less than dignified pyjamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore an argument could ensue, Audrey cut through to the forefront.<br>\r\n\"There's got to be some changes round here, I can't support this place on my own any more and things like THIS can't happen every time I trust one of you to do a job\"<br>\r\nSilence fell over the other three girls present as the looked around awkwardly, knowing full well they were main culprits there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to say?\" asked Audrey as she surveyed the group.<br>\r\nStill silence<br>\r\n\"Good. House meeting, five minutes\" asserted the blonde as she walked out of the basement, sliding past Phoebe as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith noone knowing what to say, the three girls all looked at each other slightly dumbfound before one of them finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lucky me bought these sweet clothes before the dictatorship kicked in\" chuckled Reagan as she admired herself once again as she stood up to leave the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up\" muttered Uma before neatly nudging the redhead ever so slightly as she was midstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Uma and Phoebe ran like hell before a large splash rang through the house indicating the swift baptism of Reagan's new outfit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reagan Durant was bored. It was dangerous when Reagan got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was twenty-two and everything was going for her. She lived with her sisters and roommates in this townhouse. She had worked out a major score of a deal with her sister, Audrey, who got a student rental discount on account of Reagan and her goofy twin Phoebe attending the same campus as the landlord had, who was an alumnus. Reagan had twisted the deal further to wiggle out of paying rent, saving her dollars for the important stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t tuition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Reagan kept up on tuition more or less every other penny of her college fun went to her own amusement. Reagan was too clever for her own good, always scheming. She also had a smoking hot body, a fine white girl booty and killer looks. If only she didn\u2019t have the genetic clone of a twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan knew she had everything going for her and took to finding every advantage in life. She was just brilliant enough to keep up that life of laziness. It helped that there were five of the girls in this townhouse. Plenty of others to drop off all the chores and shit Reagan didn\u2019t want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly everyone who had lived with her this long were immune to the twin swap trick. Even if Phoebe had classes for acting Reagan easily considered herself the better actor, the amount of times she pretended to be her sister to get out of trouble or shift the blame. Nobody in the townhouse fell for it anymore, as they had picked up on the subtle cues that identified each twin, given their opposite personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, leading Phoebe around was easy because she was such a sheep. Leave things alone long enough and either Audrey or Ixchel would handle it for her. On occasion Reagan had even swindled Uma Ferro to do something for her. That didn\u2019t happen too often given that the black athlete, Audrey\u2019s college roommate, was cut from the same cloth as Reagan when it came to shirking duty. The two had hit it off after that. Hell, Uma tended to be the only roommate Reagan could stand living with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a typical Saturday morning at the townhouse. Reagan didn\u2019t have any plans although there\u2019s plenty should have been doing. Her acoustical engineering professor was riding her double fine ass (metaphorically speaking) on a major project but Reagan didn\u2019t feel like sinking long hours at the campus on a Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting kind of stuffy in the townhouse. Noisy too. Not the kind of noise Reagan liked. The drone was filled with Phoebe\u2019s mindless television, Ixchel\u2019s vapid K-Pop, the sounds of Uma\u2019s workouts and Audrey\u2019s continued frustrated ranting. Reagan didn\u2019t want to stick around but she also didn\u2019t want to get up that early on Saturdays to get out of the townhouse before all the monotony happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed something to do fast or the whole day was going to be super annoying.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chel! What\u2019s the password?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d The dark, moon shaped face of her multiracial cousin poked up from behind the door of her little office.

Come on, just let me on for an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d She wrote out the password for Reagan, making a mental note to change it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that so hard?\u201d Regan asked herself ten minutes later, after returning to her retreat up on the third floor with two Dr. Peppers an a can of Pringles, snacks for some mindless surfing. There was plenty of cheap junk in the house that Reagan had gained a taste for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, everybody annoyed her now! Why couldn't she and Ixchel or Uma do something fun, like play some video games or catch a movie? Everybody retreated to do their own little thing and if you asked Audrey to do anything she came up with a list of chores. Everybody was so non-comittial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there had been a show she wanted to torrent online Reagan couldn\u2019t remember the site, so she drifted through various sites in hopes of finding someing to catch her attention before she had to get up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had conned Audrey to get off her back enough about rent life in the townhouse was the pits. Sure, she was shackled with her sisters but Reagan had thought living together would be awesome. They could do whatever they wanted after classes. Only Audrey had become such a hard nose and Ixchel kept odd hours, secluding herself away in the office. Uma was fun but she didn\u2019t invite Reagan to all the same parties as her after Audrey reminded her that Reagan still needed to finish her degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she still had two years of credits left to finish. Hell, how come Reagan couldn\u2019t score some easy cash right now? She could get her own place, hang out with her choice of friends that preferred her company and become the center of attention again. She scratched her redheaded scalp in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s when, aimlessly browsing the web, Reagan came across a special offer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Toppin' Tarts was her jam ever since she was a kid. The toaster pastries weren't as mainstream as the more common Pop Tarts but they had grown in popularity over the years. They were the first to advertise as \"Enjoy Them Frozen\" and there was also a sub-brand that had a jelly filled flakey crust with optional frosting kinda like Toaster Strudels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was young, her parents found Toppin' Tarts to be a cheap and frequent kids breakfast option. The twins could be sustained by splitting a pack in half which had always bothered Reagan even when she was small. Why did she always have to share with her twin when Audrey could have both tarts from her pack all on her own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as a kid Reagan frequently scammed her parents or her sister out of Toppin' Tart shares. As a teen she'd spend most of her allowance and other cash she would scrounge together on her stash of Toppin' Tarts. She could sit on her ass and never tire of eating Toppin' Tarts all day. Hell, that's likely part of the reason she got such a killer ass to begin with; Reagan had shed her awkward chubby phase after middle school by losing the pounds save those stored in her bodacious behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan's mouth was watering at the thought of her favorite Toppin' Tart flavors. Cinnamon Crunch, Triple Berry, Ice Cream Smoothie, Peach Marmalade, Chocolate Chip Muffin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when she was living in the dorms Reagan almost lived off the things. Although during the move to the townhouse Audrey had initially thrown out all of the junk food in the thought that everyone might follow Ixchel's example and try to eat healthier. Never mind that Ixchel had more or less been outset all her life and Audrey finally broke down after realizing how expensive it would be to go organic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, if Reagan could win this contest she would have a lifetime supply of her favorite toaster pastries. Audrey couldn't argue with free! And Reagan wouldn't have to share any with her sisters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vindictive grin to right wrongs from childhood became a crestfallen look as she continued to read on about the lifetime supply contest. Typical marketers, dragging people in with a bold statement that belied all the fine print and particulars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Reagan wanted to be waist deep in a steady supply of her favorite pastries, she would have to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like any deep web session, Reagan found herself down a rabbit hole of various web searches completely different from where she initially was going to torrent movies. She had been looking up various quick rich schemes and found herself clicking on something she normally wouldn\u2019t have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, you can be paid that much?\u201d Reagan mused, looking at the kickbacks for blood plasma donations. Being sucked dry with needles didn\u2019t fancy her, even if she got some dough out of it. After looking through some related medical donations or studies, she came across a link at the bottom of the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurrogacy?\u201d As in, carrying a baby to term for another couple. Being someone else\u2019s baby momma? Sure, Reagan was plenty promiscuous and had an active sex life, although she didn\u2019t see having a baby in her cards. To lose her rockin\u2019 bod to baby weight? No thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a lark, she decided to click it anyway to get a good laugh. And then nearly spit out her Dr. Pepper as her eyes read the new web page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForty to fifty thousand in benefits?!\u201d Reagan swallowed her soda, her eyes darting fervently as she looked at terms and dollar signs. Comfortably getting a half-grand package plus other benefits to carry somebody\u2019s kid to full term; would she be willing to give up so much of her life to get that kind of cash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan considered where her life currently was at, shirking her college studies and hiding out in this dinky townhouse she had to share with four other people. And this could pay out almost as cushy as an office job, with clients with deep pockets at a surrogacy clinic two cities over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a radical decision to make. As much as the cash was attractive to Reagan, the implications were one that needed to be considered with sound, rational judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPringles and Dr. Pepper wouldn\u2019t cut it anymore. Reagan needed brain food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her hidey hole, unfortunately, made Reagan susceptible to the trash TV watched by her younger twin and older sister. They were in deep on an episode of <i>The Shoal</i>, one of those east coast reality show types about trendy rich people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Reagan, come watch with us,\u201d Phoebe offered to her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you actually watch this...stuff\u2026\u201d Reagan trailed off, bemused by what she saw on the TV. \u201cWho is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGigi?\u201d Audrey replied, as the camera zoomed in on an expectant looking woman and her entourage. \u201cRuns some line of makeup, tries to be a trendsetter, really hates her life coach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe provided commentary over this Gigi heading to her salon, with every employee in the shop focused on her service. \u201cAnd ever since she got pregnant everyone\u2019s been treating her like a queen! But she actually hasn\u2019t revealed who the father is yet, which really upsets her brother and co-partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has to be Luca,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cBut she must be holding back the news to keep him from leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she had that fling with her tennis instructor,\u201d Phoebe said, \u201cso nobody really knows--Reagan?\u201d The redhead turned but her twin was gone. \u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully she\u2019s not out doing anything foolish,\u201d Audrey said, cursing the untimely buzz of the dryer from the basement as some juicy gossip was dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Reagan didn\u2019t necessarily make a foolish decision, but her seeking out the surrogacy clinic wasn\u2019t a decision she had made solely for altruistic reasons. The promise of tremendous compensation, plus the idea she could garner lots of attention from playing the preggo card, were prime motivators for the bodacious redhead wanting to stand out from her twin and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it involved more effort than she had expected, forms to fill out, interviews to be had, medical tests to meet. There were some costs for her up front, which Reagan had weasled together with the theory that becoming a surrogate would more than make up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a single, college-aged student without any previous births made her an unlikely candidate, information a nurse had told her early in the process, although Regan had schmoozed her way through the system given the positive results of her medical history. She was healthy, had never done hard drugs, could reduce her alcohol intake, was at the ideal weight for her age and in the prime of her fertility, although it wouldn\u2019t be her eggs used in the process. In the meantime of this application process, Reagan focused back on college to look good for the paperwork, all to justify her history and increase her chances as she completed the rigorous process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany weeks later, after full evaluation and both her psychological and background checks cleared, Regan was contacted to come to the clinic to discuss her options. The good news Regan was hoping for, as her schemes reached a new stage.</span></div></div>",

Her aim was to play up her more positive qualities, having undergone much scrutiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, you would not be her first choice,\u201d Dr. Schnieder continued, \u201cas we usually look to married women who have a dedicated family structure, and you have not previously had a birth. But your medical history aligns with an interesting proposition, which is why I have vouched for you to begin surrogacy so soon. Since you are a twin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan smiled, although she was somewhat confused. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your family has a history of multiples, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, both our grandmothers were twins, along with some twin great-uncles. And if you go far back enough there\u2019s triplets.\u201d Regan was beginning to wonder if she was getting in over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd without me being too bold, Miss Durant, you have quite the pair of child bearing hips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor didn\u2019t sound lecherous, although Reagan appreciated the flattery for her body. \u201cWhere exactly is this going, doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schnieder opened a file. \u201cIt used to be a common practice that multiple viable embryos were transferred into a surrogate. It wasn\u2019t always the case that each would begin gestating. Although there are some who are interested in having multiples from a surrogacy, and in my studies a woman with a family lineage of multiple births will have a better chance at carrying the babies to term, even if her eggs are not used. Are you aware of the diAngelos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was taken aback. \u201cShould I be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulian and Margaret diAngelo. Media moguls, they run several charitable foundations but they have always dreamed of having their own family. Margaret has been unable to bear children, however they are quite insist on having their own children rather than adoption with a suggested agency\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had been planning for this exact moment, although the prospect of carrying what, two(?), three babies(?) was a daunting one. She might almost break her cover story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is, of course, additional financial compensation to you for the stresses of a multiple birth,\u201d Dr. Schneider said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore babies, more money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had come this far, and at that moment she had decided to take the plunge. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore scheduling and procedures followed this monumental decision, including Reagan meeting the couple and starting a regimen of prenatal vitamins. And holy smokes the diAngelos were loaded! They dressed fancy, took Reagan out to dinner at a steakhouse to discuss options, and were very supportive and excited about the prospects. If Reagan had been doubting her objective until now, knowing that the parents in this endeavor had deep pockets stymied what concerns she had about such a tremendous undertaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd changes soon occurred for Reagan as her schemes hit a snag:</span></div></div>",

I know what you're thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's a perfectly logical explanation as to how she came to the idea (at least, reasons logical enough to Reagan) that help smooth this out narratively. Even though she'd always been the Gadfly amongst her housemates, Reagan wasn't exactly the type of person to go around sabotaging peoples' diets. Normally! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it had been a weird couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all anyone seemed to talk about was weight, one way or the other. Really, you could blame Audrey for that. Her penchant for stress snacking meant that she had been especially squirrely in the kitchen these days. With four other roommates (namely Reagan, but that was neither here nor there!) to play den mother to, her pants had gotten a little tighter before she realized just what was going on, and it had become her new obsession ever since - a new health kick that had brought everyone else's figures to the forefront of their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past week, Audrey had been making self-deprecating jokes, avoiding sweets, and doing these obnoxious clenches that made her look like she was holding something in. Naturally Uma had been one to offer to help her exercise, while also coming to her friend's defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I haven't put on a few lately - all that beer's gotta go somewhere...\" she'd said at least once or twice this week, with a slap to her still flat belly, \"What's say we go on a run and help me trim <i>my</i> extra pounds and inches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, neither had yet to actually <i>go</i> on that run. But the point remained, the two of them got stuck on the subject. Which meant that Phoebe, obvi, was going to catch up on it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look bloated, Rae?\" Phoebe had asked about a billion times, \"I feel bloated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, if you ask me that one more time I'm going to fucking kill you.\" Raegan groaned, had clawed dramatically at her face in utter agony of the banality of her twin's question, \"You look great, stop fucking askinggggggggg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly that left cousin Chel, perhaps the only person in the house who was <i>qualified</i> to worry about her weight, to her own devices. Since Raegan and Phoebe were talking about it, and everyone else was talking about it, Ixchel had decided to give up soda in hopes of shedding some pounds and inches. Having always been a little chubby, Raegan doubted that would have done her much good. But cousins were cousins after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we could hook you up to a treadmill powered PC, I bet you'd be able to game AND lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel had snorted at that, before taking a swig of her \"one\" soda of the day. She hadn't wanted to quit cold turkey, but she also hadn't been really good about giving up sugary carbonated beverages in general. When she wasn't swigging soda, she was usually snacking. So Raegan had her doubts about how well any diet would go for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so it had been a weird week in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was diet crazy except for Raegan, and she was bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the resident troublemaker of the group... it almost felt like an obligation for her to fuck with one of her housemates' aspirations of slimming down, didn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was... who was going to be in Raegan's sights?</span></div></div>",

And holy heck would should not shut up about recommended workout tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, ya gotta stretch out those glutes before you go on a run, even for the treadmill.\" Advice given to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how many minutes of cardio it takes to burn off those calories?\" After catching Ixchel eating some leftover spare ribs before dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to hydrate <i>and</i> sweat if you have any hopes of shedding those pounds, so skip the probiotics.\" Phoebe being told off of her favorite yogurt brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thighs tend to chunk up first, so rotate through sets of squats and lunges,\" Uma caught Reagan by surprise, giving her upper legs a poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hands off! I'm not getting fat.\" Reagan protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma cracked a smile of gleaming white teeth. \"Ya sure? You and Phebes are looking too porky in the bottoms.\" Uma gave Reagan's fine buttocks a sporting slap on her way to fish a gatorade out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsulted, Reagan shot back. \"So what, jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly, Rae. But if you want muscle tone like mine, and I could go with shedding some up top, we need to sign you up for some high intensity mixed weight workouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>OhMyGodJustShutUp</i>,\" Reagan mouthed under her breath, incredulous at Uma's claims. What weight did she need to lose? The lively, African American athlete was voluptuous in a stocky way, thick with muscle tone and eager to show off her fit bod with midriff revealing sportsware she wore around the house. And since the topic of weight woes had permeated the townhouse, she had been insufferable lording her fitness over everybody else. This was the same Uma who, weeks prior, was chill with Friday night wings &amp; booze, three plates at the buffet and overing double at the drive thru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her metabolism didn't look to have changed, prime athletic efficiency able to consume and burn a lot of calories for her physical efforts. The way Uma considered herself better than everyone else in the house in weight loss matters made Reagan sick, as the older of the twins did not feel the need to lose weight in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, aren't there a lot of sugars in those things?\" Reagan latched onto the gatorade for the slightest attempt at critiquing Uma's habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The energy and electrolytes given in my game fuel replenish what I need from a serious workout,\" Uma replied, moving to emphasis her trim figure. \"I'm just saying you should watch out for flab, Red. You and Phoebe may have the best butts in the house, but can you truly flex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter striking another pose, Uma's hearty cheeks flexed twice on her backside within her basketball shorts. Combined with patting her bulged bicep, Uma shot Reagan some finger guns as she left the kitchenette. \"Call me up when you want to lose a few of those inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was left seeing red after that. How could Uma get off claiming they should all lose some fat when she had the lowest body fat percentage of any of them? And she still ate like a horse. Previously, before these unwanted dieting tips became insufferable, Uma had told Reagan that her main stratagems for her fitness regimen followed the principle of \"Bulk Up, Get Cut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs in, load up on plenty of proteins and calories before the workout, then focus on exercise to turn increasing mass into muscle. Reagan was smart enough to realize that there was a thin line in that methodology that could lead to flab rather than fab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she now had a target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Reagan made her way back home with shopping bags dedicated to her efforts to sabotage Uma's workouts. The health goods, hardware and grocery stores had been hit up in sequence. Reagan serruptiously entered the house, cautious to not get caught by Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Reagan, where have you been?\" Phoebe suddenly popped up to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus! Damnit sis,\" Reagan shushed her twin. \"Keep it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we whispering?\" Phoebe whispered, trying to peek into the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for a project at school,\" Reagan replied, trying to change the subject. The last thing she needed was Phoebe blabbing on her scheme. \"Why don't you go watch that TV show you like with Audrey so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't. She, Chel and Uma went to sign up for yoga classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an unexpected opportunity to get her scheme underway while her target was out of the house. \"Sweet! Uh, I mean, why aren't you with them, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been feeling as bloated since I switched off the probiotics,\" Phoebe explained. \"So I didn't want to jump back into it until they tell me there's probiotics in the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan paused, setting down her bags on the counter. \"Wait, what do you think they're doing at yoga classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe shrugged. \"Dunno, making healthy yogurt parfaits? Sure, I like 'em but signing up for a whole class about making it seems boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit, could her twin be a brain-dead dolt sometimes. \"Whatever. So, do you want to help me assemble an amplifier for my thesis project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was itself a ploy, as Phoebe tended to go cross eyed whenever Reagan went into the specifics of her acoustical engineering degree. While Reagan had yet to become a major music producer, roadie or DJ from her coursework, it provided the perfect excuse to get unwanted attention from her back. Reagan retreated to her room, grinning wickedly as she took stock of her arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to have double up Uma double her weight,\" Reagan snickered, with big plans to have Uma chunk up in size. Taking out a woman in the prime of her fitness felt like the ultimate scheme, and Reagan had gathered materials to prepare for that effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would start simple, having found some vitamin shop products dangerous for the waistline if used in the wrong combination. Uma always touted a specific brand of whey protein powder for her muscle shakes. The cheaper brand, with a more crude formula, had less nutritional value. That would be followed by dissolvable appetite stimulant tablets and almost tasteless water retaining salt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan would combine this was a two pronged approach on Uma's favorite vittles; a range of her guilty pleasure favorite snacks, along with the full-fat, all-calorie, sugar-added versions of her health food junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the tools: How else was Uma's exercise bike going to have an ill timed bolt on the wheel? Or a controlled short on the treadmill?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not going to know what hit her,\" Reagan rubbed her hands together, picturing triumph as Uma started putting on the pounds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things like this didn't happen overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for Reagan to remember that, sometimes, the best-laid plans were the ones that took the longest to pay off. After all, she was no stranger to instant gratification. But this wasn't just changing out shampoo or tickling someone with whipped cream in their hand while they were asleep. Uma was an absolute fitness nut, and getting her to start slipping wasn't going to be an easy task. It was going to take time and effort to get her on the train to chunkytown, which were two things that Reagan <i>usually</i> did her best to steer clear from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in this case, she was willing to make an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Audrey, can I borrow you for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been the first time that Uma had started her day on the NordicTrack. Currently unemployed and coasting along on Audrey's good will, she didn't have much of a reason not to begin her days as she saw fit. And normally, she often saw fit to get off on the right foot with some light exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, it looked like she was going to have to make a few adjustments to her schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's been fucking with my track, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan could hear the conversation well enough from her deceptively aloof position sprawled out on her bed. Uma's room wasn't too far away from her own, and she wasn't exactly a low talker. One airpod in and the other out, she angled her head to get a better reception on what was being said\u2014the wicked thrill of a job well done tickling her into a small but wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Audrey's voice was as diplomatic as ever in a house where accusations could (admittedly) get thrown around wildly, \"At least, none of us have used it. We know the rule about touching your stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I know everyone's been trying to lose a little weight lately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure, Uma, but I can ask...\" an awkward pause in the conversation, one that made Reagan itch the bridge of her nose in anticipation, \"...why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it just gave out on me all of the sudden\u2014\" a <i>whack</i> that Reagan recognized as the hard plastic casing of Uma's NordicTrack, \"\u2014I bought this thing, like, a month after I moved in here. It's practically brand new!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan giggled maliciously to herself. It <i>was</i> brand new. Even with all of the miles that Uma had already put onto it, the machine had still been in great shape until a certain mischievous redhead with a pert, round booty had snuck in while Uma and the aforementioned redhead's sister went out to the bar and fucked with it a little. And then a little more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you return it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's out of warranty\u2014the store won't take it back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, I'm sorry Uma...\" Audrey sounded about as disappointed as Reagan was delighted, \"...is there anything that I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weary sigh and a few footsteps as Uma no doubt paced around the room. The telltale sound of a defeated flop onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo...\" she sighed, \"...unless you've got eight hundred dollars you'd like to let me borrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan wheezed out a barely controlled cackle. <i>Holy shit that thing had cost her eight hundred dollars</i>. And for it to give out so quickly, you never would have known it! Fucking with people's material possessions wasn't always nice (or worth it) but this gave her more than a little schadenfreude to work with after Uma had called her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... eight hundred dollars was a lot of bike to fuck up... Maybe she'd get her a gift card to somewhere \"just because\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that was enough to rationalize it. Back to barely restrained glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Uma wrapped up their conversation, both of them none the wiser of Reagan's machinations with the latter's machine. Uma's angry half-stomps travelled down the hall as she stormed towards the stairs. She barely paid any attention to Reagan piddling around on her tablet in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely under the radar\u2014the most dangerous place for a girl like her to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Uma?\" Reagan called back out, \"You wanna grab a bite with me at Lone Star?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause, followed by a few more footsteps, coming back towards Reagan's door. Uma poked her head in, pushing off with one arm in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? It's already been a day. I could use a drink with lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, let me get dressed and I'll meet you downstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma threw up a quick deuce as she walked back into her bedroom, leaving Reagan alone to percolate proudly on having gotten her roommate to skip out on exercise for the morning <i>and</i> agree to a greasy, Texas-sized lunch. With beer, no less! Uma was already looking a little puffy\u2014for all of her big talk, she seemed to be the only one confident enough in her figure to not take this household-wide diet as seriously as everyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this wouldn't be as hard as she thought?</span></div></div>",

After all, she <i>had</i> other things to worry about as far as her wallet was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't mean that exploiting Uma's bottomless desire for greasy takeout food and beer was entirely off the table, it just meant that Reagan had to be smart, and she had to be sneaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Reagan was naturally inclined towards both of those character traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Uma, you want another beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell.\" a mocha brown arm rose over the crest of the couch, \"Lay one on me, Rae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying with the food budget had been Reagan's best chance at keeping both her wallet and Uma full and flush. Audrey's eyebrows had been raised when her little sister had offered to take the grocery shopping of her to-do list; Reagan having successfully fooled her into thinking that she was (<i>pffft</i>) growing up. The simple answer was that cutting a few costs here or there (like buying generic cereal <i>sorry Phoebeeeeee~</i>!) meant that there was miraculously more money to keep a certain out of work athlete's favorite beer in the fridge. As well as a couple of other guilty pleasures that Uma in particular seemed to like. White Castle burgers, hot pockets, and a few other choice items that <i>definitely</i> would have gone against her volleyball training regime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that everyone else didn't like those things too, once in a while. It was just that Uma suddenly found herself with a <i>lot</i> more free time on her hands, now that her home gym was out of whack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, better watch out Uma.\" Audrey teased her friend from across the room, \"You're gonna need to go on <i>way</i> more than a few laps to burn off <i>four beers</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're not talking.\" Uma cocked an eyebrow as the other onlooking housemates snickered at the playful confrontation, \"How's Yoga going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey stuck out her tongue in refusal to dignify that with a (verbal) response. In just two short weeks, the diet talk that had built itself up had died out as quickly as it had come. Now everyone was more or less back to their usual routines. Ixchel was back at her desk, clacking away without so much as a thought to stretching, Audrey was back to playing den mother and her self deprecation had calmed to its normal levels, while Phoebe was... still Phoebe. The only member of the house who <i>hadn't</i> snapped back to normal was, of course, Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was now out two very expensive machines after her treadmill mysteriously died a week after her NordicTrack had given out, and had very little more to do while she was stuck at home, carless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had plenty of reason to feel that she'd \"earned\" those beers after the shitty past few weeks she'd had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a ton, Rae.\" Uma winced as she tackled the twist-off cap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Chel still bringing home food?\" Phoebe asked from the couch, \"I'm <i>starving</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Uma's stomach actually grumbled, \"Did she stop at the good Chinese place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Chel, <i>of course</i> she stopped at the good Chinese place.\" Reagan rolled her eyes, \"She's such a snob about her takeout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or food in general.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan stayed quiet as she sat back down in the armchair, perfectly pleased with the way things were progressing along. The appetite stimulants that Reagan had been slipping in with Uma's less-potent vitamins were clearly beginning to have more of an effect now, after a little less than two weeks of dosing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sipped her own beer happily, her feet kicking excitedly as she tried to hide her self-satisfaction behind a veil of her own normal eccentricity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I know is that she better hurry up.\" Uma took a swig and nursed a burp in her chest, \"I'm with Feebs on this\u2014I feel like I could eat a horse!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Anyone seen my jeans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan clenched her cheeks tight as soon as Uma had asked the question. Because of course, the last person to have seen Uma's favorite pair of jeans, the ones that she only wore out on dates, and the ones that she had had since high school and still fit into almost perfectly (until recently), had in fact been Reagan herself\u2014when she had snuck into Uma's room and ferreted them out with some of the other clothes that didn't have elastic drawstrings or stretchy waistbands in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few pieces of clothing at a time, and Uma had hardly noticed that they were gone. She wore leggings most of the time anyway, only really dressing up when she left the house. And since she didn't have her own car, that wasn't very often. And even when she did leave, who got dressed up to ride the bus? Or go to the bar with the girls? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, the fact that it had taken her this long to notice that some of her pants were missing was more her fault than Reagan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, sorry...\" Ixchel shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I don't <i>think</i> so...\" Phoebe scrunched her face thoughtfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see them in the wash...\" Audrey frowned placatingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are jeans?\" Reagan piqued unhelpfully without lifting her face from her tablet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma rolled her head back and groaned. This past month had sucked so far. Things were breaking for her left and right, she'd had to join gym again, except she couldn't always go every day because she had to take the fucking bus when her housemates couldn't drive her, and <i>now</i> her clothes were disappearing on her! Her <i>date</i> clothes! The cute shit that she only wore when she went out on the town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it would have fit her as well as it might have some weeks ago. More snugly, perhaps, but definitely not quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, that had been the idea behind Reagan snatching up everything that couldn't stretch a little. She had to give Uma's beer belly a fighting chance if she ever wanted to get this off the ground! The subtle softness that had crept onto her figure already was enough incentive for Reagan to keep going\u2014Uma was responding well (poorly? It was hard to keep track of the right word here) to her \"substituted\" vitamins, and the appetite stimulants that Reagan had been keeping her dosed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a month in, and there was a visible wideness to Uma's face, and a softness to her little brown tum. Her abs were slowly beginning to bulge instead of protrude. They were still visible, but they were <i>also</i> visibly soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall steps in the right direction and, if you asked Reagan, outwards was the right direction for Uma to start going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And in her defense</i>... she had left Uma with a pair of stretchy jeans. It wasn't Reagan's fault that Uma was picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep a lookout for them in the laundry, okay?\" Audrey offered with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of needed them tonight.\" Uma grunted, \"I guess I'll just cancel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched Uma walk back up the stairs, she tried not to look too conspicuous as she tried to hear for any telltale signs of heavy breathing. No doubt that Uma was still in better shape than literally anyone else in the house, even after almost a month of throwing back beers and faced with an appetite meant for carbo-loading, all on a lot less exercise than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, Reagan was just doing this by the seat of her pants. She didn't exactly know <i>what</i> to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the fact that fucking with Uma looked like there was still a <i>lot</i> of fun left in it...</span></div></div>",

Teach her a lesson in humility? Help her loosen up a little? Get back at her for a couple of especially self-absorbed comments? Teach her the true meaning of Christmas? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were certainly a lot of ways to describe exactly what Regan's new hobby was, but its title didn't change the fact that Reagan was having a ball working behind Uma's back to sabotage her volleyballer's physique. This had easily become one of her longest cons (aside from literally everyone in Phoebe's old high school job, who still gave \"Phoebe\" a discount here and there!) and it was easily the most labor-intensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, Audrey was always telling her to get a hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel had gaming, Phoebe had her social media, Audrey had... whatever it was that Audrey did throughout the day, and now, Reagan had fucking with Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma <i>used</i> to have working out, but it was beginning to become clear that she was out of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay there, Uma?\" Reagan blinked innocently from across their booth at the Lone Star, \"Your breathing is kinda... <i>labored</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, it is not.\" Uma sat back down, a full-chested sigh spreading her nostrils as she returned from the bathroom, \"I'm just a little... <i>sloshy</i> is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After four beers, I believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma rolled her eyes as she got situated back in her side of the booth. Her wider behind was only such by a small amount but had become visibly less toned now that constant exercise was off the table. Once her NordicTrack and treadmill were out of the picture, Uma's only source of exercise would be to jog around the block or to take the bus to the gym. Both of which were time-consuming, exhausting, and a little dirtier than an almost-professional like Uma really cared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan tried not to take Uma out to eat (or anyone) on general principle. She was cute, and she was one of two younger sisters and cousins, she shouldn't have to pay because she was Baby\u2122. But she especially hated taking Uma out to eat. Even before she was getting dosed with appetite stimulants, and her stomach getting stretched out with beer, that girl ate like a fucking horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had appetite stimulants and cheap vitamins to buy, dammit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, this wasn't the <i>worst</i> way to dip into her wallet. She and Uma <i>usually</i> got along, so the conversation was never really <i>dull</i>. If anything, they were happy to come together and dunk on other house members, free from Audrey's eternal tut-tutting of that kind of thing. Fellow troublemakers who liked to party, the two of them had a lot more in common than either of them really liked to think...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if anyone could have convinced Uma to have a fifth beer, it was Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, lemme ask you something...\" Uma lifted the heavy glass to take a swig, \"Promise you won't be all Wierd Aloof White Girl about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make no promises, but I'll try to take it seriously.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Good enough.\" Uma chuckled, \"It's like, a real question though. Like a girl to girl question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, we're two girls. It's a question. That doesn't leave us very many options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point.\" another sip, a little burp, both somehow suddenly more nervous than Uma liked to get, \"A-Anyway it's just, the past few weeks... you know, with my track breaking and my treadmill going out, I haven't been able to get in much exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or really any exercise, since you've only gone to the gym like three times.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've... put on some weight.\" Uma winced as soon as the words fell from her mouth, \"Lost some of my muscle definition, a little tone... I just wanted to know if you thought that it was noticeable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan smiled in a way that she <i>hoped</i> wasn't too Grinch-y.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so there are two things wrong with the other schools of thought, as listed previously in the chapter choices. And if you asked Reagan, they were pretty damning as far as both her plan, and her general taste for staying alive and un-assaulted by angry athletes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, if she told Uma the truth, Uma would probably have actually factually killed her. And if she didn't, she would have <i>at least</i> made Reagan drop two grand on new workout equipment to replace the ones that she had helped to \"mysteriously\" break down. Uma may have been out of practice, but Reagan knew that she couldn't outrun her even now. Reagan would effectively be signing her own death warrant with (as Lionel Hutz might have called it) The Truth (head-shake)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the problem with The Truth (head-nod) was that Uma wasn't stupid. This wasn't Phoebe that Reagan was pranking, who was dingier than a jingle bell, and it wasn't Audrey or Chel, who probably would have been too relieved to question Reagan's reassurance and might have chubbed up a bit more out of complacency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that ran the riskier course of action\u2014outright telling Uma that she'd put on some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meannnnnn...\" Reagan winced, \"You don't look <i>bad</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I knew it!</i>\" Uma fell back into her booth dramatically, taking her arms off of the table and pushing away her plate of half-finished tacos, \"I knew that it was noticeable. Audrey tried to tell me that I looked fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>do</i> look fine though!\" Reagan (in a mild moment of panic) answered quickly, \"You're still in better shape than... well, pretty much anyone else that I know personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands found their way back to the table, her fingers wrapped around the handle on the Lone Star beer mug. She took a big frothy gulp and wiped away the head mustache. Her other hand lifted and fell to her stomach. Softer and squishier than ever, and full of a lunch's worth of beer and tacos on top of that, there was some definite roundness to it now. During the brief glimpses of belly that Reagan had snuck, it was getting harder and harder to see any definition on Uma's abdominals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I feel gross.\" Uma scrunched her nose, \"Like one of those washed-up, coulda-been-contenders that make the bleachers squeak beneath them when they buy a ticket to go relive the glory days in the audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, okay, that's a description.\" Reagan laughed, \"But Uma, you're <i>fine</i>. It's a little pudge. Who cares?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me.\" Uma paused, \"Ugh, I need to get back to the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better yet, I need to get a new set of exercise equipment.\" Uma continued to think aloud, \"Or at least someone who'll go work out with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap crap crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was falling apart, right in front of her. Reagan had to find a way to salvage this plot fast, or else Uma would start trying to slim down. It'd be harder, with the appetite stimulants and the cheap vitamins, but how long until she was back to having a flat tummy, washboard abs, and a (mostly) undeserved sense of self-satisfaction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Reagan, to whom Socratic tendencies for Gadflyishness came naturally, there seemed to be only one solution...</span></div></div>",

She was, after all, a finely trained athlete. If things had gone a different way (read: if she'd had been able to control her appetite for booze and partying) she'd have been training for the Olympics within the season. She was college-educated, driven, and (not to sound too high and mighty) thought herself <i>way</i> too overqualified to be slinging orders in a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that your girl is gonna put on one of those stupid cowboy hats, then you're officially the dumb twin.\" Uma laughed, \"That's just about the stupidest thing that I've heard all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, the pay's supposed to be pretty good.\" Reagan offered an open palm to gesture to one of the (surprisingly curvaceous) waitresses, \"Audrey and her friend Nat come here all the time, and they've been talking me up to some of the waitresses. They <i>really</i> want me to get a job here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr anywhere. But that was beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you work here then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm still <i>in college</i>.\" Reagan retorted snottily, \"I go to classes every day. When would I even have time for a job? But <i>you</i>, you'd make a great waitress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be the only black waitress here.\" Uma cocked her eyebrow, \"Considering that this place is themed after the biggest red state, I don't like my\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, Alaska is the biggest red state, and two it's based on <i>Texas</i>, not South Carolina.\" Reagan snorted, \"If anyone couldn't get a job here, it'd be Chel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time, in the ensuing small argument regarding the merits of working here, that they attracted the attention of the surprisingly curvaceous waitress from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help but eavesdrop...\" she held out her hands defensively, a smile on her lips as she approached cautiously, \"But are y'all talking about our Help Wanted sign over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She's</i> talking about it.\" Uma stuck a finger towards Reagan, \"I'm trying to finish my beer and eat my tacos in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another life, that might have been the end of it. Uma would have belligerently sulked into her meal, angry that none of the jobs that she wanted were available while Reagan slowly lost interest in her little project. But as the Kate the waitress listed off all of the perks that came with employment, even Uma couldn't help but be just a little won over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a great atmosphere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great money, lots of big tippers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Discount on food, one free entree and a side for lunch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a great deal. Reagan almost thought about taking the job herself, before she realized that would have meant some actual <i>work</i>. They were looking for waitstaff with more availability anyway. Reagan might not have been a good fit, but <i>Uma</i>, who did nothing all day except drink beer and not exercise, didn't have as many excuses (or the capacity) to be as picky as her pert-bootied roommate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Uma frowned, \"...I still don't have a car. How would I even get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know if Audrey found out that you had a job, she'd gladly drive you to it every night of the week if she had to.\" Reagan argued, \"After all the pushing she's done\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's been pretty clear that I need to start helping out...\" Uma sighed, \"...I guess this job doesn't have to be <i>forever</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand it'll give you enough money to save up for a new home gym.\" Reagan tacked on helpfully, \"Honestly, I think that you should do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\" Kate tittered, \"A good looking girl like you would get lots of tips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma chewed her bottom lip contemplatively...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Lone Star Tavern and grill, a party of three?\" Uma's face fell suddenly as she recognized the patrons that had walked through the front door, \"Oh fuck, it's you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week after her interview, and Uma was officially a waitress at the Lone Star Tavern. Crammed into some not-quite cowboy boots and wearing a matching hat over her braids, even she had to know that she looked a little silly. Her skirt had been the only thing in her closet that didn't have elastic in it, and her soft tum was already starting to cut into the waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Audrey, Phoebe, and especially Reagan were happy to see her in uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gawd you look so cute!\" Pheobe squeaked, \"I've never seen you in a hat before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I hate hats.\" Uma answered in a low voice so as not to let the other waitresses hear her, \"But I love this paycheck, and the food's not half bad either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's why we come here.\" Reagan interjected slyly, \"That and that our favorite waitress works here~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Rae.\" Uma gave the bodacious redhead a good-natured smack on the back of her head with the menus, \"What can I get you guys started with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she hadn't known it at the time, Reagan's suggestion that Uma get a job had been <i>way</i> more detrimental towards getting her to put on weight than even the most conniving Durant could have ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer simply laying around the house, soaking up booze and snacking intermittently whenever she got just a bit too bored, Uma was now regularly surrounded by temptation in its most delicious form\u2014greasy bar food in huge portions. Now she was eating less frequently, but to a higher capacity. Reagan didn't think that she walked away from many lunch periods at that place without feeling stuffed, given the artery-clogging serving sizes. Not only that, her off-the-clock employee discount meant that the Lone Star Tavern had become a more viable option for the takeout menu. Any time they were out, Reagan always suggested that they stop and eat at Uma's job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps most importantly, Uma came home <i>tired</i>. Waitressing was a hard job, and her boots were uncomfortable. When their statuesque roommate came home late at night, she clip-clopped to the couch, plopped down, and (usually) shovelled down some leftovers before heading straight to bed. If she didn't come home too late, she'd even get a beer or two in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, since Reagan wasn't <i>about</i> to stop slipping her appetite stimulants or off-brand vitamins to help coach her slow creep outwards, she couldn't help but think that her hard work was going to start paying off in a <i>big</i> way...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lifestyle trends at 8422 Fordham Ave had definitely shifted over the past few months. Some of it wrought by Reagan's machinations with causing Uma to gain weight, but that had cascaded in ways the scheming twin had not originally anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she not been the original standout in the initial worrying about weight that demanded that Uma be taken down a peg (her own opinion), Reagan might have been worried about the amount of times she had taken Uma out to eat. That could, and had, easily backfired on her for being around an increased source of calories and alcohol. And Reagan was not one for gyms or consistent workouts before this whole affair had started. Her intense focus to messing up Uma's weight and diet meant the rambunctious redhead was less aware of the times she had taken her own share of snacks from the list of Uma's temptations, or how she added an extra beer or two on nights out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just Reagan chubbing up in the collateral damage either. Her shenanigans with promising to shop for groceries more regularly had left the townhouse pantry packed with the less than healthy alternatives to many favorite foodstuffs. Extra processed and artificial flavors outnumbered the prior attempts by Audrey and Ixchel to eat more organic. Chipped beef, pizza and chicken enchilada hot pockets had become a microwave lunch favorite at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for three of the residents being post college aged, the average vittles would match that of your typical lower credits dorm floor. Reagan &amp; Phoebe had avoided the Freshmen Fifteen mainly by residing with family with a short commute to the campus. Now that college staple, almost a right of passage, was starting to catch up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Uma's new job brought about plenty of easy excuses to eat out. The Tex-Mex menu had plenty of variety, including a set of strange experimental specials created by one of the cooks: cowboy spaghetti, five-alarm chili pizza, and tater-twisted sausages 'n' beans to name a few. Even Ixchel, normally picky about keeping to the fundamentals of Mexican cuisine before highbrow variations, was taken with the takeout options. At minimum, the Fordham ladies were eating there twice a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, the pounds were starting to creep up on not just Uma...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd, Fredrickson is such a pain.\" Reagan tumbled into the townhouse after a long day of classes. At midterm she was required to have mandatory advisory meetings and the head of Reagan's program was an utter bore, prone to long-winded speeches about precision and repetition in lab hours. It didn't help that Reagan had been fighting a wedgie all day, and the walk from the bus had only caused her underwear to ride up even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you just stay out?\" she cursed, turning to pitch her fingers on the wayward fabric of her leggings. Then Reagan caught sight of her reflection in the hall mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daymm...\" It had been awhile since she had seen her booty looking that extra juicy. She gave it a little pat, watching it wobble in the mirror. Of course, being in proximity to Uma's ascent to higher weights left Reagan with her own source of calories to soak up. And for the Durant twins, their pert rears were their post-puberty sponges for sub-dermal fat. Besides being rounder in the backside, Reagan's thighs looked thicker, starting to lose what little thigh gap she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could do without this...\" Reagan fussed over her appearance, noticing some jiggle in her shoulders and upper arms. Still, even if she had put on a few pounds, she was wearing it <i>fiiiiine...</i> Yet another way to stick it to Uma. The irony had not been lost on the household that the twins were the pair with the fine phat booties moreso than the black chick of the group, as the previously toned Uma didn't have those sorts of curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the other phat booty of the equation; on cue following Reagan's Thursday schedule, Phoebe showed up from her own classes just as tired as Reagan felt. \"Ugh...I'm thirsty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan got a full look of her twin. As expected, Phoebe's hips were looking wider than usual. The ditzy redhead dressed oblivious to her increased poundage with her hair tied up in a scarf, with a dark halter top showing some doughy midriff over her hip hugging teal skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Phebes, whats with you?\" The judgement passed in Reagan's head that she was Certified Three-C's Thiccc in her tank top and booty popping leggings (continued wedgie aside), while Phoebe was looking the wrong side of puffy by showcasing her hint of a belly roll with a revealing top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this big dance number for the spring musical,\" Phoebe heaved, downing herself an orange gatorade, \"And Mz Michaels is a taskmaster!\" The drink was followed up by a yogurt cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching sight of the bottle, Reagan suddenly wondered if that was one of the ones she'd spiked with stimulants for Uma. \"Aren't you, um,\" she caught herself, \"worried about those probiotics. Ya know, like Uma warned you against.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, this one has gummy fruit on the bottom,\" Phoebe replied, before giving a shushing gesture to her twin. \"And if you ask me, Uma's not the best source of diet advice right now given how she's looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo...\" Reagan feigned surprise. Phoebe could be such a twit it was almost cute, badmouthing Uma's weight when not realizing her own gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now girls, she's just in a rough patch until she earns enough money for her new home gym.\" Audrey chided as she came up with laundry. Dressed with the closet rejects as other clothing was washed, Audrey had her unused yoga pants mixed with a stretched out character tee from when the Durants had gone to Disneyland when they were all teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, check out the Piglet!\" Reagan pounced on the easy joke. \"Pooh's looking pretty faded too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Audrey retorted, as Phoebe followed up with a giggle. It was too easy to tease their older sister for her big boned frame most of her life. It could be said that some of the teasing stemmed that while the twins had killer rears, Audrey had larger breasts. Well, larger breasts and stomach most of her adult years. Although Winnie the Pooh and Piglet had extra cracks along the screen printing where Audrey's hefty bosom forced more space out of the old shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down the basket to fold clothes, Audrey told them they needed to be supportive for Uma. \"Honestly, I haven't seen her this listless than the time she tore her ACL sophomore year. It sidelined her sporting ambitions but she worked even harder Junior year when she recovered. So there's a silver lining if she keeps her focus on getting back to her home gym setup. At least she's providing towards rent now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Reagan hadn't heard that story before. It made her wonder if Uma had a fat period in her sophomore year as well...wait, hanging out with Uma while prodding her down the path to Chunky Town was funny now, but why would Reagan be caring how things were then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chel, I've got your skirts here.\" Audrey called out to the owner of a folded laundry pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from her office on the landing above the living room, Ixchel gave thanks as she walked down the stairs. Whoa. If the Durant sisters were adding inches to their respective assets of butt and breasts, Ixchel was becoming a major contender in the belly department. The multi-ethnic programmer with her Mexican, Korean and a dash of Caucasian features was a real woman with real curves, all curves most of her life. Some in the Park-related clans were predisposed to being overweight, last Reagan had met any of them, and Chel was right in plumper territory with a fuller looking stomach causing puckering on her stripped shirt like she was smuggling a pool inflatable. Clearly, having a sedentary programming job and video game hobby left little activity for the portly nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for former Miss Fitness herself, as the telltale clop of her horrid boots announced her passing, there was Uma's extra padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this, a shindig?\" Uma asked, the overlap of schedules seeing her off to work as all of the other housemates were assembled. Reagan was doing her best to hide her snickers and absolute feeling of triumph. Gone was Uma's chiseled, well-defined musculature as her fat cells acquired over the last few months padded out her skin. Lone Star had a number of curvy waitresses, even all-brawny Uma might have faired well before her gain. Perhaps, only a dozen or so pounds into Reagan's sabotage, with a bit of meat to make her more voluptuous and give Uma something of an hourglass look, she would have been smoking hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot was not what Uma was feeling. She was becoming a full porker now, chunky around her middle, backside and legs. The low-cut cowgirl uniforms, truthfully kind of slutty looking if you thought about it, did no favors for the former athlete starting to feel like tidbits pressed into a sausage casing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, champ!\" Audrey did her best (read: worst) method of support for her old college bestie. \"How about we all chip in for that new treadmill.\" Her coy way of suggesting the household eat at Lone Star tonight to give Uma some business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Uma sighed, but she needed the money. \"You may as well get your kicks in tonight, I guess. They're redoing the house floor next week so the bar will be closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Phoebe half-sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitchen'll still be open for takeout,\" Uma replied. The small mercy to feeling like crap since she started putting on pounds was that everyone else looked to be not minding their weight either. \"Someone want to get me some power juice for the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly,\" Reagan offered, considering the results of her schemes to be beyond her expectations as she fished for one of the 'specially' laced gatorades in the fridge, in that gross grape flavor only Uma drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes indeed, the whole household was starting to plump up. Some more than others, it turned out.</span></div></div>",

An assault from the back and the front, Reagan's fat ass was already becoming too much for even her <i>newest</i> pairs of jeans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" she said out loud, trying to ignore the horrendous muffin top looking back at her in the mirror, \"Still fits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said it like it was a major accomplishment. Like squeezing into a pair of jeans that she'd bought less than a month ago was something that she should have been proud of. And if she didn't look at where her zipper had already been pulled apart from where she'd fastened it, or how badly she was muffin topping, everything was a-okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little relax, a little slouch, look natural, aaaaand\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled <i>snap!</i> as the button ripped out of the denim. Her pale potbelly forced the flaps apart, pinched in the zipper as it bulged recklessly into its proper place. Reagan sighed angrily as she threw herself back onto the spread of her bed. Her tummy domed out to about nose-height as she surrendered against her own personal battle of the bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Godammit.\" she groaned, \"Not another pair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan <i>knew</i> what the issue was. She wasn't dumb. Hanging out with Uma all the time, eating from the Lone Star like four nights a week, not exercising or taking advantage of the school's on-campus gym, was it any wonder that she'd traded the ph in her phat ass for an f?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that, was it any wonder that she didn't have a single pair of pants in her closet that still fit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wide-bottomed redhead had spent the past few weeks watching herself expand, cautiously avoiding her reflection so as not to face the reality of her own expanding waistline in her efforts to keep enabling Uma's. It was so much easier to focus on someone <i>else</i> getting fat than it was for her to deal with the fact that she herself wasn't immune to the phenomenon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing off the bed, she took herself back to the mirror for another cursory glance, still hoping to find herself mistaken about any added poundage. But unfortunately, a rounder face and thicker appendages were all that she could see in the mirror. Besides, of course, her budding belly and her pocket-popping peach. That ass was getting <i>wide</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she was well aware of the irony to be found in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she didn't find it very amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Because <i>that was her ass on the line in the most literal sense of the phrase possible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much as she was angry with herself for having eaten herself out of every pair of jeans, Reagan had a more important problem to handle\u2014what the hell she was supposed to wear tonight...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now, for a girl as lazy as Reagan, the initial response to this predicament had been to throw on a pair of leggings and call it a night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after having spent so long fucking with Uma, and with her own weight now on the rise, Reagan was much more against settling for the easy way out on this matter. To do so may as well have been tantamount to signing over her figure right then and there. <i>Then</i> where would she be? Wearing sweatpants to the club? No thank you. Reagan wasn't about to let herself go to Fatsville, at least not without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere <i>had</i> to be a pair of jeans that she could squeeze into somewhere in this stupid house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe differences in everyone's general shape made this a bit more difficult than it ought to have been. In a perfect world, Audrey might have been more bottom-heavy like her sisters (but then, in a perfect world, Reagan wouldn't be in this situation in the first place!) and she could have spotted her a set of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was <i>unfortunately</i> skinnier than Reagan. As identical as they were, they unfortunately didn't share a waist size anymore. And to try squeezing into one of her twin's jeans would have been... well... embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Uma was at work, that left only one other option...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> want to borrow <i>my</i> jeans?\" Chel snorted, \"What the fuck, Rae, do you think you'll fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken Reagan a fraction of a second to realize that her cousin wasn't mocking her for her weight gain, but was rather taking shots at her own chubby hips and blubbery belly. The homicide in Reagan's eyes faded when she'd realized this, but she hadn't unclenched her fists yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that I've still got an older pair around here...\" Chel made a face as she pushed away from her desk, \"You know, for motivation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel had handed her cousin a pair of black boot cut Levi's, well-worn and broken in. It had dawned on Reagan that her cousin had been a fair bit more thick around the bottom half than anyone had given her credit for. Those Mexican genes had done well to give Chel a padded rear end and an ample chest, albeit at the cost of a perpetually soft tummy. A tummy that, as she crested north of two hundred pounds, only looked to be getting bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grew out of these?\" Reagan asked with some surprise, \"I saw you wearing them, like, a month ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...\" Chel's lips tugged to the side as she gave her hoodie-covered tummy a slap, \"...what can I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that.\" Reagan laughed weakly, \"Happens to the best of us, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you.\" Chel stuck out her tongue, \"Why don't you try 'em on? Make sure that they fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel had the biggest closet in the house. Which was awkward, and a little infuriating to the more fashion-conscious housemates like Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a big, walk-in affair that made Reagan grumble in jealousy every time that she set foot inside of it. She and Phoebe could have made so much better use of this space, and Chel could have split their rooms into a bedroom and office. If they had moved in first, you could bet your bottom dollar that this closet would have been split down the middle between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel didn't even <i>have</i> that many clothes! She was one of those people who liked to dress \"comfortably\". Just a bunch of wide-cut jeans and baggy tops. Sure there were <i>some</i> cute things in here, but even in her time of duress, it was all Reagan could think about that the least fashionable member of the family got the most space to store her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes like the jeans she was getting ready to try on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, what a bad night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Reagan closed her eyes and took a sharp inhale, \"Let's do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan slipped her feet through the holes and pulled the boot-cut sleeves over her legs. Taking either hand and pulling up on the belt loops, Reagan conformed the faded black denim to the contours of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the button between her forefinger and thumb, Reagan closed her eyes and prayed silently that Chel's pants would fit...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the moment of truth, as Reagan fumbled to button her cousin's black denim Levi's. She held her breath. The button closed she exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat...wasn't totally uncomfortable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yes!\" Reagan cheered. She tested the give and space of the fabric as she glanced at the affect of the borrowed jeans on her booty. She'd be lying to herself in saying they were a <i>perfect</i> fit; Reagan's bouncy booty was wider than Chel's by a considerable margin so the fit was more taunt than she would have preferred. The jeans originally being purchased for a chunky, tubby-tummied plus size like Chel (well, before she had gained more than a few pounds) gave just enough slack for Reagan's predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, Reagan had a slight tummy and her great wobbly buttocks, which stretched out the give from the other side, as on Chel the jeans <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">were</span> had been roomy for her belly flab and relatively smaller rear. The conservative mindset would have used the barely fitting inherited jeans as a wake up call to not chub up even further. That was currently the farthest thought from Reagan's mind as she was ecstatic for having fitting jeans so her big night wouldn't be ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a ton Chel,\" Reagan stepped out to model in front of her cousin. \"I think it makes my booty pop. Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, cuz. You look fab.\" Ixchel didn't have the same concerns about fashion that the twins did, but at least she was happy with the exchange. Drumming her fingers along the troublesome belly within her hoodie, Chel bit her lip from the regret of having outgrown the jeans, Yeah, Reagan was getting fat too, but she had the attention demanding phat booty that would put a hip-hop backup dancer to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her elation from a decent pair of jeans subsided, Reagan noticed the shift in her cousin's mood. \"Tell you what, Chel, you did me a solid.\" She left to retrieve her wasted jeans from her room, taking a turn at her mirror as she did so. Reagan had a different shirt to hide her belly but Chel's old jeans ended up being a solid replacement. It was pretty cool of her cousin to loan her these jeans, and Chel was rarely one of the housemates to drive Reagan crazy. The two had vastly different interests but keeping chill was a plus in Reagan's book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Regan offered a stack of outgrown jeans. This also distanced the outgrown jeans from Reagan's concerns about getting too bootilicous. \"Seems like it's only fair I trade you some of my old jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks I suppose?\" Ixchel didn't sound too sure on the idea. \"Remember how you're wearing the jeans I outgrew a month ago? What makes you so sure I'll fit into yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it!\" Reagan offered. \"I'd rather see if you fit into them than have Phoebe dress like me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel took a proffered pair of pants, stepping into her closet in turn. She supposed Reagan was trying to be nice but Chel had always hated clothes shopping. What with three siblings, a step-brother, and dozens of cousins plus growing up as a chubby kid, she'd had plenty of childhood embarrassments being pinched into new clothes or not fitting in hand-me downs for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan's claim on swapping pants was a tad optimistic it turned out. In the privacy of her closet, Ixchel fondled the roll of her protruding belly. \"Well, I suppose they fit provided I button them under my stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, loaners for you to borrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least her hoodie was baggy enough to make her belly hang not as obvious. Ixchel considered the other offerings. \"Did you seriously pop the buttons on most of these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what,\" Reagan avoided the topic. \"You can sew 'em back on. Actually, I had three duplicates of these bitches.\" Reagan looked to her acid wash, faded blue denims that would nearly white. Chel had a passing knowledge on practical sewing among her many talents, having altered clothes for some of the residents in the past. \"Couldn't you like, make a larger pair for yourself out of two of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel had a thoughtful look. \"That might work...thanks Reagan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Reagan continued with her oddly found generosity with her cousin. \"Because you're hitting the town with me tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chel dropped the jeans she was measuring. \"Clubbing? Thanks but no thanks, Regan, that's not my scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Reagan ribbed her. \"When's the last time you met anybody new? Or had a date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really none of your business,\" Chel replied, betrayed by her scrunchy face that hinted at another self-depreciating pity party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the challenge of dragging the most introverted house mate into the night life scene. \"Ya know, Chel, you've got this whole nerdy chic thing going on that's really popular right now. And the brains and humor to back it up. There's gotta be somebody lucky to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel remained unconvinced, however her silence suggested she was thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, we'll go to Prime Play instead,\" Reagan suggested. Compared to the horrid kiddie grounds of Chuck-E-Cheese or family appealing Dave &amp; Buster's, Prime Play was a nightclub with a dedicated arcade. Given the age limit for the bar and dance floor, there wouldn't be any kids around the joint. Perfect for the resurgence of adult targeting games like House of the Dead or Time Crisis and staples like b-ball hoops and fooseball. Plus they had decent snacks, another temptation towards Ixchel's favorites along with the video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've got pool,\" Reagan played her trump card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel finally made up her mind. \"Okay. You're going down.\" While not a pool shark, Ixchel's analytical, mathematical mind made her a whizz at playing the angles for her favorite parlor game. That there was no space to fit one in the townhouse with sacrificing half of the den space was one of the drawbacks of living at 8422 Fordham Ave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Reagan said, ready to party. Come to think of it heading to Prime Play might help with her primary scheme that had landed her in this mess.</span></div></div>",

Which would have meant either Reagan or Chel (or both) would have had to not drink anything alcoholic for the first few hours of their night out, which was <i>always</i> a bummer. Then Reagan would have had to make sure that Uma didn't burn too many calories or get any ideas at trying some of the more athletic games, she'd have to do her best to keep her munching down arcade food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt honestly just seemed like a lot of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Reagan, in her own narcissistic worldview, had felt that she'd earned a night off. Not just because she had been doing the whole college thing, or even because of all the effort she'd been putting into fucking with Uma, but mostly because she was still riding high on the fact that she had found a pretty cute pair of pants to squeeze into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she and her cousin headed out for a night at the arcade for a good old fashioned night of booze, bar food, and awkwardly hitting on dudes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while they were out having a blast, Uma had to hitch a ride home with Phoebe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it had been one <i>hell</i> of a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma had said it about a billion times just on the car ride back home, but it had yet to feel like it was making any difference. Coming home in her clonking cowboy boots, spilling out of her uniform and ripping off that stupid hat, anyone could have seen that she had been through the night from hell. Her red blouse and blue waist apron were stained with barbecue sauce, she was sticky to the touch from <i>something</i> that she couldn't quite remember the origin of. All of that was typical waitress/hostessing. But most humiliatingly, the clasp on her skirt had busted... <i>again</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma had been trying to stay away from the scale, in the spirit of not judging herself too harshly for falling off of the fitness wagon (at Audrey's suggestion), but that had only made this morning's peek at the needle more unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hundred and eight pounds\u2014about <i>fifty</i> more than her playing weight, and all of it pizza dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles were soft, her feet ached every night, and she was out of breath after so much as climbing the stairs. She'd never been this out of shape\u2014not even when she'd torn her ACL back when she was in college! Physical Therapy hadn't been as difficult as squeezing into yet another uniform and dealing with chafing thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, people were supposed to <i>tell</i> other people when they had their belly hanging out! She must have looked like such a fatass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was times like this that Uma liked to dive headfirst into a cold beer. And dive she did. But the leftovers on the counter stayed there. She wasn't about to let that meatloaf sandwich and order of potato wedges get a foothold on what was already a big, fat belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say again.\" Uma said a little more loudly as she clip-clopped oer to the couch, \"<i>Fuck</i> my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... you said that like a hundred times on the way over here.\" Phoebe said with an expected airheadedness, \"I mean, between the other things that you said on the way over here... which were also kinda FML-y.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, I still feel like shit.\" Uma said sternly with a swig of her longneck, \"Still a fat piece of shit with no car, no <i>real</i> job, and no embarrassing uniform that fits over my big fat gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma unbuttoned the bottom two clasps on her blouse, already pulled apart by the sheer size of Uma on a still-full stomach. Her brown belly oozed forward, blowing back up to its true naked size. Struggling to bend over past her belly to kick off her boots, Uma finally resurfaced over the couch, flush and absolutely ready to pop off at the next minor irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally, this was Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna talk about it, Umes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do <i>not</i> call me Umes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, um... do you want to talk about it?\" Phoebe paused, \"Umie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma groaned and threw her head back over the couch.</span></div></div>",

Or maybe even opened up the ice cream for a feel-good bowl of the good stuff. Even now, there was a little voice in the back of her mind telling her that the real source of her issue was her weight; one that grew louder and louder with every popped button, ripped skirt and busted seam. But it was so <i>hard</i> to work out and eat right with her job, and not having any money, and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Talking</i> to people was never Uma's strong suit. Making fun of them, outrunning them, and beating them in volleyball-slash-drinking contests. Those were things that Uma was good at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something about Phoebe's big, innocent eyes made her feel like she could open up to the vapid redhead. If nothing else, it would have gone in one ear and out the other, and she would have still gotten it off of her chest. And at best, maybe Phoebe had some advice? Some words of wisdom to help\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so Uma was doubtful about that last part. But a confessional certainly felt like what she needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to be a bitch, Feebs.\" Uma sighed, \"I'm just... sad, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About your job?\" Phoebe asked with a concerned crease in her eyebrows, \"I thought you liked working there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't.\" Uma took a swig of beer, \"But the pay's good, and the food is good, and I like the other girls working there... shit, maybe I <i>do</i> like it there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've been cussing your job since you got home.\" Phoebe scooched closer to her roommate, \"Was it just, like, a hard day or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Yes.\" Uma rolled her eyes, \"Yes but no.

This was going to be harder to admit out loud than she really expected it to be. For someone like her, who had put so much value in her athletic abilities for so long, saying the dreaded \"F\" word might as well have been admitting to committing a felony. \"Uma\" and \"fat\" didn't belong in the same sentence. But here they were, crammed into the same uniform, and almost nothing else in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig-bellied, chunky thighed, chubby-faced with lunch lady arms? Uma wasn't just thicc anymore, and there was no use denying it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've put on like, fifty pounds in the past six months.\" Uma's voice wavered, \"And... I guess I'm just taking it a little hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Phoebe said, \"That's a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of popping her roommate like a redheaded zit, Uma just laughed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it is.\" she chuckled, wiping away a tear that had rolled down her cheek, \"And, you know, I just feel <i>gross</i> about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... I kind of get it.\" Phoebe blinked innocently, \"I've, like, finally put on the Freshman Fifteen this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't tell.\" Uma snorted, \"That booty is still all anyone pays attention to anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that's what <i>I'm</i> saying.\" Phoebe said proudly, \"Like, okay, my followers on social media have been going nuts about my butt. It's really (what's the word?) empowering!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great for you, Pheebs.\" Uma forced a smile as she jiggled her fat brown belly, \"But I don't see how it helps me any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but like hear me out.\" Phoebe hunkered closer with an excited look on her face, \"You just, like, <i>be happy</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dull silence immediately filled the space between the two roommates just as it had the space between Phoebe's ears. The phat rumped redhead still wore a vaguely proud, prophetic look on her face. Like she'd said something entirely too profound for anyone else to understand. Like she'd just made <i>too much sense</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Uma cocked an eyebrow, \"And... how do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, like, think about this...\" Phoebe clicked her tongue contemplatively, \"Do you <i>like</i> working out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well yeah.\" Uma scrunched her face up and put her beer down, \"I used to do it all the time so that I could stay in shape and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no.

Her knowledge of biology and muscle groups, how best to build mass and cut fat, hadn't come from studying. Reading about it back in college when she was getting her degree had made her absolutely bored to tears. And getting on again after a big drop off was always the hardest thing in the world because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmaybe her heart wasn't in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess not.\" Uma managed, visibly stunned to anyone but Phoebe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it's okay, nobody does.\" Phoebe joked, \"But now you know that you don't like working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight, that put so many things in perspective for her. Why she'd never been able to buckle down and adhere to her volleyball coach's workout routine. Why she'd had such a hard time coming back from her torn ACL. Why she'd thought about quitting <i>way back then!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolleyball had just become an identity to her\u2014her coaches had told her all growing up that she was a showboat. That positive reinforcement had just taught her to love the game and seek out the attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she hated working out, why was she saving for a home gym instead of a car? Why did she pay for a gym membership every month?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this part's easy.\" Phoebe smiled eagerly as she shifted towards Uma, \"What <i>do</i> you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose answers didn't take nearly as much introspection on Uma's part. She liked parties. She liked booze. She liked to lay around and do nothing. She liked <i>food</i>. Uma had been well-acquainted with the many things that had brought her joy in her life, never realizing how at odds they seemed with the thing that she was \"supposed\" to be good at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... the same things that got me fat in the first place.\" Uma joked, \"That doesn't really help my problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, all I'm saying is that you'll be a lot happier if you just focus on the things that you <i>do</i> like, rather than the things that you <i>don't</i>.\" Phoebe said in a rather oversimplified way, \"So, you know... stop beating yourself up for doing stuff that other people have made you do. And start doing what you want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma sat back and thought about it. Really, really thought about it. And sure, that didn't help her with her weight problem. But hearing all of that out loud, realizing that she had been going through the motions until a few months ago, and that she'd wasted all that time on a hobby that she didn't even really <i>like</i>... it was intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have no idea why everyone thinks you're the dumb sister.\" Uma said, shock and amusement evident on her face, \"You're pretty deep when you want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm not the dumb sister.\" Phoebe scoffed, \"I'm Pheobe. Phoeeeeebeeeee. Reagan's out with Chell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma smiled tightly, suddenly reminded why everyone called her the dumb sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, you wanna sit down and watch some Hulu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Phoebe chirped, \"You want another beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Uma thought about it for a moment. She had walked through the front door absolutely fried, worrying about her weight, and analyzing every calorie she'd had throughout the day. Her first one had just been to help cope with the day, but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love one.\" Uma said, leaning back into the couch, \"Thank you Phoebe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking her feet up on the coffee table (What? Audrey wasn't gonna see) and twisting off the cap, Uma laid one hand flat on her belly while the other nursed her bottle. There was just one thing that could make her feel more at home with herself right about now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, you mind grabbing my leftovers on the counter\u2014I think I, uh... changed my mind.\"</span></div></div>",

And even though Reagan had a surprising capacity for both, even she had begun to lose sight of it all towards the end. Though she'd never officially called it off, Reagan just sort of stopped <i>actively</i> messing with Uma's fitness regime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that much of one existed anymore. She'd stopped taking her vitamins, and she didn't drink any stupid protein shakes anymore, so Reagan couldn't slip her appetite stimulants. Plus, all that shit was expensive, and it took way too much time and sneaking around, and... just <i>ugh</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, Reagan was a very, <i>very</i> lazy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Uma was doing a great job at making herself fat these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't to say that Reagan didn't actively <i>enjoy</i> seeing her former fitness-oriented roommate blow up belly-first like a big brown beach ball, taking rich and sadistic glee in hearing her heavy footsteps or complain about various parts of her life that were different now that she was officially chunked up. It was just that, well... Reagan had far more important things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she could save some money every month, sleep in later, and not have to waste all that time and energy sneaking around Uma's space. Uma's exercise equipment would stay dead and buried, Uma had gotten/would continue getting fat... honestly, the fact that she'd hung on this long was something of a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she'd have to find something else to distract her from her studies\u2014not that those were in short supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging out to <i>bug</i> Uma at her job was still a tasty appetizer in the life of Reagan. The food was good, she and her roommate still got along great (despite Reagan being the puppetmaster behind her ascension to full blown chunker territory) and Uma always slipped her a little extra for free where she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say that she <i>needed</i> any extra. With her and Chel hanging out more regularly, going to some of the other places that her gastronomy-fixated cousin liked outside of Uma's place of work (though, yes, often Uma's place of work) Reagan hardly ever ate at home. And when she did, it was almost always takeout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Uma was the only one who ever bitched about how much they ate out all the time\u2014and those days were <i>long</i> gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no one to reign in her capacity for laziness and excess, it was no wonder that Reagan's days squeezing into Chel's pants were numbered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, <i>everyone</i> in the house seemed to be putting on weight. It wasn't like Reagan had anyone to bug her about losing any now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have this perfectly under control.\" Reagan had said one day to herself, basking in the glory of the takeout smorgasbord spearheaded by Chel and Uma, \"Totally... under...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unclasped the buttons on another one of Chel's old pairs of jeans. Her fat white belly dropped, sloshing comfortably into place as it nestled between her denim-painted thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ahhh</i>... control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Free Range Reagan\u2014<b><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">With the sole good dietary influence of the household gone, it's no surprise that weights are still rising on Fordham Avenue.... but none quite as quickly as Reagan Durant's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Uma and and Chel, Reagan's life has never been tastier! Or lazier, for that matter. Having developed a nasty habit of borrowing old clothes from Ixchel as she outgrows them (and as Reagan outgrows her own!) helps ease her into a soft state of denial about her growing waistline. Meanwhile, Uma is <i>way</i> more fun now that she's fat. She and Reagan have almost nightly drinks on the couch as Uma figures out her new role as the House's resident couch potato, almost always over something tasty. No matter <i>how much</i> she ate, Reagan could never in a million years catch up with Uma, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Reagan doesn't worry\u2014why should she?\u2014until she realizes that she can't fit into anything that Ixchel <i>just bought</i>.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Free Choice/Edit Later</b></b></b></span></div></div>",

Due to the difference in builds between them, Chel's dedicated tummy room in every pair of jeans became Reagan's rump room. Elastic waistbands and stretchy fabrics meant that the cousins could share clothing in a way that meant Reagan didn't have to sacrifice her own fashion\u2014she'd even started \"borrowing\" a few of Chel's tops here and there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she aware that she had been putting on weight? Sure she was! Was she aware that she was <i>still</i> putting on weight? Tentatively! Reagan just didn't like to think about the fact that she was outgrowing clothes left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But in her defense</i>, these <i>were</i> hand-me-downs. There was no telling how much elasticity had been lost during the transfer of ownership. In Reagan's mind, a steady firewall of excuses helped built their way into an unhealthy amount of denial about her spreading rear end, even as she (and the rest of her!) continued to get bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chel, you think I could borrow those leggings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you could fuck a girl up with a number 5 plate with some mozzarella sticks? Thx Umy~:heart:\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where we headed tonight, Chel? Don't say Korean Barbecue\u2014I'm gonna bulgogi right out of these old jeans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand bigger still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chel, you think I could borrow another pair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith foodie Chel taking her to restaurants instead of clubs, double-wide Uma getting <i>way</i> too acquainted with the Lone Star Tavern's menu, and Audrey and Phoebe just plain not interested in confronting Reagan about her weight for their various reasons of their own, Reagan's appetite was running unabated. Despite her middling (at best) attempts to reign herself in, there was almost no stall in her rapid rate of growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was eating herself round with remarkable proficiency! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it all finally came to a head when, in an attempt to sneak one past her cousin, she had snuck into Chel's closet to snatch up a cute pair of pants that she had paraded around in just two days ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, they were cute! And Reagan was tired of wearing leggings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't like Chel was going to be fitting into them for long anyway. Chel was getting roly-polier than ever thanks to all the eating out she did. Having to buy new clothes every month because you kept putting on weight? Like who <i>does</i> that? Really, Reagan was doing her a favor! Just because chunky Chel couldn't control herself, it didn't meant that good jeans should go to waste\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hrrng!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan grunted as she struggled to fasten the flaps over the bulge of her belly. Not so much hammocked into the roomy denim paunch as it was squeezed in, Reagan's colossal ass made it hard for her to have room in much of anything. Gripping the flaps again, Reagan spread her elbows wide in hopes of gaining more momentum. Because after all, good jeans shouldn't go to waste\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"HRRRRRNG!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan found herself short of breath, sweat beading down her pale brow as she struggled against the stylish black denim. And its elastic waistband. Finally, she managed to get the stupid silver button through the fucking slot! And for a brief, shining moment everything was a-okay in Reagan's world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed, and stopped sucking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BANG!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the accursed button succumbed to the laws of physics. Thanks to the sheer heft of Reagan's gut and the tightness of Chel's jeans, the damn thing shot across the closet and made a visible impact with the wall, chipping the paint and revealing the white gesso underneath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck...\" Reagan slowly uncovered her ears, \"There's <i>no way</i> that these are the jeans Chel just bought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\"</span></div></div>",

Taking the poster from her room mate, the older twin would notice the poster being an ad for what appeared to be a newly opening cowboy themed restaurant opening up called the \"Lone Star Tavern\", which seemed to be offering a discount for the first day of it's opening to drive in sales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do you think you could come with me to try this place out? Audrey's too busy, and the other two didn't really care, but I really want to try this place out since they're providing a discount...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Reagan would think about things a bit, before remembering that she didn't have anything else to do today. \"Sure. Don't have much else to do, might as well try out this new place. Besides, the food in this poster does actually look pretty good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery quickly, Ixchel would hug her roommate, causing her roommate to notice a small pudge on the woman's belly, which certainly was not there a few days ago. Reagan though quickly attributed it to most likely being a side effect of the nerd's sedimentary lifestyle, and that it would probably vanish given a bit of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing out on a drive, the two women would make it to the Lone Star Tavern, and as they parked their car the two would quickly already feel the grand smell coming from within the restaurant, the smell of glorious garlic bread, cooked steaks, and the most crispy of fries. All of this combined would very quickly cause Reagan's mouth to water as she got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two would head within the restaurant though, the two would be met by a rather chubby woman in a cowboy outfit, with perky breasts that made Reagan herself a bit envious upon looking at them. The woman looked like she did not like her job that much, and most likely had to work there to pay for college fees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Lone Star Tavern, where only the best of Texan cuisine is served... the name's Kate, and let me find you a seat, and then I'll get you started on some appetizers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a menu for the each of them, Kate would take the two women to a booth seat before giving them their menus and leaving to let the two figure out what they would want to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, they have a endless refill on mozzarella sticks, let's definitely get that, alongside some garlic bread!\" Ixchel would hold her menu tightly as she said this, looking through the menu with a certain rigor as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, get whatever you want for appetizers Ixchel, I have my eyes on this amazing garlic burger... man, soaking a burger in garlic and butter sounds like it would make it so tasty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kate would come back and take the orders of the two women, delivering them some garlic bread and mozzarella sticks to start with, while also taking their orders for their main meals. As Kate would leave yet again, Ixchel would dig in on the mozzarella sticks, while Reagan would cautiously and slowly bite in on the garlic bread, wanting to save her appetite on the garlic-soaked burger she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two waited for their main meals though...</span></div></div>",

The decor briefly drew Reagan's attention until she noticed another poster with the restaurant's name back near the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Help Wanted, Waitstaff.' Geez, they really are new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Ixchel munched on her mozzarella sticks. \"You should think about getting a job here, Reagan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech.\" While Reagan could go for some extra cash, the rambunctious twin was a bit too self-centered and lazy to consider finding work. She did find Lone Star Tavern to have decent atmosphere and good garlic bread, so their food had to be good, but had yet to be sold on the idea of finding a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what your sister is like,\" Ixchel said, indicating Audrey, the eldest and de facto head of household as it was her signature as the primary renter on the lease. \"There's more bills to pay so everyone is expected to chip in. She even got Uma out looking for work the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Phoebe still have college,\" Reagan said, much as she had been shirking her studies and lab time in a similar fashion. The wide-hipped redhead slouched in her seat. \"So we're exempt, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel continued to munch at her appetizer while conversing with her cousin. \"Provided you keep up your grades. Really, she's just being a good big sister, wanting to make sure her twin sisters can make their way in the word. Think of it this way; you might get her to quiet her tune if you showed the initiative of getting a job before she would pester you somewhere down the line about finding work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan rested her chin on her fist. \"Hrrk.\" Ixchel did have a point. For having just discovered the new restaurant, her motives for encouraging Reagan to apply for the Help Wanted here drew suspicion. Particularly for the dent she had left in the mozzarella stick basket. \"What's with the coaching? You're not looking to see if they have a family rate, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I?\" Ixchel replied with inscrutable mirth. Or maybe it was the grease on her lips. \"They've got good food and great atmosphere. What's not to like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when were you so keen on the 'Tex' side of Tex-Mex, Chel? You're half Mexican.\" Ixchel Park was mostly Korean/Mexican in her genetic makeup, a cousin (by marriage) to the mainly caucasian Durant girls, although they were quite close being of the same generation in age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel nearly choked on her last mozzarella stick. \"Way to blow my background out of proportion, cuz. Yeah, some of my ancestors had their conflicts with the South, Texas most of all, but that's generations removed from me. I can appreciate a kitschy themed dive bar for what it is. If it's a good restaurant I'll give it my patronage, especially with the struggles new businesses have starting out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, Reagan thought to herself, about to call Ixchel out on how much she had been eating. Eight mozzarella sticks and two pieces of garlic bread before their entrees had arrived. Obviously the burgeoning potbelly on Ixchel's nerdy physique had to do with this newfound appetite. If Ixchel didn't mind her diet she'd be pushing the definition of chubby pretty soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought I'd ask, Reagan, since you've been looking bored and aimless lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a week's worth of classes, though,\" Reagan continued to protest. \"When will I have time for a job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"College girl?\" Kate asked. The chubby blonde Lone Star waitress had returned with a refill of Ixchel's mozzarella sticks. \"The managers are looking to hire more waitstaff. Part time, so you can fit it with your classes. One or two nights a week if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan bit her lip, still apprehensive. When Ixchel couldn't get a rise out of her by toeing her shin under the table, the cousin with a second basket of mozzarella sticks decided to force the issue as she dunked a fresh fried cheese into the marinara dip. \"What do you think about working here, Kate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a job,\" Kate shrugged, loosing some of the southern twang she had talked with previously, an inflection of speech for the image of Lone Star Tavern. \"I worked at the owner's previous eatery, kinda preferred the old shop more. But this helps out a lot with my tuition. You at a local campus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"East City U,\" Reagan admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out!\" Kate said, some amusement entering her voice. \"Small world, that's where I go too. Let me get ya a flyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan seethed as Ixchel grinned happily, munching on a hot gooey cheese stick. Kate returned with the hiring flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Previous waitress experience is great but not required,\" Kate said. \"Honestly, I think they'll take anyone with a pulse. But if it's money you want, a pretty thing like you could expect some fine tips around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Good money and attention piqued Reagan's interests, her tone shifting as she seriously considered the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what I'm banking, yeah,\" Kate said, preening as she brushed off her shoulder. \"Let me get y'all's order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying the chubby waitress, Reagan considered her on the weighty end of a conventional beauty. Nothing close to a mega-hottie like herself, although Kate's tits did demand attention. Reagan glanced through the flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$18 per hour starting wage for part time? $22 starting full time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's decently higher than minimum wage, wow,\" Ixchel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus tips.\" The gears began to turn in Reagan's mind. \"People usually give, what, five bucks when they tip? That's...that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel decided to throw her a bone. \"Assuming you worked three shifts a week and almost doubled your wage in tips,\" the programmer did a quick mental calculation. \"$2,150 - $2,200 a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Reagan gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's assuming you get consistent tips. And before taxes, obviously, lots of assumptions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you met me? I put the ASS in assumptions!\" Reagan was proud of her pert, juicy, perfectly round buttocks that attracted a lot of turned heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel wasn't going to touch that one, as she noticed Kate returning with their food. \"See what a different perspective does to the idea of coming here? Because my Korean culinary sensibilities can get behind any place with good barbecue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSizzling hot off the grill was Reagan's garlic burger and Ixchel's smoked brisket. The scents sent the pair's mouths to water. Once it was cool enough to eat Reagan took a big bite of her burger. She moaned in ecstasy at its rich, melt in the mouth flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attitude having 180'd about the temp job, Reagan swallowed her food. \"Hell, sign me up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, welcome to Lone Star Tavern! Let me get ya'll some drinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had to admit, her rear made the waitress uniform look <i>damn good!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of Lone Star Tavern's newest hires, Reagan would strut her stuff in cowgirl getup. The typical outfit consisted of a plaid, short sleeved top tied close to the navel. A wide hat, daisy dukes and cowboy boots. Reagan could accessorize a small bit, having toned hose and sully makeup to complement her red hair and bodacious, wicked bod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, her first day had her screw up two orders and spill a tray of drinks, yet she was still making killer tips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table of three chiseled guys was right up Reagan's alley. A prime bounty for tips given how she caught them eying her booty. Yeah, her new job was actually a job, more work than anything Reagan had put in all semester. She still didn't have a handle on the register system, there were so many codes to learn, and busing tables was an absolute chore! Still, she had taken a similar mindset to Kate on the overall Lone Star Tavern job experience.

Upon realizing the older twin's new job as waitress and finding out about the family discount that comes from her job, the five would quickly make the dive bar a favorite eating spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Reagan, Ixchel and Uma were actually pretty nice for the Lone Star Tavern, and while Phoebe was a bit troubling due to their similar looks, Reagan would try finding some pink hair dye to change her hair so she wouldn't be confused with her sister at the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her last roommate, Audrey however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... this is so amazing Audrey, you were right taking me here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I admit I was a bit surprised about Reagan getting a job here Nat, but this is such an amazing place to eat... I may ask Reagan to bring some food from here back home every day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the two had met, both Audrey and her new lover Nat have been hanging out at various restaurants throughout the city, enjoying the food as well as each other. Reagan didn't really like to see this sort of love, but once they started eating here, they never stopped, coming back every day much to the older twin's chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the two feeding each other mozzarella sticks and in particular noticing Audrey's growing potbelly and hips, Reagan would sigh as she looked at them, hands on her hips as she talked in a southern twang. \"Ok, you've enjoyed your appetizers long enough sis, what do you want for your entree...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Reagan... uh, give us a extra large plate of spaghetti with marinara sauce and meatballs. We're sharing it, so just bring one big plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Nat would quickly pipe up. \"Add extra cheese too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, please put extra cheese on top of the sauce too, preferably mozzarella cheese. And bring back another order of cheese sticks as well. And refill our wines when you do bring that back as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll be back with your meal, give me 30 minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the kitchen and giving the order to the back, Reagan would eventually take a short break, sitting down to eat some garlic bread with Kate. As she sat down and looked at herself, she would see an extra bit of belly on her body, but with her behind having become more plump for the few weeks she had been on the job she barely noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kate, Reagan would hand her a piece of garlic bread. \"So, you plan on doing anything after your shift is over Kate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really...\" Kate would quickly take a big bite between words, taking her time to chew on her piece of bread and enjoying the succulent taste. \"I got nothing much to do after I get home, so I am pretty much up for anything. Why you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, was just gonna ask if you wanted to come with me to hang out at my house when your done? We could enjoy some music, watch some comedies, you know... all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as she would finish off her piece of garlic bread, Reagan would get back to work, her vitality restored as she would bring out and serve entree after entree to various people. As she did this, her new happiness would bring her quite possibly the biggest amount of tips she had gotten so far, making her very happy as she counted it up bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she would deliver the big spaghetti meal to Audrey however, she'd quickly sink down as the older sister would simply give Reagan only the required amount of money to pay, with no tip. Feeling a bit angry at her, Reagan would want to yell at her, but she would hold it back, since she had to keep up an appearance for work lest she get fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as the end of the work day came...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reagan was tasked with changing out syrup packs in the soda machine. Well, that hadn't been her original job, but she could only take so much of her older sister and her mysterious girlfriend. After their southern spaghetti was used in a horrendous recreation of that \"Lady &amp; the Tramp\" scene Reagan begged Kate to switch tables with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Kate had said, \"but then you're going to change the soda machine for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan cursed under her breath as she had only been show how to do this once. Large, 5-gallon bags of flavored syrup needed to be hooked up to tubes that fed into the soda dispenser, the intake nozzles on each hose were different for the various brands. Some did a simple twist on, some had to be slotted into place, others were more esoteric. Reagan had particular trouble with the middle category, bent over to deal with a stubborn change of mix on the bottom rack of the soda mixes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Reagan had eaten well since having her employee's discount at Lone Star Tavern, her ever plumping ass could flex its fuller shape as she struggled changing the soda syrup. With every grunt and tussle with the hose, her juicy, wobbly bottom shimmied and shook within her tight daisy dukes. A favorite activity of Reagan's in foreplay but now present during her frustrations with the soda machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Reagan?\" Kate called from the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Reagan whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about your sister and her friend,\" Kate explained. \"They started ordering drinks from the bar and soon hit their limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gawd!\" revulsed by Kate's announcement, Reagan stood up, flushed, brushing aside her pink-tipped red locks out of her face as she followed Kate to see the carnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving ordered every Italian item off the Texas inspired menu, some brisket sliders, and four strong mixed cocktails apiece with an emptied bottle of tequila to boot, Audrey and her lover Natalie were snuggled up against each other on the same side of the booth, sleepy and delirious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gawd!\" Reagan put a hand over her mouth, disgusted, watching her bloated sister and bloated sister's girlfriend breathe heavily, some extra skin peaking out under the hems of their shirts. Natalie, or Nat, had a very rubenesque build with tanned, tattooed skin and dark brown hair, a contrast to Audrey's bushy blonde locks, glasses and fussy state of dress over an engorged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're not going to be able to drive of their own volition,\" Kate stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Audrey!\" Reagan cursed. \"Stupid sudden lesbian lover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this Nat, again? Kate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know,\" said Reagan, who <i>intently</i> didn't wanna know more than she already did. \"Uma said she and they were all roommates in college, or whatever. Damn hell if I knew that included 'experimenting!' \" What Nat did for a living and how she had gotten back into Audrey's life Reagan had remained selectively oblivious to by choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate chuckled. \"I guess you can never tell. Here, you should probably get them home. I'll cover the rest of your shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan's only saving grace from this pit of familial shame was that it was drawing to the late hours the Lone Star Tavern was open. Being a relatively new establishment, the grill &amp; bar had yet to gain a devoted night crowd, so the tavern was near empty. Still, Reagan considered this whole arrangement to suck eggs. It would be one thing if she only had to contend with her older sister dating. She'd seen Audrey try and strike out on trying to having a social life. Frumpy women like her sister, Reagan determined, were destined for the dudders, losers and schlubby types lucky to catch the eye of any woman, compared to the promiscuous twin's hot and sexy love life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not only did Audrey land herself a woman, an orientation that didn't mesh with Reagan's world-view, their frequent dates at Lone Star Tavern had led to ordering more and more food for each other to eat as their main act of love, with Reagan forced to wait on them. Reagan hated every minute of it, unable to fathom her older sister having such a wild and unusual side of her otherwise boring life. She couldn't even remember the last time Audrey drank in public before she started going out with Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis!\" Reagan poked Audrey in the shoulder. \"Hey sis! Wake up! You've been hitting the sauce too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's speech was slurred, her breath a miasma of booze and cheese. \"<i>Five minutes more, donkey canna water melon...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Go sloosshhh</i>\" Nat chimed in, trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're out cold,\" Reagan whined, increasingly embarrassed. She looked to Kate with pleading eyes. \"Help me drag them to the car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose we'll have to,\" Kate said, resigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Audrey,\" Reagan pulled at the arm of her big sister. Who had been stuffing herself bigger, holy crap! Reagan had to tense every fiber of muscle in her body to lift this fatty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*oof*!!\" The wind was knocked out of Reagan as she ended up supporting Audrey's full weight. Her drunk sister's limbs moved on reflex, uncoordinated lumps of jelly, as Reagan staggered to remain upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw her arm over your back,\" Kate coached, \"and lift from her core.\" The husky waitress had wrangled an equally unconscious Nat, rather effectively with surprising brawn backing up her plump breasts. This must not have been her first drunk hauling situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery protractedly, the two Lone Star Tavern waitresses made their way outside with the drunk ladies. \"Shit!\" Reagan yelled. \"Where's the car? Didn't Audrey drive?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Nat did,\" Kate suggested, propping up Audrey's apparent date. \"How about you check her pockets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought this on yourself, sis,\" Reagan left Audrey slumped over some other car, catching her breath as she eyed Nat's form, looking for a purse or wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Reagan roared, the night of embarrassment unending. She was forced to frisk Nat's body, feeling around each bulge of her voluptuous curves trying to find her keys. Finally, they dropped to the pavement with a metallic clump. Reagan picked them up and found the key fob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm beeped off as the lights flashed from Nat's car several spaces around. Kate whistled. \"Oooh, Mercedes. The girl has class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Reagan retorted, pawing out another piece of identification from Nat's body. \"Finally, some ID.\" That was Nat's address sorted out. Reagan supposed she would have to get Nat dropped off first then cart are drunk Audrey home. She and Kate dumped the unconscious pair in the back seat of the Mercedes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\" Kate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to get Chel to pick me up after offloading Nat,\" Reagan said as she dialed her cousin on her cell. Yet another stupid complication. \"C'mon, pick up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel answered on the fifth ring. \"Reagan, what's going on? You're interrupting something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey and her dumb girlfriend are pass out drunk at the tavern!\" Reagan yelled. \"I need you to pick up me and Aud once I get Nat to her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy--\" Ixchel started, before recovering. \"Well, in payment for bailing you out you better have a chicken fried steak ready for me when I save your sorry butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell am I the one at fault in this situation??!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chicken fried steak or no wheels,\" Ixchel replied flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan grumbled. \"Fine.\" She hung up the phone. Damn, her roommates could be annoying sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All good?\" Kate asked, her tone indicating she was ready to wash her hands of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, although crummy Chel wants a chicken fried steak when she comes with the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate snorted. \"Your household is good for business. In a bad way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Reagan said, getting herself set into Nat's Mercedes. She had to contort herself into a driving position, unfamiliar with how the car operated. Gawd, her sister was going to taste her wrath when she was sober.</span></div></div>",

Still a bit angry at both the embarrasment as well as being forced to carry her own sister, the pink-tipped redhead was already trying to think of ways to get revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, after a bit of waiting, Ixchel would arrive, and after Reagan would help in dropping Audrey into the back, she would give the mixed woman her chicken steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you for the steak Reagan! You know just what I love...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go home now... it's already getting dark out and I just want to sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of driving, the three would eventually get home, and as Reagan would eventually help Audrey into bed, she would let the blonde fatty fall asleep once more, before walking to the door out. However, as she brought her hand to the door, she would get a brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... she really does seem hungry all the time when she's not at work... maybe if I amplify that at home I can convince her to try dieting so she'll stop coming to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the door open, Reagan would leave the house for a bit, before returning with a bottle of appetite stimulants. She had no idea if it would even work, but this was her best shot at getting revenge, and as she would pour the liquid contents of the stimulants down her sister's throat, she would make sure from time to time that she wouldn't wake up, by stopping at certain points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had emptied half of the tiny bottle down Audrey's throat, Reagan would leave her sister's room, and wait for the morning to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... my head hurts, and I'm absolutely starving... why isn't anything filling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up to see her Uma and Phoebe already out, Reagan would watch as Ixchel would frantically work the stove, cooking the eldest roommate a bunch of pancakes and eggs in a attempt to try filling her up. Smiling to see that her plan had somewhat worked, Reagan would sit down and grab a plate herself, and begin talking with the two while smugly smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ixchel, I forgot to ask this last night but how was your day yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was pretty good. I joined a public cooking class to try improving my cuisine, you can see how well that's doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More pancakes please...\" Audrey would slowly push her empty plate forward as Ixchel would quickly refill it with a few more pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do have to say these pancakes are pretty good... are these chocolate chips AND cinnammon within them? That's pretty impressive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard Reagan. You just gotta cook it evenly all throughout. Hey, maybe if I can teach you a bit you could get a promotion to chef at that tavern and we can get a even big-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, already happy with the tips I get. Thanks for the offer though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her plate, Reagan would take her time and place her now empty plate in the sink, cleaning it while she would continue watching Audrey eat more and more. After about a hour of preparation though, the pink-tipped woman would fit into her daisy dukes and leave for the Lone Star Tavern, for another full day of working with Kate and the rest of the wait staff to make sure that the tavern would stay successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next two weeks though, after she did get off work she would wait for Audrey to get off work, before pouring a bit more of the appetite stimulant into her body, so that she would end up being hungrier and hungrier every morning. She was not sure what sort of side effects that her older sister would have, but she didn't really care as the goal was to try discouraging her from pigging herself at the Lone Star Tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the end of this two week period however, Reagan would stop using the appetite stimulant on her sister, and let Audrey's own appetite and thoughts determine what would happen next...</span></div></div>",

Her trousers now bit into her pudgy belly, refusing to keep buttoned. Audrey, forever a big-boned apple shape in her adult life, didn't consider herself to have the stomach and thighs to pull off a skirt. Even if her old college flame Natalie Greenway would be the type to encourage that kind of style change, it was still a bit too provocative for the otherwise moderate Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld flame...Audrey hadn't really considered that she had feelings for Nat back when she lived on the dorm with her and Uma. Nat had been plying them with food in college owing to her culinary aspirations. Now as adults, Audrey had reconnected with Nat when the latter had established herself as a club manager. What began as both shooting the breeze off the clock, using the excuse of Reagan's recent job at the Lone Star Tavern, had rekindled a passion behind that relationship that made Audrey reconsider that she might be open to dating more than just guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to insist we cut back on the eating and drinking,\" Audrey sighed, the consideration of her wardrobe woes a jab of practicality into new discoveries about her sexual orientation. At almost a month into dating Nat, the last few weeks frequently at Lone Star Tavern, saw Audrey chunking up considerably. Her stomach constantly looked bloated and her hips and arms acquired some extra jiggle. These dates and indulgences were to blame, no doubt, although Audrey didn't recall this kind of hangover behavior the last time she'd been a frequent drinker back in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, blondie?\" Her past and present roommate Uma asked. The black athlete could tell that the question was no, hands in the pockets of her hoodie as she eyeballed Audrey's choice of outfit. The Seattle print shirt and yoga pants weren't Audrey's largest clothing and she was looked squeezed within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far is it to the diner again?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a fifteen minute drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore groans echoed from Audrey's stomach. \"I can't wait that long.\" Before they started out, Audrey insisted on making herself a triple-decker peanut butter and jam sandwich to eat on the drive to Phoebe's new part-time job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspired by Reagan's relative success at waitressing, Phoebe had also gotten a part time job, encouraged by Audrey and the rest of the townhouse. Thankfully for her twin's sanity it wasn't at Lone Star. Phoebe had been taken by the retro chic of a throwback 50s style diner, much like the mom and pop ones the Durant sisters went to since they were girls. Checkerboard Diner carried on that malt shop &amp; restaurant tradition, with its red and black checkerboard patterned walls, neon lit interior and mini-jukeboxes at each table, complete with the patterned overalls or poodle skirts on the waitstaff with paper hats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls!\" Decked out in a pink and white skirt with an apron, red hair tied in twin ponytails, Phoebe cocked her hip as she waved down the others as they entered. \"I mean, ladies who I probably don't know or live with, can I get you a table?\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, Phoebe, I don't think your manager will care that much,\" Ixchel said. Audrey, Ixchel &amp; Uma had decided to get breakfast to support Phoebe. Reagan didn't want to get involved given how much embarrassment having her twin frequent her job usually entailed. Although she laughed to herself with a private joke when Audrey brought it up, whatever that was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get ya, hun?\" Phoebe said after sitting the others down at a booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the chocolate chip pancakes,\" Audrey immediately began, \"with a denver omelet. And an order of bacon. Actually, is it too early to order a burger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Phoebe jotted the order, eager to please her big sister. \"I'm told people come in here all the time for morning burgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also get me cheddar cheeseburger,\" Audrey continued, \"with a side of onion rings and ranch dip. And I might as well have you put in a strawberry milkshake too. What are you girls having?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel and Uma stared at Audrey, concerned. \"Uh, maybe a <i>chance</i> to look over the menu?\" the athletic slacker replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bananas foster french toast for me, I guess?\" Ixchel said, making a hurried decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, I'll try the chicken strips and waffle,\" Uma added, shooting Audrey a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and sis, could you maybe see about getting our orders filled quick?\" Audrey added, betrayed by another stomach gurgle. Phoebe happily nodded and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Aud, whats going on?\" Ixchel asked. \"I've never seen you order this much at breakfast until recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you had that triple PB&amp;J before we got here,\" Uma added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling guilty despite her hunger, Audrey nervously squeezed her love handles. \"I don't know. I'm just starving the mornings after I've been out with Nat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma arched an eyebrow. \"I know grease helps with the hangover but since when does a night of drinking leave you starved the next day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Audrey shrugged. \"I haven't been drinking this much since college, either. I should tell Nat we should cut back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't sounding like normal behavior...\" Ixchel murmured to herself, puzzling over her cousin's increase in appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof!\" Audrey stepped gingerly back into the townhouse after they all made it back from breakfast, clutching at a bloated gut. \"Well, at least we can say the diner has good food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not that Phoebe is that good taking orders,\" Ixchel said sourly, carrying leftovers. Audrey's omelette had been entered as ham &amp; swiss instead of denver, Uma had received the chicken strip <i>basket</i> and a waffle, with Chel getting plain french toast and a banana split. And Audrey had insisted they still eat the accidental orders while their actual food was recooked. As in, she had taken several bites of what was offered on the table until her roommates staged an intervention when she kept eating while looking pained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be that hungry after a night out,\" Uma demanded, trying to get to the bottom of the affair. \"You even remember what you do when you get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Audrey said, needing to stretch out on the couch to lessen the tension in her stomach. \"Reagan's been helping me back home after her shifts a lot. I should probably thank her.\" The acid reflux from her stomach trying to turn over her dense, multi-plate breakfast pained her horribly. \"Do we have antacids in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll look,\" Uma said, digging through drawers. She was about to close the garbage can after throwing away the antacid wrapper when she noticed something odd. \"What gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Chel asked, tending to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma brought out a spent bottle with the antacid. \"I've been looking for these. My appetite stimulants from when I used to do a power protein binge before a workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a strong dosage,\" Chel said, reading the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would only take one,\" Uma said, \"I told Reagan that when I tried to get her to work out with me...wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she's been driving me home,\" Audrey said, all three coming to the same conclusion. \"Or offers me water when I head to bed. Has she been drugging me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain a sudden appetite shift,\" Chel said. \"Should we bust her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" Audrey said, pausing from another stomach pang. \"Let me see that bottle. I got a better idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Audrey, I told you I didn't want to come here on my off day!\" Reagan complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went to support Phoebe on the breakfast shift, You should support her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even that hungry,\" Reagan said. Her mind drifted to just how big Audrey had been getting since she had been feeding her the appetite stimulants when she slept. Twice in one day to see Phoebe at her diner job was just pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's just have a shake,\" Audrey said, eager to literally give Reagan a taste of her own medicine. None of this was prescription.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo milkshakes were ordered, mint for Reagan and caramel for Audrey, who encouraged Phoebe to get a \"new job selfie\" with her twin so Audrey had a chance to mix ground appetite stimulate into Reagan's shake. An annoyed Reagan sat down none the wiser. \"Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of the shake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had a taste. Then more. \"This is pretty good. Hey, Phoebe, get me another one of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two shakes: \"Whoa, is that a baked cookie sundae! I'll have that if it's as good as the shakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sundae. \"Screw it, get me the brownie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the brownie.\"*urp* These are great but I need something substantial. How about a banana split?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want Reagan,\" Audrey smiled, having nursed a coke after her shake in the time Reagan chain ordered dessert. Turnabout was fair play at this point, as playing on Reagan's sweet tooth led to a show of her trying to fill herself with ice cream as she didn't notice she was under the effects of the same appetite stimulants.</span></div></div>",

The perky, bubbly redhead often made stupid decisions or didn\u2019t think of the consequences whenever she did anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hot. The twins\u2019 phenotype graced them with limber, sultry booty wide bodies post puberty. For Phoebe, her plump little rump had brought all the boys to the yard. Not that the townhouse had a big yard. The lyrical analogy was lost on Phoebe. Although she did feel like having a milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was grateful for her family and friends. Her twin sister Reagan was cool if mean sometimes. Her big sister Audrey took care of everything. Cousin Ixchel was so smart. And Uma was fun to hang out with. And they all lived in the townhouse to help Phoebe. Because life was hard, you know? The airheaded Durant twin had never contemplated life if she was forced to fend for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconsciously, she had wrapped everyone around her finger without realizing it. Being the younger twin by two seconds she was the baby of the family. She could still pass for cute when the situation called for it, her maturity not all there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if the nightmare occurred that her family kicked her out of the townhouse Phoebe was so popular. She had a lot of friends at university and she was starting her modeling career. People found Phoebe attractive and most found her sweet if doltish personality endearing. She\u2019d had plenty of suitors and boyfriends although Phoebe often had to be rescued from one-sided and jerks for lovers. It didn\u2019t help that Phoebe would crush after every handsome hunk she laid eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe may not be the brightest bulb off the shelf but she was kind, friendly and genuine. Even her sisters couldn\u2019t stay mad at her for too long. Call it karma, or fate or just ridiculously luck but a lot of things in life went Phoebe\u2019s way without her barely having to lift a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Phoebe, every week had bright sunshiney days.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like many things in life she had stumbled ass-backwards (perky little ass backwards) into what had become a lucrative gig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started back in high school when Phoebe and her twin Reagan had been told they were rather photogenic by an off duty talent scout. Reagan had blown the offer off but Phoebe had wound up at the agency\u2019s audition time unexpectedly. She had mistaken the scout\u2019s card for a plumber\u2019s office when asked to run an errand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had no clue what she was doing when first auditioning to be a model but her natural good looks and killer bod had taken her far. Mind you, as a diamond in the rough it had taken a whole lot of polishing to make Phoebe into a viable model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pay packet came from each shoot, so Phoebe started part time as was encouraged to continue with university as she got her feet wet. The girl needed acting classes to help improve her expressions. Otherwise her starting looks were spunky and a weird half-sultry half-sleepy look whenever she was asked to be sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fledgling model was starting to get some more acclaim now that she had joined an agency called Premantis. It took a month\u2019s worth of corrections to get Phoebe to remember that the \u2018s\u2019 was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Phoebe was on a shoot she had a lot of fun. A team did her hair and makeup and a gofer got her mineral water whenever she was thirsty. As she learned the lingo of the biz she was told that the gofer had nothing to do with rodents. She got to try on new clothes, playing dress up being one of Phoebe\u2019s favorites as a kid, such as when she and Reagan were in matching outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer managers were Clive Tiemens and Fiore Leoni, both were responsible for setting up the photo shoots and selecting the right model for the job.Clive\u2019s head was mainly on the business and photography while Fiore got to know the models personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right before the shoot\u2019s briefing that Phoebe was pulled aside for an important conversation. She didn\u2019t realize it at the time but her modeling career was about to change drastically.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The redhead writhed under the covers for a moment before stretching her arms over her head and unleashed a yawn into her well decorated room.<br>\r\nFinally, whilst rubbing the sleep from her eyes, Phoebe properly arose from her slumber, tossing the floral quilt to one side and swinging her legs over the edge of her queen sized bed. With her slender fingers grasping the edge of her soft mattress whilst her toes scrunched into her thick fluffy rug, Phoebe swiftly pushed herself up and walked across her room to prepare for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she wandered, Phoebe couldn't help but notice herself in her full length mirror which sat in one corner. Detouring from her projected journey, the redhead turned to face her mirror and gave herself a good looking over. Dressed in little more than a strappy vest top and a pair of skimpy pants, Phoebe liked what she saw. Prominent as ever, the bottom heaviness she shared with her sister Reagan dominated her figure looking pert as ever with a faint bite mark from her panties visible against the cheeks. Perched between her long thighs and equally wide hips, Phoebe gave her hips a little wiggle causing her bulbous bum to wobble slightly which always amused the young redhead.<br>\r\nAt this point, however, Phoebe noticed another small wobble on her body. Peeking out slightly from under her vest top was a slither of tummy. This in itself wasn't irregular, she had found with years of practice that showing a little stomach drew the guys in no end, but this particular morning made it difficult to use the word 'little' to describe her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy no means was Phoebe fat, quite the opposite, but weeks and weeks of enjoying her spoilt existence had caused some...growth. Curious, Phoebe grasped the hem of her top and lifted it to just under her unsupported boobs. With her entire middle exposed it was clear to see her very shapely hips rounding out and then turning back into her thin waist, the curves of which were framing a slight curve of puppy fat which was radiating out from her belly button giving her a soft middle.<br>\r\nPhoebe prodded at her not quite flat stomach, feeling the softness give way under her finger. The sensation tickled slightly, invoking a smile before Phoebe caught herself and whipped her vest top back down, leaving a slither of stomach exposed still, although this time not as voluntary as it used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeh, Phoebe internally shrugged, I'm still hot as hell.<br>\r\nThe thought provoked another smile, more prominent this time before suddenly remembering her usual morning social engagements.<br>\r\nSwiping her phone from her bedside table, Phoebe skipped back to her mirror and posed for her morning selfie, hand on hip, bum pushed back to embellish her most prominent feature and a gentle pout enhancing her lips.<br>\r\nHappy with the picture, Phoebe plastered the caption 'morning world' across the photo before hitting send, delivering it into the Snapchat universe to her many friends and followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with her morning routine, Phoebe turned swiftly on her heels, bum jiggling as per as she trotted swiftly to her wardrobe throwing the doors open to pick her outfit for the day. As a model, Phoebe owned enough clothes to fill a shop which presented a whole other problem; what should she wear?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Friday and Friday was Phoebe's cheat day. She had no scheduled classes and no shoots so Friday was like an extra day tacked onto the weekend for her. Phoebe hadn't made any major plans so she changed into something more comfortable: a pair of grey joggers and a coral print zip up hoodie. The weather was turning a tad chilly so Phoebe wanted to stay warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Phoebe was oblivious to the routine that had graced some pudge around her middle, how she lived on her days was very telling as to how she became lazy and spoilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey joggers were once meant to be athletic wear, gotten at discount after an early photo shoot for sportswear and Phoebe had loved how it made her bubbly rear pop out just right. She'd gone jogging with Uma a few times but couldn't keep up with the ex-athlete's pace so her sweats were downgraded to spud wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as Phoebe had gotten dressed she was out of her clothes again as she made her way downstairs. Her big sister Audrey emerged from a steamy bathroom, half dried in her moist morning clothes trying to deal with her unruly hair. \"Oh, Phoebe,\" Audrey squinted without her glasses. \"I've left a bubble bath if you want. Better to use the water twice before it's wasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks!\" Phoebe relished the idea, unlike the other women of the house who would be more discouraged by sharing bathwater. Phoebe liked it when she dipped in a toe. Still warm and plenty sudsy. The bath oils and scented candle on the sink mixed an aroma of lavender and vanilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe stripped down, slender but soft around her juicy rear and budding tummy, flinging her clothes indiscriminately before she realized the door was half open. \"Oops!\" She had to force the door shut before she descended into the warm bath. Even for being twice used bathwater it was inviting. It needed a bit of a warm up, so Phoebe added some water which also frothed up a second round of bubbles, which was her favorite part. Toes wiggling like an eager kid, Phoebe spent most of the time playing with the bubbles then actually washing. The bath oils did a wonder for her skin and any aching muscles she might have had from sleeping in a rough position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending far too long in the bath Phoebe finally got up, a little pruney but no worse for wear. She found a towel to cover her and began to redo her hair with the hair dryer before there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe?\" came the muffled voice of her cousin, Ixchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnabashed from her lack of modesty, Phoebe opened the door. \"Hi! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel tried to avert her gaze. While Phoebe had covered her chest with the towel the angle of the cloth was leaving her bum scandalously short. \"U-um, Audrey asked me to help with laundry, and she said you had been wearing this so...\" Ixchel returned Phoebe's clothes, which she had accidentally crammed out the door with Audrey's laundry after undressing for her bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!!\" Phoebe cradled the freshly laundered joggers to her face. Just out of the dryer, nice and cozy. The action caused Phoebe's towel to become undone so Ixchel hurriedly left Phoebe the rest of her clothes and shut the door, dark skin turning crimson about her round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToasty dried clothes where the best! Phoebe crooned as she got dressed for the second time that day, feeling the warmth transfer across her body. She left the bathroom with an extra perk in her step, making her way down to the kitchenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis,\" Audrey said, \"breakfast is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Score!\" Phoebe marveled. \"Chocolate chip pancakes! And those little weenie sausages. Those are like my favorites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer twin Reagan scoffed at the breakfast nook. \"Gawd, you're like a seven year old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush,\" Audrey said. \"At least someone appreciates my cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was given a stack of three pancakes and four sausages. Reagan and Uma, who had also sat at the breakfast nook, had half eaten plates. Truthfully, the pancakes were nothing to write home about. Only the chocolate chips made them salvageable, the pancakes were half burnt yet undone in the center. Phoebe was the only one to look past these flaws, either because she was hungry or had no account for taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a forkful. \"Yummy!\" She added butter and syrup, almost staining her recently washed clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma took another bite of her pancakes, staring off into space as she chewed with her mouth open. \"Yeah, I can't finish these. Sorry Audrey, maybe don't let them cook so long next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see you make the pancakes, Uma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not having pancakes two days in a  row,\" Uma tilted her plate Phoebe's direction. \"Here, you can finish the rest of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Phoebe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Reagan also unloaded some food, \"I can't stand these mealy sausages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more sausages were added to Phoebe's plate. She ate it all with gusto. Honestly, the other girls didn't know what they were missing. Phoebe enjoyed a good breakfast with Audrey as the other two vacated the kitchenette. By the time the toasty feeling had left her clothes Phoebe had the warmth of a full tummy as she went to the living room to stretch out on the couch with her last few weenie sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such cushy living that had caused Phoebe to gain a bit of weight, although she had brushed it off. She'd had her caloric intake for the day at breakfast yet the day was barely half over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else did Phoebe do on her extra long weekend?</span></div></div>",

Reagan or Phoebe?\u201d asked the first voice, placing her hands on her wide hips and squeezing slightly into a layer of pudge around her middle.<br>\r\nStill faltering, Phoebe froze like a deer in the headlights before feeling a firm hand on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave it out Nat, she\u2019s only a young un\u201d Uma replied on behalf of Phoebe as she took place by the redheads side.<br>\r\nBreathing an internal sigh of relief, Phoebe relaxed and felt confident to stand her full height against the woman apparently called Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Uma, no beef here, just getting to know Audrey\u2019s sister who I\u2019m guessing is Phoebe from your defense\u201d Nat smiled coyly as if impressing herself with her insider knowledge \u201cspeaking of, Audrey here tonight or she still playing mummy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had to pass tonight so just me\u201d responded Uma, gently squeezing Phoebe\u2019s shoulder as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame\u201d mused Nat to herself \u201cwell I guess I\u2019ll catch you later\u201d she remarked as she turned on her heels with a distinct wobble betraying her plump body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought this party was your friends?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Here,\" Uma said, thrusting an ordered drink Phoebe's direction. \"Try a Dark &amp; Stormy. Perfect for after hours or party atmosphere and you can't go too wrong with rum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe took the drink, staring at the amber liquid on the rocks with a lime. \"But the weather wasn't that bad today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma sighed. \"It's the name of the drink Phebs. You like ginger ale so this is kinda close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drink loosened up Phoebe as early as her first sip, as her eyes grew wide and excited. \"This is tasty! Thanks Uma, what are you drinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue Bull.\" Uma snapped her fingers at the bartender. \"Hey buddy, give me the rest of the can.\" Uma smashed the dregs of the energy drink that made up her cocktail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uma?\" As the pair made their way from the bar they were approached by a tall, bearded man with a well built physique. \"Yo babe, how you've been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce!\" Uma slugged the guy on a tan arm and then pulled him into a hug. \"It's been ages, man, had to come when I heard you'd be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had first been startled and then dumbstruck with a budding crush the moment 'Bruce' had appeared. In lieu of saying anything she had pounded most of her drink. Maybe a bit too hard as the alcohol began coursing through her veins and the drink gave her some hiccups. \"Sorry *hic* who is Bruce?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce had a beefy arm spun around Uma's shoulder. \"We played mixed doubles and other coed sports in college. You look sorta familiar, have I met you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's Audrey's sister, Bruce,\" Uma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd Aud's sis! Man, short of the hair color that's some resemblance for Audrey back in the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd Aud!!!\" Phoebe, having never heard such a nickname for her older sister but it was perfect. She startled chortling so hard her laugh was punctuated with even more hiccups. Bruce and Uma laughed too, although not as long as Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Phoebe,\" Uma asked, her duties as chaperone slapping her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay still a sec,\" Bruce rolled up a sleeve, steadying Phoebe with a firm hand. He gave her one forceful slap in the back. \"Sorry babe did that hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooff!\" Phoebe's back stung a moment but as her breathing returned to normal she realized her hiccups were gone. \"Hey, thanks, how'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little system shock. I've gotten into sport massage and usually a well placed jolt can sort out some muscle spasms.\" Bruce grinned sheepishly, a contrast to his tough first impression. \"You two check out the spread yet? Nat's not one to slouch on vittles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on our way,\" Uma said, bewildering Phoebe even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch you girls there I have to hit the can,\" Bruce made his exit, oblivious to the stares from the increasingly buzzed redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma was all too familiar with Phoebe's tendency to fawn after guys like the latest hot fad. \"Tone it down girl, or you're really going to be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Phoebe tried to dodge the question by returning the drink to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw your goo-goo eyes checking out Bruce's chiseled physique. I'm just warning you he might not swing that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's swinging, Uma? Don't tell me you did ballroom dance in college too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that kinda swing,\" Uma sighed, Phoebe could be such a ditz. She dragged the younger housemate by the wrist so they could find a somewhat quieter corner. \"I mean he's gay,\" Uma half whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, really?\" Phoebe pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Uma paused, \"he might be bi? I'm not sure when the last time he dated a woman was...\" Uma cut short her next comment, about how most of their friends had experimented in college, realizing that she was talking to the college aged housemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your friends are Bruce and Nat?\" Phoebe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Uma explained. She gestured to the crowd gathered in the music pumping atmosphere. \"I mean, this is Nat's place. She owns the club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Phoebe hadn't expected that the plump, tight dressed tattooed woman would be the one running this party. \"So how come you and Audrey know someone like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all lived on the same floor, Phebs. Except Bruce, obviously. Thought I might have heard Sheryl recognize you but she's probably at the DJ booth now. She was a DJ on our college radio station.\" Uma looked sideways at Phoebe. 'Well, not you obviously. I invited Regan to a hookup last summer but she mostly brushed everyone off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma scratched her bare midriff. \"That enough background for you now? Let's order up some grub, the apps are killer here and I skipped dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Phoebe said, starting to feel her party groove coming back on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Away from the crowded dance floor and the main points of traffic in the club, Uma and Phoebe were able to find a curved booth where they could rest their feet and look over the menus. The club focused on small plates and appetizers. Even though there were only two sides to the squat menu there was quite a bit of variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't kidding!\" Phoebe exclaimed, amazed by some of the choices. \"Fried tacos! Cajun shrimp! Garlic cheese curds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Uma tapped a finger on one entry. \"The wings are pretty kickin' too. I wanna try the spicy-sweet curry glaze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as all these options presented themselves, a niggling doubt decided to tickle the back of Phoebe's brain. \"But, aren't these kind of expensive? They don't even list change, just the whole dollar amount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit worrying, kid,\" Uma said slyly. \"I've caught the funds covered.\" Audrey, on the other hand, might get steamed when she saw the credit card bill but that would be next month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're thinking of getting, ladies?\" Bruce came back from the bathroom, slipping into on the side next to Phoebe. Whether he was bent that way or not, Bruce was a hunk of a man that Phoebe couldn't help but ogle. Uma gave her a swift pinch in the side when she noticed, causing the redhead to yelp and bounce on her wide tuckus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-Sorry,\" Phoebe said, feeling embarrassed. \"It all looks so good, I don't know what to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce hadn't noticed Phoebe fawning over him. \"I've had the fried green beans here before. The edamame is nicely seasoned too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eda-what?\" Phoebe had no clue what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edamame,\" Bruce pointed on the menu. \"Soybeans. You can take the pod up to your mouth and pinch out the beans with your fingers. The lightest thing on the menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's where you all ended up.\" Nat strode over in her clingy dress, tattoos undulating at the shoulders as she rested her arms on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe shrunk in the middle of the booth, still kind of intimidated by the plump club owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Nat,\" Bruce greeted. \"Looking to get some chow. How about some edamame so Phoebe can try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the curry wings,\" Uma added. \"I'm famished. What you getting Phebs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm....\" she looked down to the menu as if clinging to a raft for dear life out on the open sea. \"These, uh, stuffed mushroom things, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fast-track those in the kitchen for you,\" Nat gave a faint smile. \"Anything for old friends plus one. Also, you see my man Murray around, he'll get you any drink you want. On the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Score!\" Uma thrust her fists out in a cheer. Nat strode off, plump frame shimmying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was starting to reassess her roommate's former college friend. Maybe she wasn't too bad. While they waited on the small plates the three talked about music and times from the past. Phoebe thought her own college life could be pretty wild (well, wild for her, her twin Reagan could be an utter hellion) but the stories Uma and Bruce were trading about their co-ed life were amazing. Especially because it painted a side of her older sister Audrey she had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then,\" Bruce continued midway through a tale, \"when we were moving the paint cans for Aud's art project, we didn't realize there was a punctured hole in the bottom, so there were these criss cross lines all over the quad. Looked like a crop circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was trying to keep up with everything she had heard up until now and snorted out a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it turns out there was this little clique of Satan worshipers at the college, so the faculty thought they had done it. They even got blamed for the broken golf cart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo hoo,\" Uma let out a long laugh. \"But's its still not that funny, Bruce. The locker rooms stunk like garbage for weeks after all the pipes backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bruce could reply Nat and a server were there with the app orders and a refill of the beer pitcher. Phoebe looked confused at the fourth plate. \"Did we order those? Because that looks amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying out something new,\" Nat explained. \"Waffle fries as nachos, only as a baked potato. My treat.\" The fries were decked with melted cheese, bacon bits, chives, sour cream and seasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the wings, edamame, stuffed mushrooms and loaded fry 'nachos' there was enough for the three adults to eat. Bruce kept himself to respectable portions. Phoebe and Uma, however, were so tipsy from the booze and enamored with the food that they couldn't stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG this tastes amazing,\" Phoebe said, having had most of the fries after three mushrooms. \"But I had really wanted to try those garlic cheese curds after reading them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hey,\" Uma threw caution to the wind. \"We're here to enjoy ourselves and Nat's treating us well. We'll get another order. I also want to kick things up in the spicy factor, Cajun shrimp and the jalape\u00f1o poppers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Bruce was both impressed and bewildered. \"Didn't know you girls could eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe grinned in a half drunk stupor. Besides the excellent taste, she'd been putting away the appetizers to have her mouth occupied whenever she felt awkward talking around Uma's college friends. Yet Phoebe and Uma put a solid dent in the second round of apps. And the third round when it was just the two of them, Bruce excusing himself to chat up another college friend, the DJ named Sheryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food and the drinks flowed freely at Uma and Phoebe's table, each round bigger than the last. So much that by the time they were done, they had almost eaten out the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hooof*\" Uma exhaled deeply. Her crop top left her food baby on full display, covering the last of her abs. \"Damn. That was so tasty but I'm so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Phoebe had been eating well lately and the good living and good eats all blurred together in her overstimulated mind as she stretched, oblivious to her appearance. While her backless shirt hadn't been cut as small as Uma's top she had her own roll of pudge sticking out. And she had needed to unbutton her daisy dukes, as her rump and engorged belly left little room in the tiny shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, it was a surprise that neither one was comatose at this point.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life for young Phoebe was, quite frankly, a ball at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving managed to negotiate the night out with Uma relatively well, and by that its meant without obvious embarrassment, Phoebe managed to come out of her shell quite some.<br>\r\nThis proved to be quite the fortunate development as, initially led by Uma herself but quickly turned into sincere requests from Phoebe, the pair became semi regular's at Nat's place.<br>\r\nDespite her initial skepticism towards some of Uma and Audrey's college mates, they all turned out to be pretty decent people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce wasn't there often but he was always good fun whenever he was, not to mention to die for eye candy, particularly when the alcohol had been flowing and he always seemed to have an eye out for Phoebe. Not in the sense of fancying her, he was DEFINITELY gay she found out, more of a brotherly compassion.<br>\r\nThen there was the elusive Sheryl. Nat's in house DJ was rarely free to talk but, after a rather awkward exchange with her thinking that Phoebe was Reagan, her and Phoebe soon interacted as often as she was available. It did help that she played most of Phoebe's favourite music all the time.<br>\r\nThen, of course, to complete the trio of regulars was Nat herself. The thick figured club owner still set Phoebe on edge for some reason but she was nice enough AND she provided food for the girls so she was alright in Phoebe's niave little eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Phoebe and Uma were having a great time, going out together, getting drunk and eating some absolutely amazing food.<br>\r\nOf course, these moments being so enjoyable really made it suck when the reality hit home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll through the house there was silence, well, apart from the echoing groans and grunts of discomfort echoing from Phoebe's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock* \"You ok in there Phebe's?\" asked Ixchel rather sheepishly, not wanting to provoke an outburst from her cousin<br>\r\n*URGH* \"No, Chel, I'm not...*groan*...ok!\" called out Phoebe between grunts \"Aud's shrunk my *grunt* god damn *URGH* jeans!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" moaned Ixchel, tentatively putting a hand on her cousin's door handle \"you want a hand in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for permission, Ixchel turned the handle and managed to open the door a crack before having the division bounce back against here, likely caused by a pillow being thrown at it from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" screeched Phoebe \"I'll fix it, leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...ok then\" mumbled Ixchel before heading down the stairs with a slow trudge \"Jeez, try and help some people\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her cheeks burning red from exertion, Phoebe clung desperately onto the waistband of her skinny jeans, taking deep breaths before engaging in another attempt to pull the denim up into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seemed to go well initially, the blue material encasing her calves, knees and tightening slightly around her thighs before slowing drastically to reveal the problem with their fit.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" huffed the red head, continuing to pull harder as she tried to overcome the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what she couldn't see was that her genetically gifted backside was proving to be the problem.<br>\r\nAfter a period of intense indulgence combined with her sedentary lifestyle, Phoebe had grown quite noticeably around her rear, to the point now that her jeans were unable to cover any more than a third of the bulbous buttocks.<br>\r\nHours of sitting and consuming empty calories, both in liquid and food form, had had quite the expansive effect on Phoebe's naturally tight rear which now looked like a pair of oversized marshmallows squeezing out of her jeans. The poor things were so overtaxed that a line of pudge was overflowing the waistband giving her what could only be referred to as a 'double butt cheek' on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming out in dispair, Phoebe threw herself backwards onto her bed and cradled her face in her hands as her jeans slackly slid back down to her knees as she reflected on the past few days. In her heart of hearts, Phoebe knew that Audrey had nothing to do with her jeans not fitting, but she was too mad to think rationally like that.<br>\r\nIf she had been in a position to think sensibly though, she would have realised that her rear wasn't the only part of her effected by her gluttony of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside her booty swell, her hips had also taken on a layer of padding previously unaccounted for and on top of her hips sat the startings of a slight muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill silently groaning to herself as she kicked of her jeans completely, Phoebe found herself staring at her clock and was presented with a whole different problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot! I've got to get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing herself from her bed, nearly tripping over the bothersome jeans, Phoebe desperately looked for anything she could use as an alternative, finally stumbling across a stretchy ruffled skirt.<br>\r\nIt would have to do.<br>\r\nThrowing the skirt up her legs and feeling it constrict slightly around her backside, Phoebe sighed audibly but accepted it actually went up and made for the door, bowling down the stairs and slamming the front door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the door slam, rather sleepily, Uma trudged out from her room wearing nothing more than a tattered basketball vest and some panties.<br>\r\nStaring at the front door, the athlete lazily scratched the side of her stomach which was looking far less toned than usual and slightly more rounded before rolling her eyes and going back in her room whilst muttering something about house mates and slamming doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm sorry I'm late!\" shouted Phoebe as she burst through the door to the studio where she was currently working with the crew.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey, just get yourself to wardrobe and we'll see you in 10\" called the director back across to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful that filming hadn't fully started, Phoebe trotted swiftly towards her dressing room to get changed for the day.<br>\r\nHad she been in another frame of mind and more aware of the situation, the bottom heavy red head might have actually enjoyed the amount of wobbling that her backside was currently doing under its own momentum as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**10 minutes later**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Phoebe ready yet or not?\" shouted the director from his chair, looking around for any evidence of the red headed star of the show.<br>\r\n\"She's not come out of her dressing room yet\" muttered a nearby stage hand, expecting a rollicking from the director who was notoriously short fused when it came to punctuality.<br>\r\nAlthough Phoebe was no angel when it came to time management there was a long standing thing that she got away with a lot of things by being pretty and flirty.<br>\r\nToday was not one of those days though<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too similar to a few shout hours ago, Phoebe's distinct groans and moans could be heard through the closed door of the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, with less patience however, head of wardrobe and makeup let herself into the room.<br>\r\n\"You sound like you're struggling there sweetie, you ok?\" offered Mary Jane, as she looked over the situation before her, trying to take it all in.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...*URGH*...thank...you!\" groaned the actress as she fought to pull her tights up which were protesting like her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unlike the restrictive denim, the tights finally gave way and hugged her hips tightly as the smooth material slid over her engorged rear.<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, Phoebe composed herself before taking a step forward to exit the room.<br>\r\nThe one step was all it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud tear could be heard throughout the studio as the poor, thinly stretched tights encasing Phoebe's lower half gave up and split wide open allowing her newly developing rear assets to surge forth through the gap.<br>\r\nPerfectly aware of what had just happened, Phoebe flushed crimson red immediately before squatting down on the floor and bursting into tears.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, the squatting motion caused the tights to rip even further, only stopping when they hit the stretched waistband around her hips.</span></div></div>",

She had them arranged around her at the breakfast nook. Even though it was these kinds of habits that had led her to her current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo drown out her sorrows in ice cream, Phoebe had dressed down to little more than her night clothes and a bathrobe. The sash was tied loose so Phoebe's growing pudge and bulbous backside were easily visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to be a star!!\" cried Phoebe as she spooned candy bar crunch into her mouth. \"They had scouted my agency and said I had just the right look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn looks, Phoebe was a knockout. For acting...well, a lot could be done with editing. All through initial rehearsals it was shown that Phoebe needed those acting classes at college but fostering talent was less expensive than dealing with more credible actress's demands. Still, she had been partnered with an understudy, Michelle, both to improve her acting during training and as a back up in case Phoebe was ever disposed. While her chemistry with the other stars wasn't as great (as the part required being boy crazy, which Phoebe could do in her sleep) she had more of an acting background and could uncannily nail Phoebe's look after plenty of makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat nobody had expected, nor had Phoebe fully come to terms with, was their aspiring lead porking-up! It had been pandemonium after Phoebe's tights had split on set. She was bawling her eyes out, staffers were trying to assist her and make her look decent, shooting that day was postponed until the afternoon. As for the director, who had gotten by with Phoebe's flirty tendencies, he couldn't deny that Phoebe's ass looked damn fine even as it was fat! But the wardrobe malfunction was the last scrape of the proverbial iceberg. Phoebe's stomach and thighs had also taken their share of weight and that didn't match the vision of the character for the TV show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the waterworks were renewed afresh when Phoebe had to be told she was being replaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe them!!\" She licked a heaping spoonful of mint chip. \"They said I no longer 'got it.' I thought I was just 'getting it!' You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had been pouring her heart out unwarranted to any of her roommate's time as she continued her spiel and pity ice cream party. Mint chip joined the growing pile of emptied candy bar crunch, rainbow sorbet, dulce le duce, and banana's foster cartons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really?\" came the reply, as her reluctant listener passed over the tissue box as Phoebe blew her nose for the umpteenth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it Reagan, Audrey, Uma or Ixchel listening to Phoebe's woes?</span></div></div>",

A girl in her emotional state had no time for clean eating and, as such, wore a rather uncharacteristic smear of cream around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan chuckled at her sisters attempt at anger

her backside along with a slither of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe sighed heavily before proceeding with her crusade against any and everything dairy in the house, quickly finding herself at the bottom of the tub.<br>\r\nPeering over her shoulder, Reagan couldn't help but smile, far too pleased with her self exhibition to pass comment on Phoebe's continued binging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is just rubbish\" complained Phoebe, tossing the empty carton aside and pulling her robe slightly tighter around herself for warmth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not THAT bad Phebes\" comforted Reagan with a smidgen of sincerity behind her words as she sat down with a gentle thump of her butt spreading slightly on her seat \"last I heard some guys LIKE girls with HUGE arses\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not THAT big Reagan\" defended Phoebe, throwing her spoon at her unsuspecting twin, leaving a sizeable red mark up her arm to go along with the resonating smacking sound from impact<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, bitch\" spat Reagan, clutching at her arm whilst Phoebe giggled into her hand, amused by the effect of her outburst \"you can get me some chocolate for that, assuming you haven't eating it all, elephant arse\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh chocolate\" cooed Phoebe with a twinkle in her eye, almost oblivious of the demand as she sprung to her feet and strutted towards the poor unsuspecting cupboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill clutching her arm and muttering many a profanity under her breath, Reagan just glanced up at her sister as she walked away and found herself surprised at what she saw.<br>\r\n'Woah' muttered the twin under her breath as she watched Phoebe's bloated rear jiggle away from its perch at the nook.<br>\r\nNow, Reagan wasn't stupid and was well aware of the fact that Phoebe had been making like a birthday balloon over the past few weeks but she hadn't truly noticed the extent of the expansion and...quite the expansion it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a naturally bottom heavy duet, the twins were no strangers to ample rears and tight bottom wear but Reagan was suddenly aware that, for the first time in forever, Phoebe was now the more bottom heavy twin.<br>\r\nEven confined within her fluffy bathrobe, Phoebe's wobbling cheeks could be clearly seen fighting for dominance over a thicker silhouette than either twin previously possessed.<br>\r\nThe increase in size became even more apparent as Phoebe took to her tiptoes to reach a shelf whilst her robe hung off her shelf like behind, displaying the impressive rear bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with her acquisitions, Phoebe turned tail and headed back to her seat alongside her sister.<br>\r\nAs she walked, hands laden with treats aplenty, Reagan couldn't help but notice the extent of the damage to her sister's front.<br>\r\nRobe now open at the front, a clear view of Phoebe's bloated stomach could be seen, albeit not improved with her still continuing binge, but it was obvious that the girl had put on weight around her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, her hips were flaring slightly more which only accented her plumpening rear, but her usually tight and trim stomach was straining her bed top beyond its capacity.<br>\r\nQuite literally.<br>\r\nA gentle curve was protruding from her shirt, now sitting higher than the redhead usually cared to wear them now residing just south of her belly button, as the fabric was pulled taut over a considerably more chubby abdominal region than the twin had previously sported.<br>\r\n'Well at least she's getting fat all over' mused Reagan to herself whilst a niggle worked at the back of her mind 'the size of her ass really boils my piss though'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go\" chirped Phoebe, breaking Reagan from her thought as a chocolate bar dropped in front of her<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" muttered Reagan, peeling the wrapper off as she continued to fume about Phoebe's developing assets<br>\r\nPhoebe just smiled at her as she took a sizeable bite from a much larger bar than the one she had given to her sister<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what's with the size of that?\" cried Reagan, nearly launching herself out of her seat with her outburst<br>\r\n\"I'm still sad\" retorted Phoebe after swallowing her mouthful, a delicate smear of chocolate adorning her lips alongside the ice cream as the not so elegant airhead returned to her chocolate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That bitch is deliberately making her ass bigger than mine!' Reagan thought angrily as she bit into her chocolate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok Reagan?\" asked Phoebe, genuine concern flooding her face as she spoke<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, fine\" mumbled her twin, rather assertively biting into the bar in her hand<br>\r\n\"Good, you know you can talk to me about anything, you've helped me so much today\" smiled the ditzy twin<br>\r\n\"Oh I bet\" growled Reagan, but luckily her passive aggressiveness was lost on the innocent recipient who was too busy stuffing her face</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm going to school!\" shouted Phoebe to noone in particularly as she opened the front door, shouldering her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all expectations, the conversation between Phoebe and her twin had actually helped the aspiring actress. It had taken the best part of a week to get her out of her pyjamas and she was still obliviously putting food away like she'd never eaten before but she was on the up now and getting back into her routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her ditzy tendencies, Phoebe did actually enjoy going to college.<br>\r\nAll her friends were there and, of course, it gave her chance to act which, in her own words, was 'all she lived for'.<br>\r\nThat did ignore her fact she also 'lived for' guys but that was besides the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out onto the townhouse steps, Phoebe felt a gentle pull on the front door as she was about to close it and instinctively let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie, mind if I walk with you?\" asked Audrey as she slid through the door before it closed her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" smiled Phoebe, missing Audrey hip checking the doorframe on her way out. Had it been Reagan an undoubtedly scathing comment would have been passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween their different schedules and social circles, the two sisters rarely got the opportunity to socialise together, even less so without the accompanying audience of the rest of the household, so the morning walk proved pleasant and showed the evident friendship between sisters.<br>\r\nAudrey just wished she didn't have to make things awkward with her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got many classes today Phebes?\" asked Audrey, biting her lip cautiously as she knew where the conversation had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just the one but then I'm meeting up with some friends, haven't seen them in ages!\" replied Phoebe, smiling ear to ear as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice\" quietly returned Audrey, taking a deep breath before continuing \"Look, we all know you've had a hard time after loosing that role a couple of weeks back but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe stopped in the middle of the street, resulting in a disgruntled business man walking into the back of her that the oblivious redhead had not even been aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and it's still hard now Aud, it really sucks\" the younger Durant insisted with tears starting to well in her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it' thought Audrey 'better get it over with now'<br>\r\n\"It's just that, the house could really do with some extra money coming in and I wondered if you'd be able to find a job to help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was never one for confrontation and her mother hen tendencies were desperately trying to fight to the front so she could comfort her emotional sister but she had to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" shrugged Phoebe, flicking her hair back whilst staring dejectedly at the pavement \"I just need to get a new role and I need all my spare time to do that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got your agent though for that\" said Audrey, a little more heavy handed than she may have intended<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" murmured the redhead as she slowly started to walk again, suggesting Audrey had got away with her slight bite<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll try?\" asked the Durant matriach, putting a hand on Phoebe's shoulder as they resumed walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe just nodded, sniffing rather forcefully to hold her tears back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" smiled Audrey, pulling Phoebe into a proper hug now \"plus, now you're back to college you'll be able to use your meal card a bit rather than the kitchen which will help\"<br>\r\nBig mistake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh screw you Audrey\" screamed Phoebe, tossing her sisters arm off her shoulders \"you're just as bad as that stupid film company, why does only Reagan get me!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that outburst, Phoebe stormed off in front of her sister making a beeline for college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy vey\" muttered Audrey, watching her sister marching away from her.<br>\r\nThe blonde hadn't meant anything by it but it was hard to deny the young redhead did make a sizable dint in the weekly food budget.<br>\r\nPhoebe may have actually had grounds to be upset, mind, were it not for the sheer amount of movement from her ever increasing rear end as she stormed off, jiggling with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe's acting class was quite interesting today, they were dealing with physical interactions, stage fights and the likes. Luckily Phoebe was pissed so it worked in her favour, that is, until she actually slapped her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I think that's enough for today\" called the tutor on the back of the echoing slap, stepping between the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, sorry Lizzy\" offered Phoebe, hands clasped over her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it\" smiled Lizzy, patting her on the shoulder whilst nursing her cheek \"just warn me next time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe smiled with a small giggle as she went to grab her things and trotted out of the door.<br>\r\nAdjusting her bag strap and sliding a shoe back onto her foot, Phoebe stopped in her tracks as a rather menacing voice came from behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you think you're going missy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared, Phoebe slowly turned round to see who the voice had come from and immediately dropped her bag, flinging herself backwards with a loud squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you guys! I've missed you so much!\" squawked the redhead as she hugged the two people behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, the three amigos headed to the university food court, grabbed themselves some food and found a table away in one corner.<br>\r\nEver the social butterfly, Phoebe was never without any number of friends, but the two sat opposite her were definitely her best and closest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana was Latina, the same age as Phoebe and was studying dance. The two had come across each other during an intersubject coalition project in their first year involving their respective studies and had never looked back since.<br>\r\nEver since, the two had become near inseparable, often leading the charge on nights out and class projects alike.<br>\r\nIn slight contrast to the redhead, Tiana had become quite the curvaceous chick as a result of their partying and sported quite the thick figure, largely in an hourglass shape. Unlike a good deal of college girls though, Tiana drove straight into that skid and adored her body, not unlike her parade of one night stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside the wild party girl, there was Ryan who, for lack of a better words, was nothing like Phoebe at all.<br>\r\nThe quiet guy studied English Lit or something boring like that and rarely ever made his presence known at parties. On the contrary, he was more often than not the stand by 'designated driver' or 'overnight stop over'.<br>\r\nAs such, Phoebe and Ryan's friendship had largely blossomed around a toilet bowl, him holding her hair back as she puked up many a litre of cheap booze.<br>\r\nAll the same, he was sweet and Phoebe wouldn't have him anywhere else than by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and then, they fired me for splitting my costume!\" announced Phoebe to her friends, punctuating the sentence with a tirade of fries passing her lips.<br>\r\nTiana and Ryan cautiously glanced at each other at this announcement. Upon reuniting with Phoebe, it had not gone amiss that she was...more shapely than the last time they saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's be honest though girl, not to diss you, but you keep eating fries like that your ass is gonna be bigger than mine\" interjected Tiana, idly stirring her milkshake as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft\" spat Phoebe as she took a large bite of burger \"I wish my ass was as big as yours, T\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it's important to note that Phoebe's oblivious nature granted her a great deal of respect for Tiana's outlook on her size even if irony made her easily offended at her own bottomly girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not kidding girl, butt check!\" declared Tiana, standing from her seat and turning tail to Ryan.<br>\r\nNot one to shy away from messing around, Phoebe rolled her eyes, scarfed down another handful of fries and joined her friend.<br>\r\nAs the two girls squeezed together, hip to hip with arms laced around each others hips, Ryan couldn't help but feel bemused at his current position. He loved Phoebe and Tiana no end but they certainly knew how to tease his quiet nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" called the girls, glancing over their adjoined shoulders \"whats the verdict?\"<br>\r\nBrought from his thoughts, Ryan played the part, leaning back in his seat and holding his chin in a thoughtful pose, one which brought a giggle from the two women.<br>\r\nOn the left stood Phoebe, daisy dukes and leggings encasing her definitely increased rear whilst, on the right, stood Tiana also wearing leggings albeit considerably more stretched than Phoebe's. It went without saying that the Hispanic bombshell was in possession of the larger assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at this particular moment its fair to say that Tiana is definitely still the superior size by quite a margin...\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe\" winked Tiana through the middle of Ryan's sentence<br>\r\n\"...but Phebes is definitely on the rise\" summarised Ryan \"I mean, those dukes look tight man\"<br>\r\n\"Aww really?\" groaned Phoebe, stroking her backside to test the tightness of the denim \"I only got these last week\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Phebes, definitely tight\" conceded Ryan as the two girls returned to their seats<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to linger, Phoebe continued to moan about the other problem plaguing her happy existence.<br>\r\n\"Audrey wants me to get a job as well, apparently I eat too much at home\" grumbled Phoebe, working her way through her burger.<br>\r\nAgain, unsure of how to proceed, Tiana and Ryan looked at each other before replying.<br>\r\n\"You got any ideas? No acting jobs coming up?\" asked Ryan<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I need to see my agent\" mused Phoebe, wiping her hands of grease.<br>\r\n\"Anyway\" Tiana butted in again \"more importantly, when are you and me partying again? Sounds like you need a blow out hon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe couldn't help but agree, she had been stressed and Tiana always knew how to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many decisions for such a ditzy girl to make...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Phoebe had lifted herself out of her funk after talking with her twin (and eating plenty of ice cream) Reagan got into her own funk. For the life of her, she couldn't approach a world where <i>Phoebe</i> had the bigger rear of the two. Yes, she was plumping up like a damn turkey but that wobbly, bootylicious rear brought instant envy in Reagan's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had always considered herself the 'hotter' of the two twins. She was the older by two seconds and the first to blossom in late middle school, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. So she was caught on the blindside that while Phoebe was gaining weight, a proportionate amount of it went to the twin's shared best asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Phoebe's ass eclipsed her own! Reagan couldn't let that stand, nor could she eat her chocolate bar in a dignified manner as she demolished it in large bites. After a second chocolate bar she went into her toaster pastry stash, not even popping them in the toaster, as she ate frosted raspberry and cookies and cream packets plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, both girls had the phenotype to put most of their weight in their rears. So all Reagan would have to go is start eating as much as Phoebe (or rather, more than Phoebe) and her booty would swell out more than her younger twin's in no time. All Reagan would have to do is make sure she didn't gain weight anyplace else which would tone down her hotness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a box of mixed pastries in hand, Reagan went to the one other resident of the townhouse that could help her in her mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you want to work out with me?\" Uma scratched her shoulder, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-athlete\u2019s confusion was twofold as Reagan had never taken up her offer of gym days in the past. The fiery redhead considered her good looks a gift of genetics and thus didn\u2019t consider the need to work-out. Plus, going to the gym left her smelly and sweaty, something Reagan didn\u2019t like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Uma was currently not the star reference of personal fitness anymore as she had gone to seed. She had been partying and chowing down at the same places as Phoebe but the black hedonistic athlete wore her weight very differently. Her abs were mostly covered by a fine layer of pudge from a growing gut. Her thighs had thickened out and her rear had filled out, although Uma never had the silhouette of the twins. The other half of her recent gain had settled around her upper body. Her shoulders and arms had rounded out, becoming less toned, and her chest looked to have accumulated more fat than her sports bras had ever been used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t help that Uma had been spending most of her time between parties lounging about the townhouse, wearing little more than team jerseys and her panties. Reagan had just woken her up from a \u2018power nap.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Reagan spoke between mouthfuls of cramming toaster pastries down her mouth, confusing Uma all the more. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve been telling me about all the health benefits before, and you know tons about body shaping.\u201d The glutes were the biggest muscle on the body, weren\u2019t they? Reagan just needed to enhance that muscle and keep her fat stores centered there to have a spectacular ass to put her fattened twin to shame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez Reagan, I\u2019m surprised you want to but I\u2019m not really available\u2026\u201d Uma couldn\u2019t think of a decent excuse to explain away her laziness. Her natural talent for sports had been hampered by her lack of dedication before, as Uma had fallen into another destructive spiral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I really need your help!\u201d Reagan munched. \u201cYou know the important parts of a workout, Uma, nobody else here understands fitness the way you do. Tell you what, let\u2019s have lunch and make gym plans over that. I\u2019ll take you to Brass Tops, my treat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had Uma hook, link and sinker as the black roommate reflexively licked her lips at the mention of Brass Tops. 8422 Fordham Avenue was adjacent to a developing dining and shopping hub and Brass Tops was one of the best. It was a buffet that offered plenty of ritzy options for its price like prime rib and crab legs. It was one of Uma\u2019s favorite places it eat. And Reagan liked that it was all you could eat, as she looked to be putting that to the test on the quest for more booty filling calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation of Brass Tops nearly brought Uma into the mindset of training with Reagan. Her mind held out for one last condition. \u201cOkay, but I\u2019ve got one last request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName it,\u201d Reagan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa got pumpkin spice tarts in there?\u201d Uma asked with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught Reagan mid-bite, her cheeks filled with crumbs and fillings as she scowled darkly. \u201cFine,\u201d Reagan spat out. She hated the loss of calories for her warped plan to gain in her butt and the loss of the most treasured tarts in her secret stash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Reagan!\u201d Uma also popped open the pumpkin spice without toasting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so a plan was made.<br>\r\nOver an extremely decedent meal at Brass Tops Reagan and Uma came to an agreement whereby the two would work out together at least twice a week.<br>\r\nThere was also talk of making Brass Tops a regular thing, you know, to treat themselves and balance out the exercise appropriately, although that was here nor there at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Reagan was getting changed ready for her first gym session and she was pleased.<br>\r\nWearing nothing more than a sports bra and full length sports leggings, the flaming haired twin was checking herself out in her bedroom mirror and the view was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmph you sexy bitch, Phoebe can\u2019t handle this\u201d commentated Reagan as she looked herself up and down, turning to examine all her tightly packed curves one bulge at a time.<br>\r\nGlancing over her shoulder, arse facing her mirror squarely, Reagan couldn\u2019t help but chew her lip slightly in admiration of her most abundant asset, giving the bulging left half a healthy slap just to watch it wobble within its stretchy confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, Reagan was wrenched back to reality by the cloying shouts of Uma from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready Reagan?\u201d shouted her guide and mentor for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan groaned before straightening up with her hands on her hips before issuing a curt nod to her reflection.<br>\r\n\u201cTime to but that pig in her place\u201d muttered Reagan in regards to her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d groaned Reagan as her feet pounded against the treadmill she was on, vast patches of sweat darkening the natural grey and pink of her outfit.<br>\r\nPanting desperately for breath with her entire body aching as she mindlessly continued, Reagan wanted nothing more than to stop the punishment she was forcing herself through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018God damn Phoebe, forcing me to teach her a lesson!\u2019 thought Reagan, gritting her teeth as sweat poured down her face as locks of fiery hair clung to her burning cheeks.<br>\r\nAs she cursed her sister, Reagan thought the moment would never end until suddenly it did with a crashing halt involving ribs into the treadmill control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling with a whole new ache in her stomach, Reagan shot a look at Uma who had activated the emergency stop on the machine.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that for?!\u201d barked Reagan, cradling her middle whilst angrily brushing her hair out of her face, albeit ineffectively as most of her hair stayed plastered to her face over her eyes and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her housemates sharp breaths blow her hair in and out, Uma couldn\u2019t help but laugh.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Red, you lasted...3 minutes before sounding ready to die so I offered a bit of mercy\u201d retorted Uma simply as she took a deep chug from her protein shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContorting her face quite viciously to display her disgust, Reagan threw her hands up and then slapping her shapely thighs.<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s 3 minutes more than you\u2019ve done tubby!\u201d spat Reagan, going straight for the jugular as she often did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d defended Uma, nervously sipping her shake \u201cI\u2019m bulking for optimum muscle gain\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right\u201d muttered Reagan, folding her arms whilst glaring at her housemate \u201cwell you\u2019re my trainer so tell me what to do\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok\u201d started Uma, much more calmly this time \u201chow about we try the rowing machines?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah whatever\u201d grunted Reagan as she stepped off the treadmill, veering violently as both feet hit the solid floor<br>\r\nUma snorted behind her, having frequently seen gym patrons stagger off treadmills often.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up\u201d grunted Reagan as she wiggled towards the rowing machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis...is worse...than the treadmill!\u201d shouted Reagan between pulls of the rower, glaring angrily at the still stood and inactive Uma at the foot of the machine<br>\r\nThe sadist in Uma was apparently present as all she did was laugh at the younger girls suffering as she drained the last of her shake.<br>\r\n\u201cOh screw you\u201d hissed the redhead as she continued to yank on the handlebar as Uma continued to chortle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sweat pouring off her brow and what felt like her entire body drenched, Reagan caught a glimpse of two guys behind her in the mirror on exercise bikes who were far from subtly staring at her sizable rear arcing in the saddle of the rowing machine.<br>\r\nNever one to shy away from pleasing guys, Reagan managed to dig deeper and continue the show that was been so well received from behind her.<br>\r\nNoticing her increase in effort, the two guys openly perked up, one even catching Reagan\u2019s eye with a wink in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like all things though, Reagan\u2019s little show came to a crashing halt as her lacking fitness caught up with her and she pulled herself up from the infernal machine, breathing heavily as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinished?\u201d asked Uma with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to speak, Reagan simply nodded whilst gulping in air, wiping sweat from her forehead as she staggered towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing once again, Uma followed after her progeny as they passed the two gentlemen that had been ogling Reagan.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing more of her boys\u201d declared Uma with a wry grin, teasingly slapping one of them on the back as she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarginally aware of Uma\u2019s comment, Reagan couldn\u2019t help but smile to herself<br>\r\n\u2018Damn right there\u2019ll be more\u2019 mused the redhead, a fraction more spring returning to her step as she limped out of the gym doors, still panting heavily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI call dibs,\u201d Reagan gasped as she stumbled into the townhouse, \u201con the shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, we could have just gone at the gym,\u201d Uma replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw,\u201d Reagan gagged. While she liked to show off her curves she didn\u2019t want to be seen showering in such a sorry state after their first workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Uma said, her stomach full of protein shake but still betraying a rumble at the thought of their \u2018victory\u2019 meal at Brass Tops. Even if she had been working out Uma wouldn\u2019t want to go there in her gym clothes. Although she found her natural musk to be a primal sort of attraction, so unlike Reagan all she would do would be to change clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Reagan\u2019s dismay, the shower sounded occupied when she got to the bathroom. \u201cWhat the frick?\u201d She pounded on the door. \u201cHey! You finished up in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower turned off. Then after a minute, Reagan saw her own face shrouded by steam and towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi Reagan,\u201d said Phoebe. \u201cBack so soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan cringed. \u201cWell, you have to work your way up when going to the gym.\u201d The sight of her twin wearing nothing but towels filled her with further determination on her body shaping scheme. Phoebe\u2019s hips and rear challenged the knot she had made with the towel tied around her lower half. Reagan could note every inch of blubber and chunky love handles settled on her plumping twin\u2019s middle. Water dripping from the bulge of her budding potbelly. Even her breasts looked a mite bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGawd, how much does she really eat? Reagan thought to herself. It didn't matter. Once Reagan could increase her calories and workouts she\u2019d have as large of a rear and still look hot, while her twin turned into a blimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all yours,\u201d Phoebe offered, pulling Reagan out of her thoughts, as she tightened the knot on the towel. The tension was needed as her wobbling, jiggling backside threaded to squirm it\u2019s way out of the cover providing Phoebe her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep to the plan, keep to the plan,\u201d Reagan muttered to herself as she stripped to get ready for her shower. Although when she turned on the shower she gave out a shrill cry at the chill. \u201cDamnit Phoebe!!\u201d Her twin had used up all the hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe her,\u201d Reagan was still miffed by the lack of hot water even as she and Uma entered Brass Tops. She had changed into a maroon long sleeved shirt that left her shoulders bare and a pair of leaf patterned leggings. Subconsciously she had chose clothing with a lot of give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what\u2019s got you so worked up about Phoebe?\u201d Uma asked, still trying to sort out Reagan\u2019s motivations. The ex-athlete was in casual club wear, with an indigo shirt and ripped jeans. She was fully clothed although a definite bulge could be seen about her midriff as she started getting chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan just fumed in silent reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look,\u201d Uma was distracted by the menu as they approached the customer counter at Brass Tops. \u201cIt\u2019s Barbecue day! Score!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass Tops was aptly named as the buffet lines and serving trays were brass, as the restaurant used other earthy, neutral tones to compliment the decor. Signature entrees would be traded out over the course of the week. When barbecue was featured it included dry rub pork ribs, smoked sausage, beef brisket, baked chicken and some of the best sides you could pick for these dishes, like coleslaw, baked beans and for Uma\u2019s favorite collard greens that put her own mother\u2019s to shame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince dining at Brass Tops earlier in the week Reagan and Uma refamilarized themselves with the layout of the buffet. There was the salad line, the condiment line, the entree line, the sides line, the seafood line, the grill station, and the dessert bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies hit the lines as soon as they paid for the table. Uma sat down first, with a plate loaded with ribs, cornbread, greens, fried okra and a chicken drumstick. She had grabbed a Pepsi to drink. She happily forked into the greens and munched on the drumstick as Reagan took considerably longer up at the lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason soon became apart as Reagan sat down three plates! The first was a salad of spring greens and broccoli loaded with thick creamy ranch, bacon bits, and shredded cheeses. The second had ribs, smoked sausage and fish sticks with tarter sauce, with macaroni on the side. The third was a hodgepodge of baked beans, rice, beef taquitos, oven baked chips, green bean casserole, cheddar biscuits and orange jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn girl!\u201d Uma said. \u201cTrying for everything at once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m tired and sore,\u201d Reagan complained. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t want to go up again.\u201d Besides her workout fatigue, Reagan was also in calorie loading mode and didn\u2019t want to lose any potential gain she could direct towards her ass on her journey to beat Phoebe with the better booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Uma shrugged, returning to her drumstick. \u201cAt least when I go up next I can get freshly made food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next fifteen minutes the two young women ate in silence, obsessed with their food. Uma\u2019s appetite had been growing alongside Phoebe\u2019s with their frequent clubbing, as she remained oblivious to how she had enabled both Phoebe\u2019s gain and Reagan\u2019s crazed ambition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger roommate was finding that, much like exercising, she might have bitten off more than she could chew with this \u2018over-eating and workout\u2019 diet to reclaim the lost title of the bigger Durant twin ass. Reagan had only started overeating and once she had finished her salad plate the other two mocked her. Each was still half full even as her stomach started feeling tight. While Uma was up for her second helping Reagan took the reprieve to lean back in their booth, face twisted in agony as she struggled to consume everything she felt she needed to catch back up with Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrowing in the towel, Red?\u201d Uma teased, with a repeat plate of her first only she had traded the drumstick for a petite steak off the grill. While Uma was eating more she ate for indulgent comfort and wasn\u2019t aiming to stuff herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of towel Reagan thought back to catching Phoebe coming out of the shower. Her towel clad twin had left little to the imagination of how much she had gained weight. Yes, her thighs were meaty and her belly had too much wobble ... <i>but that zatfig ass!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Reagan pushed out a second wind, stabbing at her smoked sausage with a fork and following that up with rice. Her stubbornness rallied against the pain she was feeling in her stomach as she wanted to prove Uma wrong, making more progress towards her plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma ended up with dinner and a show as she laughed inwardly watching Reagan proceed to chow down like a woman possessed. She quickly threw together a brownie sundae up at the dessert bar to not miss the laborious meal Reagan pushed herself through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had been dining there for about an hour Uma\u2019s spoon rattled in her empty sundae bowl. \u201cMan girl, that was some good eating.\u201d She scratched her stomach, pleasantly stuffed, grinning as she took in the discomfort on Reagan\u2019s face. The redhead had sat shock still for over five minutes after she had completed the Herculean effort of demolishing her three loaded plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want dessert Red?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*hurgh*\u201d Reagan did want the calories to soak into her ass but her overtaxed stomach had blocked out any future thoughts of food in her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep this up and we may have to work out three or more times a week,\u201d Uma commented with some self-realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine and dandy,\u201d Reagan replied, mentally tracking herself through booty-popping exercises as she fought against the urge to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s what Uma said anyway\u2019 <br>\r\nNot that Uma was even at the gym, she\u2019d disappeared after making a pig of herself at breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Maybe he has a point though\u2019 pondered Reagan as she glanced down at her stomach, idly stroking the bulging curve with her thin fingers.<br>\r\nLost in thought as she slowly caressed her tummy, gentle shivers radiating from her touch, provoking a small smile from her shapely lips as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Pull yourself together Reagan, if he thinks you\u2019re fat thank god Phoebe was it at the gym\u2019<br>\r\nThe bitchy comment did make Reagan smirk, Phoebe was seriously chubbing up lately.<br>\r\nIf only her god damn ass would stop growing then this feud could end with Reagan back as queen of the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well, look who it is\u201d called an all too familiar voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh\u201d groaned Reagan under her breath as she swallowed the last of her twix as the rowdy guys from inside the gym walked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle chunker stopped off at the vending machine huh?\u201d teased the crude guy, irony hitting Reagan as she noticed a kitkat chunky in his hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you liked my ass so much I figured I\u2019d contribute a little extra for when you got out\u201d plainly stated Reagan with a shrug of her still slender shoulders, licking her lips rather seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crude guy chuckled with an understanding nod and a glance to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what red, you take this\u201d he said as he tossed the kitkat towards Reagan with a wry grin and a wink \u201cand you give me a call when you lose some weight\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably not worth my time but I can always appreciate a peanut butter kitkat\u201d purred Reagan, tearing the wrapper clean off and taking a large, slow bite accompanied by a soft throaty moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh if only you were skinny\u201d mused Mr Crude, passing Reagan on his way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAble to care less given his stinking attitude, Reagan set about the kitkat with gusto before realising she still had company from a rather more nervous voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about him, he\u2019s a bit of a...\u201d started the other member of the pair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dick\u201d bluntly put Reagan as the last of the kitkat joined the twix<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...sorry\u201d continued Mr Nervous \u201cif it makes you feel any better then I think you\u2019re really pretty\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know I am\u201d purred Reagan again, crossing her legs as she rested on her seat \u201ccome here shy boy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, the young guy walked towards her before finding himself swept off his feet and locked lips with the seated redhead.<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as it started though, it was over and the guy stumbled back tentatively in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think anything of it\u201d asserted Reagan with a stern look \u201cjust a reminder to your friend that being a prick won\u2019t get him anywhere\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the quiet guy could do was nod before starting to walk off, only to walk into Reagan\u2019s outstretched arm<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the chocolate bar though as payment\u201d declared Reagan, clenching her fist in a beckoning manner.<br>\r\nStill lost for words, a second kick at was placed in Reagan\u2019s hand before the deliverer scuttled off back to his brash mouthed friend as the redhead smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still got it girl\u201d mused Reagan to herself as she tore into her second kitkat with gusto.</span></div></div>",

work and the subsequent conversation with Reagan, Phoebe had actually managed to find peace with the situation.<br>\r\n\"Sure, I might have been replaced but that just means the role wasn't right for me\" she would tell anyone who asked, usually whilst downing one of many drinks or between bites of whatever food item the redhead was ploughing through at that particular moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here lay the true coping mechanisms employed by Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, the little ice cream binge that had taken place whilst Reagan 'comforted' Phoebe had not been the last nor were her gluts limited to ice cream which, combined with Uma's terrible partying influences, had led to Phoebe's greatly improved mood regarding the situation.<br>\r\nIt did not take long for such indulgences to continue to greatly improve her figure either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...shut up...\" groaned Phoebe in the direction of her blaring phone alarm as she lazily slapped her phone to silence the infernal noise.<br>\r\nWith peace now radiating through her sun dappled bedroom, Phoebe smiled as she rolled onto her back allowing her eyes to slowly flutter open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, last night was crazy\" mumbled the redhead as she wriggled and stretched within the confines of her covers, limbs all over the place much like her hair after not showering following a sweaty night of partying.<br>\r\nAs her smile widened slightly as vague wavering memories of the night before came back to her in drabs, her lips were torn apart more violently by a sudden belch.<br>\r\nGiggling to herself at the sudden 'interruption', Phoebe covered her mouth as the faint tastes of alcohol and grease tickled her tongue playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, last night was good\" purred the redhead as she hunkered down deeper into her covers for comfort, swiping her phone up to inspect her digital memories of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time slowly meandered around Phoebe as she scrolled through countless pictures and videos whilst replying to messages, a sudden call from downstairs caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe!\" came Audrey's voice up the stairs \"someone's at the door for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis announcement confused the young redhead as she lay in her bed still.<br>\r\nNoone had said they were coming to see her today so who could this be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the smell hit her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, pizza\" purred Phoebe as she almost hypnotically slid to the edge of her bed, dangling her legs out to allow her to stand.<br>\r\nThen, rather daintily, she sprung from her bed and to her feet.<br>\r\nAnd then, from her planted position, her body just carried on jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, the skimpy and revealing nature of her pyjamas probably wasn't helping the situation but it was impossible to deny that Phoebe was becoming positively plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all fairness to her, Phoebe's face had remained relatively thin and she was as radiantly beautiful as ever but the rest of her figure was without doubt bigger in some way or another.<br>\r\nAs a naturally shapely girl, Phoebe's assets had taken a fair proportion of her new weight.<br>\r\nHer thighs and hips were noticeably thicker whilst her rounder breasts were bulging out of the top of her now too small bra giving her an impressive display of cleavage.<br>\r\nWithout surprise, her arse had remained dominant by quite a margin and, still forming two perfectly smooth and rounded domes behind her, had proven to bulge beyond the extents of most single chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost surprising based on her past though was the now visible belly that had formed more recently.<br>\r\nTypically pale for her hair colour, the soft pudge spilling out from under her vest top sat heavily on top of her waistband and wobbled gently with every step that she took.<br>\r\nAlthough she didn't often expose her growing stomach, Phoebe did not always have the luxury of choice as her rapidly increasing size had led her to outgrow a lot of her clothes in some capacity or another.<br>\r\nAs such, her growing midriff got more airtime than the former skinny redhead may have liked, although her current experience showed that guys were rarely put off by it, much to her own enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe!\" shouted Audrey again, obviously adamant to have her sister deal with the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" cried back Phoebe as she threw her door open and skipped toward the stairs.<br>\r\nThe motion of skipping was enough to set her growing body off jiggling again but, much to her own surprise, Phoebe found she didn't hate the feeling as much as she may have even led herself to believe at one point.<br>\r\nThe way the young Durant twin saw it, she could eat what she wanted, STILL get all the attention she wanted and she was still fricking hot.<br>\r\nWhat did it matter if she got a bit chubby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, didn't think you were going to come\" mused Audrey with her arms folded in her mum stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, well I'm here now\" smiled Phoebe, oblivious as ever<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good because I'm not paying for all this pizza Phebes\" announced Audrey as she pulled the door open again to reveal a young guy holding three pizza boxes \"why did you even order this much? It's barely even lunch time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I don't remember...\" frowned Phoebe, this particular moment proving to be a blank<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may\" interjected the guy on the steps \"the young lady ordered these last night, asked us to drop some food off for 'a very hungover babe as soon as you open', gave us this address\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe awkwardly looked around before the penny finally dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I did do that!\" announced the redhead with glee, bouncing gently on her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And might I say for everyone at my shop, this is a very clever idea and we're looking into offering pre-ordering as a service\" smiled the young man at the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should totally do that!\" outburst Phoebe \"I would totally order from you guys all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy laughed as he passed the pizza boxes through the door to Phoebe<br>\r\n\"Well consider these a commission for your idea, on the house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" shouted Phoebe, fist bumping with her free hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you just give us a call when you need any more pizzas\" called the delivery man as he walked away, throwing Phoebe a wink as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will\" purred Phoebe, leaning forward slightly to give him a view before throwing her own wink in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe this Aud? Free pizza for drunk ordering some for the next day!\" cried out Phoebe as she heavily dropped herself onto the sofa before popping the lid on the first pizza<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, great win\" mused Audrey, not entirely committed to the conversation as other things crossed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right\" continued Phoebe as she hungrily bit into a large slice cradled between both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nervously chewed her lip as she mulled through her thoughts before finally biting the bullet instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Phoebe, I love you and I just wanted to check that you're ok after the whole job thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I'm fine\" smiled Phoebe, melted cheese all around her lips which she promptly licked off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...you just seem to not be as focused on acting since and I'm worried about you gaining weight\" continued Audrey, concerned she'd stretched too far<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe paused her eating for a moment, slowly swallowing her mouthful as she looked at her big sister.<br>\r\nAudrey could feel herself sweating as she braced herself for her sister's response.<br>\r\nShe really didn't want to upset Phoebe and she was concerned that if this went badly there was no way she could talk to Reagan about the fact that SHE was piling on the pounds as well.<br>\r\nAs this thought burnt away in Audrey's mind she nearly missed the fact that Phoebe practically inhaled her slice of pizza before diving into another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Audrey, it's fine, I actually kinda like it and all the guys seem to like it too so I can't really complain\" replied Phoebe with a smile as she idly rubbed her exposed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as long as you're sure\" returned Audrey, feeling like she wasn't out of the woods yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides\" started Phoebe again \"it's only a few pounds, you can worry if I stop being able to walk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey knew her sister was hopefully joking but it was always hard to tell with the ditz of the clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's all the same to you Phebes, I'll worry a little bit before then\" asserted Audrey to clarify her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe simply nodded before holding out the open pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a slice Aud?\" offered the younger twin with the box at full stretch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey hesitated.<br>\r\n\"S...Sure, thanks\" replied Audrey as she peeled a slice away from the others, taking a tentative bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you're helping me already\" smiled Phoebe with a joke in her eye as she continued to binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey laughed nervously as she worked through her slice, looking her sister up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Must keep an eye on this one' Audrey noted in her head, motherly tendencies striking up instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Audrey may have bitten off more than she could chew in trying to help Phoebe. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">(Hah!!)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer youngest sister, accounting for the seconds difference in the twins, had been wayward of late. Especially for Phoebe. While Audrey wasn't as sure of her modeling or acting before it had been a lucrative job the youngest Durant sister had taken to, without too much of an impact on her studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there was no denying that Phoebe had put on quite the amount of weight in a short amount of time. Was that really from partying with Uma once or twice a week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality, Uma and Phoebe were out most nights a week, downplaying just how much they spent partying. Audrey had been plenty stressed with work and other matters that she had yet to get to the bottom of the situation. All she could see was the aftermath, as in the rounding bottom of Phoebe. The weight flourished in the lower regions of the pear shaped redhead. And Reagan was starting to pork up too, for reasons Audrey hadn't been able to fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after those initial prying questions Audrey felt the need to talk over with Phoebe some more. Get a better understanding of how her sister was feeling. Which ended up being over an impromptu lunch, as after the first slice Phoebe offered Audrey some more. While their was the very behavior Audrey was hoping to curtail, she felt that if she was too hard too soon on Phoebe that it would trigger one of the twin's infamous meltdowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, Aud, it's been great hanging out with you!\" Phoebe said after she had scarfed down her last slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it,\" Audrey moaned. \"Ooof!\" Audrey may have been plus size for most of her life but she rarely ate this much in one sitting. Of the three pizzas Phoebe had been given Audrey had ended up consuming most of one and a bit. Only by partaking in the pizza with Phoebe did Audrey get more insight into her sister's mindset. She didn't sound depressed or distraught, a little unfocused if anything, but there was nothing too troubling about her behavior outside of the weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Audrey's middle was feeling the immediate drawbacks of Phoebe's new tendency to indulge. To relieve some of the pressure of her full tum Audrey had to unbutton her slacks. Her stomach gurgled occasionally as the density of the food being disgusted was trying to send Audrey off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Phoebe, her recent overeating had conditioned her digestive track to take on this much food. Getting through almost two whole pizzas wasn't a sweat for her, compared to Audrey. She was contentedly sated, although still peckish if the right craving were to grab her attention. Her growing midriff bulged out further, heavy with food, as Phoebe subconsciously rubbed it to relieve some gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, <i>The Shoal</i> is on!\" Phoebe noted the time. \"That's your favorite, isn't it Aud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey didn't protest the TV being turned on. In the wake to reality shows like 'Jersey Shore' countless imitators of various waterfront hotspots had formed, the Shoal being one of them. It didn't take much to entertain Phoebe or Audrey, who enjoyed watching trashy TV together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow,\" Audrey observed the TV. \"Did you see how much purple and bronze she has in that bedroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, oh my gosh!\" Phoebe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulled into the glamour of people trying to live beyond their means and struggling to digest the pizza, Audrey lost her focus of time. She didn't know when, exactly, the sounds of crunching had started until she looked over to where Phoebe had returned to the couch with a bag of pretzel nuggets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some Audrey?\" Phoebe happily munched, offering the bag. \"Pinto and cheese flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh, I've had too much already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Aww,\" Phoebe shrugged, scooping another handful of the filled pretzel bites into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was the area of most concern Audrey had about Phoebe, her increased snacking as the obvious source of her weight gain. If Audrey hadn't already been comfortable on the couch, lost in her favorite genre of television, and fighting off a food coma, she would have sensibly put her foot down on the matter. Currently, however, Audrey had none of the willpower and mixed signals from her food addled mind. Bonding over her sister with pizza had felt like the two were getting closer again and as an older sister she did want to care for Phoebe's wellbeing. After all, hadn't she started eating the pizza to 'help' Phoebe in some fashion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go eating all of those,\" Audrey rescinded, plucking the bag from Phoebe's hands. \"I got those on the last grocery run.\" Slowly, she put a few pretzel nuggets in her mouth and chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These really make you thirsty,\" Audrey said, again missing that Phoebe had gone around to the kitchenette before returning to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iced tea?\" Phoebe offered, cracking open two Lipton bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Phoebe,\" Audrey took the drink, as she started to slide down the slippery slope of minding her own snacking. While Phoebe tended to overdo meals around her partying, Audrey took to the increased consumption through grazing, leading to both having excess calories over some noontime bonding as sisters.</span></div></div>",

Between partying into the early hours with Phoebe, binging and not going to the gym with Reagan and then sleeping most of the former athletes time was accounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at herself in the mirror, Uma grabbed her hefty stomach in both hands, watching as fat oozed between her fingers as angry stretch marks garnished her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up Uma!\u201d squealed Phoebe again, banging impatiently on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d shouted Uma back as she swiftly whipped her shirt down to cover as much of her gut as possible before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least Uma wasn\u2019t the only one looking less than thin these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Uma wasn\u2019t the only one looking a cheeseburger bigger than thin and, truthfully, was the smaller of the pair, Phoebe felt considerably differently about her weight situation.<br>\r\nAn opinion that was less modestly displayed in her outfit choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Uma awkwardly tried to cover herself and her expanding chub, Phoebe well and truly steered into the skid of her growing frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a pair of overly stretched tights, the redhead\u2019s hips and rear dominated her figure, so much so the external bulge of said rear was visible when looking at her face on, only to lead in to her closely pressed thighs.<br>\r\nFat continued to be squeezed out over the top of her leggings as well, forming meaty love handles either side above her hips.<br>\r\nThese thick rolls then tapered into the blossoming belly taking up the redhead\u2019s middle which curved and hung over her waistband slightly in one smooth pale surface, where it lay exposed, unable to be contained by her shirt.<br>\r\nHigher still, her boobs hadn\u2019t been left out in her gorging whilst her arms also sported a fine layer of fat to thicken them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d demanded Phoebe before grabbing hold of Uma\u2019s hand and dragging her towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh boy\u2019 thought the former athlete as she mentally prepared herself for what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep the food coming Nat, I\u2019m a hungry girl tonight!\u201d shouted Phoebe across the bar, having caught a glimpse of the full figured club owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat couldn\u2019t help but smirk before throwing a thumbs up towards the young Durant, disappearing into the kitchen as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna slow it down a bit Phebes? You\u2019ve nearly eaten through the entire menu tonight\u201d protested Uma before being silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, tonight\u2019s the night it happens!\u201d replied Phoebe, necking a full pint of beer in her stride before staggering from her stool towards Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must commemorate this moment, Snapchat picture!\u201d shouted Phoebe, wrapping her arm around Uma as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know Phoebe, I\u2019m not looking so great...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, just do what I do!\u201d cheered Phoebe as she stuck her bulging rear out in a sexy pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma reluctantly struck a semi pose for the photo, holding in a deep rooted sigh as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd...send!\u201d cooed Phoebe as she hammered away on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"There!\" Ixchel exhaled deeply, the relief of a multi-week project completion leaving her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ixchel didn't always partake of the same activities as her roommates, even the multiracial geek wasn't this asocial. She'd been holed up in the townhouse office on an important, extensive project for the med-tech company she worked at. For the past several weeks most of her time had been consumed by the project, she'd had to recode it from scratch twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she could put this to rest. She could relax and have fun with her friends again. She had to cut back on the streaming severely and she only saw the other residents of the townhouse at brief times. Crossing to the bathroom or kitchenette, or such, rarely a chance to say more than a few words. What with the night schedule of those going clubbing, gym workouts and multiple work or college stints, usually everyone else had been out as the bronze skinned Ixchel worked from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relief and cramped office air was causing her to perspire. She lifted a thin long sleeved lavender shirt from her indigo dress, looking for sweat patches and finding her tummy was more pudgy then she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Ixchel said sourly. All the stress of her job looked to have caused her to gain five or so pounds, long nights of using cheap food for nourishment as she sat at her workstation. The irony of her medical-tech career was not lost on Ixchel as she had never been a skinny-minnie, a trait she shared with Audrey from losing the genetic lottery. She bit her lip as she checked out her profile in her computer's camera. In a few weeks she'd have to be present at the launch of the new application she'd coded, public appearances being a rare time she had to leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould her business attire even fit her anymore? Ixchel's geek physique had the attributes of a plush teddy bear, both in size and color. She tended to be round all over, especially her front and chest, with her hips rounding out like her tummy. She tested for a double chin, her cheeks wide as she had a full moon face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" she banished her weight woes from her mind, eager to hang out with her roommates again. She'd missed doing anything of note with them over her sequestered coding project. Surely one of them could lift her spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel couldn't believe what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately exiting her office space, Ixchel had almost collided with another tenant. \"What the frick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Ixchel apologized, readjusting her glasses. \"I'm sorry...Reagan??\" The loudmouthed twin looked entirely different from what Ixchel remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geesus, Chel,\" Reagan chided, cocking her rear to one side and putting a hand to her hip. \"I thought you'd fallen off the face of the earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Ixchel mouthed. \"It was the project...at work-\" She didn't mean to stare but she couldn't help but look at just how much weight Reagan had been piling on. The flat fronted wide hipped twin had become a bulging pear. A lacey thong could be seen digging into her weighty hips and stomach, a lower belly almost reaching Ixchel's own. But the formerly fit redhead looked to weigh more than Ixchel now, those bulging hips continuing back to her fully padded rear. Sure, the twins had always been big reared since puberty but that butt was getting <i>large!</i> Reagan's breasts were fuller than Ixchel remembered as well, only she hadn't bothered to up her cup size or skimpy tops, making Ixchel sympathetic of her own perky mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with you?\" Reagan asked, given Ixchel's dumbstruck expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel tried to downplay her disbelief. \"Nothing! How are you? I know I haven't been present much in...\" Seriously, how much weight had she been able to gain in almost two months?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan snorted. \"Well, Uma's bailed on me for our gym sessions, so I don't know what I'm doing half the time I'm there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowing of Reagan's twisted sibling jealousy, Ixchel could only comprehend that statement with what she could presently observe. \"Well, keep at it? I'm going to see how everyone else is doing.\" Ixchel excused herself awkwardly, trying not to insinuate too much given Reagan's acrid personality, and trying to fathom what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma bailed on gym sessions? Sure, the athlete lounged about whenever she had expended the energy but she was still pretty buff, right? Out of curiosity Ixchel wandered to the upper level of the townhouse. It's not likely everyone was up in their rooms, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yyyaaawwwwwnn*\" a massive sigh of sleepiness came with the stretching of a protruding black belly out of Uma's door, along with the rest of Uma. Ixchel's eyes grew wide behind her glasses. Uma had a gut! A belly that looked to be soaked with alcohol and fatty foods sat on her muscled thighs starting to attract cellulite. Uma had a pretty straight body shape before. This was the girl with ripped abs and a chiseled physique in her prime, wasn't it? Yet her newly accumulated fat was trying to find places to settle on the formerly fit frame, with the bloated belly getting the dark lines of stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Ixchel,\" Uma noticed her, rising from the dead sleep after Phoebe had dragged her on a hefty club visit. Not only for their tab but the food. It had been fun getting the younger Durant twin into more parties but damn, this was too much like work and too hard on her waistline. The appearance of the quietest roommate got her out of her funk. \"Whatcha been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of programming,\" Ixchel had been blindsided by Reagan's appearance but Uma's was unbelievable. Was this real? Had they signed Ixchel up to be punked in a reality prank show? Had she gone down the rabbit hole to another dimension? Uma's poorly abused stomach couldn't be real. right? Ixchel caught herself crossing, hand outstretched to give it a feel for confirmation, so she hastily grabbed her other arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like I haven't seen you girls in forever,\" Ixchel said, starting to feel fuzzy in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" Uma, somewhat disgusted with herself, had an inkling of what Ixchel was reacting to. \"You haven't seen nuthin' yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma shrugged. \"Doyah know if anyone was in the shower? I've got to get the smell of last night off of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I hadn't noticed.\" Ixchel was growing more worried. Now Reagan and Uma were blimping up, what had she not seen yet? Alarmed by Uma's statement, Ixchel took the back stairs as she quickly moved through the townhouse, trying to spot the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the panty, she noticed the telltale profile of the blonde Audrey. While the cousins looked radically different they had somewhat similar plus size physiques. And Audrey was the most sensible of the bunch, surely she could explain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gasp caught in Ixchel's throat. While not much wider than Ixchel had recalled, Audrey was looking positively stuffed in the belly and bust department. Her stomach was notably pinched by clothes Ixchel recognized. She hadn't she Audrey this full since she had overdid it on the buffet put out by Ixchel's folks for her kid sister's quinceanera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ixchel!\" Audrey greeted warmly, oblivious to her cousin's mixture of confusion and concern. \"Finally done with that big project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um, yes.\" Good lord, wasn't Audrey meaning to diet some time back? She looked like she was snacking nonstop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should celebrate you finishing that project,\" Audrey mused. \"Ooo. You still know that korean beef recipe with the veggies you do so well, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Ixchel said, beginning to see where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so tasty. And perfect, the other girls would love it, I'm sure I can scrape together anything you might need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay.\" Ixchel pressed against the wall to let Audrey pass. If the elder Durant, hell, if any of the ladies Ixchel had seen this late morning got too much bigger they'd have to awkwardly shuffle past each other in the townhome's tighter hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what had caused all this? Ixchel was still puzzling over this mystery as she continued on to the commons of the ground floor. The sudden exclamation of her name roused her from these deep thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chell!! Ohmygawd give me a hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel was caught in the headlights, a fuzzy animal about to be roadkill given the size of what was lumbering towards her. If she thought Reagan was getting fat, Phoebe was, was, FAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger twin sported similar plumped up curves to Reagan, only she was far more broad in the rear and wide for her stomach. Her weight mainly settled to her lower half, juicy love handles jiggling and butt quaking as she raced toward Ixchel with energy beguiling of her size. Her overstretched joggers were starting to roll downwards off her zaftig buns and thighs from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel felt the wind knocked out of her at the impact of Phoebe's hug. Being squeezed so tightly, she was in the uncomfortable position of feeling with her entire body just how much Phoebe outweighed her at this point. Soft fat pressed into Ixchel, risking her breathing being cut off until Phoebe finally released her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you so much, it's like I haven't seen you in ages!\" Phoebe said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Holy heck, if Ixchel didn't know any better Phoebe was posed to be the fattest woman of the house! Her stomach wasn't as large as some of the others but that overfilled ass of hers put a Kardashian to shame! Just what had happened in this house when Ixchel was caught up in work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Phoebe asked, concerned that her favorite and only cousin didn't share her enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" Ixchel swallowed, \"I guess I'm mainly tired and hungry from all my work. I've missed seeing you girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, we should totally do something!\" Although Phoebe soon jiggled off to the kitchen to grab her cousin some snacks, Ixchel's mouth hitting the floor again as she watched Phoebe's butt sway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel sat down, feeling much smaller today.</span></div></div>",

In particular, a rather sorry looking tshirt clung to the blonde's upper body, betraying every inch of her now bloated state whilst barely containing the lower hang of her growing tummy. A small release of pressure was gifted to her when the seam running up her side had popped slightly from the pressure but the overall effect was still a great deal of taut material which only served to draw attention to her suffering bras as well as her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere shadow of her former sporty self, Uma was perched in little more than a obscenely small pair of latex shorts strangling her thighs sat underneath her prominent rounded belly that was currently hanging free of her old basketball vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowering quietly to herself was the ever fiery Reagan who, following a rather rambunctious hook up the night before, had finally conceded her bras were no longer fit for purpose, not to mention her softening stomach challenged every clothing limit she could throw at it. Her sorry state had left in in nothing more than a baggy hoodie (stolen from a different nightly conquest) so as to maintain her bloated chests' dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, to top off the group, there was Phoebe, the accidental architect of the problem at hand. Whether the younger twin was truly oblivious to her situation as a whole or was actually enjoying it was very hard to tell but, following today's mishap, Phoebe was no longer in possession of leg wear that could contain her enormous rear end. Her thighs were challenge enough for even the stretchiest of leggings but it had been her ever increasing rear that had seen the untimely demise of her last pair bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular occurrence had done nothing for Reagan's mood who spent a good deal of time staring at her twin's exposed bulging rear, a glimmer of satisfaction being offered in the form of Phoebe's growing belly sat atop her thighs and exposed up to the belly button under a poorly stretched vest top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so we're all starting to struggle a little with clothing\" started Audrey, a sentiment that was met by a quiet chorus of murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde nodded her own agreement before carrying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, things are tight as always financially with balancing this place so before we go out buying any new clothes is there any way we can share any hand-me-downs out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls glanced around the table again before the silence was broken by Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate your optimism here Aud, particularly given how you aren't normally all that optimistic, but I don't think that's gonna work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, a quiet wave of agreeing murmurs rolled across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, the twins WERE the smallest in the house so they can't hand anything up and I'd dare hazard a guess that nobody can <br>\r\nhand anything UP to Phoebe these days\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the passing reference to them, Reagan simply refused to comment whilst Phoebe idly grinned at her housemates, failing to see the obvious problem been proposed by the former athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed.<br>\r\n\"You have a point Uma, but I don't see how we're going to be able to afford to clothe the entire house with a new wardrobe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be able to help there\" piped up Ixchel, a look of conflict on her face as she spoke whilst biting her nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four girls looked across at their cousin/friend intently, completely intrigued at the possible solution being offered so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as part of my last project I did get a pretty handsome down payment for the work and seeing as I've been on lock down to actually get the job done I've spent next to none of the money, aside from rent contributions\" continued Ixchel, the look of conflict not subsiding in the slightest but a faint glimmer of knowingly joined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chel, we couldn't possibly...\" started Audrey, attempted to save her cousin's honour, before being bluntly cut off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Chel, thank you so much!\" squeaked Phoebe, launching herself from her chair and burying Ixchel in a jiggling flabby hug of gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steady Pheebs, she can't help us if you suffocate her\" warned Uma, scratching her protruding belly as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry\" responded Phoebe awkwardly as she backed onto her seat again, Reagan groaning as she watched her twin's rear bulge out over the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" nobbed Uma with a smile before returning to the matter at hand \"are you sure you want to do that Chel? It'd be a really big favour to us all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can either help out like this or we have to spend the rest of eternity staring at each other's nakedness\" interjected Ixchel, pragmatism leading the way at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sold\" barked Reagan, breaking her silence as her willingness to look at her ballooning twin's exposed form dwindled completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you're sure Chel\" smiled Audrey, giving her cousin something of a sideways hug, feeling slightly winded by the pressure she put on her own stomach by twisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah\" mused Ixchel as she hugged back awkwardly \"you all owe me one though, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls all expressed their gratitude, albeit some more enthusiastically than others *cough Reagan cough* and the deal was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so when are we going to actually do this?\" asked Audrey, checking her watch as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\" barked Reagan again, throwing herself up from the table and walking out to get her shoes as the tell tale sign of her unrestricted chest bounced within the confines of her hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down grump\" shouted Uma after the redhead before looking to the remaining group \"but seriously, can we go now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not\" shrugged Audrey, looking to her cousin for support<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel simply nodded before rising from the table to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"lets go then\" smiled Audrey, quite pleased at the prospect of a much looser shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey remember how we used to tease Audrey about being chubby?\" asked Phoebe, looking at her twin as she spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" grunted Reagan, still visualising her sister's swollen rear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda funny that I barely fit in her fat pants now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" grumbled Reagan again whilst fishing around under her hoodie to make some sort of comfort in the borrowed bra that Audrey had given her to protect her dignity as they roamed the mall for clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up you two, shops close in a couple of hours!\" called Audrey from in front of the twins as they passed shop after shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming mum!\" shouted Phoebe before skipping after the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Urgh, such a fat pig' thought Reagan as her twin bounced off ahead, the image of vast butt cheeks wobbling in tightly packed sweatpants seared into her mind at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Reagan continued to chunter to herself, she was blissfully unaware of another individual joining her at the back of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever gonna stop sulking today?\" asked Uma, giving Reagan something of a playful nudge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not til I have clothes of my own that fit\" spat Reagan, eyes staring forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're all in that boat so try lighten up yeah?\" asserted Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs arsey as Reagan was, Uma actually didn't mind her too much.<br>\r\nThey'd bonded over many a 'carb load' and 'gym session' even if the reason Reagan had attempted to work out still eluded Uma no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look stupid by the way\" murmured Reagan in reference to the former athlete's outfit of choice for the trip, of which the only addition to her previous get up being a rather large sports jacket that JUST covered her enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is all that would fit\" defended Uma, puffing up her shoulders whilst holding her sports jacket down by the pockets to avoid exposing any of her rogue gut to the general public \"besides, I'm not the one borrowing my sister's bra\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remark caught Reagan off-guard.<br>\r\nIt was true she was wearing a hand-me-down from her once much larger sister but it was kind of comfy and suited her quite well.<br>\r\nWho would have expected Audrey the straight laced Durant to have such a brightly coloured bra...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to be soft though, Reagan took to her usual smart arsed remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" smirked Uma, holding back a full laugh \"still ain't wearing her bra though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat remark actually made Reagan smile and relax slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better, now lets go have some fun and actually be respectable human beings with clothes that fit\" teased Uma, nudging the redhead again before taking off towards the multitude of clothes shops before them.</span></div></div>",

That butt can not be holding itself these days\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe laughed to herself, so enamoured that this stranger was taking such an interest in her best feature<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are getting kind of tight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, have you any pictures of yourself in your...previous wardrobe?\" asked Toni, starting to get an idea of what style Phoebe was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, sure\" replied Phoebe, grabbing her phone from the exceedingly tight sweatpants pocket on her left hip \"I like the revealing kind of things that lure the guys in, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know what you mean\" smiled Toni with a wink as she waited to see what Phoebe had to offer for inspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is the kind of thing I usually go for\" said Phoebe as she showed her new personal shopper her phone whilst flicking through a few images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...ok...yep...\" mused Toni as she made more notes \"you have a twin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment followed a picture with Phoebe posing with Reagan some time last year before their respective gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reagan? She's great, I'm surprised she's not here because her butt is huge these days too\" smiled Phoebe.<br>\r\nDespite the damage she had caused over the past few weeks, it hadn't flown her by that Reagan had also been expanding at quite a pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" mused Toni again, adjusting herself slightly in her chair \"anyway, today is all about you so lets get some clothes shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay\" cheered Phoebe with a slight shoulder bounce that radiated through her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your enthusiasm here...sorry, what was your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe\" smiled the twin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe, such a pretty name\" responded Toni \"I think we're going to do great things today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I've got you a few things to try, some from your current style and some things more fresh so how about you just hop on through to the changing rooms and we'll see what we're working with\" announced Toni, a slight loss of breath in her tone as she reappeared before Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe could only squeal with excitement as she skipped off to the changing room to see what had been selected for it.<br>\r\nAlthough she had only known Toni for a short time, Phoebe was blown away with how well the shop assistant understood her sense of style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrop tops<br>\r\nShort shorts<br>\r\nSome dresses with the side panels cut out to show off her hips<br>\r\nAND the cutest (not to mention skimpiest) pyjama set you have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the redhead excitedly skipped into the changing room she thought she caught a glimpse of someone she knew coming into the store, more specifically, she thought she just saw Nat from her favourite bar walk in.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for her to forget that particular titbit though as she swaggered into the private room and closed the door behind her, ready to try on her new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you holding up in there Phoebe?\" asked Toni through the door, gently rapping on the wood with her knuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing ok, just struggling with the dress a little\" replied Phoebe, gritting her teeth as she resumed trying to roll the thin material over her fuller hips, oblivious to the fact the zipper opening was cupping her bulging behind out back which was preventing the dress from sliding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get a bigger size if you want?\" offered Toni, hearing another sharp grunt followed by a shallow breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the door whipped open to reveal Phoebe fully dressed in the offending item.<br>\r\nSaid dress was red to match Phoebe's hair with a single cutout on each side whilst being relatively low cut to show off her swelling cleavage.<br>\r\nAs Phoebe gave a twirl to showcase the item, it became very clear why she had struggled getting the thing over her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking nearly as tight as her loaned sweatpants, the red material clung tightly across her cheeks, swaying slightly with every shift of blubber.<br>\r\nReturning to face Toni it also became clear how tightly the material clung to her front as well, with the front of the dress curving out with her swollen stomach with the cutouts giving a clear view of the delicate rolls of fat forming at her sides above her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow girl, you look good!\" cheered Toni with a soft clap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe could only bounce on her toes at the compliment before going back into the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I start ringing all this up for you?\" called Toni, turning slightly towards the till<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my friends has my money, can it wait?\" responded Phoebe, remembering Ixchel had the money still<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I set you up with a credit account?\" asked Toni, leaning back towards the closed door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get one of those?\" asked Phoebe, honestly not completely sure what a credit account was for a store<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, I can sort it out whilst you change\" purred Toni, turning tail again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, thanks a lot Toni\" replied Phoebe, a large grin crossing her face as she spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem honey\" replied Toni as she sashayed to the till \"don't forget those pants by the way!\"<br>\r\nPhoebe looked around before finding a white plastic bag on the bench behind her, a selection of panties and bras packed into it.<br>\r\n\"These are so cute!\" murmured the redhead to herself as she slid the tight red material down her legs \"this shop is awesome!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who was...oh my god, Nat?!\" squealed Phoebe as she saw her favourite bar manager lent against one of the marble arches framing the door to +Size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only\" purred Nat as she stretched herself in a pose of exhibitionism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs great as it was to see Nat, Phoebe was a little baffled.<br>\r\nShe had never actually seen Nat away from the club and all those times she had either been too nervous to look at her properly or was too drunk to notice anything other than the things pouring into her own mouth.<br>\r\nAnd yet today, stood in the mall outside her new favourite clothes store, Phoebe got her first proper look at the woman who had been indulging her every partying whim for the past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost striking was that Nat was really quite pretty.<br>\r\nAlthough normally basking in the faint or flashing lights of her club, Nat was quite a sight in the daytime with her mid length hair tussled and gelled up into a quiffed fringe.<br>\r\nPiercing blue-grey eyes looked through generously made up lashes set within a cherubic, if not slightly rounded, face whilst a delicate silver ring punctuated a button nose set above curvy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAesthetically, Phoebe could only compare the bar manage to the darker girls from college with her black lace skirt and sleeveless band vest hugging her curves.<br>\r\nAlthough not having any predetermined expectations, Phoebe did not expect the otherwise professional woman to be dressed as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks aside though and, as no real surprise to the redhead, Nat was still as plump as she looked on a night.<br>\r\nA closer look proved that Nat and Phoebe appeared to be quite similar in size at this point, albeit Nat was lagging slightly behind the younger girl and carried her weight much more evenly, resulting in her vest not quite covering her adequately enough around her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you in there Phoebe? Not being day drinking have you?\" quizzed Nat with her hands on her hips, leaning slightly to take a closer look at the redhead's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh no, I wouldn't do that...\" Phoebe faltered, Nat was very 'mum-esque' outside of work it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar manager started to laugh though and relaxed her stance which instantly made Phoebe feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax Phebes, just messing with you\" teased Nat with a light nudge to Phoebe's arm, smile beaming across her face \"so you found +Size huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its really cool in there\" the redhead shuffled slightly on her feet, transitioning from daughter in trouble to awkward friend trying to impress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet, great for girls like us...if you know what I mean\"<br>\r\nNat punctuated that sentiment with a wink in lieu of the nudge.<br>\r\n\"Where you off to now then? Looks like you got enough clothes to sink the Titanic there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not actually sure, I think I've got to meet with Audrey and all them\" answered Phoebe, glancing around to see if any of her housemates were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was about to hit the food court if you want to join me, you could always get your sister to meet you there\" suggested Nat, one arm sliding around the youngest twin as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had to admit that that did sound like a good idea.<br>\r\nShe hadn't eaten in hours which, considering her form as of late, was a crazy long time for her to go without food and she could feel the startings of a hunger to form in her belly.<br>\r\nNat was apparently not oblivious to that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, sounds like the captain has spoken there Phebes, gotta get some food in you quick\" teased Nat again, starting to lead Phoebe away from the store front \"don't worry, you've spent enough there, how about I make this my treat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was always a sucker for free food and she had spent a lot in +Size, not that she understood her credit arrangement anymore now than when she signed for it<br>\r\n\"Sounds great Nat, lead the way\" smiled Phoebe, allowing herself to loosen up in order to be led.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great stuff\" smiled the natural host as she took Phoebe's arm and headed for the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unnoticed by either of the girls, Uma had just turned the corner as Phoebe and Nat walked the other way around another corner.<br>\r\nAs brief as the moment was, it gave Uma enough of a chance to see what had just happened and she didn't like it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shit\" she muttered under her breath as she whipped her phone out to send an emergency text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had been to the mall food court before, plenty of times actually, but now as a far more seasoned eater she could appreciate the place much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the edge of the court were a great number of eateries ranging from McDonalds and Taco Bell through to some smaller chain stores that included a delicious Chinese noodle place if Phoebe remembered rightly.<br>\r\nThere was also a Baskin Robbins which, aside from being one of Phoebe's favourite places, served as the main dessert place for the entire court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything jumping out at you then Phebes?\" called Nat over her tattooed shoulder as a distinct bounce rippled through her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Everything' was Phoebe's first thought but that seemed a little rude given that Nat had offered so kindly to pay for her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know, theres so much to chose from\" replied Phoebe, attention not entirely on the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've spent long enough serving you, how about I just get a few things and take it from there?\" offered Nat as she glanced round the court herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe just nodded as she sidled around a table before sitting herself down, bulging rear threatening the extents of her chair as well as Audrey's borrowed sweats.<br>\r\nNat didn't say anything else and just took off into the crowds, weaving with a great deal more dexterity then her figure would suggest.<br>\r\nWaiting patiently for her dinner host to return, Phoebe took in the vast array of smells wafting through the food court, all of which only made her hungrier than she already was.<br>\r\nHer bliss was interrupted briefly by the buzz of her phone jiggling against her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Pheobe, just checking you're ok? Uma saw you with Nat and don't want you getting out of your depth' read the message from Audrey.<br>\r\nSilly Audrey worrying so much, Nat was cool even if she did used to scare the young twin.<br>\r\n'Just having something to eat, see you later xxx' replied Phoebe before putting her phone away, and not a moment too soon as Nat had returned with a mountainous tray of food<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go Phebes, that'll keep you going for a while\" chirped Nat as she placed the tray in front of Phoebe before depositing a not as full one before her own chair, sitting opposite the redhead as she did.<br>\r\nPhoebe could only look over the pile of food in awe as she took in all the things that had been brought for her.<br>\r\nNat wasn't lying when she said she knew what Phoebe liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foot-long sub crammed with meats and melted cheese crossed the tray diagonally, splitting the meal into two categories.<br>\r\nOn one side sat tacos and fried chicken whilst the other corner of her tray nearly exclusively housed a large container of spicy Chinese noodles, just as Phoebe liked them, with a portion of prawn toast squeezed in beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe's eyes and hardly subtle lip lick obviously tipped Nat off to her success.<br>\r\n\"Well go on then, this is the longest I've ever seen food last in front of you\" teased the bar manager as she took a Big Mac from her tray and took a large bite from it.<br>\r\nPhoebe didn't need any more of an invite then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, your appetite is insane Phebes\" cooed Nat as she lent back in her chair, nudging her tray into the middle of the table whilst cradling her bloated middle.<br>\r\nPhoebe was too busy shoveling the last of her noodles straight into her mouth from the tub to respond to the comment which only made Nat smile more at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Phoebe sat the empty noodle cartoon down to complete her emptied tray before letting loose a delicate burp whilst wiping her mouth clean with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you bested me there kiddo\" mused Nat, heaving herself up in her seat again \"you can finish that off if you want\"<br>\r\nNat had nodded to her tray which still had a slice of pizza, two tacos and half a burger sat on it.<br>\r\nPhoebe looked over the tray, considering the option whilst toying with how full she was.<br>\r\nIt had to be said she was very full but she didn't want to let Nat waste money after treating her so well, not to mention Phoebe hadn't had a burger on her side of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'a girl\" purred Nat as Phoebe swiped up her tray and started making her way through the remnants of Nat's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna want any ice cream after that?\" asked Nat, looking to stand from the table feeling rather confident in the response she would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe looked up from the pizza she was chewing on, licking sauce from her lips as she did and only offered a cute nod in response whilst swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it\" smiled Nat, giving the redhead finger guns as she hoisted herself from her seat and headed towards Baskin Robbins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Phoebe being paying more attention she would have noticed that Nat's vest was struggling even more to contain her bloated stomach than before.<br>\r\nIt had not missed Nat, however, that at some point during the meal Phoebe had rolled her borrowed sweatpants down to release her own bulging gut which now rested on her thick thighs and wobbled with each bite.<br>\r\nDespite her compromising situation, Phoebe felt great, not to mention that she was rather excited at the prospect of inbound ice cream, given her dominant sweet tooth.</span></div></div>",

Have as many of your girls round as you like, I'm just eating your food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrly looked confused.<br>\r\n\"So you're moving into my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" Reagan glared before carrying on \"rule number three, this is all on my terms so when I'm done we're done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask a question?\" asked Darryl, turning fully to face Reagan with an elbow on the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as that wasn't it\" jabbed Reagan, not meeting Darryl's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never even liked the idea of stuffing your face before, why now?\" asked Darryl again, rather insistently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan thought about it for a moment, chewing her lip as she did getting a delicate hit of salt from the residue of fries left on the edge of her mouth.<br>\r\n\"None of your business\" she settled on defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking again, Darryl kicked the car over before turning into the drive through just in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your choice but these things work better with a motive\" he chimed, taking a moment to glance over the scrolling menus stradling the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan rolled her eyes, taking to looking out of her own window as the heavy smell of grease and fries hit her nose.<br>\r\nFeeling her mouth start to fill with saliva, Reagan couldn't help but admit to herself that she enjoyed pigging out lately.<br>\r\nA naturally greedy woman, not unlike her twin, being given an excuse to indulge in everything she wanted did please the moody redhead more than she'd admit to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Castle Darryl\" chirped Darryl as the automatic gates slowly parted to a long winding drive, leading to the familiar house on the hill.<br>\r\nReagan didn't particularly care though.<br>\r\nFor one, she'd seen the place before and it didn't impress her then and two she was busy tearing fried chicken from the bone.<br>\r\nMcDonalds had led to KFC which had then led to Krispy Kreme, all of which was dispersed around a phone call to an unfamiliar pizza place which had delivered to the gates they had just driven through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving discarded her jacket sometime after doughnuts and denting most of the food apart from the pizza, Reagan already showed signs of fullness with her stomach bulging further than when she started and a faint layer of sweat dappling her face and arms.<br>\r\nStubborn as ever though, this didn't stop the redhead swallowing chicken before swiping up a 2l bottle of coke and downing a good portion of it.<br>\r\nThe result saw Reagan belch forcefully before going back to it, brutally biting into a doughnut from her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl was impressed and, he had to admit, that he was turned on by his former flame's display but, as a gentleman, he simply unclipped her seatbelt for her and grabbed the freshly arrived pizza.<br>\r\nAutopilot kicked in at this point as her door swung open and Reagan meandered up the stairs and into the house, never skipping a beat to eat as she almost instinctively worked towards a living room she hardly remembered.<br>\r\nFading memories aside though, Darryl didn't have to correct her path and simply laid the food he was carrying down before Reagan as she landed, still not halting her eating for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree from the car and restrictive seatbelts, Reagan's belly did look swollen for her efforts but, to her own touch, still felt plenty soft.<br>\r\nHer mind wandered to the first time her and Uma had gone to Brass Tops after hitting the gym and how she'd felt fit to burst after all she'd eaten there.<br>\r\nNow here she sat having eaten much more than that sitting and felt fine still, so much so that her continuous stuffing didn't break at all as she almost elegantly glided between food items.<br>\r\nNeedless to say, she was a much larger girl than she had been then but the sentiment still stood as Reagan started to double stack slices of pizza before feeding them into her eager maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oo...BUUUUURP...ph\"<br>\r\nReagan groaned as her lips tore apart to release the pressure resting in her stomach which she was gently rubbing between her hands.<br>\r\nWith a wry smile, Darryl sauntered back into the room having left some time back and glanced over the woman before him stretched out on his sofa with feet barely touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you're finally finished there\" he smirked whilst sliding his hands into his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit Sherlock\" spat Reagan, snippy as ever even in her incapacitated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose you won't be wanting this cheesecake then\" teased Darryl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't got cheesecake\" mumbled Reagan, making the observation based on his empty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" challenged the host before taking a couple of steps back and taking hold of a serving plate holding quite a sizeable cheesecake \"What's this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan initially repulsed at the thought of eating more but soon the sweet combination of vanilla and chocolate filled her nostrils and she felt drawn in.<br>\r\nDarryl simply started to close the gap, bringing the large dessert closer to his guest which had the effect of luring Reagan into a slightly upright position, albeit restricted by the size and fullness of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know I love cheesecake?\" asked Reagan rather huskily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all love cheesecake Reags, all fat girls love the stuff\" teased Darryl as he sat the plate into Reagan's lap who hungrily licked her lips.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the ladies of 8422 Fordham Ave, when everybody had needed Ixchel to bail them out with an up-sized wardrobe last month, for a majority of the residents it had been a wakeup call. Audrey and Ixchel, both with the kinds of metabolisms that had left them chunky since middle school, had really tried to not outgrow their new clothes. Uma, finding dismay at what she had outgrown and the loss of her athletic drive, had tried to return to her body's prime by increased efforts at the gym. It would be far too expsenive to replace their wardrobe again and again if their weights increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit these concerns didn't end up reducing the amount of snacking and extra portions had at the townhouse. What was saved in the clothing budget was put towards the increased appetites of Audrey, Ixchel and Uma. Enough that they weren't losing weight but, for now, their weight had plateaued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were a different story, as the redheaded youngsters of the townhouse surged forward on their weight gains at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArguably, at one point in time the twins had each been the skinniest members of the household, as their weight was only carried in their shapely rears. The pair of pear-shaped twins had shot up the relative sizes of all five roommates ranked smallest to biggest. Everyone had gained plenty of weight but the twins had gained the most. The possibility of them becoming the fattest residents of the townhouse was not a question of if, but when given the inevitability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe's increasing appetite and Reagan's envious stuffing complex had been accelerated by their respective enablers. Nat, who had started giving Phoebe generous discounts at the club even when the young redhead was the only townhouse gal in attendance, also frequently invited Phoebe out for lunches on the days in-between club nights. With each meal, not only did Nat put her fair share of food away, most of what she ordered on her plate wound up on Phoebe's instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had her arrangements with Darryl, a short-term date with a history of catering to hungry, gaining females. Her crazed ambition was given calorific substance by Darryl's deep pockets and feeder expertise. Much as she insisted on keeping her own control and agency of this agreement, from the outside those that knew Darryl wouldn't be that wrong in thinking the older Durant twin was a prize new conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, both of the twins were spending most of their time out of the townhouse with these compatriots. Their waistlines and bottom-heavy genes were taking a toil from having their appetites lavishly provided sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel was mainly a computer gamer, and thus holed up with the games in her office one floor up in the townhouse when she had her free time, but every once in awhile she would pull out one of the consoles and commandeer the TV on the ground floor living room. Today she had gone very retro, having hooked up the classic Playstation for early polygonal gaming she remembered from her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel was every part the video game slogger with a pack of special flavored Dew and a bag of chips on standby. As aforementioned she had stymied her weight gain thus far, although her stomach was broader and her breasts plumper, another dozen or so pounds inching onto her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" Ixchel was startled out of some speed running practice when Phoebe emerged on the scene. \"Is this that game with the monkeys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, Apes, rather,\" Ixchel corrected. \"The ones that have escaped, after all.\" She had to pause her game as it had become rare these last few weeks to actually see her youngest cousin at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd good lord, Phoebe had not slowed down the rate of her expansion in that time. It was hard to believe she had once been a model. Phoebe was poured into some overtaxed pajamas, apparently arisen from another late night of partying at Nat's club. Nightlife Ixchel was not as familiar with, but that wasn't what worried her. Phoebe was in full porker territory now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer floral patterned pajamas were stretched over a broad stomach and wide hips, the ties barely having any length to poke out the waist of the lounge pants. Ixchel had the sudden memory of when all the cousins/sisters had been in their single digit ages, one time during a sleep over at Ixchel's place when they had played around by wearing her older sister's clothes and stuffing pillows in those oversized shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what Phoebe looked like now, like she had grafted a pillow to her middle, yet Ixchel could see that rather than unyielding foam of a pillow the faintest of flabby jiggles could be seen under Phoebe's plain shirt, snug to her engorged middle like a second skin. Her breasts were also approaching Ixchel's own enlarged sweater puppies, and the beginnings of a double chin filled out the redhead's face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I watch?\" Phoebe asked, chipper as ever an oblivious to Ixchel's growing concerns. \"You were always better at this game as I kid, I could never find those blasted apes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Ixchel bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! Let me get us some more snacks!\" Ixchel had to flinch back when Phoebe turned to retreat back into the kitchenette. That butt! That huge, plumped, just sagging butt that looked like it would need its own zip code soon. Its enormity stretched the seams on the pajama pants, compete with thighs that would require two or three hand-withs just to measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Ixchel's chagrin, Phoebe had brought back a bevy of snacks. Two more bowls of chips, a package of creme filled cookies, and an ice pop for each of them. Rather, 4 ice pops that Phoebe was unwrapping to Ichel's single tangerine flavor. And if Ixchel hadn't comprehended the girth of Phoebe's lower half from sight alone, she got fully aware of it when Phoebe sat down. Uncomfortably so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, the townhouse furniture for the living room had to be compact. A small couch, a recliner, and the two-seater that Ixchel had been in when she set up her game. Phoebe planting her great big tuckus in the other seat brought Ixchel the realization that, holy crap, Phoebe's weighty hip was pressing up against her own. Hell, she took up more than just her side of the seat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel lost all composure on trying to master a pathway for her ape catching platformer as Phoebe took up her attention, both from her fun-loving nature and complete disregard to addressing how big she was getting. Ixchel couldn't help but notice that Phoebe was plowing her way through most of the snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes of putzing around a level at Phoebe's request for funny antics, they pair were interrupted by the slam of the front door. \"Hey sis, I got something for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan, an equally rare sight as Phoebe these days, stomped into the room. Stomped was a good choice of words, as Ixchel was starting to feel claustrophobic once both twins were in the living room. It wasn't that odd to imagine that identical siblings were close to the same size and shape but for the Durant twins this was downright ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan had to unbelt her hip hugging jeans that were gang-pressed into hip-incarcerating jeans, her midriff billowing over the tight pinch of the material in the waist. How in the heck had Reagan gotten as big if not bigger than Phoebe? Ixchel didn't know about the depraved lengths Reagan's twisted ambitions had wrought her. The envious, conniving twin had just come home from a session of burning Darryl's wallet for food money, and the signs of Reagan's gorging where plain to see. Her skippy top had to maintain both an enlarged chest and a belly that was starting to form two rolls even with Reagan standing, in contrast to Pheobe's belly folding only when she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ixchel it was almost like staring at an optical illusion. She would have sworn Phoebe was the largest of the Durant sisters at this point, yet Reagan might have usurped that claim. As bottom heavy as they were the twins surprisingly wore their weight differently. Phoebe had more of her flaring profile broadening to chunky thighs and calorie soaked legs, while Reagan had developed quite the impressive bust and had her greedy gut stick out farther from her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Reagan,\" Phoebe greeted between mouthfuls of cookie bites. \"Where have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping,\" Regan said, laden with store bags. After her disastrous first shopping trip to up her wardrobe, it didn't take long for Reagan to discover +Size as the store better suited for her newfound dimensions. \"I actually found these really sleek pair of shorts so I got us a matching set. Want to try them on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Phoebe was never one to turn down a gift but the motivation surprised her. \"You want us to dress up the same? We haven't really done that since high school, when it fell out of fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Phebs,\" Reagan brushed aside the query, intent on settling this matter once and for all. All of her efforts to outclass Phoebe in the size of their ass had come to this moment, using a new pair of shorts to have the definitive example to see who's ass was more spectacular. \"We haven't really hung out or done anything together, and I just wanted to get you a gift. Try them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Phoebe grunted under her breath as she hoisted herself out of the seat. Reagan grinned wickedly, masking her calculated machination into a more genuine smile, as the thought of the bliss of regaining the sibling right of passage for having the bigger asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ixchel watched the two twins go off to try on their new outfits, she couldn't help but stare at their great big rears. Honestly, everyone in the townhouse had let themselves go but the twins had REALLY let themselves go! The two looked like walking bean bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel cracked open another soda, disturbed at the thought of how much further the expansion of Reagan and Phoebe would continue.</span></div></div>",

I can't wait to see how cute we look in these shorts!\" called Reagan from the top of the stairs as she forcefully swung her bedroom door open.<br>\r\nUnlike her twin, Reagan kept a much messier room.<br>\r\nWith much too small clothes strewn around the place surrounding a barely covered bed, Reagan kicked her jeans off completely, giving a momentary sigh of relief as her hips could breath again.<br>\r\nThe restrictive denim landed amongst a pile of discarded food wrappers that had frequented her room more since Darryl's arrival on the scene just as Phoebe entered the room and delicately pushed the door to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Reagan, I've never seen you so excited about something\" mused Phoebe as she glanced around her sister's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just nice to be able to share something for a change\" smiled Reagan with a sickly smear of mania as she grabbed the bag that contained the shorts \"Here ya go sissy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe barely reacted in time as the flying shorts came at her and, admittedly, her larger chest caught more of them than her hands.<br>\r\nNeedless to say though, the upward movement was enough to pull her too small t-shirt just enough to expose more of her growing belly.<br>\r\nClothes in hand though, Phoebe did not hesitate in stripping her bottom half ready to redress herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me\" muttered Reagan as she got a real eyeful of just how large Phoebe had gotten in the ass department as two huge wobbling cheeks rolled out of her pyjama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Phoebe, looking over her shoulder whilst bent over as best as her middle would allow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just coughed\" lied Reagan, knowing the ditzy twin would fall for it as she looked over her genetic reflection.<br>\r\nAs similar as they were, Reagan couldn't help but feel a pang of doubt for the first time in an otherwise perfect plan.<br>\r\nPhoebe's rear was unmistakably her widest asset by a noticeable margin as each cheek continued to jiggle slightly after their declothing whilst gobbling her skimpy underwear to near invisibility.<br>\r\nThe youngest twin also sported a fair smattering of pale stretch marks around her booty too, not that that was all so surprising given how rapidly she had swelled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Reagan returned to her own situation.<br>\r\nAlthough her confidence was shaken slightly, she knew she had gotten pretty damn big in the backside department herself.<br>\r\nHer much larger top half just made it so hard to tell which twin was larger at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohhhh, you got these from +Size?\" cooed Phoebe as she looked at the label inside the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly did, best place for girls like us right?\" smiled Reagan, still buttering her sister up no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'mhhhm, butter' thought Reagan rather uncontrollably.<br>\r\nShe hated to admit it but Darryl's weird methods had got some amazing results.<br>\r\nAs much as she would have killed for an arse this big on her previous waist to beat Phoebe with, Reagan couldn't deny how tasty this route had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready then?\" asked Reagan as she examined the shorts.<br>\r\nThey were cute, all black with a little stretch to support all that luscious rump she now sported.<br>\r\nThe question was moot though as her twin was already stepping into her equivalent and readied herself to hike them up her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're kinda...tight Reagan\" grunted Phoebe as she struggled to drag the material past the lowest bulge of bum as the shorts ground to a halt around the thickest part of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding\" groaned Reagan in return who was having similar difficulty, albeit with some of her own ass covered as her thighs weren't quite as large as her sister's. The problem now was that the twin curves leading up the back of her figure were barely half covered as the rest bulged upwards greatly to escape the restrictive material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get the right size?\" asked Phoebe, pausing for a moment to take several haggard breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan didn't answer, instead contorting her face with exertion as she continued to tug at the shorts that were slowly but surely covering her bottom half.<br>\r\nLost in the moment of fitting in the shorts, Reagan had forgotten that the aim was to fit less well than her twin.<br>\r\nRest assured though, Reagan's effort had appeared to spur Phoebe on who, in one fell swoop managed to hike the shorts up her legs and encase her voluminous behind in the black fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn girl, you look good in those\" purred Reagan, a sense of victory starting to climb inside her.<br>\r\nIf Phoebe could fit in the shorts and she couldn't there was no question about who had the biggest ass now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...got...to...button...\" wheezed Phoebe, the effort of pulling the shorts up proving to be quite tasking on the unfit redhead who again doubled over herself, causing a roll of fat to spread over her poor stretched shorts waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they will button\" smirked Reagan, wishing for them to do just that as she still struggled to contain her own rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes rolled by as both twins continued to grunt and groan at their clothing to little effect.<br>\r\nReagan had finally forced her shorts over her immense rear and was fighting with her own button now as Phoebe slowly edged closer with her own.<br>\r\nAnd then, the victory was assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Reagan, think you need bigger shorts than that...\" suggested Phoebe, rather cautiously as she watched over her sister who was unable to span the last inches stopping her shorts from buttoning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, ya think?\" retorted Reagan, trying to be at least a little mad through her inherent glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...your butt is huge...\" honestly replied Phoebe as she smoothed her own shorts down, even if they were tight enough themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan saw her chance.<br>\r\n\"Bigger than yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess, if these shorts are the same size and you can't fit in them when I can\" shrugged Phoebe, watching as Reagan slowly let go of the button flaps which relented as her bulging gut settled forward again, oozing slightly through the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right!\" shouted Reagan as she practically lept up, body jiggling as she did \"suck it bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe could only look on confused at her twin's outburst, awkwardly unbuttoning her new shorts to release the tightness around her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked Phoebe innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been taunting me for MONTHS with that enormous arse of yours and now I am finally the queen again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taunting you? I've...what?\" Phoebe didn't understand a thing that Reagan was saying which made the apparent victory all the more sweeter for the delusional twin.<br>\r\nReagan couldn't help but laugh for a moment, each nasally chortle shaking her double belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you lost your job because your ass split your costume you've been gaining weight just so you could have a better ass than me\" asserted Reagan whilst squaring up to her twin, accidentally squashing their bellies and boobs together between them \"but not any more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Reagan? I've not been gaining weight...on purpose\" stammered Phoebe, feeling a little unnerved by her sister's attitude \"and I wouldn't try to hurt you anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, save it stick butt\" spat Reagan as she pushed past her now smaller twin \"mamma's got some business to attend to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her sister waddle out of her own bedroom, Phoebe couldn't help but shed a tear. Completely confused as to how she had managed to upset her twin so much, she pulled out her phone to make a call.</span></div></div>",

There's nothing but cherry bear-claws in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was all the bakery had?\" Audrey joked, as she dutifully returned to her computer while opening the case file as her boss strode away. Biting her lip, she scooted one stack of forms to the side and grabbed a maple frosted doughnut from her secret stash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat with the increased snacking habits of her townhouse roommates, Audrey was the definition of a stress eater given her heavy workload. The law office handled far too many cases than two partnered lawyers and three paralegals would conceivably be able to keep up with, most ending up on Audrey's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality, Denise had brought two boxes of doughnuts today, and Audrey had needed the nourishment to get through a work day. She told herself that the doughnuts had been for the whole office, that included her, and soon taking a pair become tacking four, then six, then Audrey felt she may as well sneak her own box to her desk as she deserved it, using a quiet, unobserved morning to pick her favorites from the office offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was careful not to get powdered sugar on her work blouse, her plumped chest and middle beginning to put a strain on the buttons. Her hunger kept her mind placated, ignorant of the downsides that all these workplace treats would cause her to soon outgrow her business attire, and this was after a wardrobe upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMid mouthful, her cell phone started ringing. Audrey hurriedly swallowed the doughnut, strugglingly to reach her phone in the shallow pockets of her slacks. While she didn't have the twin's outrageous bum her plus size physique had a more than meager butt, which put a strain on trying to grab something from her pockets as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Audrey answered, the phone immediately filled with the sounds of sobbing. \"Phoebe? Sweetie, I told you I can't take personal calls at work--\" Audrey's nerves lead her to the next doughnut to nibble, chocolate with cinnamon frosting. \"Huh? Slow down. Reagan did...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up, witches!\" Reagan excitedly bound down to the den, where Uma was seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated was a questionable term for Uma, trying to fit her butt on the exercise bike she kept down here. Mid-workout, although thoroughly taxed compared to her previous physical prime, she regarded Reagan with annoyance. \"Damnit, red, I'm busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what?\" It was amusing that Reagan was oblivious to how she and Uma had waffled on their gym membership. Whereas Reagan had been futility exercising to keep her weight down whilst stuffing her face to match Phoebe's rear and Uma had gone less and less, both of them had changed their goals entirely, with Uma trying to downsize after she realized all the weight she had gained while Reagan, desperate for the biggest ass, had shunned the gym in favor of meeting Darryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Uma noticed Reagan was wearing a pair of sleek black shorts she couldn't even close, letting her doughy middle pooch out over the waistband. Reagan should look in the mirror for how fat she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was so single-minded that she didn't catch the connotation. \"Whatever. How about when you're done and clean up we go out to celebrate? Hit the party scene, I've got plenty to blow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when did you want to party the same places I do?\" Uma questioned, as Reagan was often too prickly to others in a public setting. \" 'Sides, I already went out with Phoebe last Sunday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though she's gone out every other night without you?\" Reagan retorted with a bit of a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Uma off guard. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan grinned. \"Phoebe's been spending a lot of time with your ol' college chum, Nat. They even meet up for lunch. You party at her place, you never noticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...what?!\" Uma stepped off the exercise bike. \"I introduced them, that bitch! I warned Audrey about the two of them.\" Back when Phoebe had first discovered +Size, Uma had caught Uma and Nat coming out of there heading off to the food court. While Uma liked Nat as a friend, well enough, she knew from her college years what Nat could be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she started her nightclub, Nat was always getting the gang to go drinking and try out her recipes. She was as equally as big of a hedonist as Uma, only the black athlete had her sports to keep her figure trim when she was an undergraduate. And Uma had seen Nat sink her claws into her 'favorites' before. She had tried it with just about every girl in their dorm. And Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Uma first brought Phoebe to Nat's place, she thought her presence would help curb Nat's tendencies. Hell, she had damn good food, which was part of how Uma had let herself go in the first place. Yet she had gotten so caught up in her own weight gain that she hadn't gone out as often when Phoebe wanted to party constantly. Thus she hadn't acted on the signs that Nat had turned Phoebe into one of her 'projects.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcern, fury, and some repressed jealously at never being such treatment from Nat all these years that she had known her, mixed in Uma's face. \"How come Aud hasn't done anything about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's to say?\" Since Reagan had learned of the parameters of Phoebe's social life, she was getting more and more ambitious at besting her twin in every way now that she had reclaimed her crown as booty queen. \"What say we hit up Nat's place and give her a piece of our mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma threw down her exercise towel. \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe, don't talk with your mouth full, just slow down and help me understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's youngest sister was in full on meltdown when she interrupted her workday. Her tears and blubbering couldn't be comprehended over the phone. Audrey had a cheap cell phone plan that didn't offer her many minutes and data each month, so she semi-frequently would hit her cap, plus the reception was horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was sticking her neck out at the office taking her lunch break at this part of the day, given everything she had to do, but the only way she could think of getting Phoebe to calm down was taking them out to their favorite diner. It was one of those retro 50's malt shops that their parents had taken them to since they were kids. For the oldest and youngest of the Durant sisters, it was their favorite hangout that brought back a lot of childhood memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Audrey was hanging back to try and keep her blouse clean. Sitting in the opposite seat of the booth, Phoebe's face was runny with makeup, tears, and the six flavors of ice cream found in her ultimate banana split. \"*sniff* Reagan was so mean!!!\" She cried. \"She said I was fat! *sniff* Pur-posefully *sniff* to show her up in the booty!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...\" Audrey tried to comfort her baby sister, yet was unsure how to do so. Phoebe had been getting fat as of late. Out of the corner of her eye she could see other diner patrons giving odd looks to the sister's booth. The whole motivation behind this was as childish as Phoebe currently was being, a grown young woman bawling like a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she bought these shorts!\" Phoebe sobbed after another spoonful. \"That were tight and painful, made me wear them, when I thought...\"<br>\r\nPhoebe was lost to her emotions and her increased appeitie. Her explanation of the events were fragmented and lost being her sobs, as it took Audrey most of her patty melt to decipher what had been going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Reagan insulted you, humiliated you, and has been bullying you?\" Audrey summarized. \"That has got to stop! I also don't like her spending so much when we're struggling to get by as it is!\" She grabbed Phoebe by the sticky, ice cream covered hand. \"And Phoebe, you're prettier and nicer than Reagan! Don't let her get you down, we're going to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so blind.\" Uma sighed into her hands. \"Still, Reagan, that's a stupid thing to compete with Phoebe about. Who has the bigger ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like you're not surprised,\" Reagan crossed her arms under her growing chest. \"Phebs and I have been pulling shit like this since high school when we tried to go after the same guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose all of this junk is your own choice, then,\" Uma jiggled some of Reagan's fattened middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hands off!\" Reagan yelled, hiding the fact that she was getting ticklish as she grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure explains a lot about why you needed my help at the gym. But why can't Phoebe see that she's being played? Trust me, things with Nat can take a...bad turn, let's say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we enact some vengeance.?\" Reagan replied, pleased to have swayed Uma to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to hit it to her where it hurts, yeah,\" Uma said. Much as her machinations with Reagan could backfire, she couldn't help but regard their current predicament. \"So you plan on staying this flabby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan shrugged. \"Eh, I could do without gut,\" she admitted, although her newfound breasts pleased her. \"I just want to stay on top of Phoebe. She's such a crybaby, only thinks about herself, little goodie-two shoes that claims she can't do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Uma said darkly. \"I'm getting sick of her pity games. She can deal with being in over her head for once.\"</span></div></div>",

see how it goes\" replied Reagan rather bluntly whilst futilely tugging her top in an attempt to cover her bulging stomach.<br>\r\nDespite her aversion to the cold, the redhead had made no attempt to dress accordingly given that she was still wearing the shorts that could not be closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno Reagan, Nat's a bit crazy\" pleaded Uma \"we need some sort of plan\"<br>\r\nHer words were lost on their audience though as Reagan had already started to walk towards the club, great assets struggling against the shorts that confined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" breathed Uma as she followed after her partner in crime for the night.<br>\r\nAs she walked, Uma couldn't help but feel every bounce of her rounded belly combined with the faint rubbing of her thighs even through her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the double doors opened the great thumping of a bass line hit the girls like a wall.<br>\r\nNeither of them was prepared for the sensation, particularly Reagan with much more skin on show than her friend, and they both took a moment to enjoy the fresh air before stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, Sheryl is playing tonight so Nat should be pretty free\" announced Uma, being much more familiar with how the club worked, although not as familiar as Phoebe she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\" muttered Reagan mostly to herself as she scanned the club for signs of her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma wasn't wrong<br>\r\nOccasionally Sheryl did play a more personalised set at the club and it always drew a huge crowd.<br>\r\nIt also meant that most of the club's clients were out on the dancefloor, only breaking off temporarily to get refills which meant the bar was mostly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Natalie!\" bellowed Reagan from across the dancefloor as she marched towards the bar with her chest and stomach bouncing melodically with her steps.<br>\r\nUma caught a huge eyeful as she followed behind the redhead, doing all in her power to avoid staring at the ass.<br>\r\n'Jeez, this girl really went to town' thought Uma as she felt slightly better about the girth of her own rear at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused at the declaration of her full name, Nat looked up with narrowed eyes before locking onto the inbound redhead.<br>\r\nA moment passed with the tattooed club owner thinking that Phoebe had decided to swing by that night before realising this wasn't QUITE the Phoebe she was familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you've been messing with my sister\" announced Reagan as she lent against the bar, her boobs sitting heavily on her forearms, giving Nat quite the view down her stretched tshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Reagan honey, we've just being hanging out\" purred the club owner making no attempt to hide her downward glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb Nat, I know what you're like with girls like Phoebe\" sternly put Uma behind Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it isn't the finest athlete in the whole city\" joked Nat as she stood up straight to address her college friend \"I haven't seen you in a while Uma, you look...healthy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma could only tsk at the scathing remark, even if it did light a spark hearing Nat say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, down here lashes\" demanded Reagan, passing comment to the volume of Nat's eye make up that night whilst also standing up, giving more of an overall view for the smirking club owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, calm down hotshot, I'm listening\" patronised Nat, appreciating the amount of bulging fat escaping Reagan's tshirt \"you want a drink or...something to eat perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you've been doing with Phoebe, loading her up with food and fattening her brains out...\"<br>\r\nA pause ensued as Reagan assessed whether Nat really was listening before wagging a finger to draw her target down to her level again, allowing her to whisper directly into Nat's ear.<br>\r\n\"I want in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat's face lit up at those words, a look that she couldn't quite wipe away before continuing the conversation.<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey, you've got the wrong person there, I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my sister ain't clever enough to get that fat on her own and she sure spends a lot of time with you\" retorted Reagan, knowing that Nat was just playing with her at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, the girl can eat\" purred Nat with the pretense of innocence still oozing from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are twins and I do have a much bigger ass than her these days\" teased Reagan, employing techniques she normally used on guys.<br>\r\nThe two locked eyes for a moment just before Sheryl's song finished, leaving an almost eerie silence over the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be right back ladies, I just have to talk to my DJ\" rattled off Nat with all the charm of a hostess before shimmying around the bar and trotting up to the sound desk across the dancefloor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan could only smile as she caught a glimpse of Nat peering back over her shoulder, no doubt to examine the redhead's figure in its entirety.<br>\r\nThe moment did not last, however, before a forceful punch found its way into Reagan's softer arm.<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?!\" exclaimed Uma as she stared daggers at Reagan as she chuckled \"I thought we were getting revenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I said was I want to stay on top of Phoebe\" interjected Reagan \"this Nat chick seems like a pretty good way of doing that considering what she's done to Phoebe over the past few weeks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma was left flabbergasted at what she'd just heard.<br>\r\nNot only had she steered Phoebe into Nat's web of food related torture but now Reagan had lept into the same trap willingly.<br>\r\nUma couldn't believe the stupidity of the twins and, more importantly, she couldn't believe that she was once again been upstaged for Nat's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I'm doing the house a favour, between Darryl and Nat my food bill is going to be non-existent back home\" laughed Reagan as she started to salivate just thinking about all the free food she was setting herself up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma could only stare dumbfounded at the younger redhead, baffled as to how Reagan thought this could end well in any way.<br>\r\nThe thought was cut short though as Nat came sauntering back towards the bar as the music kicked up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that ladies, you know how live entertainment can be\" apologised Nat with a quirky smile \"so where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were about to leave actu...\" started Uma before being cut off dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, little Reagan wants to be my friend\" grinned the host with a cheshire cat smile before closing the gap between the two of them to whisper in the redhead's ear as she had done before \"I say let's play, friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan would likely have reacted more openly but, before she had the chance to, Nat had grabbed her hand and was leading her to a door to one side of the bar.<br>\r\nAs the girls approached the door, Nat turned to face Uma<br>\r\n\"You coming Uma? There's room for everybody back here\"<br>\r\nUma's instincts told her that this was beyond wrong, but a deep urge within her stomach cried out for her to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further hesitation and a semi-audible rumble from her stomach, Uma followed after the others.<br>\r\nThis was all she had ever wanted after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ladies, what we have here is what I like to call...the Manager's Special\" announced Nat as she heaved two large trays towards her guests who were seated in a cushioned booth next to each other.<br>\r\nNat had brought them into a private function room that backed onto the bar but could not be seen by any other patrons of the club that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHEN you want this again you'll have to come through me because, well, its not on the menu\" purred Nat as she laid each meal down before each girl \"besides, its basically a food challenge so I have to...authenticate every attempt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, neither Reagan or Uma were particularly listening as they looked over the piles of food before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as you're so curious, let me go over the meal\" smiled Nat, taking great pleasure in her theatrics \"each Special includes two foot long chilli dogs, a half dozen sliders and a rack of ribs laid on a bed of mashed potatoes, spicy wings and fried chicken with onion rings, mozzarella sticks and salt and pepper fries\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer quantity of food would have been enough to deter most people but, given their recent dietary upgrades, the girls of Fordham Avenue were hardly 'most people'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whenever you're ready girls\" beckoned Nat with a spread of her arms as Reagan and Uma threw themselves into the mountains of food before her.<br>\r\nAs the girls feasted, Nat couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\nIt had been a while since she had had so many people on her feeding hook and it felt good to be back in the game like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh Uma, I can't move\" groaned Reagan with her stomach bulging out from her figure in a near spherical curve \"Uma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skinned hedonist snorted in her sleep as a soft puffy belch escaped her lips, her own stomach looking even rounder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh useless\" groaned Reagan as she adjusted herself slightly with a hand lazily laid over her stomach with the haze of an overstuffed sleep tugging at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Reagan!\" cooed Nat from the kitchen \"how would you like something sweet to finish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't kn...\" started Reagan with a grunt as she cradled her fullness just in time for the kitchen door to swing open to show Nat carrying a tray of cakes through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would only go to waste after tonight so have what you want honey\" purred Nat as she placed them before the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan couldn't help but look at the selection which instinctively triggering her hunger again, even if she didn't want it mentally.<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, she reached for a particularly aromatic chocolate cake with both hands before peeling a slice from it and taking a large bite, prompting a rather throaty moan of enjoyment as she did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Audrey had to admit, she was proud of Phoebe.<br>\r\nThings had been rough after the great divide between the twins, particularly given the emotional reactions from Phoebe and the long lasting absences of Reagan...and Uma for that matter...but Audrey felt her motherly tendencies stirring for her youngest sibling.<br>\r\nTurbulent times aside though and, after a great deal of supportive \u2018there theres\u2019, Phoebe\u2019s mood had improved a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, one might even mistake Phoebe to be growing up from her usual childish ways.<br>\r\nIn a surprising turn of events, and with little persuasion, Audrey had managed to convince Phoebe to take a position at her office which the redhead had warmed to almost organically.<br>\r\nSmartening herself up, Phoebe had traded her usual skimpy attire for tailored skirts and formal knee length dresses whilst also allowing her pride to subside enough to start wearing her glasses again.<br>\r\nPhoebe really was a pretty girl when she wasn\u2019t being so pushy with her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey also took solace in the fact that Phoebe\u2019s new job came with a constant and not insufficient wage.<br>\r\nAlthough not a great salary for one trying to support a house of four, Ixchel was after all self sufficient, but with Phoebe matching that wage and Reagan and Uma rarely home to drain resources they weren\u2019t contributing to, things were financially settled for the first time in a long time.<br>\r\nCombined with Ixchel\u2019s contributions the sisters even managed to hold onto some disposable income for themselves.<br>\r\nDisposable income which, given Phoebe\u2019s improved mental state and Audrey\u2019s pride for her sister, was being spent with something of a blind eye turned to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm, Aud, could you pass me the soda?\u201d asked Phoebe as she shuffled a pizza box onto the couch cushion beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing sweetie\u201d smiled Audrey as she leaned across to her sister with the 2litre bottle in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks sis\u201d purred Phoebe as she twisted the lid for and drank deeply from the bottle, draining a significant amount before breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had become something of a regular occurrence for Phoebe and Audrey as the former settled into her new job and increased wage.<br>\r\nAlso increasingly frequent were the number of shared meals the girls had in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast before work<br>\r\nLunch at work<br>\r\nSnack breaks during work time<br>\r\nDinner after work<br>\r\nTakeaway and tv nights<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular instance was the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving at one point disapproved of Phoebe\u2019s excessive consumption, Audrey had quickly realised that it did provide an outlet for her younger sister to air her feelings when dealing with the Reagan issue.<br>\r\nAs unorthodox a method as it may have been, the matriarchal blonde deemed it a worthy sacrifice if it meant Phoebe felt supported...even if the two girls did take on a great deal of empty calories as a result.<br>\r\nLong story short, even once Phoebe had got out of her funk, neither Durant wanted to give up on their frequent bonding meals and the rest is history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUUURP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebe!\u201d cried Audrey with a slight giggle to her tone, one which jostled her bloated middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead barely seemed phased though as she dove back into one of the pizza boxes in close arms reach, retrieving a greasy cheese drenched slice and bringing it straight to her plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey could only roll her eyes as she took to her own pizza box, looking over the tv as a parade of tanned scantily clad couples paraded around some beach chalet.<br>\r\nAs per, she didn\u2019t specifically care for the content but it was her guilty pleasure nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the garlic bread down there?\u201d asked Phoebe, hoovering up a string of cheese dangling from the corner of her mouth, the only remnants of her most recent slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded, her own mouth full at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool\u201d smiled Phoebe as she heaved herself to her feet.<br>\r\nAlthough quite the professional at work, Phoebe hadn\u2019t changed that much at home and, after a full day in the office she had immediately shelled her skirt and unbuttoned her shirt.<br>\r\nThe wardrobe choice didn\u2019t leave much to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her front open to the elements with the sides of her button shirt flapping around her bulging sides, it was clear that Phoebe\u2019s boobs were catching up with Audrey\u2019s in terms of size.<br>\r\nHer stomach was also surging forward compared to her thinner days and, even now standing, a prominent roll around her belly button was starting to feature giving her a heavy double belly look.<br>\r\nAs ever though, Phoebe\u2019s rear end was her largest asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the redhead possessed something of an office ass already, working alongside Audrey had only allowed her rear to balloon even more.<br>\r\nWith her panties being swallowed by the vast wobbling cheeks and overhung by her bulging love handles, Phoebe\u2019s ass was an entity unto itself and a defining feature like no other for the youngest Durant.<br>\r\nHer thighs were expanding at just as great a rate as well which, combined with her ass, had garnered a great deal of attention at work, something that Phoebe still relished in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry honey, I could have got that for you\u201d apologised Audrey as she shifted in her seat whilst discarding her empty pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t worry Aud\u201d cooed Phoebe as she bent over to grab the bread box \u201cyou can get the ice cream\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, I forgot about ice cream\u201d pondered Audrey \u201cdo you want it now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways!\u201d cheered Phoebe as she plopped heavily back in her seat, a piece of garlic bread already hanging from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I should have known\u2019 thought Audrey with a chuckle as she shuffled to the front of her seat before rising to her feet.<br>\r\n\u201cOoph\u201d groaned Audrey as she glanced down her body and gently stroked her belly with her finger tips.<br>\r\nThe sudden shift in her well fed weight had felt slightly uncomfortable until the blonde realised a different source of pressure.<br>\r\nNot to peddle stereotypes but, as a motherly person, Audrey was prone to wearing her leg wear more high waisted than her age group would usually suggest.<br>\r\nThis fashion choice also extended to her sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having eaten a great deal that night already, the stretchy grey material was still hugging her belly on a plane that still concealed her belly button.<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take a genius to notice though that the material was starting to pinch and form a slight bulge above the waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look comfortable Aud\u201d observed Phoebe, taking a moment to pause from eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me\u201d groaned Audrey as she tugged at the elasticated band, relishing in the release of pressure with each tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, let it all out!\u201d suggested the redhead with a cherubic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suggestion caught Audrey off guard.<br>\r\nSuch exhibitionism was usually the twins forte even with their recent weight gains.<br>\r\nAudrey was much more reserved even if the pressure on her stomach was REALLY unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAudrey?\u201d called out Phoebe to her sister, breaking the blondes day dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Sorry, what did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet the belly out if it\u2019s uncomfy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah...\u201d<br>\r\n\u2018What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment of build up but finally Audrey built up the courage and...*snap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, that feels so good!\u201d moaned Audrey with a deep breath as her rounded belly hung heavily over her now lowered waistband.<br>\r\nNaturally broad hipped, although not as curvaceous as Phoebe, Audrey had filled out quite impressively around the middle as she and her sister had indulged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, told you!\u201d smirked Phoebe before diving back into her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you did\u201d smiled Audrey with a thankful warmth \u201cso, ice cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm, yeah\u201d purred Phoebe \u201cand chocolate and chips and cookies whilst you\u2019re there\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u201d laughed Audrey as she turned to the living room door.<br>\r\nThe blonde ambled slowly down the hall towards the kitchen, one hand cradling her bloated belly as she did.<br>\r\nShe felt full but not uncomfortably so and, if she was being honest, it wasn\u2019t the most she and Phoebe had eaten in one sitting...<br>\r\nAs concerned as she had once been for Phoebe\u2019s sudden weight gain, the worry had since dissipated, it wasn\u2019t so bad enjoying what you ate especially now they had the spare money anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I couldn\u2019t decide on flavours so I\u2019ve brought them all, hope that\u2019s ok\u201d called Audrey as she re-entered the living room, arms full of the food requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhhhhm, good\u201d cooed Phoebe from her place on the couch \u201cpizza won\u2019t be here for a while so that should keep us going\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked confused as she put the food down<br>\r\n\u201cYou ordered more pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d purred Phoebe as she took a rather revealing photo and posted it through snapchat \u201cI just figured there\u2019s still loads of the night left so we might as well enjoy it\u201d<br>\r\nDespite her recent changes, the redhead remained as popular as ever on the medium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a surprise, Audrey couldn\u2019t argue the decision.<br>\r\nShe did feel much hungrier now she wasn\u2019t being squeezed by her waistband...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good Phebs\u201d smiled Audrey as she sat down again, her boobs jiggling above her belly as she did before slipping up a large packet of triple chocolate cookies hungrily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Auuuudrey\" called Phoebe from the opening of her eldest sisters work cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Phoebe?\" replied the blonde, not breaking eye contact with her computer screen as she flicked between databases and emails with a certain finesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wondered if we had a plan for dinner tonight\" cooed the bottom heavy redhead as she sauntered slightly into Audrey's cubicle space, her red dress clinging to her engorged figure with every fibre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed, there was no way she would be able to concentrate on work during this conversation.<br>\r\n\"Not officially, have you got anything in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh\" replied Phoebe with an overly enthusiastic shake of the head, one which sent her larger chest into a wobble \"I just wanted to know because I was thinking of going out for lunch and didn't want to get the same thing twice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well where are you going for lunch?\" asked Audrey, a hint of mum slipping into her tone as she turned in her swivel chair with her arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Nat'll probably just take me to the food court again\" mused Phoebe with all her usual innocence and a glimmer of daydreaming of the potential feast she was going to indulge in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still seeing Nat huh?\" questioned Audrey, the 'hint' of mum stepping aside for the more upfront version, one which was lost on the redheaded junior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we're still friends\" chirped Phoebe with a smile \"do you want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe another time\" murmured Audrey.<br>\r\nHer suspicions of Nat were very much still on the surface but there was no telling Phoebe things like that.<br>\r\nBesides, even with their combined wages, one less meal to pay for wasn't such a bad thing, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK!\" smiled Phoebe \"So I can get what I want for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the need to bite her tongue, Audrey painted on a warm smile before responding to her sister.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing sweetie, just work out what you want for dinner as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" purred Phoebe as she turned tail, great hips swaying side to side with the accompanying cheeks shaking like jelly with each heavy step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl\" murmured Audrey under her breath with a small endearing smile.<br>\r\nAll that talk of food had stirred a hunger inside Audrey though and, in one well practiced move, she slid her desk draw open and grabbed one of the many doughnuts stashed away in there.<br>\r\n\"Mhm, that is so good\" moaned that blonde softly as she took a large bite from the sugar crusted confection, licking her lips to ensure nothing escaped her.<br>\r\nFortunately for Audrey, it had gone unnoticed that she had her shirt untucked and free of her skirt to reduce the tightness around her stomach. She would have to pick up some more shirts for work soon but, for now, the doughnut was indulging her needs enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Two Days Later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe honey, could you get the door!\" shouted Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" shouted the redhead back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was another one of the sisters much beloved takeaway and TV nights and they were not messing around tonight.<br>\r\nBoth were showered and getting into pyjamas for the night and they had even had the foresight to order food at work earlier that day so they didn't need to wait longer than needed once they were settled.<br>\r\nAudrey was taking her sweet time getting re-dressed though meaning Phoebe had to get the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a life saver, we are starving in here\" announced Phoebe as she opened the door to the unsuspecting delivery driver stood on the steps of the townhouse, his arms laden with pizza boxes and a couple of bags hanging from his fingers.<br>\r\nEven with all the weight in his arms, the driver still managed to look surprised at the girl answering the door before him.<br>\r\nHe had a sneaking suspicion that 'starving' wasn't ENTIRELY true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a self declared queen of comfort, Phoebe had donned nothing more than a white stretchy vest top and a pair of sweat pant-style shorts but, in true ditzy Durant twin style, had not taken into account how exposed this left her.<br>\r\nIt was impossible to deny that Phoebe had continued to gain weight and came as no surprise, given her size and flirtatious exhibitionism, that she had more skin on show than some would be accustomed to.<br>\r\nA vest top so ill fitting that it couldn't cover her belly button, allowing for a complete roll of belly fat to hang free and heavy over her waistband, along with a valley of cleavage so deep it looked prone to causing suffocation was certainly more than usual for the unsuspecting delivery driver.<br>\r\nNot to mention her dominating hips and ass had expanded so much her shorts looked painted onto her and the seams had begun to split up her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the delivery driver struggled for where to put his eyes, the transaction itself went by smoothly and before long the door was closing on him, forgotten almost instantly after.<br>\r\n\"Pfft, you think we've got enough food there Phebs?\" asked Audrey as she headed down the stairs, now suitably dressed herself.<br>\r\nAlthough more modest than her sister, Audrey also found her choice of comfort slightly more revealing than she once appreciated.<br>\r\nIn truth, Audrey had very little skin on show but the tightness of her long legged pyjamas and the matching tshirt told enough tales on their own of how much the blonde had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoebe became increasingly double bellied, Audrey contrasted by having an uncreased rounded middle which sat heavily on billowy love handles.<br>\r\n'Round' was a rather apt word for Audrey's figure as a whole as her chest had continued to blossom whilst her lower half also bloomed, although more soft in comparison to Pheobe's maintained pertness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, we'll probably need some more before the night is out\" mused Phoebe as she waddled into the living room with the boxes she had been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'll see about that\" snorted Audrey as she followed behind, scratching the lower crest of her belly which had ever so slightly exposed itself beneath her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Three Hours Later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna need more food aren't we?\" groaned Audrey as she swallowed the last bite of pizza in her mouth, idly licking her lips clean of sauce and cheese as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask\" cheered Phoebe as she lazily reached for her phone \"you can get this one though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" replied Audrey as she absently rubbed her belly which rumbled softly at the thought of more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Six Days Later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph, I can't eat another bite Phebs\" groaned Audrey from the other side of the table, nudging her most recently emptied plate towards the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right behind you there sis\" groaned Phoebe in return as she slumped heavily back and delicately sipped at a glass of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we got value for money out of our 'employee of the month' meal though right?\" smirked Audrey with a touch of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe could only smile.<br>\r\nHer sister had never been so sassy before but it actually suited the blonde well.<br>\r\nThe two sisters had also never got along as well as they had been doing over the past few weeks and Audrey was quickly becoming Phoebe's best friend.<br>\r\nWell, along with Nat of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you ladies anything else?...\" asked the waitress tentatively as she weaved to the Durant's table.<br>\r\nThis hadn't been the first time she had asked that question tonight and she fully expected to be sent off again with another order.<br>\r\nNeedless to say, mind, it had not gone unpredicted that the two women before her would be in for the long haul that night but this actually did look like the end for them both.<br>\r\nAs large as they had looked when they arrived they were certainly larger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a skin tight dress as always, Phoebe now sported a food baby that caused her usually creased belly to smooth out considerably, giving her quite the outward bulge as her belly sat proud of her hips in a rather rounded fashion.<br>\r\nAudrey meanwhile, whilst not showing too many outward signs of her stuffed nature, was contending with her overly tight button down shirt again which was stretched so tightly her button holes had spread open to expose the pale skin beneath.<br>\r\nAt some point during the meal she had also freed herself from her skirt, allowing her bulbous belly to sit on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I could go for some dessert\" chimed Phoebe whilst wiggling in her seat, giving quite the show to their waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Phoebe?\" called Audrey from across the table, a slight look of concern tugging at her face.<br>\r\nPhoebe just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\" said the waitress cautiously as she pulled out her notepad \"anything in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, just a bit of everything and we'll take it from there\" smiled Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then...anything for you miss?\" asked the waitress, looking to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde knew she didn't want to really but temptation overcame her in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the same please\" requested the blonde politely, wishing she was in her pyjamas for this bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will be right out\" smiled the waitress automatically before heading to the kitchen, completely astounded at how much these girls had put away that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are terrible\" frowned Audrey with all the effort she could muster, albeit very little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You didn't HAVE to have any\" smirked Phoebe \"besides, the desserts here are fantastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*One Hour Later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These desserts ARE fantastic!\" cheered Audrey as she dropped her fork down for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya\" purred Phoebe with a wry grin.</span></div></div>",

Pretty pretty pretty please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was finding it difficult to concentrate.<br>\r\nShe and Phoebe had just finished indulging in one of their classic oversized meals when the redhead had received a text that had got her very excited.<br>\r\nNow, whilst all Audrey wanted to do was crawl into bed and belch in peace, Phoebe was begging her to go to lunch with Nat tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Phebes...\u201d Audrey weakly protested, her hand covering her mouth to stifle a string of puffy burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleeeease! It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d insisted Phoebe, bouncing a little more than a girl in her state of skimpy dress probably should, certainly in front of a sister who was copping an eyeful as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed, pushing a moderate burp through her lips, before reaching the inevitable conclusion.<br>\r\n\u201cOk Phoebe, I\u2019ll come with you just this once\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d shrieked the redhead, bouncing around the living room for a moment before dumping herself down on the sofa and swiping her phone up to hammer out a text to Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nervous as the thought of meeting with Nat made Audrey, it was nice to see Phoebe so happy and, needless to say, the thought of lunch did appeal to the blondes new found gluttony.<br>\r\nAs Audrey began to maneuvr herself off her seat, Phoebe suddenly came flying back in, phone held out and next thing Audrey knew was the sound of a phone camera clicking.<br>\r\nBriefly seeing the photo flash up on Phoebe\u2019s screen, Audrey found herself slightly bemused at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe\u2019s appearance was no surprise, she saw that often enough, and usually more than she bargained for with the youngest Durant\u2019s tendency towards ill fitting and displays of skin.<br>\r\nAs such, it came as no surprise to have her eyes drawn to Phoebe\u2019s bloated belly escaping her skin tight T-shirt.<br>\r\nAudrey did, however, also notice her own bloated middle escaping her pyjama top and sitting heavily on her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts mulling over her new found girth, Audrey only found herself pulled back as Phoebe\u2019s phone pinged and the twin rattled off the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNat\u2019s looking forward to it and says you look really good Aud\u201d smiled Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey just threw an awkward smile as she found the energy to rise from her seat.<br>\r\n\u2018Of course Nat thinks I look good...\u2019 thought the blonde as she half waddled out of the living room towards her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t my favourite family!\u201d purred Nat as she clapped eyes on Phoebe and Audrey approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe simply squealed before taking off at a moderate pace for the ever growing redhead and threw her arms around Nat in a huge hug.<br>\r\nAudrey was far less enthusiastic as she closed in on the pair, awkwardly adjusting her stretchy denim pants as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Thank god +Size makes everything so stretchy\u2019 thought Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had suggested to her older sister that she wear sweatpants but the blonde had opted for more stylish jeans instead, even if they did sit as high waisters and pinched around her motherly hips..<br>\r\nBesides, sweats wouldn\u2019t have gone with the blouse she had picked out and she was desperate to wear that at least as it flowed whisp like around her bulging figure, concealing some of her larger features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was far less conservative though, and with her sweats hiked up to her waist, ever inch of the younger girl was popping out.<br>\r\nThe stretched grey material of her leg wear was tight around her legs, displaying her huge calorie soaked bum and thighs as well as drawing attention to her concealed belly hang which made a cute addition to the front of her figure.<br>\r\nLikewise, her vest top looked fit to peel off her as it struggled against her chest and the rest of her expanded belly.<br>\r\nRounded out with feet clad in flip flops, she was the image of her formally thin self just much rounder and hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, you both look fabulous so shall we get going?\u201d asked Nat, turning slightly to gesture the group moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh yeah, where are we going?\u201d asked Phoebe, eyes swimming with delight as she asked the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just a little place called Brass Tops\u201d announced Nat as she shimmied off in the direction of the popular buffet restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d cheered Phoebe as she headed after her friend, leaving Audrey to follow up behind.<br>\r\nThe blonde bit her lip anxiously, anticipating the direction this would take but was quickly overtaken by the sound of her stomach growling at her.<br>\r\n\u2018Oh boy...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you both know the drill here so go crazy girls, my treat\u201d said Nat as she pushed the decorative double doors open, swarming the girls in the rich smell of meats and sticky sauces.<br>\r\nThe Durants were lost for words, licking their lips and staring like kids in a sweet shop, or them in a sweet shop that one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirlies?\u201d cooed Nat as she eyed her guests with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped Phoebe and Audrey back to their senses and, on autopilot, they made for the buffet line grabbing a couple of plates each.<br>\r\nPouring over the counters, it didn\u2019t take long for the sisters to load their plates with a range of barbecued meats, potatoes, breads and a cast array of sides perfectly matched with their meat choices all whilst Nat followed behind with her hands full of a tray housing the larger girls overspill of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in smooth automated motion, the girls then made their way to a circular booth, sitting down and then immediately diving into their respective feasts.<br>\r\nAudrey\u2019s skepticism fell by the wayside almost immediately as she shoveled the first forkful of meat into her mouth, a delicate uncharacteristic moan escaping her lips as she did.<br>\r\nPhoebe, meanwhile, was far more accustomed to Nat\u2019s hospitality and nothing could have stopped her as she dove into her food with the enthusiasm of a starved woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got everything you want girls?\u201d asked Nat as she tucked into her own plate of sizeable portion<br>\r\nBoth girls just nodded without fully looking up, the hunger having taken over for them both.<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d purred Nat as she bit into a large steak burger whilst eying Phoebe and Audrey across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time trickled by, the plates piled up as the Durants systematically emptied each and every one of every morsel put before them whilst Nat diligently resupplied the hungry women per their requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore chicken Aud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you tried the ribs yet Phebes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about another portion of salt and pepper fries for the table, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth finished at once, this might take a while\u201d grinned Nat as she excused herself to get a fresh plate for both girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny semblance of decorum either girl may have had before entering Brass Tops was long gone, buried under a mind boggling torrent of calories.<br>\r\nAudrey discovered the error of her ways in not following Phoebe\u2019s suggestion of sweat pants and, to provide some comfort, had long since unbuttoned her jeans allowing her filling belly to escape onto her lap whilst pulling her blouse tighter to her bulging love handles.<br>\r\nEver the wise in clothing decisions, Phoebe was actually maintaining her modesty for once even if each item was stretching further and further by the minute to keep her swelling belly under wraps. To compensate the forward growth her vest had crept up to expose her back though, not that the redhead cared and actually enjoyed the slight cooling effect of her exposed skin.<br>\r\nThe fullness of her belly had also caused her blossoming boobs to be pushed up, reaching a point of rivalling Audrey\u2019s at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re still hungry you two\u201d called Nat as she returned with another refill for the girls, possibly the largest one yet.<br>\r\nPhoebe and Audrey simultaneously groaned as they looked at their most recent acquisitions but, unable to resist, found themselves reaching out and continuing the binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs each girl sweated and slowly soldiered on, Nat just watched, indulging in her own food.<br>\r\nThe more observant would notice that, since meeting Phoebe at the mall that day, Nat has also actually filled out some, an appetite like that was infectious after all, but her main prize was watching the Durants pig out.<br>\r\nHaving Audrey join the fold was a sweet perk after reeling in Phoebe, Reagan and Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph, I have never eaten so much in my life...\u201d groaned Phoebe as she kicked her bedroom door shut for the night.<br>\r\nHer and Audrey had really hit the buffet hard and it was showing now.<br>\r\nWaddling slowly, Phoebe unintentionally parked herself in front of her full length mirror before peeling her sweatpants off.<br>\r\nThe waistband really was drenched in sweat after all that time eating but the real surprise came when Phoebe caught her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah...\u201d whispered Phoebe as she saw just how distended her belly was, hanging heavy and firm free of her clothes.<br>\r\nPhoebe wasn\u2019t completely stupid, she did know she\u2019d been steadily growing recently but she\u2019d never looked THIS big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore out of habit than anything, Phoebe grabbed her phone, rolled her vest up completely and snapped a picture of her reflection.<br>\r\nShe ogled the photo for a moment before making her way to bed and burrowing herself into her sheets.<br>\r\nAs the redhead looked over her most recent picture, her belly sticking out so far in a near perfect sphere in front of her whilst her infamous rear ballooned out behind her...it was oddly interesting to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip in the dark with nothing other than her phone lighting up her face, Phoebe opened Snapchat and brought the photo up in the app and plastered \u2018oops\u2019 over the picture as her eyes began to droop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ping*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...oh no...\u201d<br>\r\nThat shouldn\u2019t have happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At this point, the schedules of the women of 8422 Fordham Ave and club manager Nat were becoming inexorably linked. And with it a shift in the method of the meet-ups as Nat continued to encourage everyone's increased appetites. The new regulars to the club ended up being Reagan and Uma, while Phoebe and Audrey would meet Nat for regular lunches, as Audrey was reluctant to enter the night life scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, the enabling feeder was beginning to feel the effects of personally catering to the other ladies caloric intake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep these wings coming!\" Reagan belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Red, how about sharing some of those?\" Uma snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager's private booth was getting two well worn grooves into it these days, with the expansive pair of Reagan and Uma. Course, with the size of the brash twin's ass she had hips that went on for days, her cheeks and thighs flattening as she sat to give her an extreme squashed pear shape with her oversized club shorts, full belly hanging over her lap, Reagan had by far the biggest groove. Not to be outdone, Uma had a very thickened look, her potbelly nearly out-pushing Reagan's these days in distance where it was second in terms of width. Their tummies were on full display, given lavish attention by the exclusive menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat can get us more,\" Reagan rolled her eyes, munching away. \"Won't you Nat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Nat smiled, licking the last of her signature spiced-soy glaze from her fingers. These wing baskets had been subject to the baker's dozen effect, as it wasn't like Nat couldn't have some of her own as she brought out fresh food for her favorite patrons. Had to check quality control and all that. Damn, she made good food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the plumped, thick legged outset manager made her way back towards the chicken, she could feel the extra wobble in her body. Since joining in with her four latest <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">victims</span> friends she had been putting on the pounds herself. It wasn't an unpleasant sensation, for her, although her wardrobe was more selective these days. Her leopard print skirt and leather belt combo was feeling more pinched around her middle, and sections of her tattoos were more exposed than they had previously been with this outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis introspection was interrupted by the sudden presence of Michael, one of her bartenders. \"Hey Boss, got a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, *urp* excuse me,\" Nat coughed. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Michael really didn't want to be the messenger in this situation. \"The kitchen staff is complaining about a backlog of orders that's really slowing things down. We've got customers on the main floor waiting on their apps and plates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brit and Antonio haven't failed me before,\" Nat scoffed, \"I think they can deal with an uptick in business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael scratched his shoulder nervously, well aware of his boss's tendencies. \"See, it's more about where most of the orders are coming from. The line is, err, clogged with your private orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat's expression soured, only to be broken by a sudden outburst back from the private booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I was going to eat those cheese curds!\" Reagan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow Reagan,\" Uma said with her mouth full. \"You weren't sharing the wings so it's just desserts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd, you're annoying when you get drunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it if you slow down,\" Uma teased. \"Can't hold your liquor, Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm not even full,\" Reagan kneaded the top fold of her belly rolls. Since charming her way through two feeders on her mission to eclipse Phoebe's rear, Reagan was used to large portions. \"I'm not about to slow down! Where's Nat with more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cringeworthy smile, Nat looked Michael dead in the eye as she passed off the spent plates. \"Well, if the kitchen can't handle the orders maybe you should go back there an help them. You REALLY don't want me to have to come back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss,\" Michael groaned, not wanting to argue further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a shame that her best bartender had to fill in back in the kitchen, Nat thought to herself as she rubbed her forehead. She could really do with a stiff mixer right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you're always so nice to us taking us to these new places!\" Phoebe squealed, \"That we wanted to bring you here! Audrey and I've been to this diner since we were kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was nice to come back when we moved back to the city,\" Audrey smiled, pouring extra cream in her coffee. \"You okay, Nat?\" she asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph?\" Nat replied. \"Oh, nothing, just tired. We've been really busy at the club lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to miss it,\" Phoebe said. \"But Aud's got me on a new job and it cuts into how late we can stay up. But we have time for all these lunch breaks, which is also great. They serve breakfast all day so you can order it right along with lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spread at their table showed the clashing sections of the menu. The Durant sisters, who knew the menu by heart at this point, had stacks of pancakes next to burgers, a basket of onion rings over an omelet, with extra bacon and sausage gravy finding itself a topping wherever it was or was not fitting. Even Nat had been talked into mixing and matching, as she nursed a breakfast burrito with a hot tuna melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had suggested the dinner so she could justify having more casual wear, still not one to maximize her outfits for maximum consumption like the ravenous Phoebe. \"Oh look, they're doing the limited time pancake balls with the confetti batter and sweat cream, we should order those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG yes!!\" Phoebe exclaimed, bouncing up on her massive rump akin to a plate of gelatin on a trampoline. \"And the chili-cheese fries. You've gotta try those Nat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh,\" Nat shrugged, she still felt a partially digested mass in her stomach. As the Durant sisters continued to place orders and offer to share food with Nat, naturally being the most generous of the housemates, the club manager was regretting the major change to her common strategy. When she was feeding someone she preferred being in control, either with her club or taking dates to a place like a buffet or food court so she could keep loading the food their direction. Audrey and Phoebe were total sweethearts, and while they were still eating an impressive amount, they were so chummy with Nat on slipping the plates that Nat got a bit more food than she bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*oof*\" Nat groaned as they were getting to settle the bill. \"I gotta hand it to you ladies, you know how to pick them.\" Heck, she was feeling gassy, struggling in her purse to find an antacid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not even the best part!\" Phoebe said, \"We saved the best surprise for last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat blinked. And blinked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took two waitresses to safely carry the largest ice cream sundae dish Nat had ever seen. The sundae crested the edge of the table, pushing aside empty plates like a raiding viking ship, a veritable mountain of a dozen flavors of ice cream, tons of nuts and whipped cream, a bushel of cherries and a bunch of split bananas outlined the fantastic dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've always wanted to try this!\" Phoebe said, \"although we figured it'd be best with three people.\" And without losing one moment the dizzy redhead stuck her head towards the sundae with her spoon, an increasingly messy eater when ice cream was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe, manners!\" Audrey chided, trying to reign in her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,\" Nat frowned, \"You too enjoy, I've had enough sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, help us, Nat,\" Audrey said. \"If we don't finish it in time it won't be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat considered her options: finding any further capacity in her stuffed stomach vs more money lost on her disposable cash...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is a smorgasbord,\" Reagan said, having hit overeating euphoria at yet another night at the club. \"Darryl may have the dough, but he can't provide the atmosphere.\" Nat's house DJ, Sheryl, had a nothing killer set pumping through the club as the feasting beauties heard it from the private booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though you can't dance worth shit,\" Uma said, have let go of her previous reservations as she regained the confidence of her college days. \"They'd have to evacuate the dance floor with your wide ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right,\" Reagan said, although having become a glutton she didn't fancy the exertion. \"I can't believe you shook your stuff out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works up quite the appetite,\" Uma said, picking up on her eating. \"How about you, Nat, you work yourself to the bone with this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nat's feet were killing her, standing up so much. Having two sets of feedees and managing her club was more tiring than she had thought. \"You know, schooch over there before Michael comes out with the next manager's special. I am the manager after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her break, DJ Sheryl and Michael began gossiping about Nat joining in with her favorite clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it weird how you never seem to get full from Asian food?\" Phoebe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe, Audrey and Nat were crowded around a table at the mall's food court, sitting on far more chairs and possessing far more lunch trays than their number would suggest. Ostensibly, they had original meet for a shopping trip as they again were needing to go up a rack size at +Size, although it had mutated to having lunch first so they would 'know what size to shop from.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week of catering to all four new favorites was leaving Nat frazzled. She was dressed far more casually than her typical club attire and business suits, nothing really fitting as she wore sweats and an oversized t-shirt. The constant enabling, and her own consumption was making her feel bloated an exhausted. Even her gourmet tastes had diminished slightly, as she and the Durant sisters ate through the fast food combo numbers like a bizarre game of food court bingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feeder dominance was beginning to backfire.</span></div></div>",

It's kinda early...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for that hun, I just wanted to apologise for not been able to meet up with you recently, its been PRETTY hectic at the club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, long as you're ok\"<br>\r\nAudrey groaned as she lazily swung her legs out of bed, muffling a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am amazing girl, which is actually part of why I'm calling\" mused Nat with an air of self pride in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here we go' thought Audrey.<br>\r\nAlthough she had made an effort to befriend Nat, much to Phoebe's gratitude, the blonde matriarch of 8422 Fordman Avenue was still very much skeptical of the club owner on the other end of her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm throwing a bit of a party at the club tonight to mark the success of our expansion into new realms and I would really love it if you could come down\" asked Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had mentioned something about Nat having to do a massive overhaul at the club, something about opening during the day as a bistro type thing to warrant taking on a larger kitchen staff.<br>\r\nApparently Nat's food was held in such high regard lately that it was too much strain on the team.<br>\r\nPhoebe said the place was barely any more crowded than usual but Nat was a savvy enough business woman to know how to deal with consumer growth and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok...I don't know Nat, it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on Audrey, I know you and Phoebe don't have work tomorrow so I'm sure your curfew can stand to extend a LITTLE longer tonight just this once\" purred Nat, knowing she had Audrey's usual excuse taken off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thanks Phoebe' thought Audrey as she chewed her lip, floundering a little still barely awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what\" continued Nat, undeterred by Audrey's silence \"we'll call this an open invite, come if you want but it would mean a lot if you could make it, especially seeing as I wouldn't be where I am without you girls\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Audrey off guard and stank suspiciously of a 'Nat Trap' as her and Uma had taken to calling them in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" asked Audrey, unable to engage any more mental faculty to the conversation in her tired state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just without you, Phoebe, Reagan and Uma I wouldn't have realised that my passion truly lies in hospitality\" cooed Nat with a smile that could be seen down the phone.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I will see you later and don't worry about being fancy or anything like that, we're all friends and we're just going to have a good time, bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BEEP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed.<br>\r\nShe could smell a rat somewhere, she just didn't know where it was or if it was actually a rat for that matter.<br>\r\nShe did know though that, just for a change, she was hungry as her belly growled at her from the confines of a stretchy vest top.<br>\r\nAt least she would have time for a decent breakfast before work now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you've ACTUALLY come to the club Aud, tonight is gonna be so good!\" squealed Phoebe as the two girls stood at the bottom of the steps leading into Nat's club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither\" muttered Audrey as she thought back on how she'd ended up finding herself here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Phoebe, looking up from her phone with a perplexed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just saying I can't believe you got the taxi to go to McDonalds on the way here\" mused Audrey, diverting the conversation.<br>\r\nPhoebe giggled.<br>\r\n\"Well you did always tell me I should line my stomach before drinking and I couldn't get anything to eat before we left because I was getting ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey glanced at her sister with a look of bemusement at that comment.<br>\r\nFor a start, it had taken the youngest twin all of five minutes to throw on a pair of sweats and a tortuously overtaxed tshirt likening the wearer's physique to that of Buddha and inviting people to rub her 'lucky belly'.<br>\r\nSecondly, Phoebe's idea of not eating before leaving had included half a box of pop tarts, a sharing back of chips and a sleeve of oreos.<br>\r\nIt certainly didn't take a genius to know that none of these points were worth arguing with the young redhead though so instead Audrey made her way towards the club door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aud!\" called Phoebe from the foot of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" asked Audrey, impatiently turning around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your butt looks amazing\" cooed Phoebe before waddling up the stairs herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs odd as it was to have her sister compliment her rear like that, the comment still made Audrey smile.<br>\r\nIt certainly carried more weight since Phoebe's shift in perspective after her accidental Snapchat belly pic.<br>\r\nDespite being initially concerned of the backlash she would receive socially as a result of her weight gain, Phoebe actually received far more positivity from it than anything else and, long story short, had embraced the new attention to the max.<br>\r\nShifting from a stereotypical flirtatious poser into a much more rounded (literally and metaphorically) lover of food and chub, her audience barely changed and, as it turned out, a lot of guys were still into what she had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Phebes\" smiled Audrey, trying not to blush whilst watching her sister climb the stairs, the redhead's own continuously growing assets shaking like jelly with each heavy step.<br>\r\n\"You're...welcome\" panted Phoebe as she drew level with her sister \"Ready?\"<br>\r\nAudrey nodded before pushing the door open for her sister, quickly following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were immediately dragged into the bustling party behind the doors with people crammed in like sardines, something that neither Phoebe or Audrey had accounted for.<br>\r\nNevertheless, the girls forced their way through the crowds, having to stop on multiple occasions as people recognised one girl or the other and wanted to talk or take pictures or rub Phoebe's belly as her tshirt requested.<br>\r\nIt was a wild few moments for the Durant sisters as they slowly but surely made their way to the bar in the hopes that they would come across Nat at some point on their travels but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seen Nat?\" shouted Phoebe to one guest over the sound of Cheryl's DJ set<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat?\" asked the girl in question, looking puzzled as she slowly sipped from her drink through a straw \"nope, don't know any Nat's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she was helpful\" grumbled Phoebe before turning back to Audrey who put a drink in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" asked Phoebe, taking a sip before the answer could come her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never really got chance to celebrate your new job so seems like as good a chance as any\" smiled Audrey softly, taking a sip from her own drink<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks Aud!\" cheered Phoebe, throwing her arms around her sister causing their bellies to rub together within their respective clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad you're happy replied Audrey as she gently squeezed her sister back, opting to gloss over just how big the two girls felt in that moment even if she did admit that Phoebe felt quite a bit larger than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Audrey Durant?\" called a voice from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" replied Audrey, turning to where the voice had come from.<br>\r\nIt was Michael the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss woman said to send you through the back once you got here\" added the server before wandering to the end of the bar and placing a hand on the door next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...erm...thanks\" said Audrey as she nudged Phoebe along towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's about time you made it!\" called out Nat as she heaved herself from her seat to greet the two sisters at the door \"there will be nothing left by the time these two are finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for inviting us\" cooed Phoebe, throwing herself in for a hug which was caught immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not at all, come on, come on\" ushered Nat as she wandered back to the booth with the sisters in tow \"you must be starving the pair of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" cried Phoebe with her belly rumbling almost on cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's plenty to be had\" purred Nat \"but first...look who's here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Audrey and Phoebe came round the booth they both took a double take as they looked at Uma and Reagan for the first time in an apparently long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma was a mere shadow of her former athletic self at this point, although the amount of attention that Nat slathered her with did wonders for helping her get over that, even if her choice of a overstretched sports bra and leggings might indicate some denial.<br>\r\nSporting a near spherical gut ballooning out from her padded hips, Uma was unquestionably belly dominant in contrast to the Durants as well as having a thick pair of thighs and a chin swaddled face.<br>\r\nEach hungry grab also gave away the development of fattened underarms which wobbled cavernous cleavage with each gentle nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Uma sat Reagan who appeared to have completely doubled down on staying ahead of Phoebe.<br>\r\nDressed typically Reagan-esque in gym shorts, fish nets and a sleeveless vest, the older twin was frankly huge.<br>\r\nIn keeping with her genetics, her ass took up more of the booth than Uma by a considerable margin and was stretching her shorts so tight that rips had formed around her thighs.<br>\r\nHer fish nets served more to cause inch after inch of fat to squeeze out between the webbing around her voluminous thighs and the lowest roll of her belly they had been stretched over which lay exposed in her lap.<br>\r\nThe shortness of her vest betrayed her growing chest as the normally flowy material clung against her muffin top and side rolls, further displaying her descent into unadulterated gluttony at the cost of her waist line which now divided her middle into two heavy pale rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you girls anything then?\" asked Nat innocently as she shifted her own weight to give the newcomers room to sit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Er, hello,\" Audrey said, beginning to realize to what extent everyone's night plans had been over the past few months. Nat had gone all out on refurbishing her club and kitchen, and the manager's special booth had been widened considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Phebs,\" Uma said, rousing herself from some wings as she caught sight of the twin's shirt. \"Here, let me rub your belly for luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe shifted her weight to sit next to Uma, who wiped her hands off with some napkins and proceeded to give the twin a full belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe giggled, \"Aw, thanks!\" Reagan scoffed from her end of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about it Aud?\" Nat offered the seat, which conveniently meant Audrey would be hemmed in by her youngest sister and former college bestie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Audrey said, nerves still frayed from going outside her comfort zone. But the smell of the appetizers Reagan and Uma were having were fantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking good, Aud,\" Nat said as she squeezed into next to the oldest Durant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, um, you too?\" Audrey said, feeling flustered. Nat certainly looked healthy. And bigger than Audrey had remembered. Her overripe plumped form was looking much larger, more evenly portioned all over compared to the standout features of Uma and the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Business is booming,\" Nat said, \"and the girls have been helping me develop a fantastic menu, so I wanted to you taste the end results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping was a generous definition of the efforts of the club regulars, as the generous extra padding on each of their frames was a testament to their enabled gluttony. Audrey had expected a different experience having passed the dancing attendees and drinks flowing from the bar but she remembered how Nat had been experimental with foods in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new twist on a classic,\" Nat explained as a new dish was pushed in from of Audrey. \"Spicy Spinach-Artichoke Dip with extra parmesan and house made pita.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Audrey said, too prim to use her hands and portioning out a bite with her spoon. She took a taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point it was obvious that Audrey would be the sole eater of this appetizer, as old memories began to stir in Audrey's mind with the tastes playing off of her taste buds. She had missed Natalie's fantastic cooking. When she was on their floor when she and Uma were roommates, there was always something Nat had offered to eat. Hell, after the first Freshman Fifteen Audrey had gotten an extra set from Nat's involvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her previous concerns about that previous relationship were rendered dormant as Audrey began to eat all that was offered at the table. When Nat asked if she needed a refill of a drink, or Phoebe had her try some dumplings, to Uma offering to split dessert, Audrey ate, and ate. And ATE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was eating like a woman possessed, like a woman making up for lost time over all the previous meals her other roommates had consumed from Nat's influence. Sure, she had been keeping heavy portions at home or around the diner thanks to Phoebe's increased appetite, but this was decidedly different as the manager's table enjoyed course after course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Urk*\" Reagan winced, kneading the sides of her broad stomach. \"I need to catch my breath.\" Her double feeder jumpstarted appetite, from her aim to surpass Phoebe as having the biggest Durant twin rear, had lead to her practically shoveling food into her mouth at every meal. She ate so large of quantities that she was beginning to have stomach pains from indigestion. It was like her stomach was a back up traffic jam on the freeway during rush hour, as the pain to Reagan's overfed appetite was getting sharp whenever she hit her limit, and she and Uma had already consumed several rounds as the first ones to the club. She was beginning to feel how tight her shorts were getting and could silently feel those rips increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Reagan, Uma had already had an impressive amount to eat, and her swollen stomach was getting gassy from the food and beverage she had consumed. She gave out a low whistle after a mighty belch, now giving her own stomach rubs. Her dark skin was covered with even darker stretch marks, as she had given up on trying to diminish their appearance with medicative cream. \"Excellent menu, Nat, I'm about ready to throw in the towel. Gotta let this settle before we hit the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I still want to get out there!\" Phoebe added, lavishing in the attention she was getting from people with the change in her style of profile pics. The air headed redhead might have bitten off more than she could chew with the pre-clubbing run to McDonalds. While her appetite could rival Reagan's, she had been downing plenty of drinks after the first Audrey had gotten for her as congratulations, and the inebriations were making her eager to head out to the dance floor much like Uma, as their only collective exercise these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile each of the women ate at their own pace, plenty of eyes were looking Audrey's direction, where any previous shred of willpower had been lost to the fathoms of her newfound hunger. From fried mozzarella to wings, pizza flatbreads to meatballs, the dips and award winning brownies, Audrey had a chance to eat everything on the menu. For how restrained she could be around the townhouse, this was surprising to many of her family and friends present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Aud, don't you think it's time to slow down?\" Uma asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey raised her head, glasses slightly askew and mouth stained with various foodstuffs. \"Oh this is excellent! You girls have been having it so lucky! What do you call this again, Nat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Plum and Rum Parfait,\" Nat said, all smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, yummy!\" Audrey laughed, her belly quaking in the tight confines of the jeans jacket and skirt combo she had selected for clubbing. \"And a, what you say, chaser of another rum drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up,\" Nat said, flagging down her bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when has Audrey ever had this much to drink?\" Reagan asked Uma, as neither of the two could find an answer.</span></div></div>",

Why didn't you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\" hissed Reagan from within her hair, shoveling bacon into her own mouth at a great rate of knots \"too loud\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hung over too huh?\" asked Phoebe as she tucked into her bacon, noticing the appearance of sausage, fried bread and eggs on her plate as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan could only nod as she continued to eat.<br>\r\n\"She's not much of a conversationalist at the best of times\" teased Darryl as he slid a fresh helping of breakfast foods towards Reagan.<br>\r\nPhoebe giggled under her breath, trying to avoid shaking her head too much as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs breakfast trundled on for Phoebe and Reagan, the twins chatted a little between themselves and with Darryl.<br>\r\nIt came out at one point that Darryl had been helping Reagan fill her face to her heart's content and the twins actually managed to air their grievances about Reagan's one-sided rivalry.<br>\r\nIt was a sweet moment for the alienated twins as they gorged their hangovers, so much so that their bellies were aching nearly as much as their head's by the time they were finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope Uma wasn't planning on having any breakfast\" chuckled Darryl as he cleaned away the remnants of the girls breakfasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, her loss\" sneered Reagan with a ripping belch and full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe snorted as she rubbed her own bloated belly, licking her greasy lips as clean as she could manage whilst balancing her phone in her spare hand to capture her post-breakfast appearance for her fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you girls anything else then?\" asked Darryl, wiping the counter down like an industrious bar manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think I need a break for now\" grunted Reagan with another belch as she dropped to her feet for the first time in a few hours.<br>\r\nAs she landed her whole body wobbled, and it was quite the sight.<br>\r\nDefinitely still the larger twin, and biggest town house resident for that matter, Reagan was all bottom heavy girth which was on full display given she had also discarded her bottomwear like Phoebe.<br>\r\nAs queen of the booth at Nat's club, Reagan looked like she challenged Darryl's bar stools adequately with angry red marks adorning her thighs where her weight had pressed against the hard perch.<br>\r\nIndicative of her binging, Reagan's belly bulged out ahead of her hips in a round mass that hung heavily over her pants and gifted her with a fattened muffin top above her hips.<br>\r\nAlthough no Audrey, Reagan's chest had certainly soaked up plenty of calories in its time and was stretching her top much more than it would previously have had done, much to the redhead's pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was just a slightly smaller clone of her twin in most dimensions, her only real size difference manifesting in the form of her double rolled belly forming a thick crease around her belly button in contrast to her sister's single formed stomach, even when not stuffed to the gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me know when you're hungry again and I'll get you both sorted\" smiled Darryl as he finished his cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins waddled their way into the living room where Phoebe had been sleeping, catching a glimpse of Uma's head nestled in between a huddle of blankets on their way, before settling down on a sofa large enough to house both of their sizable arses comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we're talking again Reagan, I've missed you\" smiled Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh leave it out Pheebs, you're obviously still drunk\" smirked Reagan as she reached for the TV remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it Reagan, I hated that we fell out\" replied Phoebe before curling up as best as her bloated figure would allow to watch the telly.<br>\r\nReagan glanced at her twin before giving a subtle nod of acknowledgment to what had been said.<br>\r\nShe had missed Phoebe if she was honest, she just didn't need her reputation damaging by being soft.<br>\r\nBesides, she could be friends with Phoebe again now that she was the undisputed queen of arses in the Durant family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Audrey...\" grunted Uma from her nest, a torrent of groans punctuating the announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not here Umz!\" shouted Reagan, happy to be loud now that her hangover had been soaked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...What? Stop shouting Reagan, where's Audrey at?\" asked a confused Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan shrugged.<br>\r\n\"I dunno, thought she'd got in the taxi but I was pretty wasted\" shrugged Reagan, idly flicking through channels \"she'll turn up, she's a big girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" grunted Uma again, barely risen from her blanket fortress \"hey, erm, can you guys smell bacon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe looked at Reagan unsure of what to say whilst the eldest twin threw a wink at her junior<br>\r\n\"I dunno Umz, I can't smell anything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, me neither\" chirped up Phoebe, stifling her laughter as she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, could really do with some bacon\" groaned Uma before collapsing back into her blanket cocoon.</span></div></div>",

We've been walking for miles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, the twins had only been walking a few blocks, something even their former thin selves could have comfortably managed, but the days of walking without complaint were behind the girls now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Reagan still dominated her twin in size, and the rest of her housemates for that matter, she was becoming lazier by the day.<br>\r\nCasing point; last time she had lured a guy back to the house for an evening of amorous intent, something she didn't struggle with despite her increase in size, she had insisted that he did all the work whilst she mindlessly pigged out on ice cream for both of their pleasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony of wearing sweatpants was completely lost on the eldest twin too as she pulled them clumsily over her love handles, causing her belly to bulge slightly from the mild increase of pressure around her waist, not helped in the slightest by how stretched the grey material was around her arse.<br>\r\nHer ensemble for the day was capped with a strappy vest top tucked into her sweats and a checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves left open at the front, partly for style but mostly out of necessity as the garment was long past buttoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe, although just as ironically dressed in struggling sweats and a quirky t-shirt, certainly gave off more energy than her sister but, in reality, was no more suited for the morning walk than Reagan was.<br>\r\n\"If I'd have known we would be walking so much...\" panted Phoebe with her hands on her sides \"I wouldn't have eaten so much last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan snorted, even if the thought had crossed her mind not moments before.<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, sweetie, baby Phoebe, we both know that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what is that smell?\" interrupted Phoebe, a sudden surge of enthusiasm filling her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sis, would be our destination\" purred Reagan, her own mood lifting with the end in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place Reagan?\" asked Phoebe as she heavily plopped herself into the booth that the two girls had been guided to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the most amazing breakfast place in walking distance of the house Pheebs\" gloated Reagan as she sat opposite her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously\" replied Phoebe, her mind obviously elsewhere as she idly licked her gloss coated lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty great here, Darryl showed it to me ages ago\" smiled Reagan, indulging herself in some fond memories as she explained herself \"and, if you haven't read the signs yet, it's an all you can eat breakfast buffet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" asked Phoebe, double taking with a hefty bodily jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, fill your boots Pheebs, we're in for the long haul!\" grinned Reagan, rising from her seat again and heading straight for the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait for me!\" shouted Phoebe as she hauled her own arse out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacon<br>\r\nSausage<br>\r\nEggs<br>\r\nFrench Toast<br>\r\nBreakfast burritos<br>\r\nHash browns<br>\r\nOatmeal<br>\r\nPastries<br>\r\nMuffins<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything the twins could have dreamed of having for breakfast that morning was available to them and, despite Phoebe's panic of being left behind, they had it in ample quantity.<br>\r\nWith a high piled plate in each hand, the girls waddled back to their booth with hungry gleeful looks adorning their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This all looks so good!\" cooed Phoebe as she eyed up what she had got herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\" grunted Reagan who had already taken it upon herself to dive into the first of her plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok\" giggled Phoebe as she realised the time for talking had now passed, before turning on her own food with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" groaned the junior twin with a hint of arousal as she took her first monstrous bite of breakfast meats sandwiched between pancakes and waffles \"this is so good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the syrup\" suggested Reagan between mouthfuls whilst pointing at the large pitcher in the middle of the table with her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh yes please\" purred Phoebe, setting her cutlery down and grabbing the jug.<br>\r\nWith an almost delicate hint of decorum, Phoebe extended a single finger into the pitcher to dab at the sweet liquid within and, as delicately as she had dipped her finger, licked the substance from said digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmmmm\" groaned Phoebe again as she swiped the receptacle up and poured a great waterfall of syrup over her loaded plate, taking a moment to wipe a run onto her finger and sucking it clean.<br>\r\nBefore she removed her finger from her mouth though, Phoebe took her phone out and, with some mild alterations to her pose, snapped a rather flirtatious photo full of curves and sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh Reagan! Photo time!\" cheered Phoebe, momentarily forgetting her breakfast with the overwhelming urge to take selfies taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh fine\" grunted Reagan as she swallowed a dense mouthful before tossing her hair back and fish hooking an eyebrow in as alluring a manner as she knew how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go\" cheered Phoebe as the twins sat back in their seats after leaning into the table in order to both get into the shot \"and send!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, can we eat now?\" asked Reagan impatiently, already picking up her cutlery in preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" beamed Phoebe, instigating an impressive moment of synchronised feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls attacked their respective loads, Phoebe's phone silently vibrated in her sweats pocket indicating a flood of notifications from her various social media outlets.<br>\r\nHad she not been otherwise preoccupied, the redhead may have taken the time to see just how many complimentary remarks that she and Reagan were receiving for their latest shared selfie, and may have also noticed that a sizeable portion of which were aimed at the girls sizes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nAs the morning slowly trucked by, so did the girls through copious amounts of breakfast foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo plates became four.<br>\r\nFour plates became five with baskets of muffins.<br>\r\nThe long syrup pitcher for the table was soon joined by a second and third as the girls drenched their plates in the stuff.<br>\r\nSooner or later though, things began to slow down before finally after scrapping together the last forkfuls of food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUURP...urp...pard-urrrp...\" belched Reagan with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reagan!\" accused Phoebe whilst trying not to laugh, far from innocent as she silenced her own burps into a clenched fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just making room\" goaded Reagan as she rubbed her belly, burping again in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the Social-verse would definitely like that\" mused Phoebe, phone in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah?\" asked Reagan lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are all over the fact that we've gained weight lately, y'know?\" explained Phoebe as she scrolled through comments on the picture she had posted before the feasting began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they should be!\" announced Reagan \"we are pretty damn sexy these days Pheebs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we always were sexy?\" asked Phoebe, confused as her twins statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we were, but this is like a modern day body positive kind of sexy\" purred Reagan \"not to mention guys are all like closet fat lovers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Phoebe, not convinced even with the internet supporting Reagan's statement.<br>\r\nSeemed a lot of girls were closet fat lovers as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" smirked Reagan, gently slapping the broad bulging side of her belly \"take another picture and you'll see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was almost reluctant but her inner social bee couldn't resist a photo opportunity so, with the help of a passing waitress the girls did a follow up photo for Phoebe's socials.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the notifications to come flooding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See sis? The internet loves a couple of bombshells piling it away, especially when they're as enhanced as we are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe could feel her cheeks go a little warm at Reagan's comments but it did seem that she was talking sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that we have breakfast out of the way, you ready for the next part of our day?\" asked Reagan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't it?\" asked Phoebe, brow furrowing under the thought process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not when you have such a doting audience\" teased Reagan \"besides, I'm totally hungry again nearly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe did start to protest but, as per usual, her stomach did all the talking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'a girl\" teased Reagan again before planting her hands on the booth table \"now lets get out of here before we get tempted by breakfast again\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

just how deeply the cult of personality she had following her on the internet ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe it Pheebs coz it's happening\" responded Reagan, consciously aware that Phoebe's phone was going crazy in her twins pocket even though she couldn't hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so weird\" mused Phoebe to herself as she blindly followed Reagan into Brass Tops, their favourite all-you-can-eat buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope your breakfast has settled because round two is about to begin\" purred Reagan, inhaling the intoxicating smells of juicy meats whilst openly salivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so\" pondered the youngest twin as she autopiloted herself into a seat, still staring at her phone at the torrent of adoration in comment form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets give these people something to talk about\" encouraged Reagan as she hooked onto Phoebe's elbow and dragged her to the establishment's characteristic brass topped counters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take the girls long to expertly pick their way through the restaurants many offerings, loading plates artfully with the most delicious things they could get their hands on.<br>\r\nAs they negotiated the buffet, both girls were getting an array of looks from other customers which were returned either in kind or ignored on the grounds of rudeness.<br>\r\nEither which way, the twins were soaking up any attention they could get, just like their skinny former selves did in any bar or street.<br>\r\nThey were also soaking up calories like they were going out of fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umph, this steak is so good!\" groaned Reagan as she carved great chunks from the plate sized hunk of beef before her, alternating get shovels of mashed potatos as the combinations all melted in her mouth with minimal effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have GOT to try the burgers Reagan\" moaned Phoebe as grease dripped down her chin after each monstrous bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already been there\" retorted Reagan through a mouthful of meat as she reached the bottom of her plate \"refill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe wasn't far behind her twin as she sauntered back to the buffet counter to reload her plate once again.<br>\r\nBoth twins were on their third plates now, which after the breakfast they had shared was quite an impressive feat, but neither girl felt full yet.<br>\r\nWhether it was the thrill of the online attention they were feeding or just a deeply ingrained habit after weeks of eating to their hearts content, Reagan nor Phoebe could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph, my pants are getting tight Reagan\" groaned Phoebe, stretching her waistband as much as she could so as to squeeze her hands down in order to massage her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me t...ooph...too\" puffed Reagan with a half arsed belch \"and let me tell you, doesn't matter how many bus boys get nosebleeds from looking at you, management don't like it when you start exposing things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you...\" started Phoebe, bemused as her head span trying to imagine that scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter\" cut off Reagan \"we just need a solution\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" complained Phoebe as she stubbornly stabbed at her plate of food, not willing to leave any behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan also persisted with her plate, even though she was flagging more than Phoebe at this point.<br>\r\nAs a particularly large burp surfaced on her lips though, the solution came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" Reagan shouted to her twin before fishing her phone from her cleavage and started hammering away at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is nice to see you two getting along so well again\" mused Darryl as he set the car in motion again, leaving Brass Tops to shrink away in his rear view mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\" grunted Reagan as she untucked her vest top and rolled her sweatpants down over her belly, allowing the expanding mass to bulge forward into her lap \"sure you don't mean that it's nice to see THIS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too\" nodded Darryl, unable to hide his smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for picking us up Darryl, you're the best!\" chirped Phoebe from the backseat, her own burgeoning belly hanging from her hips as she lent forward to thank their saviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it\" smiled Darryl, innocently enough \"so you girls nearly ended up infringing Brass Tops pressure 'no nudity of any sort no matter how many bus boys you give nosebleeds' rule huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this bus boy nosebleed thing?\" asked Phoebe, curiosity spiking at the repetition of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never you mind\" barked Reagan at her junior who stifled a giggle.<br>\r\n\"And yes\" she admitted to Darryl who had to bite back a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Reagan, what have I told you about dressing accordingly?\" teased Darryl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we did come from that breakfast place which we hit hard I might add\" sassed Reagan as she playfully fondled her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can see that\" mused Darryl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we didn't get to finish at Brass Tops either coz Reagan's vest top started to split\" moaned Phoebe, hunger flooding her senses now that her belly was free to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that too\" mused Darryl again, sidewards glancing at the small hole that had appeared above Reagan's hip giving a tiny window into the skin-toned bounty beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it pervert\" snapped Reagan, although with far less venom than she would have once intended \"so this does mean you are going to have to feed us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did expect as much, I can hear your hunger in your voice these days\" replied Darryl with all the suave attitude of a crack-pot detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that\" muttered Reagan as she continued to massage her exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Darryl, you are amazing!\" cried Phoebe as she wandered into one of the many living rooms in Darryl's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\" replied Darryl, all too calmly as he watched the two redheads minds explode before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a smart arse and I love you a little bit right now\" muttered Reagan, eyes transfixed on the takeout feast before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do Red, now eat up\" teased Darryl as he sauntered past the girls with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, come back here you\" shouted Reagan, lacing an arm around her sister and grabbing Phoebe's phone from her pocket as she did.<br>\r\nDarryl froze on the spot, slightly concerned he was actually in for it at this point.<br>\r\n\"We need a picture of us and all this\" Reagan followed up as she handed Phoebe's phone to Darryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an open release of breath, Darryl took the phone and snapped the photo of the two girls, linked in a semi embrace at the hip with their exposed bellies pressed gently together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks babes\" teased Reagan with an almost curtsy and sickly sweet voice before dropping herself by the side of the table and tearing open a pizza box like a depraved animal.<br>\r\nNot far behind, Phoebe dove down next to her sister and grabbed two helpings of kebab meat and a bucket of fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, Reagan, how are you still eating?\" groaned Phoebe from her reclined position on the sofa, her breathing shallow as she contended with the heavy mass in her belly from a day full of mindless and near constant gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not\" grunted Reagan \"there's just so many wrappers around its impossible to move without disturbing something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph, good because the thought of you eating is making me feel sick, I'm THAT full right now\" complained Phoebe again as she cradled her belly delicately, trying to limit her grease flavoured burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightwei...\" started Reagan before covering her mouth as her cheeks bulged out as far as they could \"BUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" grunted Phoebe, glancing at her sister who was sat on the floor with her legs spread, allowing her own belly to settle between her thickened thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...not really\" replied Reagan with a laugh brewing as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" asked Phoebe, awkwardly rolling herself over and finding comfort in having her belly rest on the sofa cushions beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...I've NEVER eaten this much before\" smirked Reagan before laughing fully this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe took a moment to think on her own diet as of late before responding.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me neither\" laughed the youngest twin, a string of burps escaping with each note of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give us your phone Pheebs, gotta do that\" announced Reagan, reaching her arm out \"don't want to waste the effort after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe continued to laugh as she passed her phone over to her twin.<br>\r\n\"I've actually had fun today with you Reagan\" admitted the younger twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what sis\" responded Reagan as she held the phone up in preparation \"me too\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You sure you girls didn't want to spend the night again?\" Darryl asked from the driver's seat, watching the two bulbous Durant twins fill up the back seat of his BMW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, all my shits here,\" Reagan said, getting a bit droopy eyed now that the full enormity of what she had eaten with Phoebe settled in her stomach. The past 36 hours, from a big night at Nat's club, a breakfast of bacon and cleaning out two buffets over the course of the day had really packed a wallop. Not only were Reagan and Phoebe's butts mashed together in the car seats, they stomaches formed a point of contention in a non-historical take of the 'Battle of the Bulge.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's been fun meeting you!\" Phoebe said, vivacious as ever but also cradling her great gut. \"But we've got classes tomorrow. And I work with Aud now so I need my things too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourselves,\" Darryl shrugged. His car was no stranger to carrying the weighty hookups he had made as something of a feeder sugar daddy, although it was currently ill suited for the twin sisters. If anything Darryl had never gotten to get a pair of twins to indulge appetites for, Phoebe's unexpected arrival and makeup with Reagan granting the feeder with a fantasy playing out in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twins almost had to be rolled into his car when Darryl rescued them from the buffet, the topping off they had done at his house to add to their already massive binge made extracting them from the car more difficult. Reagan, a patron saint of gluttony at this point, had an overfed belly struggling to digest the mass she had consumed over the last day and a half, with Phoebe as her slightly smaller 'shadow' eating along with her throughout the day. The twins' stomachs were so bloated by this point that, unbelievably, one might say their bellies were as wide was their hips at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir potential indecency at Brass Tops had been delayed to this point. From a distance, Phoebe and Reagan's exposed middles could be mistaken for a strange flesh colored truck tire worn about each waist. Their clothes were fraying out at this point, Reagan's ruined vest and fragmenting sweatpants leaving plenty of flesh to be seen around her waist, overhang, hips and rear. Phoebe's clothes were somewhat less damaged, the hem of her shirt cracked with small tears, but the space between her shrinking t-shirt and sweats left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suspension of Darryl's car creaked with relief once the two mammoth beauties had managed to extract themselves from the BMW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo call Pheobe and Reagan a pair of fatasses was the absolute truth. Once they got moving, the flab located in their backsides stuck out as huge, quivering butt cheeks that swayed and waddled with every breath and movement. Each squashed lobe was a sponge of titanic caloric absorption, and it wouldn't be long before the aftermath of this weekend long binge would be adding further padding to the extra plush tushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl bit his lip as he controlled his libido driven thoughts, pleased as what his part had been in helping enable this transformation in the Durant twins and planning a way to encourage them to let him pull out his measuring tape. But for now he remained as gentlemanly as ever as the deep pocketed fat admiring playboy he was, finding each of the girls on either side of him as he helped them to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for parking out front,\" Phoebe said, \"most folks usually park down at the garage, which adds another flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm,\" Reagan added, getting quite lethargic at this point, needing a rest after demolishing her personal best in food consumption and needing to rest to alleviate pressure, before she inevitably got hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to it,\" Darryl smiled, if finding himself taxed by supporting their respective weights. \"Don't go wasting away now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly likely,\" Reagan said, sniffling a belch as she fished for her house key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Darryl drove off, the twin sisters stumbled themselves into the cool of the townhouse. It was oddly quiet for this time of the evening, with only the drone of a blue screened TV and the overhead fan audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...bitches...\" came a weary voice from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uma?\" Phoebe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you?\" Reagan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra sized ex-athlete groaned as she shifted her bulk on the townhouse two-seater. Unlike the twins she didn't look any larger than the results of their big night at Nat's club, although her state of physical unfitness was apparent as her stretch mark covered belly heaved and even the slightest effort seemed to cause her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, you and that Darryl guy just let me sleep after we crashed at his place, then you are were gone after I woke up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell her about missing the bacon,\" Phoebe whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I had to run all the way back here!\" Uma continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From Darryl's?\" Reagan was taken aback. \"Shit. Why didn't you take a cab?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have my wallet on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Just take some of Darryl's money and pay him back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for still having some scruples, you pair of lardasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Reagan wasn't up to finish the argument, as sleep threatened to take her. \"Where's everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hells if I know,\" Uma said, trying to curl back into a comfortable position in her exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh,\" Phoebe sighed, also growing lethargic, \"I could do with a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could do with crashing,\" Reagan said, visions of her bed approaching her as she took the first step to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo steps in and this was a difficult prospect. Although the queen booty redhead had her hands gripping both railings, the reality of trying to shift her overfilled bulk up a simple flight of steps decided to come down upon her head like a hammer hitting a nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, hurry up Reagan,\" Phoebe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying,\" Reagan hissed, straining muscles that had gone untrained for weeks that now had to contend with her newfound obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go faster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do with a push\" Reagan said, beginning to realize that the strain of walking to the breakfast buffet this morning was small potatoes compared to the effort of traveling to the second floor. And Reagan had nearly eaten her body weight in small potatoes in the form of hash browns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, where do I push?\" Phoebe asked. Currently, her view was filled with nothing but Reagan's ass that had eclipsed her own. Although a bit more energetic than her sister as of late that was akin to saying a fat seal moved faster on land than a walrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just anywhere, come on Phoebe, we practically have the same bodies--YAH!!\" Phoebe caught her off guard by thrusting both hands into the doughy composition of her monstrous booty, nails first. \"Easy! Easy! Watch the goods!\" The probe drummed up a less than flattering sensation. \"Knew I should have gone before we left Darryl's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe pouted. \"Reagan, I can't fit your fat ass in my hands and it's too hard to push!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor anyone wondering, Reagan had managed to travel up to four steps at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put your back into it! I don't know.\" Reagan had a sudden thought. \"Turn around and push me up bum to bum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our only option.\" Reagan continued to strain her arms in helping her climb each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma, still sore, turned herself to snicker at the comical sight the twins had made for themselves. With the combined cushion of the mega-sized booties distancing them, Phobe struggled to hoist herself up the stairs backwards to support Reagan who was starting to lean back to relieve pressure from her middle. Both were so overstuffed that what should have been a simple climb became a herculean effort, with plenty of creaks, groans, popping of seams and swears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Reagan huffed, \"Twelve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gawd,\" Phoebe cried, \"keep moving! Make space for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two jumbo twins crowded the landing. Reagan regarded the remaining climb. \"Hell, I need to rest before trying any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was hard,\" Phoebe said, neither twin willing to admit how they had led themselves into these circumstances. \"I'm so sweaty and stinky from that, I really need that shower.\" She clambered into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Reagan roused herself from where she was leaning on the bannister, \"I call first dibs. I need the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm already inside,\" Phoebe said. \"Go upstairs or downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Phebes,\" her twin cried. \"Just let me go here and then I'll be out of your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with both twins trying to cross the threshold of the bathroom at the same time, in opposite directions, that became the biggest mistake of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooff!\" came twined cries of pain, and a hard crack in the wooden door frame. As both twins had done most of their respective gains apart until today, it had been some time before they had encountered the unpleasant consequences of both of their bottom heavy hips approaching a ridiculous circumference. The last time the twins had ever gotten caught in something was back at summer camp many years and a hundred and more-so pounds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir sweat had been just enough lubricant to have their flesh attempt to slide past each other, but now both of their meaty thighs and butts where trying to cram into the same space, a physical impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Phoebe cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Reagan said, worriedly. \"Push!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom each side of the doorframe, each twin scrambled to find some sort of purchase. There were few options with each twin only having a scrap of wall and the squashed ass cheeks of the other as respective handholds to contend with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't move!\" Phoebe said. \"I'm stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck it,\" Reagan sighed, having to swallow her pride along with the effects of her binge. \"Can somebody help us? Please??\"</span></div></div>",

like she had done at Nat's club.<br>\r\nTruthfully, she had probably NEVER cut loose like that before, not even in her wildest of college days but the night in Nat's club just seemed to unlock a beast inside.<br>\r\nFood...drink...Nat<br>\r\nAudrey had had a wild night indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12 HOURS EARLIER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey did not have a clue where she was.<br>\r\nTangled in a mass of bed sheets with hair plastered across her face, Audrey was a state and she felt it.<br>\r\nAching in her bones whilst her head pounded like a sledgehammer, she was out of control and that didn't sit well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uma?\" she feebly cried out in the hopes she wasn't completely alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe?\" just as feeble and with far less hope, the youngest twin's name came tumbling from Audrey's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reagan?...\"<br>\r\nAudrey really was getting desperate if she was hoping Reagan would come to her rescue.<br>\r\nMore the point and unbeknownst to Audrey, three girls she had hoped to find were at Darryl's with the twins demolishing their hosts breakfast feast at that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment but the sound of footsteps approaching came into Audrey's head, hopefully in the real world although the blonde couldn't tell at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" called out Audrey again, hoping the mystery footsteps would announce themselves soon and, at the very least, be gentle about it.<br>\r\n'God my head hurts' thought Audrey with quite the internal groan.<br>\r\n\"Hel...argh!\" cried Audrey as light suddenly poured into her eyes and fresh air enrobed her shoulders serving as a major shock to her delicate system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning sleepy head!\" called out a familiar voice, the feeling of the soft mattress indenting and tipping Audrey slightly sideways with the force.<br>\r\nAudrey scoured her memory for who the voice belonged to and, futilely, attempted to remember who she had been with last night.<br>\r\nIt took a moment, delayed even more so with the smell of bacon filling her nostrils, but finally the pieces fell into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat?\" groaned Audrey as she rolled back into the mountain of pillows and covered her eyes with her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, course its me!\" smirked Nat as she shuffled a little further onto the bed, into the space created by Audrey moving \"you don't go home with many girls surely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde could only shake her head in denial as her head continued to throb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, I should think not too, it's not very becoming of a lady like you\" teased Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" asked Audrey weakly, still shielding her eyes from the faint light coming from between the drapes opposite the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less of that, drink this first\" offered Nat, nudging a cold glass against Audrey's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" grunted Audrey, unwilling to uncover her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me\" insisted Nat, peeling Audrey's arm away from her face and pushing the glass into her open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what actually happened last night?\" asked Audrey, almost miraculously more alive as she delicately placed pieces of bacon and fried bread into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you would not believe Aud, I have NEVER seen you party like that\" laughed Nat having gotten into the bed next to Audrey with a thin dressing gown wrapped around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" moaned Audrey as she took a deep drink from the banana milkshake Nat had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milkshake good?\" asked Nat, ever the attentive host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm\" Audrey nodded as she savoured the thick creamy liquid in her mouth before swallowing \"much better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" purred Nat as she looked over her friend enjoying her breakfast \"Let me know if you want a top up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded again as she continued to eat.<br>\r\n\"Are the others here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, they left before we did\" answered Nat \"think Reagan said they were going to some guy's, Darryl's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey didn't know the name but motherly instincts were beginning to bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they're fine, the three of them did leave together\" reassured Nat with a gentle hand on Audrey's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should still check though\" muttered Audrey, shoving the empty breakfast plate away and sliding out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Audrey, they're adults, just relax!\" insisted Nat, crawling to the foot of the bed, watching as Audrey clumsily dumped her clothes on the bed to avoid excessive bending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum brain was running faster than light at this point as Audrey fished out her skirt from the night before and stepped into it.<br>\r\n\"I can't Nat, you know how I stress and if the twins are...hnnngh...come on...if the twins...uuumph...why won't my skirt close Nat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...\"<br>\r\nNat attempted to look innocently away but the grin on her face was impossible to hide.<br>\r\nNot that it mattered when Audrey inevitably looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" screeched the blonde as she looked down her front where her hands were futiley attempting to pull the button of her skirt together, instead only pushing a bulging mass of pale belly between the unreaching flaps.<br>\r\n\"How much did I eat last night?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat could only laugh as she watched the scene play out.<br>\r\nHaving watched/helped Audrey get undressed earlier that morning when they had got in she had suspected the skirt would be problematic.<br>\r\nOnly in her wildest dreams though would it have been THAT problematic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, you really did go to town last night\" teased Nat with a bitten lip as she watched Audrey attempt to close her skirt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I going to get home now when I can't get dressed!\" asked Audrey, trying not to lose her mind too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out Aud, it's fine\" supported Nat \"it's really not that bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that bad?! In one single night I am unable to fit in an item of clothing, I should have known this would happen if I came out with you, you always...\"<br>\r\nAudrey was getting hysterical now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't put any food in your mouth last night\" returned Nat, almost a little hurt \"I don't do that anymore, not since college\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come off it, you've been feeding Phoebe for months\" complained Audrey, giving up on the skirt at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've supplied her with food\" corrected Nat \"and I've never done it when she's not wanted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I don't do this\" moaned Audrey, dropping herself on the bed with her belly in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat found herself a little lost in how best to support her friend.<br>\r\nIt was impossible to deny that Audrey not being able to fit into her skirt was quite the turn on to Nat but at the same time she wasn't going to prey on her like that when she clearly wasn't happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we can sort something out, I can buy you some new clothes and get you a cab home, it'll be fine\" said Nat, taking control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\" mused Audrey, more in her own head than the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And likewise, if you want to stay here for a bit you can do\" offered Nat, putting an arm around Audrey as she spoke \"it's entirely up to you and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a movement far too swift for a hungover person with the idea of a very drunk person behind it, Audrey slid down Nat's tattooed arm and locked lips with her.<br>\r\nDespite enjoying the moment though, Nat had to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, hold up Audrey, what's going on here?\" asked Nat as she held her friend at arms length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, erm...I don't know\" mumbled Audrey, holding an outstretched palm against her forehead \"I'm just...going with it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but this is kinda...\" started Nat before Audrey stuck a finger against her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to feed me or not?\" asked Audrey almost huskily with a hungry lust in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but...\" replied Nat as her confidence began to falter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then go with it\" purred Audrey as she clumsily clambered onto all fours and kissed Nat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had taken...quite the turn for Audrey and Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long and short of it had been a lot of raucous behaviour that Reagan would have applauded, a near constant torrent of food that Phoebe would have applauded and, now that things had settled down again, a moment of reflection that Audrey and Nat were internally applauding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So help me out here Aud\" started Nat, her dressing gown sliding from her shoulders with a handful of cake about to be delivered into her mouth \"where the HELL has that come from today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey pondered for a moment, mostly to swallow her own mouthful of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, I don't know...it just felt right\" contemplated Audrey, hunkering into the blanket that Nat had provided for her decency as the pair cozied up on the sofa in Nat's living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" pondered Nat, not entirely satisfied with that response \"So where does that leave us after today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had to think hard on this one, more opportunity for cake at least.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure just yet\" answered the blonde honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls watched the TV quietly, Audrey's phone pinged beside her.<br>\r\nSwiping her phone up and opening the message from Uma, she snorted most ungracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Nat attempting to peer at the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey read the message:<br>\r\n'I'm pissed as hell with you...but that doesn't mean you should miss this...'<br>\r\nBelow was a picture of Phoebe and Reagan stuck in what seemed to be the first floor bathroom door.<br>\r\nSeeing it for the first time, Nat burst out laughing whilst Audrey smirked broadly as she replied to Uma.<br>\r\n'Looks like they've had fun, see you soon xxx'</span></div></div>",

More like lovers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Audrey tried to make sense of her feelings. \"I really like you, Nat, I don't know why I set aside those feelings for so long, but I've never thought of it as love. I mean, being in love with a woman. Not that I wouldn't love you, but, I've never thought myself--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was shushed by Nat pressing a finger to her lips. \"I get it, Audrey. I've always been the most forward since college. You never struck me as one who was into gals, although I admit that added to my attraction. But I don't want you to make the next step until you're able to decide for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Nat. I mean, whoo, I guess there was something freeing about being at your club last night. It's been awfully busy at work, and the girls have gotten the whole house turned on each other with one of their spats, I've been under so much stress lately. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, I don't know if I can go steady with you until I sort out several other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Go steady'?\" Nat chuckled, \"we're not in high school, Aud. But I'll be here for you when you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's been great,\" Audrey smiled. \"Minus me freaking out. I shouldn't toy with your emotions either until I'm sure I can be committed. It's been fun hanging out with you again, Nat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still have fun and keep things platonic,\" Nat blushed. \"Or if you'd prefer, sporadically intimate. I've got the manager's booth at my club for may favorite, most special customer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving plunged down the smorgasbord of Nat's fine cooking in the last 24 hours, Audrey couldn't help but lick her lips at the prospects. \"Oh, I'm always going to enjoy your food. Clearly, too much to the point of overindulgence.\" Audrey gripped the meaty fold of her overfeed stomach, still trying to digest the cake from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, right,\" Nat said, becoming pragmatic even before Audrey did, as the aftermath of their soul-searching brought its own issues. The elephant in the room being Audrey's elephantine stomach. \"I can't have you going home half naked. And that skirt is shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Nat got up to her closet, turning on the light and searching through her clothes. \"Let me see if I have anything that will fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presented Audrey with several clothing options. \"A loaner to get home with, the least I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Nat. Do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, oh wait, sure, let me give you some privacy.\" As much as her own libido shot up at Audrey's predicament, she had promised to take things slow with her for now. As she stepped out to freshen up, Audrey got down to looking at what options she had to make herself decent to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had to laugh in how she and Nat had very different styles. Audrey's style was simple, plain and conservative in some circles, with even her discarded party clothes not being too flashy (although Phoebe had said her butt would look amazing) while Nat had a lot more color and personality. The assortment that she had to try on was rich with textures and different kinds of fabric Audrey wouldn't have ever thought of wearing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went without saying that both Audrey and Natalie were fat women. And while Audrey was initially hopeful that she could find something of her size in Nat's wardrobe, their physiques were quite different. Audrey, ever big-boned as the tallest sister of the family, had a long torso and weighty apple-shaped belly to Nat's ruebenesque, thigh heavy weight. Enough differences to the point that as Audrey tried on some of Nat's clothes to borrow, one of two issues would crop up. It didn't help that Audrey should have called it quits after realizing how much she had demolished her diet after last night at the club, but her hunger had led her to being stuffed anew with cake and goodies shared with Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stubborn mass digesting in her belly proved too taxing to the stretch of some garments, while those that were loosest about the stomach weren't quite long enough for Audrey's frame, leaving more skin showing than she cared to reveal. It would be a different story if she could find some skirt or pants suitable to pair with a shorter shirt. Unfortunately, Nat had something of a pinched under-bust where she wore her skirts high, a metric too taxed by Audrey's overfed belly. And all the give in the rear from Nat's more broad hips couldn't make fastening the clothing up front any less awkward as Audrey struggled over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Nat?\" Audrey called out. \"Can you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat opened the door a creak. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for offering, but I don't think I can fit in any of your clothes,\" Audrey admitted, growing beet red yet also excited. \"Unless I try your maxi dress here that leaves me far too, um, inadequately covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey patted her side, making her belly jiggle. \"Your food is just too good, if only I had managed to watch my appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tease,\" Nat retorted, smirking, as Audrey blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, big girl,\" Nat said, \"let me see what size you were. I'll go out and get something that should fit, make yourself at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Nat,\" Audrey said sheepishly, keeping herself half dressed in the outgrown remains of her previous outfit. As Nat left it gave Audrey a chance to take in the layout of Nat's high end apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe club manager lived in a more upscale part of the city, in a designer flat comfortable for two people. It definitely didn't have the room for five like Audrey's roommates, even before their respective weight gains. Nat had offered her the TV but Audrey didn't have any shows she wanted to watch and was more curious than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat didn't keep pictures on the walls but there was a bookshelf over in her living space. Books with large binders. Audrey picked one and saw that it was filled with architectural markups and interior swatches, design work as Nat had built her club. The next book went into operations, although it gave way to recipes she used at the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the books were cookbooks. Making Audrey all the more interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey?\" Nat knocked at the door. \"You still decent in there? I got you something to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Nat had arrived after an impromptu shopping spree at +Size. She unlocked the door to a chorus of Audrey's giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh,\" Audrey said as Nat entered, \"I can't believe you've still got all these old college notebooks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, some of my best recipes are from that era,\" Nat said, oddly defensive for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've got all your school notes in here too. Your scathing remarks about the other people in our dorm and all that bad poetry you wrote!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat cringed. \"Ok, so I wasn't suited for my first major in college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>All the world a despicable shore--</i>\" Audrey began to read, before having a shopping bag flung towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, can it and see if this fits you,\" Nat objected to further airing out of her bad poetry as Audrey went to get changed. She shook her head filing her old books back in order as her blonde friend got changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you manage to find something in the same style?\" Audrey asked a few minutes later, pleased to be wearing a better fitting skirt. She couldn't hide her stomach at this point but it was covered and the waist wasn't too snug. It had retained her club look from the previous night, albeit at larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should start shopping at +Size, they cater to gals with our physiques.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to pay you back for this,\" Audrey said as they prepared to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come off it,\" Nat said, \"it's a gift, you've given me enough business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take advantage of your generosity,\" Audrey began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the gift, blondie, I mean it,\" Nat teased, before she found herself on the receiving end of a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks for everything Nat,\" Audrey said, \"I'm so glad we're friends again. I'm sorry for what friction came between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool, Audrey. Whatdaya say we have our own lives, but leave time for each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" Audrey said, having a more chipper outlook on life. Although her budding adventurous side brought up one last coy comment. \"You know, if you keep feeding me like this these clothes aren't going to last much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll always be there for a friend,\" Nat said, grabbing her keys as they prepared to leave. \"Especially for a friend with extra special benefits.\"</span></div></div>",

It suited her that her housemates didn\u2019t ask after her - they usually didn\u2019t mean it after all - but she certainly couldn\u2019t complain at the extra food in the house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>grumble</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh god...\u201d groaned Reagan from within the tangle of bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>grooowl</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d grunted Reagan a little louder to her complaining belly as it\u2019s cries of hunger roused her from her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith begrudging acceptance and a chorus from her creaking bed frame, Reagan heaved herself out of bed, grabbed a T-shirt whilst crossing her room and opened the door closing her off from the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment NOW to pull her shirt on over her otherwise underwear clad body, the redhead waddled towards the bathroom with phone in hand, beginning the morning rituals she had adopted from Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs wonderful as the attention was that the older twin garnered from piggy backing her sisters\u2019 profiles, Reagan was far too much of a self indulgent individual to not strike out on her own.<br>\r\nThe process had taken best part of an afternoon and a great deal of help from Phoebe, but Reagan had managed to tweak her social profiles to accommodate her current lifestyle and the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSituated in front of the bathroom mirror, Reagan posed with a slight kink in her body alignment, a delicately chewed lip and a set of fingers splayed over the exposed belly hang rolling out from under her shirt.<br>\r\nGiving her belly a slight pinch causing pale fat to bulge slightly through her fingers making the picture all the more alluring for her avid fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with her morning show piece, Reagan threw her hair back and let herself back out of the bathroom.<br>\r\nA small glimmer of memory flashed into her mind of the night her and Phoebe had got trapped in that very door frame, but it passed nearly as quickly as it came. The arrival of another resident helped to push the embarrassment from the twin\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch where you\u2019re going!\u201d Reagan quietly barked, more interested in the torrent of likes her latest offering was already bringing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh pfft\u201d grunted Uma as she stomped into the bathroom, her distinctive spherical belly wobbling ahead of her engorged frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to herself as Uma passed her, looking quite the sight with her pregnant looking belly leading her way atop black pillars of fattened thighs.<br>\r\nRiddled in stretch marks, Uma was a ballooned shadow of herself even if she was small fry next to Reagan still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk still painted on her lips, Reagan made her way downstairs only to hear her name being called from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReagan, sweetie, could you...help me out...please?\u201d came the soft words of Audrey at the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno Aud, kinda on my way for some breakfast y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be long, just...ungh...please?\u201d groaned Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine, what is it?\u201d complained Reagan as she clumsily turned around on the stairs, only to be met with her second sight of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs with her hands on her hips, Audrey stood giving quite the display of plump midriff squeezing over the band of her high waisted jeggings which, needless to say, were not around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, they didn\u2019t even make her hips as the hem of her panties betrayed and the exertion of attempting to get the leg wear high enough had left the blonde matriarch flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I borrow some jeans or something? I\u2019m heading out soon and nothing of mine fits\u201d moaned Audrey, still with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t Ixchel be a better ask, she\u2019s more your figure right?\u201d probed Reagan, trying to ignore her constant stomach rumblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah but I\u2019ve already tried, turns out I\u2019m bigger than her now\u201d confessed Audrey with a hint of shame mixed with what Reagan could only think to be...arousal?<br>\r\nWhat was going on with Audrey lately anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Audrey\u2019s starting to get a real mum bod now\u201d teased Reagan as she laboriously began to climb the stairs again, one great wobbling thigh rolling past the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up\u201d grumbled Audrey in return \u201ccan I borrow something or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, my stuff is a bit skimpy for you\u201d Reagan continued to tease whilst struggling to catch her breath as she drew level with her oldest sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have sweats\u201d pleaded Audrey as her own stomach began to purr from hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do\u201d sighed Reagan with a grin as she waddled towards her room, nudging the door open with a great curving hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they\u2019re not too tight\u201d admitted Audrey with a gentle puff through her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope\u201d agreed Reagan, working her way around a large block of chocolate she had discovered in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda the other way now though\u201d mused Audrey as she let go of the grey material around her hips and watched as rolled back down past her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they\u2019re the smallest I have nowadays and, honestly, I haven\u2019t worn those bitches in a while\u201d contemplated Reagan as the last of her chocolate disappeared between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks for trying\u201d smiled Audrey as she stepped out of the leg wear \u201cyou want these back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah you keep em, something to grow in to\u201d winked Reagan as she passed her sister and began to descend the stairs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment caught Audrey off guard but, after a moment of thought, the prospect did seem...amusing to say the least.<br>\r\nIt\u2019d certainly drive Nat mad anyway thought the blonde as she made a mental note to take them with her when she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Finally, I can get some breakfast\u2019 Reagan told herself as she hit the ground floor, her body jiggling from the impact as she lazily paced towards the townhouse kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going to plan as the redhead began to silently salivate at the prospect of her first gorge of the day only to be disturbed by the sound of the tv quietly playing away and frequent and feverish rustling of papers and boxes coming from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho on earth could that be?\u201d muttered Reagan as she halted her progress and turned tail again, following the sounds back towards the living room.<br>\r\nA warm feeling bubbled inside Reagan as she felt her arse wobble violently behind her, the fabric of her panties being chewed on by the great curves of blubber behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her erotic thoughts, Reagan only found herself brought back to reality as the sound of someone speaking to her cut through her thought process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey Reagan, didn\u2019t know you were up\u201d purred Phoebe with a wide grin and cheeks full of greasy breakfast burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, ain\u2019t been up long\u201d replied Reagan as she eyed up Phoebe lounging on the sofa surrounded by a great deal of debris from food already inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe only smiled through her mouthful as she carried on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny for me?\u201d asked Reagan, licking her lips a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm...not <i>really</i>\u201d replied Phoebe, swallowing hard \u201con a bit of a challenge from the fans\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair play\u201d muttered Reagan as she pulled out her phone and began to concoct her own order having been inspired by her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey if you hurry our orders might come together\u201d piped up Phoebe, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gone twice?\u201d asked Reagan, eyes flitting up from her phone through curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, SOO hungry this morning\u201d purred Phoebe before unexpectedly bringing herself to her feet after inhaling the last greasy bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple act of standing up drew Reagan\u2019s attention more than anything had that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough visibly bloated from the extensive breakfast binge, it was clear that Phoebe had grown outwards since the twins altercation with the door.<br>\r\nHer belly hung heavily under its own great weight as the redhead gently kneaded her fattened side, quaking ripples rolling through the two tiers of fat at her touch.<br>\r\nHer chest was swelling against restrictive cups which were biting into the plump flesh within with each breath.<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Phoebe\u2019s arse was the embodiment of her gluttony, swelling outwards with more and more empty calories by the day with heavy love handles chasing her hips outwards an inch at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe\u2019s arms were flabby, her chin swaddled with a second and her cheeks were plump and rosey.<br>\r\nHer bottom half was dappled in cellulite and even her feet had a chubby quality to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly though, she was fatter than Reagan in every way which was an impressive feat given the senior twin\u2019s bulk.<br>\r\nBut how?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking in the sight of how her younger twin had bcom even fatter, all Reagan could do was mouth \u201cHoly shit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of Phoebe\u2019s quaking steps caused her ginormous ass to wobble and bounce, threatening to pop out of her tight pyjama bottoms as she reached for the second of her four breakfast orders that morning. Although Phoebe had more chipper energy than Reagan, the younger twin moved just as slowly and laboriously as the pair grew to titanic sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when Reagan was driven by jealously over the whole ass expansion of their respective gains, she had channeled that hate and sibling rivalry into continuously stuffing herself, an effort that required plenty of willpower. Only by alternating nights with Nat and Darryl enabling her allowed Reagan to keep up with the massive nutritional requirements to gain those pounds. Since making peace with Phoebe, Reagan was content with her massive appetite and thousands of followers interested in the size of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, much like this morning, Reagan felt most of her efforts now extended to keeping herself fed. Having taken such extreme efforts to match her sister for expanding size, Reagan was familiar with just how many extra calories were needed to add an inch, even if the twins\u2019 signature assets soaked up calories like sponges. As Reagan stomped into the kitchenette looking for food while her own breakfast burrito order was processed, she regarded what had become the new normal for her. Much as she enjoyed eating and the attention it garnered, it was beginning to feel like a chore. Moving was becoming difficult and the incident that had caused both her and Phoebe to get stuck in the bathroom door had scared the older twin somewhat, although she wouldn\u2019t admit it. What if she got stuck in a tight spot with another housemate? Or worse, grew so bootylicious that she couldn't fit in anything? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than see it as becoming a slave to her appetite, Reagan had accepted that she was huge and this was about as fat as she wanted to be before it got uncomfortable. Her gaining had slowed down considerably, compared to her climb over the last several months, as she neared her plateau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet Phoebe was surging ahead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puzzle occupied the oddly self-reflective Reagan as she joined her twin in the last wave of their breakfast binge, each having ordered another dozen burritos apiece. Hunger satiated temporarily, Reagan regarded how the bubbly Phoebe managed to chow down all the more excitedly as she completed the challenge set by her fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, Phebes, how do you have that much energy?\u201d Reagan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d replied the oblivious redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, for getting fatter,\u201d Reagan said, thinking back on the number of food comas she had eaten herself into and the booths she had gotten stuck in as the twins grew out of their 200s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I? Phoebe asked blithely. The more gregarious twin took to the dramatic shift in their collective lifestyle much differently from Reagan. Her blend of perkiness, friendliness, and cluelessness had never approached the weight gain from dubious objectives like Reagan had. Indeed, it could be said that outside of her initial gain from comfort eating to get over getting dropped from her acting gig had switched to resonating, however subconsciously, that getting fat had led to further popularity, comfort, and overall better times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was taken aback. Gawd, Phoebe couldn\u2019t be that thick about how thick they were getting. \u201cNot that I care, but don\u2019t all those jackasses and staffers at college look at you with scorn and snide marks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe paused her post-digestion belly rub. \u201cNot really. After working with Audrey I graduated early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what??\u201d Reagan couldn\u2019t believe that. For the longest time, the only A\u2019s Phoebe had ever accumulated were bra sizes. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding! Wait, did you actually get a diploma?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained that then. \u201cSo what you meant to say, sis, is that you dropped out for a lucrative paralegalling career.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that lucrative,\u201d Phoebe said, picking morsels out of her teeth. \u201cI get more money modeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought Reagan some pause. \u201cWhat modeling? You haven\u2019t modeled since, well\u2026\u201d Reagan recalled that day, what felt like half a lifetime ago, when she had begrudgingly consoled Phoebe during her ice cream binge after the younger Durant twin had split her pants during her acting gig, as the booty gaining war had started in that aftermath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe lit up. \u201cIt\u2019s been great, Reagan, I\u2019ve gotten paid for being in front of the camera again ever since one of my followers messaged me about it.\u201d She fished out her phone from under a flabby roll and after a few taps showed her twin the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is gormandize?\u201d Reagan asked, struggling to read the cursive font on a black-backed website at the awkward angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Phoebe corrected, \u201cI got this wrong all the time too. It\u2019s \u2018Gormand-Size.\u2019 It\u2019s a site that celebrates big beauties like us, and one of the studios is local.\u201d The younger twin had a dreamy, somewhat vacant look to her eyes as she described it. \u201cAnd Marcello makes the best flan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Reagan asked, trying to search for the site on her own phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe studio prop master and chef,\u201d Phoebe replied happily, licking her lips. \u201cThey let me eat during the shoots, and last week I got a trough of flan to myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the dumb things Reagan had heard her twin say throughout the years, that was one of the weirdest. She was starting to put the pieces together about what sort of modelling Phoebe had gotten herself into. The age restricted access to \u2018Gormand-Size\u2019 was the final piece to the puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as Reagan didn\u2019t care what sort of nonsense Phoebe got herself into, she was a big enough...err, old enough girl to take responsibility for herself for a change, the whole prospect sounded as sketchy as hell. And this was coming from the townhouse resident with the most active, promiscuous sex life, although Reagan never stuck around with the same conquests for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebe, sis, this is a skeevy sounding site. Like a porn site.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe shook her head. \u201cNo! Well, no, I haven't agreed to model nude yet. They lend me fashionable outfits. And the food is so good~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, neither of the twins were the definition of \u2018fully clothed\u2019 as each flabby roll of fat bulged out from the hems of their overtaxed lounge wear. They were showing more skin than they ever had during their scantily dressed skinny days. It\u2019s not like Phoebe or Reagan being nude would reveal anything new about their zaftig sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear what you're...\" Reagan's comments fell flat, recognizing this kind of behavior from her twin. \"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was all grins as she hefted herself from her seat for the third time that morning, her cascade of fat drooping to gravity as it was no longer supported by the over-burdened couch. A return to modeling, pampered living and an all encompassing access to food? No wonder Phoebe was continuing to pork up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I heard about a new pizza joint that opened up right near the studio, wanna head there for lunch Reagan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older twin felt her bulk press down into her well-worn cushion groove. \"Sure, just give me a chance to nap this off,\" she replied, feeling ever-more lethargic as she struggled to digest a massive breakfast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Phoebe, I got the last of those cameras set up.\" From the steps down into the living room from the second floor Ixchel appeared. Blinking from her drowsiness, Reagan looked at her cousin with fresh eyes. The Mexican/Korean housemate was by far the smallest resident but that did not make her immune from the collective weight gain shared by the young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a dual strain of doughy, rounded phenotypes in her genetics, Ixchel had plumped up more than a moderate amount. Some brown skin was visible in the wayward gap that appeared between her printed shirt and long skirt as she paused on the steps to sort out some cables and an old modem in her hands. Pudgier than ever, Ixchel had let her hair grow long as the dark strands draped over rounded shoulders and engorged breasts. Given how they flopped within the stretchy confines of her shirt, she was out of fitting bras as she was catching up to the twins and Audrey for breast size. These sat atop a fattened stomach, not as protruding as Uma or Audrey, mind, but giving Ixchel a shape like a stuffed sausage as her thickened thighs and calves could be visible putting the fabric of her skirt through its paces as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down heavily in the remaining chair, Ixchel took her glasses off for a polish, unaware of how much of her belly was now uncovered from the impact. \"I had to jury-rig a second router in your room but I think that will give us the coverage we need for your streams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks Chel!\" Phoebe began to lean her bulk over towards her cousin's seat, before finding the distance too far for a hug and settling for air kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cameras?\" Reagan asked. \"Is this about Phoebe's weird modeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel nodded simply, all business. \"Just don't go unplugging anything next to your alarm clock,\" she warned, having been burned too often by Phoebe making hazards with the townhouse's internet in the past. \"Plus, you'll probably want to tidy up before you start filming in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Phoebe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're okay with this?\" Reagan questioned Ixchel before realizing what she said. Shit, she was beginning to sound like Audrey. Sure, Chel had her gaming streams and stuff but she worked for that medical tech company. Right? And she was the last holdout for eating healthily after Audrey had fully given into her repressed appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ryan said she was a great find!\" Phoebe explained, which still didn't explain anything to Reagan at all. \"The studio is more of a start-up so people with both web and video experience are needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say it's been more interesting than any projects I've had with work lately,\" Ixchel said, putting on her glasses. \"Pays better, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Reagan jeered. \"Company thinks you're too fat for making those fitness lifestyle apps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel huffed, tugging at the hem of her shirt. \"You're one to talk, Reagan, we should be thanking both you and Phoebe for dragging us all down this path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it, bitch,\" Reagan said with a chuckle, pleased with keeping her place in the packing order of the house's hierarchy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! Chel! You want to join Reagan and me for lunch at that new pizza place?\" Phoebe asked. \"I hear there's an early-bird special!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could go for two or five slices,\" Ixchel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, girl,\" Reagan groaned, \"give me a chance to make some room.\" She kneaded her broad stomach, still stuffed with the eclectic mix of pop-tarts, instant waffles, and breakfast burrito takeout she had eaten to quiet her morning stomach growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Ixchel said coyly. \"I did acquire that last piece of equipment if we want to start another one of your field assignments, Phebes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Reagan sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel set up a new piece of equipment. \"A new megapixel high resolution body cam. I'll also bring the tripod if we have the space for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh,\" Phoebe stage whispered. \"Wouldn't that be a super-naughty thing to do?\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Ixchel replied, rather forward for the reclusive nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what are the two of you on about now?\" Reagan said, beginning to regret agreeing to this lunch date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just another challenge, Reagan!\" Phoebe said, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal's Zone was the horribly pun-titled new pizza joint across town as the three cousins made their way to lunch at 1:30, with many complaints from the twins about the car getting small. Inside a renovated old city brick interior, the pizza shop looked promising if sparsely filled, customers having lulled after the soft opening. After managing to waddle their way inside, the twins knew from an instant that the short booths up front would be inadequate for girls of their heft. Ixchel suggested they take one of the tables in the back where there was the most privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women needed a six-seater table on account of Reagan and Phoebe needing two chairs apiece to prop up their massive posteriors. Much to Reagan's chagrin Ixchel sat next to her while Phoebe got one side of the table to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Ixchel said after orders were taken. \"I don't think they know about the body cam. And the angle looks good.\" She had mirrored the camera feed to her phone. \"Now, Phoebe, tell your viewers about what you're going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys,\" Phoebe launched into a signature perky, saccharine tone of voice. \"This Cal Zone's place is amazing, the smell of good pizza is everywhere. And their double extra-large deal is FREE! if you finish it in the shop.\" Phoebe jiggled her flabby upper belly. \"Which I don't know if I'm going to be able to finish, you instagram followers already know I went for the Gross Grande Burrito challenge this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross!\" Reagan said under her breath, not using the definition of 'a count of 12 dozen' that Phoebe had used to describe her burrito challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel shushed her. \"Quiet, or I'm going to need a lot more edits on the video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid!\" Reagan said, who was used to lunches only with her twin where they could  eat, talk, eat, catch the reactions from onlookers, and eat in relative peace. It was nothing against her cousin, Reagan was off put by the small, empty pizza joint as she wasn't as impressed as Phoebe had been upon arrival. And now her younger twin was bringing her bizarre BBW camgirl/modeling thing into lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush,\" Ixchel said. \"Think of it this way, if this pays out for Phoebe and me we could chip in for a larger vehicle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Reagan said sourly. From an outsider's perspective this was a new low for Phoebe's continual gullibility. Reagan was fine with being the center of attention, even moreso as she had jumped on the fat booty snapchat bandwagon with Phoebe. She knew she was still as hot as hell at her present enormity without degrading herself with eating challenges from strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And cousin Chel is here on camera,\" Phoebe waved with a stage whisper. \"And we're all going to have lunch with my twin Reagan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare film my bad side,\" Reagan warned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That'll make for a good intro,\" Ixchel said, focused on keeping the body cam at a good angle and other quick adjustments to her phone based recording setup. \"Here, I'll get us drinks while we're waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as Reagan grumbled about the proceedings, she appreciated that Ixchel waited on the pair of them as their pizza orders were cooking. She could sip her giant cherry Pepsi to drown out the cutesy talk Phoebe was blabbering on about to her fans. As Phoebe was trying to save room, Reagan had a basket of cheesy garlic bread all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here you girls go,\" a lanky waitress said minutes later as she set down a tray with several pizza orders. If she hadn't figured out they were filming Phoebe's eating challenge, she definitely didn't think highly of the amount of food the trio of lardasses was ordering. It was making for interesting gossip back in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunts and shuffling of seats were needed as the fold-outs of the table were needed to fit everyone's pizzas. Both Reagan and Phoebe had ordered the extra larges, a pizza size normally meant to feed 5-6 people. And the younger, vivacious redhead had two of them as per the 'Double Extra-Large' promo. Ixchel had order a chunky sized calzone and had been supplementing her trips to refill the twins' drinks with plates from the salad bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG-ness, you guys,\" Phoebe continued as Ixchel resumed filming, in awe at the two steaming, freshly made pizzas laid out before her at the end of the table. And yes, that was said as a three-letter acronym with added hyphened syllable. \"I asked the cute guy at the register what the best pizzas on the menu were, and that's these. This is the Spinach Alfredo Chicken Parmesan and this is the BBQ Hawaiian with Tomato.\" Each was a sea of crust, toppings, and bubbling cheeses; the creamy white, green, and tan of the former with the burnt ruddy-browns, pinks and red of the latter with scattering amounts of yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Chel's got an impressive calzone, show them Chel.\" At Phoebe's beckoning, Ixchel careful lifted her plate at a tilt so her calzone was briefly in the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what'd you order again, sis?\" Phoebe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Super Spicy Meat Special,\" Reagan growled between bites, her tone indicating her half of the table was not to be disturbed now that food was in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as the twins had rekindled their sisterhood with frequent buffet and diner lunches, today's outing highlighted the contrast in their styles of eating. Reagan had become a dogmatic eater, preferring big lunches and late night eats, as partying at Nat's and having snacking intermissions during sex could attest to these habits. The larger breakfast that morning had put her off her game. An extra large was child's play for her, normally, if not for the basket and a half of cheesy bread along with the pudding cups Ixchel had gotten her from the salad bar. After the two-thirds mark Reagan was slowing down, using a well-practiced series of massages to sooth her belly from the massive qualities of food she often subjected it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe, however, took to the food like a fish needing water. Or perhaps a puppy to training, given how eagerly she took to each bite and moaning with pleasure from the taste. It was more pronounced than her usual habits, with Reagan attributing to Phoebe's mugging it up for the video to be posted on 'Gormand-Size' once Ixchel was done editing it. It would be sickening if Reagan hadn't lost most of her gag reflex by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*hurk*\" Reagan breathed heavily some time latter, feeling stuffed to the absolute gills. \"Gonna have to take this home.\" A respectable quarter of her extra-large remained to be boxed with more of that cheesy bread, in all honesty Reagan would have it for dinner that evening, if not a late night snack, but she had become acutely aware of her limits. Gone were her days of hour-long binges, Reagan had shifted to keeping two massive meals with snacks in-between, efforts to keep her tank from going empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe weakly brought another square of pizza to her lips. \"This is, so, so, tasty everyone,\" pause for a belch, \"but I'm not too sure on the Double Extra-Large challenge. Not after burritos.\" She cumulatively had just shy of three times the amount of slices left that Reagan had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't puke my direction if you get sick,\" Reagan chided. Just how air-headed could Phoebe be with these eating challenges of hers? The only saving grace on that \"Gross Grande Burrito\" challenge with breakfast was that the namesake burritos were actually palmed sized and normally came in orders of two or three. That 'taquito' would have been a better moniker was lost on the fast food marketing executives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel, for as focused she was being on the furtive filming, had but away quite a bit of food herself, as she finished the last of her calzone with a large mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling full, Phebes?\" Ixchel asked encouragingly. \"That's a shame. This was going to be the first video set out in public you were going to make for your fans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Chel,\" Phoebe said, somewhat delirious as she found a second wind. \"I wouldn't want to disappoint everyone that believes in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan rolled her eyes, muttering \"Oh, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having already consumed four times the suggested daily caloric intake for the average male by 3 o'clock, Phoebe drew upon her unbelievable energy reserves to go back at her eating challenge with gusto. It was disturbingly mesmerizing for her twin and cousin seeing just how far Phoebe had given herself to gluttony. Whether it was for the online acclaim, proving something to herself, or being just so unrestrained in her consumption, who could say what motivated Phoebe at this point, yet the signs of how the youngest (on a technicality) housemate had become the fattest was clear to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Phoebe huffed, great swaths of her stomach peaking out from under her top as it pressed against the table, her jiggling juggs also matching the rhythmic swelling of her belly with each labored breath. \"I'm...five...pieces...away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like she's swallowed a goddamn truck tire! Reagan thought, filled with mixed feelings. Phoebe's stomach had expanded further than breakfast, somewhat pink, and each jostle Phoebe made to sit more comfortably on her massive rump caused the chairs to creak. As they were identical twins, it was an eerie look into the mirror how far Reagan might have gone had she continued her pursuit of having the largest ass, for how introspective this experience had been for her. And Phoebe was eating this much, seemingly, only for fun it brought her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Phoebe, I know you can do it,\" Ixchel said with quiet excitement. Reagan looked sideways at their cousin from where she sat with her own digesting payload. How come this arrangement, of all things, had made mousey Chel the most excited Reagan had ever seen her short of a video game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good...\" Phoebe said, stuffing her mouth with one of the dwindling slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe powered through the remaining slices. Three left. Two lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was only half a bite of each flavor left, Phoebe did one last surge of consumption to eat them together, sandwich style, to get everything swallowed. \"The...\" she hiccuped, \"double-large-ex, promo, pizza combo, spinach and pineapple, challenge,\" she was beyond rational speech at this point. \"Complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was damn amazing girl,\" Ixchel said, standing for an overhead profile of Phoebe's piggish accomplishment, gingerly poking some of Phoebe's stomach as the younger Durant twin leaned back, chairs giving another creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for watching,\" Phoebe blew a kiss to the camera, before a telltale Durant twin food coma lapsed her to unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Reagan said for the second time that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel sat back down, shutting off the camera. \"You laugh, but Phoebe's bound to get a ton of hits on this video. That's some juicy cash. Even if Phoebe didn't complete the discount the online revenue will more than pay for this bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan watched her twin snore. \"Alright, guess I understand. But how the fuck are we going to get her home now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel paused. \"Um, I guess we wait until she wakes up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Reagan groaned, although she didn't feel like getting to her feet just yet either. \"Although if we're here much longer I'm going to order the terimissu.\"</span></div></div>",

but she found a certain allure to her bulk, not to mention the freedom to indulge whenever she saw fit, as well as a new found connection with her twin born from their...odd...circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet fucking Jesus\u201d grinned Reagan in the bathroom with her reflection grinning back at her between the soap splatters adorning the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavily stepping off the bathroom scales, the mechanism releasing a metallic groan, Reagan couldn\u2019t help but run the numbers in her mind in a constant loop as it dawned on her...<br>\r\nShe\u2019d lost 2lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs inconsequential as the number may be, especially considering most of Reagan\u2019s meals weighed in higher than that, the redhead was still knocked back by the fact that she had - somehow - managed to drop some weight for the first time since Phoebe had glutted herself senseless on ice cream after losing her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs on the nose as it was as her ass still shook under its own momentum from stepping off the scales, Reagan was beyond pleased with herself as she turned to embrace her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if that day held nothing for her that would likely continue her current weight loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lethargic, lumbering steps, Reagan made her way downstairs with her grin still firmly in place as she made her way to the townhouse living room to enjoy a day of relaxation and unadulterated Reagan time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo boys, no chores, no Audrey to nag her because she was nowhere to be seen which seemed to happen more and more lately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Today was Reagan\u2019s day\u2019 thought the redhead as she hip checked the door with a sizeable thrust, granting entry to the still draped room as she semi strode/waddled towards the couch imagining what she would do with her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*rustle rustle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck!?\u201d outburst Reagan as she was wrenched from her own head at the sound coming from the larger of the two sofas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, what the?...\u201d groaned a familiarly pathetic voice as more packaging was disturbed and a mess of red hair emerged from beneath a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What the fuck?\u2019 questioned Reagan again, to herself this time, as she took in the absolute carnage surrounding her and consuming the living room in a surprisingly thick layer of discarded wrappers and boxes from more take outs than she cared to count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh Reagan, is that you?\u201d groaned Phoebe, groggily rising from her rudimentary nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourse its me dummy\u201d snapped the eldest twin as she sighed in disbelief at the mess before her \u201cwhat the hell happened here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhhhhhh\u201d hissed Phoebe with a vague attempt to hold a finger to her lips \u201cI did a donation drive last night, let people buy me food and I live streamed eating it all\u201d<br>\r\nAs she finished a raw belch ballooned out of Phoebe\u2019s mouth and blew a tuft of hair away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what now?\u201d asked Reagan still bemused and fuming at the state of her crash pad for the day \u201cyou know what, I don\u2019t wanna know, just clean it up ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure\u201d groaned Phoebe as she awkwardly sat up, yawning in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the youngster shuffled to escape her sleeping arrangement for the night, Reagan caught quite the eyeful of her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly still bloated from her obvious binge Phoebe was near spherical around her middle which, given she was the twin with the double belly, was a mighty indicator of just how much she\u2019d stuffed into her mouth the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Durant chest was fully fledged and then some as her suffering bra barely kept her decent, never mind fully contained by any stretch of the imagination and Reagan could only hope that her junior was wearing some kind of pants as they were far from visible between rolls of flab and their shared monumental rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot\u201d cussed Phoebe as she glanced at her phone \u201cI\u2019m late for work\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d spat Reagan, a little peeved as she foresaw where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go, Audrey will be so mad if I\u2019m late\u201d insisted Phoebe as she almost energetically brought herself to her feet with a great wobble through her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything, Reagan was left on her own as Phoebe heaved her bloated self out of the room and awkwardly up the stairs with the sound of panting accompanying each heavy foot step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just perfect\u201d sighed Reagan as she rolled her eyes before scooping an arms worth of empty food containers towards where Phoebe had been sat moments before \u201cshe can tidy this mess later then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you Um\u2019s, she\u2019s losing it\u201d grunted Reagan through a mouthful of pizza sub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you did play quite the part in the insanity at one point Red\u201d shot back Uma with a wry grin as a darting tongue licked her lips clean of marinara sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair point, but I\u2019m a changed woman now, I\u2019m down 2lbs today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh totally, you\u2019re practically wasting away\u201d teased Uma as she swiped up another sub before biting hungrily into the cut end, causing melted cheese to billow out between the two pieces of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan could only throw Uma the middle finger as she was too busy with her own sandwich but the point was taken.<br>\r\nUma shouldn\u2019t have brought so many sandwiches home from work if THAT was how she felt.<br>\r\nBesides, the former athlete could hardly critique anybody\u2019s weight these days whilst she lugged around her \u2018six pack turned keg\u2019 belly whilst holding the reputable title of most ill fitted member of staff at the sandwich shop she worked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*bang*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d quizzed Reagan as she glanced into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno\u201d returned Uma with a shrug \u201cChel?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, me!\u201d cheered Phoebe as she stood in the doorway looking a little flushed as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi Pheebs, thought you had work?\u201d asked Uma whilst Reagan deliberately avoided the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did but I finished early\u201d smiled Phoebe, a slightly laboured huff accompanying the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d asked Uma with a fish hooked brow, well aware SOMETHING wasn\u2019t right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm...well I\u2019ve been off work for a couple hours so I went by the all you can eat Chinese buffet next to work and well...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Reagan looked at her twin and couldn\u2019t help but groan at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe\u2019s rather rushed attempt at getting ready that morning had been rife with problems, amongst which was a lack of suitably fitting clothes so, in the spirit of improvisation, she had cobbled together a button up shirt which would not button, a plain white T-shirt underneath to maintain her decency that was compromised by her non-buttoning shirt and a black pleated skirt with an elasticated waist that just managed to stretch around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, her poor skirt was trapped under her rounded belly, still pulled plenty tight by the immense shelf of ass behind her, whilst her shirt was gradually rising with each heavy breath the redhead drew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Phoebe...\u201d groaned Uma having actually put her sandwich down at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold that thought\u201d interrupted Phoebe as she hurriedly fished her phone out of her bag and swiped away an unseen notification, her eyes glistening after reading it as she took to chewing her lips \u201cI\u2019m just gonna...get something to eat, cya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Uma and Reagan looked dumb struck at each other the sound of Phoebe rifling through cupboards could be heard in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s crazy man\u201d Uma finally announced as she turned back into the room to see an exasperated Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan meanwhile, had fished out her own phone and was scrolling to something, finding it a moment later and then passing the phone to Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I looking at here?\u201d asked Uma, confusion written on her face as she looked over a kitchen that looked vaguely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see\u201d retorted Reagan as she wiggles back into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue a very familiar shirt and skirt combo appeared next to the counter top the filming phone was sat on with trails of flaming red hair cascading past the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t...\u201d started Uma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d responded Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she\u2019s...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBemused, Uma looked back at the live stream as she watched Phoebe\u2019s face briefly appear in shot as she blew her signature kiss to her viewers before clumsily reaching into the overhead cupboards as her belly rolled onto the surface in front of her, free of her clothing as it pooled out on the cool surface like flesh coloured lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe playfully giggled as she loaded herself up with as many snacks as she could carry in the form of cookies and chips before grabbing her phone and taking it to the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph, I might have to do another food drive tonight coz I don\u2019t think this is going to cut it\u201d purred Phoebe, pawing at her belly as she set her latest binge down \u201cwe\u2019ll just see though, I am a little pi...argh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith almost comedic execution, Phoebe disappeared out of shot completely with just the top of her head still visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ\u201d muttered Reagan as she watched the stream like a car crash as her twin vocalised her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, guess my butt is just too big for these tiny kitchen chairs now\u201d cooed Phoebe as she held her phone over her head, displaying not only her rolls layered up in her seated position but also the shattered pieces of broken chair protruding from under her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma and Reagan could only stare at each other in disbelief at what they had seen.<br>\r\nHow much carnage was Phoebe going to cause?!</span></div></div>",

Grunting with some effort after a shared pizza &amp; sub meal with Reagan, she rose to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, gotta sign off now,\" Phoebe said from the kitchen, echoed from Reagan's phone as the sounds of Uma's steps marked her crossing between the rooms of the narrow townhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daym girl!\" Uma exclaimed after seeing the site of Phoebe's destruction directly. The fatter of the twins was splayed on her back, broken pieces of the chair under her and the last tension in her clothes having given up the ghost. Having barely crammed herself into the clothes for work and having chinese buffet before hand, the last of her snacking and subsequent collapse had effectively destroyed them. The waistband of her skirt had snapped and buttons had cascaded off of her professional shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee,\" Phoebe laughed with a huff, far too mirthful over the situation. She brushed some of her red hair out of her face. \"Could you lend me a hand, Uma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Uma obliged, stooping to offer an arm. The process of trying to lift the mammoth Durant twin to her feet strained muscles Uma hadn't worked in some time, the must heavy lifting she had done recently being mayo jars at the sandwich shop. \"Dang frick!\" Uma hollered. \"Work...wit' me...Pheebs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan, of course, hadn't bothered getting up to lend a finger to her twin's plight. She heard the minutes-long struggle of Uma trying to help Phoebe to an upright position through the lens of schedfrude. It was pathetic how her sister hadn't learned her limits by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two waddled into sight, Uma in her mildly distorted sandwich shop uniform strained to keep Phoebe moving. The 'baby' of the bunch was dressed in tatters now, her button-missing shirt swaying free from her crumb covered, sweat soaked white undershirt. The snapped skirt had been left in the kitchenette. Phoebe's oozing fatness from her hips, doubled belly and ginormous ass was clearly seen in her underwear also beginning to fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh!\" Reagan quipped through gritted teeth. Sure, they were all women here, and Phoebe was her biological twin, but for once Phoebe was pictured as to not be carrying her weight sexily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you clothed,\" Uma suggested, \"and try to clean up before Audrey discovers this carnage,\" she added, leveraging a strong hint towards Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" Reagan huffed, wiggling her own fatness to build the momentum to climb to her feet. That was when the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can someone get that?\" Reagan roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Ixchel made an appearance at the top of the landing, quite late to the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you can join us,\" Reagan snarked, still a bit suspect on Chel's enabling of Phoebe's renewed modeling career. \"How about answering the door?\" she asked over a repeat of the jingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way looks blocked,\" Ixchel said, not about to attempt to maneuver around Uma and Phoebe on the stairs even if she was smaller than both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Another doorbell ring. \"I'm coming!\" Reagan grunted loudly, marching her way towards the front door as her hips and rear waddled aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo strange young men were on the doorstep, visible through the thin window. Reagan opened the door with a gruff \"Waddya want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lads were somewhere between high school and college age, younger than the twins. One was white and blond with a bit of a schlubby look and the other had light brown skin and curly dark hair. They both stared wide eyed at Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you, Phoebe?\" asked the blond guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" the dark-haired guy said. \"She's not as big as Phoebe was last night. I think that's her twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you fuckers on about?!\" Reagan demanded, although she could put enough of the context clues together to tell these were fans of Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're, um, Putz57 and X-Drango,\" the blond began before he was nudged by his buddy. \"I'm Duncan, he's Marcus,\" Duncan corrected, \"and we sent food on Phoebe's stream so we knew the address, so, could we...meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan, who had never given up on seeing herself as dead to rights hot, could tell from the stuttering and weak-wiled delivery of the two that these were boys without the confidence to talk to a hot girl. Normally she'd be taking advantage of the situation for some screwing around, although both looked too young for her tastes. However, catching fanboy seconds from Phoebe's modeling didn't appeal to her in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe can't come to the door, so you can get out and catch her on the web.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Marcus said, looking up from his phone. \"She was just live-streaming for like two minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan, still taken by the almost equally zaftig size of Phoebe's twin, asked \"Are you on Gourmand-Size too, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan slammed the door in both of their faces, not deeming them worthy of response and not needing to see Phoebe's antics again minutes after they happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the mess?\" came the concerned and angered tones of the eldest Durant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Reagan mouthed. Turning about-face (and her rear keep turning) she attempted to head off Audrey before she caught sight of the kitchenette. Audrey was coming up from the garage home from work with two bulky bags of takeout for dinner. Reagan had completely forgot to make Phoebe clean up her own mess from that morning's wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally Phoebe's fault,\" Reagan said, before realizing the extent of wrappers everywhere. \"That's my lunch, I only admit to this much,\" she hastily picked up her pizza leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe was in sorry shape at work, it was so embarrassing!\" Audrey said, \"I swear we need to do something about that girl--WHO BROKE THE CHAIR??!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo add insult to injury, after Audrey had discovered the destruction in the kitchen, Phoebe had to be rescued from her closet. The townhouse bedrooms had shallow closets owing to space limitations. Phoebe, having outgrown the upper echelons of +Size's higher clothing ranges, was searching for remaining suitable clothes she might have to wear. However, her meaty circumference from mighty ass, wide hips and bloated belly meant she had no good approachable angle to cross the small closet door. Trying to reach a hanger on the far side had left her wedged within, a single-woman stockage compared to when the twins had gotten caught in the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, a hasty house meeting was assembled in Phoebe's room after the efforts it took to extract her from her closet. Each of the Fordham women barely had space to themselves to stand as Phoebe weighted down one side of her mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe, sweetheart,\" Audrey began after chewing. \"You've been getting far too obsessed with food and its not healthy for work or home. I had to find excuses to stave off Ms. Parkins at work for your lateness and state of dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I was just up late and lost track of time.\" Phoebe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Ixchel hastily slurped down some noodles. \"She's been up late with me. Studying.\" She wasn't prepared to explain to Audrey just what kind of modeling Phoebe was doing online and why she was helping. Her cousin couldn't think of Phoebe as anything other than the baby of the bunch sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Phoebe, your ass was too fat to lift girl,\" Uma said between munching. \"You're too fat for your britches that crushing chairs will be the least of your problems if you don't curb your eatin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, jeez sis,\" Reagan snickered, loving the times Phoebe got in trouble, as she had found her twin's Snickers stash left out on a dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe pouted, wearing only an ill-fitting teddy as she hadn't gotten some proper clothing. \"What's wrong with being fat?\" The way Phoebe saw it, her ass was as luscious as ever and she still had lots of friends and followers. And the eating was dang good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, honey, that's not what we're saying,\" Audrey said, \"I'm happy you find yourself beautiful at a larger size but really, there is a thing as getting too fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nearly as wide as your mattress!\" Uma stated. \"Seriously girl, lay off the food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, as Phoebe nursed the sore red welt on her chunky hip from where she had gotten stuck in her closet, said spread of her largest ASSet brought her flab dangerously close to the width of her bed. \"That's not very fair,\" Phoebe pouted, \"I'm not the only fat one here and you aren't letting me have any of the takeout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words brought a fallout of some self-realization among the other residents, who had been sharing Audrey's takeout during this impromptu intervention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't want it to get cold,\" Audrey explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, cousin,\" Chel said, \"the twins may be big but you've been catching up behind them. Ever since you all went clubbing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself I'm down two pounds,\" Reagan bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's...\" Audrey had her own secrets to hide, being experimental in her relationship with Natalie and coming to terms with her own desires of eating and gaining. She kept some restraint and decorum compared to Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk, Chel,\" Uma started, \"you're not much of a skinny minnie either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not as fit,\" Chel replied factually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I have a couple too many subs after work,\" Uma muttered darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point being,\" Audrey said, \"maybe we all have some points to work on, or things around here will be tighter than ever.\" Especially as they had to enter Phoebe's room in single file.</span></div></div>",

days\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan recoiled slightly with an instinctive hand to her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost 2lbs\u201d muttered the smaller twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u201d insisted Audrey with a hint of motherly tone in her voice \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together and we\u2019re all going to lose some weight together\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence befell the group.<br>\r\n\u2018Weight loss\u2019 had become something of an unspoken thing whilst needles on scales had gradually crept higher and, if nothing else, the exhibition of exposed pudginess and curves hardly screamed \u2018healthy young women\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis SUCKS!\u201d grunted Reagan as she returned to the kitchen with her arms loaded with all manner of sweet and salty snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d Uma grunted back \u201cmaybe you can lose another pound though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut up\u201d spat Reagan as she watched Uma\u2019s pendulous belly swing from one hip to the other with each heavy step \u201clet me know when you can waddle more than 50 yards\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha ha, point taken\u201d smirked Uma as she deposited her stash of protein bars and ironic health snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan followed close behind and clumsily dumped her own food into the box.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, maybe we should get back into the gym if we\u2019re taking this seriously?\u201d suggested Reagan trying to ignore the warm flush colouring her cheeks and hint of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the nicest way Red, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll fit on a treadmill at the moment\u201d Uma stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan laughed \u201cyeah, you\u2019re probably right\u201d.<br>\r\nFeeling uncomfortable, the redhead rolled her shorts down allowing her belly to escape in a heavy downward bulge.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d love these hips though\u201d teased Reagan as she forcefully swung her engorged girth into Uma\u2019s own side, knocking the former athlete off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, totally\u201d mused Uma with an eye roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls chatted and teased each other, Ixchel silently slid in and placed half a dozen bottles of energy drinks into the contraband box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo food Chel?\u201d asked Uma, folding her arms awkwardly over her spherical stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope\u201d mused the resident nerd with a finger nudge to the glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan and Uma simply shrugged at each other as Chel buried herself in her phone, hoping this awkward situation would pass sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs simmering chatter floated around the kitchen, laboured breathing began to grow louder in the hallway behind the gathered townhouse girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew...I\u2019m he...here\u201d groaned Phoebe sounding fit to pass out as she waddled into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got everything?\u201d asked Uma, opting to play mum in Audrey\u2019s temporary absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d huffed Phoebe looking redder than her twin with arms so full she could barely see past the pile of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how much did you eat on the way down?\u201d asked Uma again, a small smile spreading on her lips as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoads\u201d admitted Phoebe as she poured her stockpile into the box, most of which fell onto the counter as it overflowed the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped away from the box and rested her gargantuan arse against a cupboard, Phoebe looked every pound of her vast bulk.<br>\r\n\u2018Jeez, that could have been me\u2019 thought Reagan as she looked over her twins thick belly rolls and bulging rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk ladies, hope you\u2019re all done\u201d cooed Audrey as she appeared with her own modest collection of sweet pastries collected from her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of agreement responded with hints of reluctance mixed in as Audrey piled her contraband up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a really good start, good job guys\u201d enthused Audrey with a beaming smile as she looked over her fattened housemates \u201cnow just have to avoid temptation and no more food in bedrooms\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Audrey stopped talking the sound of a doughnut bag rustling cut through the quiet kitchen causing everybody to look at Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebe?!\u201d shouted all but Audrey as the redhead began loading the jam filled pastries into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWah?\u201d grunted the twin through a full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on sweetie, we\u2019re in this together\u201d smiled Audrey as she tried to take the bag from her youngest sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just so hungry\u201d complained Phoebe as she clutched her belly, chubby fingers sinking into her pale flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know\u201d sympathised Audrey as a thought came to mind \u201dI\u2019ve got to go somewhere, have a healthy dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blonde turned tail towards the garage with the contraband box in her arms, the remaining girls glanced at each other confused.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all thinking it, what the hell is a \u2018healthy\u2019 dinner right?\u201d announced Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh thanks for letting me come over\u201d sighed Audrey as she strolled into Nat\u2019s apartment, confiscated food still in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it\u201d replied Nat, a look of confusion washing over her face as she closed the door behind the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re having a clear out of all the junk to try and shift a bit of collective weight at home\u201d said Audrey in acknowledgment of the look Nat was giving her \u201cPhoebe\u2019s weight is getting out of control\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat knew all too well how Phoebe\u2019s weight was going, that stream was everywhere she went these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I hoped I could dump this stuff here for you to get rid of\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m totally the shady \u2018disposal girl\u2019\u201d smirked Nat, adjusting the strap of her vest top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean it like that, just thought you might have a use for some of this stuff\u201d smiled Audrey as she placed it on Nat\u2019s marble breakfast bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d quizzed Nat with a warm spark bubbling inside her as she almost delicately trotted up behind Audrey and pinned her against the breakfast bar between her arms.<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise this was a pleasure trip too\u201d cooed the confident woman as she bit her lip allowing her belly to gently grind against Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not, I mean...\u201d Audrey faltered as she turned between Nat\u2019s arms to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh blondie, momma\u2019s gonna take care of your little snack problem\u201d cooed Nat as she reached around Audrey, producing a muffin to devour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph, no wonder Phoebe has been piling on the pounds\u201d groaned Nat from her reclined position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...buurp\u201d belched Audrey \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be on a diet you know\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat giggled, rolling onto her side.<br>\r\n\u201cWell what they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them\u201d teased Nat with fingers delicately resting on her full belly \u201cbesides, I didn\u2019t hear you complaining\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She\u2019s not wrong...\u2019 thought Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s the townhouse diet going sugar?\u201d asked Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s going great, everybody has settled in to it nicely\u201d smiled Audrey, delicately slicing a section of juicy steak from her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad\u201d smiled Nat \u201cyou girls have to stay healthy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded as she chewed the delicate meat, mentally moaning in ecstasy at the flavour.<br>\r\nNat was such an amazing cook and her stuff tasted even better since she\u2019d started dieting with her house mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you aren\u2019t just enjoying me being round most nights?\u201d coyly probed Audrey between bites as she watched Nat enjoying her own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is always a perk\u201d smirked Nat, catching a stray juice line with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed as she emptied her plate, placing hands on her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re not too full hun\u201d mused Nat as she stood up to collect Audrey\u2019s plate with her own, bending to whisper in the blondes ear \u201cthere\u2019s dessert tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No wonder my shirt won\u2019t button fully\u2019 thought Audrey as she pawed at her partly exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know, this healthy eating isn\u2019t so bad\u201d smirked Reagan as she loaded her fork with an assortment of greens and grilled chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you it wouldn\u2019t be so bad\u201d smirked Uma as she nibbled at her own salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself\u201d complained Phoebe as she grumpily scratched at her now empty plate with her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls continued to chat the front door clicked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you Aud?\u201d shouted Reagan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! You had dinner yet?\u201d the blonde called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it now\u201d replied Uma as Reagan had resumed eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood coz I\u2019ve got to go out tonight so I don\u2019t want you guys waiting on me\u201d purred Audrey as she came into the kitchen with a bounce in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool\u201d murmured Phoebe, still sulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, sorry to dash but I\u2019ve got to go again, see you later!\u201d chirped Audrey as she turned to leave again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blonde disappeared down the hallway, Reagan followed her down with her eyes and the redhead couldn\u2019t help but notice her sisters love handles escaping her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmmmm\u2019 thought the redhead with a narrowed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, Audrey was packing more junk in the trunk since this whole diet thing started too...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a scant few weeks, it looked like the Fordham ladies had seen the error of their ways in terms of the weight piled on by their unbridled gluttony. Audrey had kept a stern eye on the household, confiscating any and all treats that weren't on the diet plan. Ixchel had been instructed to crunch the numbers along with her kale chips given her med-tech expertise. Uma had gotten some of her zeal for working out back and together with Reagan they were making baby steps in working out at home. The older Durant twin, glad to have not gotten to Phoebe's size, was looking to shed a bit of her gut while keeping her killer, inflated ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was safe to say that just about everyone had lost a handful of pounds, barely perceptible size changes present among the household. Well, except for two that weren't losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as Audrey was running a tight ship, she spent just as much time as she spent at home out, often with Ixchel or Uma taking point of the diet efforts. Somehow she hadn't lost any weight yet, as she seemed to be getting bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as for the youngest resident, Phoebe was resistant to such changes in a bad sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chel! Chel! Please let me in,\" came a soft whimper at the door to Ixchel's office space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe multiracial nerd sighed, her youngest cousin's pleadings over the last few days starting to wear her thin. Her patience, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe, go away. I can't make any exceptions for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chel, I'm so hungry, please! Even one of your kombucha drinks might stave off how famished I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Ixchel opened the door. The problem with these forced diets was that Phoebe, the Durant sister under the most scrutiny, hadn't looked to have lost even a pound yet. Dressed in what passed for her loosest clothing (a generous term), the redhead looked bleary and her hair unkempt as she filled out some grey sweats. She hobbled inside, the spare space of Ixchel's office vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll give you another bag of carrot sticks,\" Ixchel gave in, getting a second snack portion for her cousin who was poised to outgrow the two-seater Ixchel had as the other office furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food and drink were gone in a minute. \"Is there any more, Chel?\" Phoebe asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we can't, Phoebe,\" Ixchel said conspiratorially. \"Your weight gain, unchecked, brought Audrey that close to realizing what we were doing on the Gormand-Size site. I'm lucky I've managed to buy off Reagan's silence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is horrible!\" Phoebe moaned. \"It's so mean, not letting me eat!\" Her metabolism had long been broken to her caloric shift in lifestyle over the past year. All these healthy meals and restrictive snacks did nothing to quell Phoebe's appetite. Too obese for even simple exercise, despite Uma's best efforts, the pear-shaped twin hadn't lost as much as an ounce. Her ass and hips were as wide as ever, taxing the waistband of her clothes, and her stomach constantly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was a mess, becoming a skulking recluse ever since the diet plans were enacted. Under an equally tight eye at work, Phoebe had withdrawn from both her BBW modeling and her social media feeds, having practically dropped off the face of the earth when it came to her online life. For the bubbly Phoebe, who had tied her social worth to her gluttonous ways, she felt all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel was torn. Much like Audrey's original intentions, she was concerned for her cousin's health and how the whole household had been tipping the scales to outrageous weights. Still, that time she had been helping set up Phoebe's Gormand-Size presence had been both lucrative and exciting. Days of being in a thankless programming job and now having to help enforce a shift in the roommates' lifestyle made her miss out on the risqu\u00e9 activity she had helped engage with Phoebe. But they had to remain quiet or else Audrey would find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough seeing Phoebe sitting there depressed, staring off into space and massaging her saggy, empty belly tugged at Ixchel's heartstrings, as she wasn't as emotionless nor as prim-minded as the others of the household took her for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Ixchel said, digging out her keys. \"If anyone asks where you've been, I've registered you for a weight loss trial with my company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chel, how could you!\" Phoebe gasped, feeling betrayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGawd, Phoebe could be such a ditz. \"That's what you're supposed to say, Phoebe, if anyone asks, because what I'm actually going to do is drive you to the studio because I know you've missed it so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel nearly found herself squashed by the tremendous poundage of her baby cousin pouncing on her for a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorge began at the Gormand-Size studio in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtilizing space from an old factory building converted to commercial space, the pop-up BBW studio used the third floor for its shoots. Nothing elaborate, mainly against curtains or simple backdrops, although having access to an industrial shipping grade elevator and remodeled kitchen space was a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, a lot of burger deliveries were being accepted on the ground floor and run up to the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be sat along a table as cameras were focused on the return of their recent starlet. Who had barely gotten a word in edgewise to thank her fans as she made up for lost time from her failed dieting with a massive burger binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a hell of a girl,\" the director said, as Phoebe's eating overtook double digit in patties. \"How did you know her again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both went to college together,\" said Ryan, one of the assistants. A member of Phoebe's college clique along with Tiana, the two hadn't seen much of Phoebe in the direct aftermath of her embarrassment about losing her acting gig. And by strange serendipity the three were now involved with the fetish model site. Tiana, a voluptuous Latina hourglass, did makeup and had appeared in a few shoots of her own, yet Phoebe had eclipsed her in size. \"I hadn't realized she would be into this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't loose out on her again, even if it'll break the food budget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorge continued at a downtown dinner, much like sisterly work lunches that had once occurred but a different restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been to one of these places in what feels like forever, thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting opposite the gorging redhead were Duncan and Marcus, also known as Putz57 and X-Drango, two fans on hers who had kept track of her \"well-being\" as they put it since Reagan had slammed the door in their face. By chance, catching sight of Phoebe leaving the Gormand-Size studio had led to this impromptu diner meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" said Duncan, overwhelmed at being this close to the enormity of his crush. He and Marcus felt like they had suddenly made it. If making it required trying to scramble enough hands-on cash to pay for Phoebe's bill and having to schooch the table closer to their side to make room for Phoebe's bulk on the other side of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, are those banana chocolate chip pancakes?\" Phoebe noticed on the menu. Duncan flagged down their server for an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" Marcus said, with the subtextual gestures of how strapped for cash they currently were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one, she's a hottie,\" Duncan protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mega hottie, yeah, but we have to call it quits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both think I'm hot?\" Phoebe asked, as the two sat straight at attention, \"Aw, you're so sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the gorge continued at a private residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, oooh,\" Phoebe yawned, mildly delirious. \"That tasted so good. Reagan doesn't know what she's missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she does,\" said Darryl, another enabler to the twins. \"Not everyone goes for the salted carmel or blackberry cheesecakes but I think they add more flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving endorsed Reagan during her own sided rivalry and then catching them in post-clubbing escapades, Darryl had missed seeing the Durant twins in particular. Regan had her machinations for letting Darryl pamper her and abuse his pocketbook but Phoebe was genuinely thankful. It was funny how acerbic and abrasive Reagan was to how sweet and carefree Phoebe could be. Short of being identical, you'd never think they were twins. Well, identical didn't match up on their physiques nowadays...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl thanked his good fortune for getting an unintended call from Phoebe's phone. Could you call it \"butt dialing\" if was made from a a roll of fat? Knowingly, Phoebe would pulverize her phone if she had sat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopped off with luxurious dessert, Phoebe was a totem of sheer gluttony at this point. Tight clothing discarded, her gelatinous ass and flared hips oozed out of her stretchy panties, dwarfed by a bloated, tremendous stomach that looked a tinge pink after all she had eaten that day. It nearly looked like she had gained ten pounds that day alone after weeks of fruitless dieting. Well, fruit had been on the accepted meal plan. With labored breathing the dome of Phoebe's engorged gut raised and lowered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do yah think,\" Phoebe mused, nodding off towards sleep, \"we could wake up to all that bacon like we used to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, princess,\" Darryl got her a blanket. The best reason to cut out of work early he'd ever have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a different gorge continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waddya say we make a pizza fort out of all these spent boxes?\" Nat said teasingly, holding a slice of sausage and cheese above Audrey's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasurable consumption was the only reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say I should get some more ordered,\" Nat cooed, rubbing Audrey's broad belly. The club owner looked chunkier these days but the majority of vittles during their trysts had gone to Audrey's increased poundage. \"Four more and I get the freebee from the punchcard, how about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stifled belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I say no to you?\"</span></div></div>",

less casual fling, burrowing her face into the pillows behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat bit her lip as she checked out Audrey\u2019s figure casting quite the silhouette through the bed sheets from the curvaceous Durant hip sticking up to the plush slope of growing belly bulging towards the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut darling\u201d crooned Nat as she sidled herself behind Audrey into a spooning position \u201cit\u2019s breakfast time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey\u2019s eyes flicked open at that.<br>\r\nThe diet she\u2019d imposed on herself, siblings and housemates was taking its toll on the poor blonde and she relished the thought of enjoying Nat\u2019s scrumptious cooking away from prying eyes.<br>\r\nThat said, the blonde Durant would probably have more standing to be pining for greasy breakfast foods if she was sticking to the diet she was forcing everyone else on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Phoebe had been the prime instigator in the start of the house wide dieting, it was no mystery that all the girls were packing on the pounds.<br>\r\nUnlike the rest of her housemates though, Audrey\u2019s reliance on escaping to Nat\u2019s and her girlfriend/not girlfriend\u2019s sympathetic doting was doing nothing for the blondes waistline.<br>\r\nTruthfully, Audrey was gaining weight hand over fist almost obliviously as she treated herself constantly whilst lost in her infatuation for Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine\u201d relented Audrey with a casual scratch of her belly beneath the sheets \u201cbut it is my cheat day so you better make it worthwhile\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat practically leapt out of bed with a display of naked wobbly curves as she strutted towards the door where her silk dressing gown hung.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d teased Nat as she covered her tattooed shoulders with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that darling?\u201d cooed Nat over a mug of coffee, legs crossed beneath the dark wood table as she watched over Audrey who was savagely tearing into a mountain of breakfast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing\u201d managed the blonde between mouthfuls of bacon and sausage drenched in as much syrup as her pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my girl\u201d purred Nat as she put down her mug and delicately sliced a segment from her own plate of pancakes before hungrily chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed as she ate, Nat was a charmer with words as much as her food and it was exhilarating for the Durant senior.<br>\r\nShe\u2019d had boyfriends before who were sweet enough but Nat was a whole different level...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuurp, ooph, pardon me\u201d chuckled Audrey with a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, you getting full sweetheart?\u201d asked Nat with an upwards glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems so but then...buurp...I have eaten a lot\u201d groaned Audrey as she rubbed her full belly, it\u2019s natural softness reduced from the sheer quantity of food crammed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame, you didn\u2019t even get to try my muffins\u201d sighed Nat with an all too practiced faux drama that always hooked Audrey back in no matter how full she was.<br>\r\nOnce upon a time Nat had used such a move to push her food on unsuspecting individuals but with Audrey it bore no ill intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou made muffins?\u201d asked Audrey, interest piqued despite her fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you said it was your cheat day after all\u201d purred Nat as she rose from her chair and tottered to the kitchen \u201ccan\u2019t let me girl go without being spoiled now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best Nat, you know that?\u201d fawned Audrey, watching as Nat came towards her with a plateful of still warm muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I do try\u201d smiled Nat as she stood behind the blonde, peeling the wrapper from a chocolate muffin before reaching forward and wiped the fist sized cake in the syrup left on Audrey\u2019s plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey lent back in her chair which creaked slightly, resting her head against Nat\u2019s stomach before instinctively open her mouth as the soaked muffin came towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey moaned as she tore a mouthful of warm cake away, her lips taking a coating of syrup in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d smirked Nat as she stood ready to dutifully feed the growing girl before her \u201cbut I thought you were full?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey only closed her eyes as she inhaled another bite, tipping her head slightly further back against her lover\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as long as you\u2019re sure\u201d smiled Nat as the first muffin was taken from her fingers allowing her to grab a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment of feeding which was not uncommon these days or necessarily exclusive to Nat feeding Audrey continued for several muffins before a sharp phone ring cut through the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww shit, I\u2019ve got to get this\u201d cussed Nat as she dumped the plate of muffins in front of Audrey who looked on hungrily if not reluctantly before taking off after her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean the order hasn\u2019t arrived yet? We\u2019ve got to...uh huh...but we\u2019ve got...uh huh...oh fine, see you in 10\u201d<br>\r\nAs soon as the phone went down Nat came back with a gentle waddle in her hip swinging step.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry hun but I\u2019m gonna have to go to the club, stock\u2019s gone out of whack and they\u2019re having a meltdown without me\u201d sighed Nat, this time more frustrated than anything \u201cyou gonna be ok until I get back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, I\u2019ll be fine\u201d smiled Audrey weakly as tiredness rolled over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl\u201d smiled Nat, leaning in for a syrupy kiss \u201cbehave yourself\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nat had taken off to handle the latest business crisis Audrey had admittedly taken a nap.<br>\r\nNot a long one but a much needed one after the great feast that had been breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling much more ready for the day though, Audrey squeezed herself into a pair of jeggings and a baggy hoodie before depositing herself onto the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she casually flicked through the tv channels it crossed her mind just how good things were with her and Nat and, despite being casual, they were going strong and feelings were very much involved.<br>\r\nAlthough nothing official had been said Audrey certainly felt like things were progressing and she felt compelled to do something to show Nat she was ready.<br>\r\nThen inspiration struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis certainly was not Audrey\u2019s kind of shop.<br>\r\nPacked away in a quiet corner of the mall was Knicker Knackers.<br>\r\nDarkly lit with a curtained door, Audrey had always avoided the place, in no small part due to the stories the twins had regaled in the past about its contents.<br>\r\nAudrey was on a mission though and it certainly did not involve any of the things dangling from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there sugar, what can we do for you today?\u201d asked a skinny guy behind the counter with no name tag and an air of cockiness about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just looking for erm, something to wear tonight for my girlfriend to help spice things up a little\u201d declared Audrey with surprising confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome\u201d nodded the skinny guy \u201clingerie is on the right there and plus size is towards the back\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d shot Audrey with a motherly glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trying to help coz the stuff at the front ain\u2019t gonna fit you\u201d retorted the clerk, clearly not his first time directing larger women to the right shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colours and shapes were mind boggling. Audrey had always been a simple girl in that respect but she really wanted to do something special for Nat.<br>\r\nAfter some time flicking through the various items one jumped out at Audrey.<br>\r\nAlthough the light was dim the \u2018garment\u2019 appeared to be purple and it was labelled as a babydoll which, by Audrey\u2019s limited understanding, would suit her full middle figure with the flowing base and some matching panties.<br>\r\nIt was even in her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriumphantly Audrey quickly turned tail to the till and sat her items down to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice choice\u201d remarked the clerk as he rang it through.<br>\r\nAudrey gave him a small smile.<br>\r\n\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of my business but try this as well\u201d<br>\r\nAs he spoke, the skinny guy scrawled a website on the bottom of Audrey\u2019s receipt before handing it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at it briefly before putting it in her purse and heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I think\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk simply smiled as Audrey walked away, the website Gourmand-Size now flashing through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so sorry babe\u201d cried out Nat as she slammed her apartment door shut \u201cbut I\u2019m here now and we can still make something of the...did you order pizza without me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was strong and Nat hypnotically wandered after it into the living room where Audrey was lay surrounded by fresh pizza boxes wearing her new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is a surprise\u201d purred Nat, lingering on the blonde\u2019s belly bulging in her lap and against the sheer purple material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d smiled Audrey with a little shoulder shimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I do\u201d grinned Nat as she slid up alongside Audrey, placing a hand on the blonde\u2019s thigh as she lent in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d purred Audrey as she turned into Nat, blindly pressing play on the tv to start the video she had preloaded from the website she had been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, a little background entertainment too?\u201d asked Nat between kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust some atmosphere\u201d returned Audrey as she gently caressed Nat\u2019s neck as the sound began to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are quite the minx Audrey Durant\u201d cooed Nat \u201cI hope you have a plan\u201d<br>\r\nBut before Audrey could explain a VERY familiar voice cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d questioned Audrey as she looked to the tv where the voice had come from and found herself mortified as she was met with the sight of her youngest sister bursting out of a school girl uniform, gorging on cake with her belly resting on a worktop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"...and it's not a birthday for the birthday girl without presents...\"</i> came the coy, playful tones of Phoebe on Nat's smart TV between mouthfuls of cake. Phoebe's 'character' in this video complained about having to go school on her special day and having all the other students make fun of her for being so fat. A thin veneer of narrative to explain the balloons and party decor behind Phoebe as she moved onto opening her first present, demolished cake left to her side. Yet not enough to explain why this party was occurring 'at' a school setting, with Phoebe crammed into a folding desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...a whole case of tropical pudding pops! My favorite~!\"</i> Phoebe licked her lips as she massaged the belly bursting out over the taxed schoolgirl skirt. She opened a cup of lemon-orange zest and dug in with her messy cake fingers, bringing more food to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, she, uhhh...\" Nat was at a lost for words. She was no stranger to following Phoebe's rise to stardom on the BBW model site, a part of her kept a soft spot for her original 'manager's favorite' before getting physically intimate with Audrey. But having your lover's kid sister's fetish video on in the background was a definite mood killer for obvious reasons. Especially one that had not known prior to that exact moment what her sister had been up to, as Nat could tell splitting her eyes between Phoebe's video performance and Audrey's gobsmacked, frozen look of absolute mortification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Audrey's perspective, she was unable to process what exactly she was seeing. She could recall the events of the day, becoming more embolden during her time with Nat, wanting a way to heighten that spice in the bedroom. She couldn't remember the last time she had ventured into a store for sexy lingerie, certainly not when she was this big. Before Nat's arrival back to her flat Audrey had taken a cursory examination of the Gorman-Size site the Knicker Knackers clerk had given her. Previously, Audrey would have been confused and unsure about such an niche adult site, although the layout did have an air of class about it. Most candids of the models were tasteful, less provocatively clothed, with videos adorned with title cards with only the descriptions to suggest the contents. Minutes ago, browsing the free videos page, Audrey had thought nothing of the innocuously titled 'Party Gal' with a picture of a cupcake. It being one of the highest rated videos seemed like a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe! She...how...why??\" Audrey could not put words together either. That was her little sister! The youngest of the twins, the one Audrey always considered to be too naive and precious for her own good. She knew the twins' were scantily driven given their attention grabbing booties and maybe, in some strange yet no less mollifying way should could have accepted Reagan staring in such a video, but not PHOEBE!! Did she even know what she was doing? Who in full honestly could have supported her on this?! She's was supposed to be on a diet and she sure as well wasn't! That Phoebe was just smaller than she currently was told Audrey this was a recently shot video and the release date confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has she been doing this THIS WHOLE time?!\" Audrey cried. \"Is that what they do when I'm not there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's not judge too hastily,\" Nat suggested, biting her tongue. Gosh, she had never imagined trying to talk Audrey down about this subject. Audrey being forward with loading a Gormand-Size video was a pleasant surprise when she got home, but she had failed to remember the big conflict of interest that would arise form Audrey discovering the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go,\" Audrey quickly stood to get her things. The leaden weight in her stomach was not from food binge foreplay this time, her mind flooded with confused emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Aud, you might want to cover up...\" Be its very definition, the babydoll lingerie left far too much skin on display. Audrey hastily clothed herself, her stomach bulge still not fully covered by the time she went out the door with a heavy slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooooooooo...\" Nat sighed, not wanting to be there for that confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coast is clear,\" Ixchel said. She and Phoebe had the townhouse to themselves. Audrey had been spending plenty of time away from home and both Uma and Reagan had gotten into a habit of going to the gym again. Or so they claimed, although the evidence pointed to yes with them returning sweaty and collapsing in the living room the moment they stepped in the door twice this last week. Now, the schedules had overlapped leaving a window where the two remaining residents were free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again Chel, this is going to be amazing!\" Phoebe was not as much of a ditz as she let on. Okay, only by so much, but she was aware of what Gormand-Size was really about. Sex sells, after all, and some of the models got up to pretty risqu\u00e9 material in their videos. Phoebe had mainly done eating video content and pics up until her forced hiatus but now that she was working for the sight on the down low again, she really wanted to give her fans a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were set up in a corner of the den, Ixchel on camera work and Phoebe lounging on the sofa in her pyjammas. An older set, having shown signs of strain, with the obvious indications under the material that Phoebe wasn't wearing any kind of underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Phoebe blew a kiss, having teased her hair and gone for sultry look with her eyeshadow. She took a drink of the milkshake Ixchel had gotten her from a fast food joint around the corner, a fast food bag part of the other items needed for the video on the side table. \"This video is going to be different from my usual content. I wanted to give you all the opportunity to know me even more. Which is why I'm not at the studio, this is more like my everyday life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick pan across the squat basement. \"People ask me if I mind being fat. I don't mind but there's some obvious challenges. Space gets kinda tight here. And I can't go long before nothing fits anymore...\" She inhaled deeply, her top constricting around her breasts as the camera took an overhead view, catching the width of Phoebe's body as her great stomach stuck out under her chest atop her flared, flabby hips filling out couch space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never had much of a chest before,\" Phoebe said, trying to work her buttons but needing to look down to catch each fastener on her top. \"But now I don't know what to do with these new girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe's full, flabby breasts plopped down over her stomach. She breathed a sigh of relief at airing them out, working her bare arms out of the shirt. \"All that food, all those stuffing challenges,\" she rubbed across her chest, \"so much of me is filling out. And most of it goes down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted, working up momentum to stand. The camera panned back as Phoebe stood, fingers slipping to the taunt waist of her jammie pants. She turned, pulling down the pants in a tantalizing fashion, her meaty, gigantic ass filling out the frame. It's a good thing Ixchel had moved the coffee table or she would have tripped needing to back up enough to keep Phoebe's lower half in the lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe twisted a little bit, letting her great big ass wobble, fat flopping too and fro rhythmically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*whew*\" she sighed, lowering herself back onto the couch with a plop. Another long sip of her milkshake followed by a bite of her roast beef sandwich. \"I don't go up or down stairs that fast anymore. And I got stuck in my closet once, can you believe that?\" Her hand strayed around the drive-thru bags on the stand. \"It's kinda getting hard to find pleasure time for myself...\" A toy borrowed from Reagan. A click. A strong, pulsating buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, er, cut,\" Phoebe said, motioning to Chel to turn off the camera. \"Is 'pleasure time' correct? Should I have said 'pleasurable time' instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't matter that much, Phoebe,\" Ixchel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Phoebe asked over the din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it's fine,\" Ixchel shouted. \"Turn that thing off!\" Another click and silence resumed. \"Sheesh, what's wrong with Reagan? That sounds like a jackhammer.\" Ixchel fiddled with the camera settings. \"I'm going to have to work on the audio balance if we keep that in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is too much?\" Phoebe said casually in the buff, continuing to eat the first of her fast food lunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Ixchel replied. \"Getting you to this tier with a nude shoot is going to have an even bigger payout than the usual. Maybe we should have a bit more build up before we get to the spicy stuff and you get tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, *munch* more poses and foreplay and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that, I can edit it in,\" Ixchel replied, mind focused on their home video setup, having grown oddly professional to becoming the web mistress for Phoebe's moonlighting as a BBW camgirl. Such as her nonchalance to Phoebe continuing to eat in the nude. \"I can work on that with the compilation of your best phone vines. Maybe save some of that for the video, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Phoebe wiped sauce off her lips. This was actually kinda fun! She and Ixchel continued to film content for Phoebe's 'All Revealing @ Home\" vid, working title, as she went through an array of approaches and poses for the concept, thinking they had the afternoon to themselves. However, when they got back to the point when the sex toys were about to be introduced into the equation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PHOEBE AMELIA-RICHARDS DURANT!!\" The booming voice came with the echo of the front door slamming open upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't her mother although the intensity caused Phoebe to freeze up all the same. \"Oh shit!\"</span></div></div>",

Ok, I\u2019ll fill in the gaps then\u201d remarked Audrey as Phoebe remained silent, fidgeting from chubby foot to chubby foot causing her dressing gown to flirt dangerously with exposing her as her hips rolled and stressed the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are filming porn and, clearly now, Ixchel is helping you\u201d sighed Audrey, feeling a little ill at speaking the words \u201cand to think I found out today of all days\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not porn\u201d muttered Phoebe almost under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to speak louder than than young lady\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not porn and don\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201d shouted Phoebe with an ironic teenage sulk spreading on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you do this Phoebe and in our house of all things!\u201d asked Audrey, volume and temper flaring more with each passing sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed modelling ok and this guy offered me the job\u201d admitted the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou took a porn job from a stranger? Good lord\u201d sighed the blonde, hardly believing her ears at how truly naive Phoebe had been this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not porn!\u201d screamed Phoebe again, stamping her foot with arms angrily folded across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are your panties hanging off the sofa?!\u201d retorted Audrey having eyed the stretched lacy garment.<br>\r\nPhoebe flushed red almost instantly from a combination of embarrassment and anger whilst Ixchel attempted to shrink herself into a dark corner of the basement as the sisters threw verbal shots at each other.<br>\r\nBefore the redhead had chance to respond the front door flew open again with the familiar laboured pants of Reagan and Uma crawling into the townhouse.<br>\r\n\u201cJeez it\u2019s...quiet in here...\u201d grunted Reagan audibly upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least I\u2019m not having sex with Nat!\u201d hurled Phoebe with an unexpected load of venom from the townhouse ditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey froze.<br>\r\nHow did Phoebe know she\u2019d been sneaking off to Nat\u2019s and the more intimate details that went with those sneakings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thought I was too stupid to notice?\u201d snarked Phoebe with a hint of sanctimonious attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Phoebe, you\u2019re not stupid...\u201d whispered Audrey, her anger completely diffused at the unexpected reveal into her personal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Reagan confirmed it after you started going backwards on your diet, she followed you one night\u201d affirmed Phoebe with a seriously smug grin on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, go go go!\u201d came the panicked hush tones of Reagan from upstairs with pounding footsteps running from the kitchen and ending as the front door slammed again.<br>\r\nA muffled complaint from Uma was also heard from upstairs but no more footfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe...what?\u201d exclaimed Audrey now completely lost and confused with her own emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been sleeping with Nat\u201d repeated Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed seeing no use in denying it any longer.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, me and Nat have been seeing each other for a while now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, so I\u2019m not that bad\u201d crooned Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPheebs, don\u2019t...\u201d tried Ixchel, but the damage was already done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me? Me having a girlfriend is NOT as bad as you filming porn videos in OUR HOUSE\u201d shouted Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not porn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it sure looked like it with your skimpy school girl outfit and all that went with that\u201d urged Audrey, arms flailing at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you...watched my videos?\u201d asked Phoebe, looking a little thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just...well one accidentally when me and...\u201d Audrey faltered as she played the situation back in her mind but Phoebe was already ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just weird Audrey...I\u2019ve got to go\u201d<br>\r\nAs the youngest Durant pushed past her sister to escape the basement, Audrey looked exasperated at Ixchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is being safe you know?\u201d insisted the plump multiracial cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t, we will be talking later\u201d sighed Audrey as she trudged up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was upset.<br>\r\nShe had enjoyed her time flaunting her growing body and growing her body for that matter but knowing that Audrey had actually watched some of her videos and with Nat made the junior twin feel very uncomfortable.<br>\r\nNot uncomfortable enough to not drown her feelings in fan-bought cheesecake she had hidden in the concealed fridge in her room but uncomfortable all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d called out Phoebe after a heavy swallow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief pause followed but an answer hesitantly came shortly after.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s...Audrey\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away Audrey\u201d grunted Phoebe as she continued to shovel cheesecake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Phoebe, I just want to talk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe fell silent this time, partly from eating, caught on whether to talk to her sister or not.<br>\r\nThe choice was taken from her though as Audrey tentatively cracked the door open and slid into the redhead\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said go away\u201d grunted Phoebe again, awkwardly turning her great hips away from her sister and placing the relative remains of cheesecake down so she could aggressively stab into it from her reclined side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...sorry Phoebe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t...wait what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for going off at you like that especially when I\u2019ve been keeping secrets from you all too\u201d sighed Audrey, taking a seat on the corner of Phoebe\u2019s bed.<br>\r\nPhoebe looked a little dumbfounded at this revelation.<br>\r\nAudrey had never apologised to her over something like that before and it was strange to see her older sister be so humble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult remember that you\u2019re not my little little sister anymore and, honestly, I was angry out of concern for you\u201d continued Audrey as a tear rolled down her chubby cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am staying safe Audrey\u201d replied Phoebe, opting to sit up against the headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Ixchel mentioned that after you left\u201d sighed Audrey, scooching a little further onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too\u201d admitted Phoebe as she waved her phone in the air indicating Ixchel had texted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters sat in silence, Phoebe occasionally chipping away at her cheesecake before finally breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoo you and Nat are, like, a couple now?\u201d asked Phoebe, curiosity getting the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019re working things out, it\u2019s all a little complicated\u201d answered Audrey honestly.<br>\r\n\u2018Even more complicated now...\u2019 thought the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe nodded understandingly as she polished off her dessert.<br>\r\n\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d offered the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Audrey off guard, was Phoebe really taking this so well after storming off and refusing to talk at first?<br>\r\n\u201cSure, haven\u2019t eaten for hours\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe wiggles herself to the edge of the bed and opened a low level cupboard, revealing her own personal stash of food as well as vast thighs and the full expanse of her trademark rear been thrust into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Makes sense why Phoebe is still piling on the pounds at least\u2019 thought Audrey, trying not to stare at her sisters cellulite dappled thighs wobbling with each minor movement whilst conveniently glossing over her own accumulated extra poundage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoughnuts work for you?\u201d asked Phoebe with a glance over a strap bitten shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d mused Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe grabbed a dozen doughnuts she had stashed away and laboriously crawled over the bed and heavily dumped her ass next to Audrey, offering the first pastry to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d replied Audrey with a feint smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe returned the smile before biting into her own doughnut, coating her lips and cheeks in sugar.<br>\r\nAn uneasy quiet settled over the sisters as they snacked on doughnuts neither was meant to have whilst silent contemplation over the past few hours sunk in for both girls.</span></div></div>",

So innocent, she doesn\u2019t even know what she\u2019s getting in to\u201d complained Audrey whilst waving her spoon between mouthfuls \u201cunder our roof too\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, just...she\u2019s obviously just doing something for her right now and if it earns a bit of money on the side then is it REALLY that bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey shot daggers at that comment causing Nat to recoil slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t like that idea but Phoebe has always wanted to model and this is giving her that chance\u201d pleaded Nat, trying to remain impartial which was increasingly more difficult as her girlfriend continued to pig out before her \u201cbesides, you can\u2019t be her mother forever\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment struck a chord with Audrey.<br>\r\nEver since she and the girls had moved out and taken on the townhouse she had instinctively taken the role of \u2018Mrs Durant\u2019 without realising.<br>\r\nSure Reagan made jokes to that effect frequently enough but that was just Reagan being Reagan; it was endearing, right?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on babe, this doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing\u201d reassured Nat, grabbing at Audrey\u2019s free hand and smiling as warmly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed.<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose not\u201d relented the blonde, chewing on her lip as she did like the notion pained her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, it\u2019s not so bad\u201d purred Nat, taking the opportunity to slide from her seat and cuddle Audrey in hers.<br>\r\nAudrey relaxed her body into Nat\u2019s, relishing in the warmth emitted from Nat\u2019s chest as she continued to chow on ice cream albeit slower than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I could be wrong but I believe you had a nice night planned for us that never came to fruition\u201d cooed Nat referring to the night that Audrey had surprised her with a purple babydoll that had been cut short rather unceremoniously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u201d grunted Audrey, enthusiasm lacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have a treat that may help take your mind off things\u201d teased Nat, offering her hands to the blonde before pulling her from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno Nat, I\u2019m just hungry and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry darling, there\u2019s PLENTY of food\u201d continued Nat as she led Audrey to the bedroom, kicking the door open with the pad of her foot which caused her modest love handles to wobble ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTa dah!\u201d cheered Nat as she stepped to the side presenting Audrey the dimly light bedroom where a decedent cake sat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d asked Audrey as her eyes adjusted to the muted light, nostrils flaring as vanilla, caramel and chocolate filled her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to do something for my baby and decided to follow your example seeing as the relationship seems to be moving forward so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey turned and wrapped Nat in a huge bosom led hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Nat\u201d whispered Audrey, a warm tear running down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem sweetheart, now let\u2019s enjoy this delightful cake\u201d purred Nat with a playful glance in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh T, I think I\u2019m gonna burst...\u201d groaned Phoebe as she lazily licked her fingers despite her previous statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT?...Tiana?\u201d groaned Phoebe again unable to sit up from the weight of her rock solid belly which ached to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response Phoebe got was the sharp sporadic sound of snoring indicating Tiana had crashed out from her own monumental binge, stretched honey coloured belly swelling with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you girls doing in there?\u201d came a voice from the kitchen, the smell of grease and meat still wafting through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, I think we\u2019re...buurp...we\u2019re done\u201d Phoebe weakly replied, tentatively resting a hand on her belly which angrily pushed back causing Phoebe to pant deeply in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame, just got some racks of ribs out here and they\u2019re only going to go to waste if you don\u2019t eat them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe considered her options.<br>\r\nOn the one hand she was the fullest she had ever been to the point of discomfort and had no real inkling to eat another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand the redhead was sad and ribs made her happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake em extra barbecue and you got a deal\u201d announced Phoebe wishing to herself that the smell wouldn\u2019t wake Tiana so she could have them all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm, that good Aud?\u201d cooed Nat as she sat straddled on Audrey\u2019s thighs, licking her own fingers after feeding the blonde Durant another slice of cake.<br>\r\nAudrey nodded with her mouth full of soft sponge and creamy icing bulging her cheeks as the slice threatened to escape her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d purred Nat, leaning in to Audrey which in turn put a gentle pleasure on the blonde\u2019s bloated gut, eliciting a soft moan from the woman underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you glad we talked tonight now?\u201d asked Nat with a surprisingly pointed question which had Audrey snap out of her trance,

just wanted to...wo...woah!\u201d<br>\r\nNat faltered as Audrey yankee her to the bed in an unexpected show of strength and speed before rolling herself on top, using her weight to pin Nat to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe quiet\u201d whispered Audrey as she blindly reached for a slice of cake, cramming it to Nat\u2019s mouth much to the club owner\u2019s surprise and arousal.<br>\r\nShe wanted to apologise again but instead found herself holding Audrey\u2019s hand to her mouth so that she could eat the cake so roughly presented to her.</span></div></div>",

Phoebe?!\u201d<br>\r\nThe compliment fell on death ears as Phoebe seemed to not even realise the shoot had finished as she had taken over from Tiana\u2019s torrent of feeding, barely registering her friend had dismounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPheebs!\u201d shouted Tiana, a stack of pizza in one hand, as she swaggered back to the huge sofa the two girls had been sharing a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no response as Phoebe softly moaned in her own ecstasy, bending the flimsy foil platter enough to funnel any remaining crumbs of brownie into her waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi piggy\u201d called Tiana again, this time swatting Phoebe sharply on one thigh, causing the flab to ripple where the limb was not in contact with the furniture and eliciting a pitiful welp from the redhead who finally broke from her feeding trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry what?\u201d grunted Phoebe rather dazed as she looked around almost glassy eyed, licking her lips slowly and gripping her belly gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were just getting complimented babe\u201d replied Tiana matter of factly before tearing into more pizza \u201cit\u2019s ok, I took it for you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks I guess\u201d said Phoebe, still rather confused as she rolled onto her hip causing her belly to land heavily against the sofa with a soft thrump, pink stretch marks running around her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u201d continued the director \u201cthe boss wants to see you so you best get decent enough for that conversation\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye aye cap\u2019an\u201d teased Tiana, sweeping up a robe from the side of the set and wrapping it around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d grunted Phoebe once again distracted by food, this time a couple of slices of Tiana\u2019s pizza that had escaped the voluptuous woman\u2019s grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige Lazenby at the tender age of 18 had worked in a strip club to help pay for college which is where her penchant for modelling began to shine with a just curvy enough figure to really take in the tips.<br>\r\nSadly a freshman 15 (or rather freshman 15 three times over) ended her run at her original club but a helpful tip off from a less sleazy ex client sent her to a club more suited to her blossoming physique and well, the rest is history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, sixteen years later, Paige drove a desk as the founder of Gourmand-Size with all the acclaim, comfort and weight that came with that title and the blonde heifer sure knew how to milk it for everything her greedy personality could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an entire coop\u2019s worth of fried chicken to one side and a selection of cakes to the other, the huge woman mindlessly and hoggishly grabbed from each pile and simultaneously crammed meat and cake into her full lips, only interrupted by the knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in\u201d called Paige not stopping the feeding frenzy as Tiana and Phoebe let themselves into the spacious office with their boss pigging out at her desk as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, if it isn\u2019t my favourite girls!\u201d cooed Paige, not stopping eating as the girls took seats opposite \u201cplease help yourselves, the kitchens will keep us fed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh we know boss\u201d purred Tiana as she happily grabbed some chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I want you two to take on something a little special\u201d began Paige, seemingly reluctantly stopping her feast whilst taking the chance to massage her enormous spherical belly which had started to press against her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Tiana, trying to sound interesting as she chewed whilst Phoebe simply pigged out like she wasn\u2019t at a meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u201d beamed Paige as greasy finger trails glistened on her belly \u201cyou\u2019re partnership has been enormous for Gourmand-Size so I want you to do something a little different for your next content run\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had you request content from us, right Pheebs?\u201d asked Tiana, taking a moment to rub her own rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell either way I want you two to play out a little weight gain challenge against each other\u201d announced Paige, leaning back into the desk space in order to grab a plateful or densely filled eclairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, a what now?\u201d asked Tiana, a little confused whilst throwing an elbow into Phoebe in the hopes she would start listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d welped Phoebe again, eyes shooting up from her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA weight gain challenge\u201d reiterated Paige through a mouthful of creamy pastry \u201cyou pick a time scale and the aim is to either gain the most or weigh the most by the end\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we literally just gain weight?\u201d quizzed Tiana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, and keep diaries or film feedings or weigh ins, whatever you two think will really sell for you girls\u201d continued Paige \u201cif the numbers are anything to go by though anything with your name in will be an instant hit\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds awesome!\u201d announced Phoebe after sitting silent for the entire meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then get to it, I wanna see some big numbers by the end of this girls\u201d smiled Paige \u201coh and I will be letting the kitchens know so you can really go to town here too\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Sweet!\u2019 thought Phoebe as the prospect of food clouded her mind more than she realised, idly rubbing her rounded belly as the two models turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think Pheebs, how long do you wanna do this for?\u201d asked Tiana, arching her spine causing her belly to spill further over her already suffering waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, maybe new year?\u201d pondered the red head, still fogged up on the thought of glutting herself completely to her heart\u2019s content with no one able to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo like six months?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah totally\u201d smiled Phoebe, licking her lips again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know, we eat like we can for THAT long and we\u2019ll end up the size of Paige\u201d remarked Tiana, cupping her cellulite dimpled belly hang with a distant but fond look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Wow...\u2019 thought Phoebe as her mind wandered down that garden path a little too deeply as she began to drool at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure, the girls were in for a wild ride for the next six months.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the proposal accepted, Phoebe and Tiana set the groundwork for their weight gaining challenge.<br>\r\nFirstly, it was agreed the challenge would last 6 months meaning their final weigh in would coincide with the new year.<br>\r\nSecondly, never ones to back down from a serious challenge, the girls decided their challenge would be two fold in that the end goal was to have gained the most weight in 6 months AND who weighed the most by the end of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, good luck catching up with this Pheebs\u201d Tiana had teased with a hearty belly slap sending her rolls in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, anything could go as far as tactics employed went. This meant that the girls could meet with fans, spend the days gorging at the studio kitchen, dive into the extensive list of studio partnered eateries across the city...ANYTHING went as long as the end result was pounds on the respective girls figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this of course had been distributed on their respective channels and in the three days since posting had already garnered enormous support, messages of encouragement and even predictions of the end result.<br>\r\nThe general consensus however was that Phoebe and Tiana were going to balloon, especially with the challenge period ending with the holiday season most known for its expanded waistlines even amongst those not deliberately packing on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem\u201d came a gentle cough at the end of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe didn\u2019t even hear the soft sound as she took the last mouthful of breakfast meats, washing it down with a deep chug of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Scuse me\u201d came the voice again, still lost in the background as Phoebe slumped back in her seat taking deep breaths in as she began the long task of digesting her meal that already exceeded what most would eat in a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry miss, are you Phoebe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of her name snapped Phoebe from her thought process and she glanced to the right, finally catching sight of the girl who had been calling out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m Phoebe\u201d forced Phoebe as she attempted to sit herself upright again in the presence of company, with an even more forced smile under the effort of sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, I just...oh don\u2019t sit up, you looked comfy!\u201d<br>\r\nPhoebe didn\u2019t need telling twice.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a REALLY big fan and wanted to say hi\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, Phoebe had girl fans?<br>\r\nPhoebe was well accustomed to having male adoration but having a girl fan was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, well great to meet you\u201d smiled Phoebe as she looked the girl over to see what a girl fan of hers looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding a fraction shorter than herself, the initial look suggested a rather outspoken girl with multicoloured hair, a couple of lip piercings and an alternative fashion sense with a torn up vest, white denim shorts with paint splats and fishnets running the length of her legs.<br>\r\nPhoebe couldn\u2019t help but notice how thin the girl was too.<br>\r\nThe conversation preceding the observation did suggest quite a shy individual though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you too, I\u2019m a huge fan!\u201d the girl blurted giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mentioned that\u201d smiled Phoebe, a hand on her belly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, I did...sorry I\u2019m just so out of my depth here and...hngh\u201d<br>\r\nPhoebe\u2019s new friend seemed to lose all concentration as she took in the redhead\u2019s pose, chewing on one of the studs protruding her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, sit down, I don\u2019t bite\u201d smirked Phoebe feeling a little fame rush herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor sure, just tell me your name\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose\u201d announced the girl with an excitable squeal as she almost threw herself into the seat opposite.<br>\r\nPhoebe meanwhile, called over a waitress and placed herself another order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it was but you just...unlocked something in me and well, here we are\u201d said Rose after a lengthy conversation exchange between herself and Phoebe who was decidedly less committed as she made her way through her second breakfast that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s always nice to meet a fan\u201d replied Phoebe between mouthfuls of food, gluttonous as ever even with company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about earlier too...so embarrassing...I just get excited at the best of times and well, this was a surprise\u201d admitted Rose with a namesake blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve had worse\u201d confessed Phoebe thinking back to the shockingly large number of individuals who had approached her in a far less dignified way than Rose before her, absently rubbing her belly with one hand with the food coming thick and fast with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I bet\u201d responded Rose, distracted again by the show \u201cI think you\u2019ll win by the way\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d grunted Phoebe rather unladylike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Tiana\u2019s weight gain challenge, I think you\u2019ll win\u201d Rose reiterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thanks, me too\u201d responded Phoebe plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you always eat way more in your videos at least, there is no way she can stay ahead\u201d continued Rose, seeming to get a little dreamy as the sentence emerged \u201cif you want any help I\u2019d totally be up for that, I can bake if that\u2019d be cool with you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phoebe could respond, her phone pinged.<br>\r\nDarryl.<br>\r\n\u2018You still coming tonight?\u2019<br>\r\nPhoebe had completely forgotten about their meet up tonight.<br>\r\n\u2018Defo, looking forward to it xxx\u2019<br>\r\nShe barely had chance to put the phone down before getting a response,<br>\r\n\u2018Me too, eat well\u2019<br>\r\nPhoebe smiled to herself as Rose looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything interesting?\u201d asked the multicoloured admirer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh just a thing tonight\u201d replied Phoebe \u201chey, you wanna come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Yes please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Tonight\u2019 was 8 hours later so naturally, with Rose happily in tow, Phoebe spent that time wisely binging as hard as she could.<br>\r\nNo surprises of course when exiting the taxi she and Rose had taken to Darryl\u2019s was quite the chore.<br>\r\nNevertheless, the redhead managed to escape and waddle her merry way to the door and awaited Darryl to let them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you know someone who lives here?\u201d asked Rose in awe as she looked over the vast frontage of Darryl\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s so sweet and always gets me food\u201d purred Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phrasing certainly had Rose imagining a VERY different kind of person than what opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvening Miss Durant, you look positively famished\u201d welcomed Darryl without breaking his facial expression once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, staaaarving\u201d Phoebe played along with less composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou best come in then and the beautiful girl behind you\u201d Darryl announced as he ushered the pair in, giving a small bow to Rose and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose\u201d blushed Rose as she passed Darryl, following Phoebe\u2019s bulging figure through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember what we said for tonight Pheebs?\u201d asked Darryl as he strode past the pair, taking the lead in a different direction from Phoebe\u2019s usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething about a funnel?\u201d asked Phoebe, not entirely sure on what that had to do with food whilst Rose nearly collapsed having done much more internet searching than Phoebe clearly had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one, easiest calories you\u2019ll ever eat girl\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d asked Phoebe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo get comfortable\u201d replied Darryl as he pushed open a door into a plain room with the most inviting arm chair Phoebe had ever seen.<br>\r\nDarryl simply nodded as Phoebe took steps towards the chair and placed herself in the chair which she now noticed was wider than any she had sat in before.<br>\r\nNovel for a chair with arms, her hips didn\u2019t even touch the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is really simple Phoebe, you just have to open your mouth and stick this pipe between your lips\u201d explained Darryl as he sauntered over with said pipe, a funnel attached to the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d said Phoebe hesitantly as she opened her mouth to receive the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now with this\u201d he said, producing a pitcher of sweet smelling thick liquid \u201cyou will consume about 10,000 calories in 10 minutes or so\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe\u2019s eyes grew wide as a smile curled around the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d asked Darryl, pitcher at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe nodded, anticipation making her grip the arms of her chair as Darryl began to pour with Rose looking on in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, 10 minutes passed and Phoebe had chugged the whole pitcher.<br>\r\nAlthough used to alcoholic drinks in such quantities this stuff was completely different in thickness and how much it filled her.<br>\r\nBefore all eyes in the room Phoebe\u2019s belly had swelled outwards to its now comically round state and she was gulping for air between dense sugary burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep drinking like that and you\u2019ll be outweighing Tiana in no time\u201d cooed Darryl as he gently rubbed Phoebe\u2019s taut belly, causing the redhead to moan and belch at the same time.<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough, you might be worth suggesting the two of you do this together some time\u201d winked Darryl as he backed off, leaving Phoebe to her calorie addled state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose meanwhile could barely pull her eyes away as she looked over her favourite model stuffed to the gills.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The redheaded twin's expansive appetite surged even further as Phoebe was encouraged to gain weight for the Gormand-Size challenge with Tiana. She was already becoming a mindless eating machine before the fallout with the thrice embarrassing method Audrey had discovered her BBW modeling and being off her diet, so restrictions from home had dried up as the other Fordham 8422 residents largely gave up on trying to mind Phoebe's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few months Phoebe was getting various sponsorships from her local fans. Nat gave her a free pass at the club the days Phoebe had the energy to stay out late, although the manager didn't make too many appearances given the conflict of being intimate with Audrey. Combined with serious gaining regimens at Darryl's, ramshackle bids from her online subs such as Putz57 and X-Drango, and Rose fawning over Phoebe's needs whenever she was out, the weight was piling on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the social restrictions at home had shriveled up, the physical restrictions remained unchanged. Halfway through the challenge, solidly into autumn at the end of September, Phoebe was on the wrong end of the 360s. Having a weight on par with a calendar year of days, Phoebe was a mammoth of gluttony with her rounded poundage. Her legs were two large pillars of fat, widening to her broad hips and ginormous backside, rolls upon rolls of flabby cellulite that covered her private parts. Added to her huge, stretch mark covered stomach and flabby breasts, Phoebe's girth was an unbelievable sight. Although her half nakedness in the privacy of the townhouse was becoming too frequent of an occurrence to her family's liking. For the girl whose weight had skyrocketed past the typical wardrobe concerns to brushing up against the confines of the house, there was of course little that could cover her full, jiggly rump as it shimmied as Phoebe grunted her way around the townhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez, Phebes!\" Uma, having turned from the back storage after being pressed into a grocery run, had to turn back because there would be no chance in trying to pass Phoebe in the hall. Be it hip or belly first, the pear-shaped redhead had far too much radius in her circumference to allow anybody to pass. Well, especially for her weighty housemates, as while a subtle shift in weights had occurred in the intervening time everyone else was still undeniably fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, are those cheesy puffs?\" Phoebe's eyes lit up, noticing the bulk snack jar Uma had hoped to save for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, have at Phoebe,\" Uma sighed, knowing it was the quickest way to have the youngest housemate vacate the premisses so she could pass. Having her sandwich shop job and semi-regular workouts with Reagan had kept both of them closer to the high 200s, now possibly the \"lightweights\" of the group as Ixchel's increased proximity to Phoebe's eating habits had her catching up towards Audrey and Phoebe in the post-300 club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma watched with mild concern as Phoebe almost wedged herself in the storeroom door to receive the cheesy puffs. With only a pink shirt keeping her upper third covered, Phoebe was a doughy ball of lard where it was difficult to determine if she was wearing bottoms depending on her profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, nope, not today,\" Uma quickly averted her gaze as Phoebe turned, backside crack on full display as it was revealed that she had no underpants or even leggings. Phoebe's apathy at keeping clothed at home was the more troubling aspect for Uma, second only to her enormity that threatened to plug up the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you've got to be freaking kidding me sis!\" Reagan huffed with her hands on substantial hips. Starting to thin out some in the middle, Reagan had lost some but overall not that much weight given the breadth of her juicy, flabby butt and fleshy body. There was now a significant difference in her and Phoebe's girths, as her junior twin was several tens of pounds her senior, having apparently outgrown the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me...erggh, a push Reagan. Pretty please.\" Phoebe was stuck fast into the sliding glass door of the shower, incompatible with the set opening allowed to enter the shower cavity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGawd, Phoebe had soured hanging out with Darryl and now Ragan couldn't escape her at home! After some serious soul searching a few months back, Reagan had curbed her tendency to gain weight so as to not become as pathetic as Phoebe. And she was glad she had. The largest ass in the world was not worth being unable to enter a standing shower! A slave to fighting her hunger and staving off immobility, Reagan was extra cranky in matters to how her fat twin was a dark reflection of where she might have ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know,\" Reagan sighed, in disbelief over being the more rational twin, \"even if we squeeze you in there, how are you going to get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't I be all sudsy and slick after a wash?\" Phoebe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard pass,\" Reagan said, figuring Phoebe would barely be able to turn around in the shower let alone properly bathe. It was bad enough most of her mornings were spent fishing Phoebe's limited clothing options out of her narrow closet, as she had since swelled from the threshold of being unable to fit in her closet. Similarly Phoebe had outgrown her bed, the queen sized twin having serious overhang on what had been an undersized Queen bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd don't even start Reagan on the results of the twins' birthday; long before their chunky years the two brats had been adamant on having their own cakes apiece. With each of them past a quarter-ton, that affair now morphed into full sheet Baskin Robbins ice cream cakes. And yeah, Reagan had gorged on half of hers in one sitting, once she bothered to share with friends, but Phoebe had gone full human vacuum and face-dived into her cake until not a crumb, cream, or lick of frosting was left from the nearly 6lb calorie bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering from the thought, as a similar mess today had brought Phoebe to need an urgent shower, Reagan backed up out of the bathroom despite her sister's cries. \"Wait, don't leave me like this!\" Phoebe pleaded to her heartless twin. \"Reagan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seriously makes that much?\" Audrey asked, amazed when Ixchel told her the amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cousins had taken the lion's share of an asian takeout order to the den in continued talks in what could humorlessly be described as the \"Durant Civil War Accords\" as uneasy peace was soon reached in the household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey, bloated from an extended weekend at Nat's, was quite outsized in the chest and huge belly from fashionable clothes she just managed to still squeeze into. That didn't stop her from putting away most of the savory lo mein dish as Chel informed her of the monetized perks of Phoebe's alternative modeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's lucrative financial gains from this stint,\" Chel said, the brown skinned, moon-faced counterpart to Audrey's own girth as her body had been plumping from increased calories as well. Entering the middle of the runnings, Ixchel was nearing Audrey's size in terms of chest and stomach, although she tended to carry more weight in her arms and extremities. Having her figure balloon slightly from her involvement in recent events, Ixchel had been encouraged to try the other side of the camera but she didn't have the personality or confidence to want to attempt. It was bad enough holding down her main job and trying to mend fences about the townhouse. Frequent dinnertime talks with Audrey had led to this poundage, given the avoidance that now took place between Audrey and Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had gotten to the point where the two most responsible flatmates had reached common ground. Extending to and including sharing of clothes such as the hand-me-down business dress Chel had inherited from Audrey, as their physiques were becoming more similar then the disparity of the blonde and her twin younger sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess if it supports her,\" Audrey said, trying to be accommodating but still singed from the method of discovering how her sister had been involved as an online cam girl and fetish artist. The past year and some months had brought a lot of changes, such as her relationship with Nat and the extent of what was going on behind the prior twin rivalry. Audrey supposed she had to be supportive, although the thought of it still left her overfed stomach in metaphorical knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the stairs made the telltale creak of a elephantine woman making her way down the steps. \"Ooh, is there any kung pao chicken left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey grimaced. At least Phoebe had gotten herself cleaned and dressed today, better than other days. Some overtaxed, yellow and blue swirl leggings just managed to fit over Phoebe's gigantic thighs, although that left plenty of belly roll on display. Changed into a teal shirt, Phoebe looked ready to explode out of her clothes given the added weight she had been pilling on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight had become a taboo subject around Audrey and Phoebe when both were together, even as both continued to tip the scales, given the shame of how it tied to the exposure of their secret lives. At Ixchel's signal Audrey tried to put on an encouraging smile. \"Sure! Good to see you dressed, hon. Got anything special planned today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe took laborious steps, backside quaking as she lined up her position to get some food. Oblivious to the question, Phoebe piled high her plate and made her way towards the sofa, given that Audrey and Chel filled the other chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel realized the danger before it was too late. \"Phoebe, maybe don't sit on the old couch-\" THUMP! Having pushed the limits of how much the old sofa could take for the past few weeks, the furniture imploded under Phoebe's mass as she sat down hard. Startled, Phoebe found herself trapped in the pit of a worn frame and broken springs, pinned by her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey kept her smile plastered, trying to tell herself things were still okay. That didn't stop the next inevitable obstacle from happening...</span></div></div>",

We should go to this place together some time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u201d grunted Reagan as she looked over the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, the food just kept coming and, well, I\u2019m kinda full now\u201d laughed Phoebe as she rubbed her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan was dumbstruck now, how on earth could he sister have got THAT fat.<br>\r\nSo fat that her pyjama shirt was so stretched it barely functioned as a bra and it was impossible to see if she was wearing pants AGAIN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all well and good Pheebs but how are you going to get out\u201d asked Reagan starting to feel hangry now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just work through all this food and then just slide up as normal?\u201d suggested Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be hours, people need to get downstairs\u201d said Reagan, folding her arms which pushed her bloated boobs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm well...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on Red?\u201d came Uma\u2019s voice from the hallway above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww shit\u201d grunted Reagan \u201cPhoebe\u2019s got her ass stuck on the stairs and I can\u2019t get down\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d shouted Uma seeming excited at the prospect of seeing the youngest house member trapped by her own fat.<br>\r\nBefore long the former athlete was stood behind Reagan trying hard not to laugh at the situation before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s real helpful Uma\u201d spat Reagan, looking over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s not that bad...\u201d added Phoebe, still really not seeing the problem as she futilely wiggles her enormous hips which only produced a concerning groan from the banister and no forward movement for the red headed glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk ok, I\u2019ve got some baby oil in my room so just hold up\u201d offered Uma, still trying not to laugh as she turned to her room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Reagan, could you take a picture?\u201d asked Phoebe, fishing in her bra for her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding Phoebe\u201d scowled Reagan as her twin offered her phone up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww please, I\u2019ve never been this full and I do owe them for all he food\u201d pleaded Phoebe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for gods sake...give it here\u201d relented Reagan, snatching the phone and taking some snaps as Phoebe helplessly posed, rubbing her belly, cupping her boobs and throwing in some mock panting, all whilst her girth held her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Pheebs, get your bathing suit coz you\u2019re gonna go slip and sliding\u201d announced Uma, heavily stomping down the stairs with baby oil in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh sounds fun but I\u2019m still stuck Uma\u201d frowned Phoebe, the metaphors lost on her as Uma chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk this might be a little cold but it should get you moving\u201d said Uma as she upended the bottle over Phoebe\u2019s back and let the clear liquid run over her hips and down her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, that is cold\u201d groaned Phoebe \u201cbut it does feel good, take a picture Reagan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are we helping her film a porno Uma?\u201d complained Reagan, really not wanting to promote Phoebe\u2019s online activity as Uma lubed her up to escape the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201d said Uma as she rolled her eyes, shoving her hand down Phoebe\u2019s hip so as to spread the oil around \u201chey, good job on wearing pants Pheebs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d purred Phoebe, moaning under her breath \u201coh yeah, just like that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey missy, you do THAT on your own time\u201d preached Uma \u201cthis is business, now get wiggling\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe groaned as she dropped down onto her hands and started to sway her hips, her belly rubbing against the steps as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not...working\u201d panted Phoebe as she partook in more physical activity than she had in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it is, just pull\u201d urged Uma, taking one of Phoebe\u2019s chubby hands in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so stuck!\u201d groaned Phoebe as she kept wiggling, her hips slipping fractionally past the banister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou moved Pheebs, keep going!\u201d shouted Uma as she tried to pull Phoebe up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...trying...\u201d Phoebe managed to huff, face going red as she gripped on the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little more, keep coming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t...too full...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCREEEEAK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah woah, what was that?\u201d asked Uma with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, she\u2019s nearly out\u201d admitted Reagan from the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRAASNAP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrrrgh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRAAASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit Phoebe, you broke the banister\u201d shrieked Reagan, looking over the wreckage of wood and angry red marks running over her twins huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, Audrey is gonna be mad\u201d said Uma, hiding her snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god...I\u2019m free...feels so good\u201d moaned Phoebe, rubbing her gut suddenly realising the tension she had felt from being trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep now get upstairs and get clean, Audrey REALLY is gonna be mad so...\u201d began Uma<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was THAT?!\u201d asked Reagan in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuchie...\u201d<br>\r\nPhoebe\u2019s foot had gone straight through the weak step and was now stuck up to the thick calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are so fucked...\u201d announced Reagan and Uma at the same time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Business at Parkins &amp; Lobelle had certainly changed the Durant sisters. Phoebe's vivacious and bubbly personality was a natural fit for answering the phones and arranging meetings with clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became a cush job of answering phones, making arrangements, and the like. Work had been a boon for Phoebe. It gave her a newfound purpose, since the accident of her climbing weight had cost her modeling and the frequently partying had stymied her relationships with her twin, Reagan, and Uma. This job was actually the best thing to happen to her! Having integrated herself to the staff, she become their little sister; in terms of age, not size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as if the law office was against obesity but it was clear who among the staff were the weightiest. The Durant sisters were becoming quite fat. Audrey, forever a plus size, had been getting very rounded in the breasts and stomach, while Phoebe continued to redefine the term of bottom heavy genes when the weight of their massive home meals settled in her rear. The sisters proportions were salvaged by an impeccable fashion sense, with Phoebe's eye for style and Audrey's sensibilities outfitting the businesswomen with the best office attire +Size had to offer with their combined paychecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice it to say, while they were growing at the company they were also <i>growing</i>, which soon led to some new problems for the Durant sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smarties and Starbursts again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outburst was from Ms. Parkins, senior lawyer of the agency, aghast at the selection in the lobby candy bowl. Parkins &amp; Lobelle was not the largest office by any means, the lobby was only a few chairs by the reception desk, yet is was a highly successful office that wanted to showcase an air of classiness and plenty of comforts for both its personnel and clientele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the trouble, boss?\" Phoebe Durant piped up from the receptionist's desk, sporting a purple pair of designer glasses with accentuating lavender and grey blouse/skirt outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheap fruit chews and chalky tablets! Who keeps buying these low quality candies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I saw Denise fill the bowl last.\" Phoebe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Parkins frowned. \"Our quality of edibles has taken a nosedive.\" There had been a lack of variety in the company vittles over the last few weeks, from sorry looking doughnuts to untouched cans of that flavor of juice nobody liked. Even the fruit bowl in the break room only amounted to bananas these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should Audrey and I bring some new candy tomorrow?\" Phoebe earnestly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could, although don't go overboard with it; we just need some higher quality sweets.\" Ms. Parkins kept a long look at the firm's newest hire with a hint of suspicion. While pretty with cherubic features, Phoebe Durant was very overweight and seemingly getting bigger week by week. It was Ms. Parkins' business as a lawyer to be inquisitive yet not without the proper evidence. Nothing yet proved that the Durant sisters were getting fat on the company dime, although their frequently discussion of what to have for dinner once they were home was a mite distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, did you want your lunch meeting rescheduled for the 8th?\" Phoebe asked, oblivious to her boss's suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you Phoebe,\" Ms. Parkins said, returning her thoughts to the present. \"And do let me know when my 2 o'clock has arrived. There's a lucrative deal to be had taking this construction firm as a new client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And dispose of this tosh,\" Ms. Parkins left the inferior candy bowl at Phoebe's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe watched her boss leave. Given her base appetites, her method of disposing the remaining treats was not the way Ms. Parkins had intended. What could a few treats more hurt? What with Phoebe having already cleaned out the candy bowl of the better sweets earlier, spent wrappers hidden in her shredding bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like her sister before her, Phoebe picked up on keeping her snacking at work hidden. With two voracious Durant appetites at the office anything tasty rarely lasted for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want this file for the indictment in triplicate,\" Ms. Lobelle, the junior law partner, instructed to her chief paralegals in a midday meeting. \"Judge Conroy is a stickler for documentation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStewart, the sole male of the office, was chief paralegal and had helped Audrey Durant learn everything she needed to know. They were two of the best assistants in the office, although the case load taken on by Parkins &amp; Lobelle was considerable. Typically, this wouldn't be that much of a problem even with the small staff, although there had been unexpected snags occurring over the last few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, shouldn't I update the indexing of our associated files?\" Stewart asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be smart for the proceedings,\" Ms. Lobelle replied. \"I had Denise prepare the files already. Sorry this had to delay lunch. But we should be able to work quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch pow-wows were common in the course of a day at Parkins &amp; Lobelle. As the junior partner worked on her legal preparations her paralegals were there to assist her and handle minutia in the bureaucratic cogs of the legal system. Ms. Lobelle was generous, providing a sandwich tray for the impromptu business lunch, as the trio of Ms. Lobelle, Stewart and Audrey sat down to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Audrey, while the roast beef subs, chips, and pickle spears were tasty for lunch, her rate of consumption of late made the offerings a paltry drop in the bucket. Today the blonde sported a light pink blouse with a pencil skirt, although 'pencil' no longer applied to her body shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking on autopilot, Audrey was fantasizing on what she might have ordered for lunch. While pasta may not have been appropriate, there was an excellent Italian place not far from the office. Which was two doors from the Thai place. Or the fanstastic food truck that would park nearby with the best fish and chips Although if she had to keep to to sandwiches, she would have upgraded to a party platter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStewart's sudden outburst changed the tone of the meeting considerably, rousing Ms. Lobelle and Audrey to attention. \"What's wrong?\" asked their boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These pages are stuck together! This is a critical file.\" Mysteriously, most of the document was stuck together with amber stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lobelle blanched. \"Can't we salvage any of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tearing paper was absolute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a setback that would put them days behind and further increase the workload. As Ms. Lobelle and Stewart tried to determine what had caused this issue, Audrey stayed mum as she recalled having prepared that file days ago when she and Phoebe had taken breakfast at their favorite dinner before getting into work. And they had been too liberal with the syrup on their pancakes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the crash from the front of the office occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only popping smarties in your mouth actually made you smarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded Durant twin had the thought as she finished of the last packet of smarties. Sure, she could easily pass for the look of an intellectual, and was overall making more mature decisions, but her prospects at the law office wouldn't be ones of advancement. Having gotten a handle on reception work, Phoebe couldn't hold a candle to what the paralegals had to do. Some of the notation and legalese of the documents her sister and the others processed was mind-numbing to Phoebe. Like when Audrey had to prep a document when they had last had pancakes at the dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I'm here for a two o'clock appointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoused from her munching, Phoebe looked up to greet the man to enter the office. And have her mouth left agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ms. Parkins had said she was expecting a new client from a construction firm, Phoebe wasn't sure what type of person that would be. So many people coming to Parkins &amp; Lobelle wore suits. She had not expected a man dressed so casually in plaid and denim. Or such a hunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho Phoebe was looking at was Matthew Robbero, headliner of a budding construction firm making quite the waves as a new business. Matthew had quite the business acumen but also worked the construction himself with the rest of the crew. Making him well tanned and muscled, with the slight unshaven scruff, and Phoebe was ogling every fiber of his being. He was so young too! He couldn't be that much older than her or her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, yes!\" Phoebe found her composure. \"Ms. Parkins' new client, let me just get her.\" Phoebe rose from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to find that she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlummoxed, Phoebe tried to lift herself again. There's was more weight than she was used to lifting. And the pinching of her bum lead to a horrifying realization. Phoebe had been oblivious to how snug her office chair was getting the last several days. Her butt was so expansive, soaking up most of the calories she ate, that it continued to be her most prominent feature. It was less a butt and more a behemoth and now Phoebe was stuck fast in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, do you need help?\" Matthew asked, watching Phoebe struggle to extract herself by pressing down on the armrests of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've got it,\" Phoebe said, horrified that she was ruining her first impression with such a hunk. Finally she got to her feet! With the chair still iron locked to her massive buttcheeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Losing her balance trying to exit the desk, Phoebe collapsed the the floor, taking a flower vase off a side table with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash attracted the rest of the office, both lawyers and Audrey, who immediately rushed to help her sister. \"Phoebe!\" The huge blonde bent to help her sister with her predicament. And for the second time that day heard an unfortunate rip. Audrey's own backside had been pilling on the pounds, and she had neglected how tight her skirt was getting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ixchel Park needed to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her family, that is. When Nancine Durant, anthropologist, had married Che Park, community event organizer, they had had gifted children. Ixchel was one of them and had been encouraged all her life to embrace her heritage. Her mother delighted not only by educating the youngest generation of Parks about her background but also the intertwining lineages of Che\u2019s family, Mexican plantation owners and Korean royal chefs, if you traced the lines back far enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor young Ixchel it had been overwhelming. It wasn\u2019t that she hated her heritage but the lessons her family taught were not ones that were easy to describe to the other kids at school. Ones that bombarded her with endless questions, poked fun at her skin, name or physique and the other myriad ways kids could be cruel. While her cultural heritage was rich indeed Ixchel was unlucky enough to be the worst off compared to the branches of her family in the genetic department. A predisposition to obesity thanks to a Mexican market oversaturated with processed foods for generations and her rounded Korean phenotype had left her struggling with her weight ever since she was a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel marshaled through family events as best she could. She was always a studious child and when left to her own devices she took an interest in math, science, and fantasy literature. She blended her loves the way her own bloodlines had been blended, becoming a full on nerd as she matured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t dislike large crowds; after all, there where numerous Parks and the family\u2019s offshoots and distant connections before you even got to the integrating families that home life was never quiet. Ixchel much preferred the company of other people who could understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that\u2019s why, years later, Ixchel found herself living with her favorite cousins. Unlike the rest of Ixchel\u2019s relations the Durant daughters of her mother\u2019s brother had never judged her harshly. Audrey, Reagan and Phoebe were the closest to Ixchel in age compared to the first, second and third cousins Ixchel had to remember names for during family gatherings. The four of them had a lot more fun together as kids than Ixchel could honestly say about those who were more closely related to her by blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was her parents conscious decision or not, Ixchel did not carry the same sensibilities being of the modern generation. She appreciated Audrey defending her whenever she got too shy, for the twins providing the right amount of friendship and naughtiness to broaden Ixchel\u2019s horizons in a new direction. She looked forward to their visits the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome college, Ixchel had fast-tracked herself into computer programming. She also had an interest in the medical field, graduating early and landing a well paid position with a medical technologies company. She was set up with everything but the right living situation, so when she heard that her cousins were looking to share the rent on a townhouse in a major city Ixchel moved in with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townhouse soon became cramped with the addition of a fifth roommate, Audrey\u2019s college friend Uma Ferro, but that was nothing new to Ixchel. Being one of five occupants was much more of a breeze compared to life back home. She had converted one of the rooms into her programming den/office, being able to work remotely from home for 97% of her work schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Ixchel was taking a break from some long hours preparing the new heart monitor matrix update for the company\u2019s newest medical app. For someone as loosely connected to the medical field as Ixchel was she had been trying to keep her propensity towards being overweight under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could stand with losing twenty pounds but she ate healthy. While she hadn\u2019t originally liked her inherited culinary education from her household she had to admit that knowing how to cook helped her as an adult. She had almost put thought into setting up a culinary app but she thought the market was already flooded with the software. The other residents of 8422 Fordham Ave liked it when she cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel leaned back in her ergonomic chair. Her hair was a deep dark brown and rather long. Her skin was a rich umber and she tended to tan easily. She was wearing a purple dress and a black long sleeved top. Her excess weight left her rather pudgy looking. Her hours and hobbies kept her from really optimizing her diet. When she wasn\u2019t coding or bookkeeping Ixchel liked to play video games, watch anime or listen to her favorite K-pop bands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept a hot thermos of spiced horchata by her desk when she was craving something sweet. Given the traditions of her two cultural cuisines Ixchel liked spicy food. Few ever took to spicy chocolate but that was one of Ixchel\u2019s favorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, she had acceptance from others her own age at the townhouse along with their emotional support, while still having the freedom to breathe unlike the obligation that had almost smothered her as a child. Living at the townhouse was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings at 8422 Fordham Ave never tended to stay quiet for long and Ixchel could never escape it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ixchel had grown used to a certain pattern to her day at 8422 Fordham Ave. She was one of the rare early risers, having a quick check of the morning\u2019s data compiling, stock reports and some morning news while she tried to keep a healthy breakfast. Most of her work was broken into multi-hour segments over the course of the day. She gave herself the time to cook something or walk down to the dining district for lunch before logging back on in the afternoon. Unless she was on call for troubleshooting, which anchored her to the house the whole day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had Saturdays and Sunday mornings off, with another flexible half day of time off she could use any point of the week she needed to, except for being on call. It gave her a brief bit of time to hang out with the other girls or finish some IRL chores before she was back to coding and software maintainence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel made Tuesdays her movie night and she often did streams on Thursday and Saturday nights. The squat little office in the townhouse wasn\u2019t soundproof, as the sounds of her other roommates going about could distract her from work, although in those instances Ixchel would blast her K-Pop on full tilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of her life was dedicated to work or gaming. It was a convienant, straightforward schedule that gave her all she wanted for socializing and being out in the world. It was a sustainable routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis complacency, however, spelled Ixchel\u2019s downfall whenever she was thrust outside her comfort zone. Such as a major break to her routine that fell in her thick lap out of the blue in the middle of the week.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Thursday night streaming and Ixchel had gone back to something of an oldie but one of her favorites: Skyrim. She had started a new play through for the stream a few weeks back because it was something familiar enough to use to fill content, as her work life was getting hectic and her roommates were being especially loud. Ixchel had easily sunk hundreds of hours into the game over the course of her life so it was easier to have commentary over it and enjoy something to unwind with after a long week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was primed to be perfect. Ixchel had cleared out her workload and most of the townhouse was empty as Audrey, Phoebe and Uma had gone off to catch a basketball game. Plenty of open time to relax with a favorite game and her stream crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel had made herself a new Khajiit character, a fantasy feline race, and had made steady progress through her past streams on a mixed faction run. Pure vanilla, which was something of a rarity in streams of Skyrim, as most people showed off ridiculous mods but Ixchel's classic approach had found a dedicated, if small niche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel had cobbled together an impressive array of tech for her budget, after accounting for rent, but she had an eye for quality with her electronics. Her mic had cost her a pretty penny but it was worth the improved audio quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at the College,\" Ixchel narrated, as she returned to Winterhold, the location of a school of magic, wanting to inform new viewers, \"there is a glitch that can be pulled off using the black market, it's really hard to pull off but if I had set it up, I could have gotten --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>CLICK!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a hard click and the dying fizzle of electronics, realization hit Ixchel as she found herself in the dark. \"No. No! NO NO NO NO NO!!!\" Her frantic key strokes did nothing. Her rig, the fan, the lights, everything was without power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>THUMP!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Ixchel swore, losing all composure as she lost her bearings and slammed her knee trying to get out from her computer desk. She fumbled over to the wall switch, which provided only further proof of the power outage. How could this have happened? She was on her favorite quest line! She hadn't saved in forty minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chel, you up there?\" A muffled call came from outside the door. Ixchel patted around for the doorknob. When she opened it the beam of a flashlight assaulted her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Reagan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" the rambunctious twin lowered the light. \"Although don't go blaming me for this. I checked outside too, the whole damn block is dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Just great,\" Ixchel seethed. There would be no recovering her stream now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have your equipment fry, in the middle of your fantasy quest?\" Reagan teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it,\" Ixchel snarled, in a rare bad mood given how her stream had been interrupted by the power outage. \"Why don't you be useful and come help me with the fuse box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way down to the utility closet in the basement, the two roommates spent several fruitless minutes with the fusebox. \"Told you,\" Reagan shook her head. \"Whole damn street. The only power we've got is our phones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel sighed. \"The others won't like to hear about this when they get back. Did it effect their game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan looked up from her phone. \"Doesn't look like it, the grid's only out in our neighborhood.\" The tone of her voice turned from frustration to mock horror. \"Shit, the jello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" And then Ixchel remembered. Win or lose, the rest were going to come back that night and celebrate with a team colored jello mold Audrey had set up before the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way back up to the the ground floor in the dark, Reagan shone her flashlight into the dead fridge. Ixchel picked up the bowl and curiously peered into its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan whistled. \"Well, that didn't finish setting up.\" The colors had blurred together as the gelatin remained a mostly liquid slurry. She turned the light back to the fridge. \"Most of this stuff is going to go bad if the power outage keeps up. Imma going to find some candles, Audrey has those flowery ones in the towel cabinet.\" The scented bath candles disgusted Reagan but they were the only available light sources in the townhouse at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are going to be so pissed with the landlady,\" Reagan said as she came back with lowlight wicks on juniper candles, only to find Ixchell seated at the breakfast nook with a gravy ladle into the jello. \"What happened to waiting for everybody else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw it, the jello was already ruined,\" Ixchel said darkly. Healthy lifestyles be damned, she was so crushed on how the power outage had ruined her stream that she needed to find solace, and the only source of that was the inoperable fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of this will last anyways,\" Reagan shrugged, deciding to join Ixchel for a bite as she poked at a box of leftover stirfry.</span></div></div>",

And who could blame her? Maintaining a townhouse wasn't exactly the cheapest of endeavors, and Ixchel's med-tech job did more than its fair share of keeping the lights on and the fridge fully stocked. In a place like this, where Audrey seemed to be the only one <i>capable</i> of holding down a full-time job, Chel could understand just why her paycheck was so important to her cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only for a little while, okay?\" she said calmly, lowering her hands in a (hopefully) calming fashion, \"I'm still gonna send you some money every month to help out around here. But I'm making a <i>lot</i> of money from this project, and I can't really afford to say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey honestly looked like she might break out into tears. Not because of any familial connection between them (despite them being cousins, Chel had always been closer to Phoebe and Reagan) but because of the fact that her paycheck meant <i>so much</i> to the townhouse. There was no way that they'd be able to get by without it. At least, not unless a certain freeloader started pulling her weight. And for that matter, the young ones too\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, why did this have to happen <i>now</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm just as stressed out about it as you are.\" Ixchel said in a calm, professional manner. The same tone that her bosses had taken with her. And presumably, the ones that their bosses had taken with them. \"I'm gonna be sending back about half as much as I have been for my part of the rent. Hopefully that makes a difference, since you're not feeding me and the lights will all be off in my room, but you might want to start cracking the whip around here, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like a breakup. Like some family member had suddenly died, and now Audrey was a frontier woman, trying to live on her own in the harsh and forgiving world. For so long, Ixchel's medical technician's paycheck had meant that they household could afford to skirt by (not really, but it had helped!) and now that it was getting kneecapped, the designated worry-wart of the group seemed to be the only one concerned about where the money was going to come from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need someone who speaks Spanish, and they need me on-site.\" Ixchel explained in her best \"please don't shoot yourself\" tone of voice, \"I'm only going to be gone for as long as my contract holds. It's <i>going</i> to be oka\u2014please, stop crying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chel had been offered the position, she could hardly believe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer job was hardly glamorous to begin with, clicking and clacking away on her keyboard. But when her boss had approached her for the Huevo Mundo project, she had barely been able to withhold her excitement. And that high feeling had lasted as long as her boss further stating that she would be assigned Lead Technician, and therefore responsible for the entirely Hispanic staff located in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it a little racist that she was being selected for the job? Sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time... this was a payment opportunity that she couldn't afford to turn down. Literally. They offered to pay off her student debt <i>in its entirety</i>. Opportunities like this didn't come around very often. Chel would have been stupid not to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Plus</i> it was still far away enough from her family that she didn't have to go see them for the holidays. So really, it was the best of both worlds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll joking aside, Chel still hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMexican servers did <i>not</i> offer her the high speed connections that she needed for gaming. The lab techs were rude, and treaded her like they would any other American. She was housed in a <i>dinky</i> apartment on the company's dime, and everything around her was shit. She fucking <i>hated</i> Mexico. Holiday visits to her Tita's had taught her that from a young age, but it was really living through the constant power outages, the pollution, and the incessant insistence on in-person banking that reminded her why she'd hated visiting relatives for the holidays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had only paid <i>less</i> attention to her dad. Then maybe she wouldn't have known so much goddamn Spanish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Chel persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, it was easy to hold strong when your contract was only for...</span></div></div>",

Excluding when Super Nintendo World got built in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she would be fitting in many rides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, it wasn't as if her paperwork was out of order. She had her passport and her work visa was clearly laid out. She'd had limited chances to make day trips into El Paso or New Mexico because Texas was literally right there over the river. If the development team had placed more emphasis on their actual jobs rather than an excuse to party over the border Chel would not have found herself in this exact situation with alarming reoccurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, working in Mexico for only a year left little reason to have her passport updated. And while Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez had a decrease in crime that had attracted business opportunities like the venture that Chel had been on, the state of vittles had not improved. Mexico frequently towed the line with the USA for obesity rates, For the doughy mixed race programmer, with an already sedentary job and an increased case of stress, it had nearly been a death sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course she now had eyebrows raised at every security checkpoint when her identification said she was supposed to be around <b>a hundred and ten pounds</b> lighter. Compared to the little picture in her passport, Chel's belly had broadened considerably, a rolling ball of fat now in two rolls, with her breasts not too far behind. She forced herself to wear one of the cheap brassieres she'd needed in a pinch, desperate for American delicates to help with her added jugs. It didn't help that her rump and hips had rounded out as well, her thighs fleshy and packed with cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Ixchel had access to her guilty pleasures with real Mexican cuisine, but also the junk made for tourists and a lack of organic, health options she usually had at home to help curb her weight. They put sugar in everything over here! The brief border crossings over the past year punctuated reminders of just how fat she had gotten at each stage of her weight gain. Another \"highlight\" to a dismal year she didn't need. Video calls with the girls of 8422 Fordham Ave had become sparse as of late, limited to only the neck up, so only her growing double chin was commented on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while she had done her best to avoid family, that didn't stop one branch from finding her out and forcing an extended weeklong visit over Mexico's Independence day that had been a week heavy on the red beans and chalupas. Everyone on the data team teased her about her increasingly zaftig figure as well. She'd had to stand the ridicule of getting called \"chinita\" because of her vaguely Asian looks, no matter the number of times she'd insisted the other half of her genetics came from South Korea, not China!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the potshots of \"chinita gordita\" followed not long after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, the impact on her health and diet had been horrible, what with Chel being just several inches from needing to purchase a second seat for herself on the plane if her hips accumulated any more fat cells. She missed home, she missed the girls, and she missed her gaming group. And if she was destined to be a fat slob, let it be at a place with a higher quality foodstuff (well, relatively speaking) and on-demand streaming that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Land of the free, home of the brave, apple pie and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, if only she was more fluent with her Korean, she fancied she would have preferred a year abroad working out of that satellite office. Although her foodie tendencies may not have necessarily left her that much smaller...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the immediacy of her travels, the agent regain his composure. \"Anything to declare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel would have told him that she had nothing to declare besides the fact she was desperate for a new wardrobe, what with a suitcase stuffed with her formerly fitting clothes and a hastily required wardrobe, being too practical and sentimental to see her old clothes go to waste, maybe of some of the other girls could use them, although fuck import costs she'd just wait until she flew back home, because of how she'd gained over a hundred pounds in a years time of fruitless work, leaving her to travel through the airport in a floral print mumu and sneakers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she could have said all that but she didn't want to be seen as a basket case nor detained further. So she only brought up the souvenirs and a snack she was finishing as she adjusted her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally passed that checkpoint, the newly 270lb + Ixchel waddled towards the last chance to grab a coffee and pastry, even though she had promised herself to hold out until her exchange, because darn it she was tired of all the looks at the disparity of her increased poundage, she was tired of standing and above all else, she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel bit her lip, unsure of what the full effect of her tipping the scales from sorta chubby to really fat would have on her Durant cousins, or Uma. That would be for later, of course...</span></div></div>",

Ixchel could hear their shouting before she opened her door, and getting the full volume echoing up from the living room set her nerves on edge after an extended week of coding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Ixchel returned to her room that doubled as her office and gaming center. So much for suggesting a friendly game on the Playstation or going out to see a movie. Uma was off on a jog and bouts between the Durant sisters could take up an inordinate amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel stooped down to open her mini fridge to see what she had to eat, not wanting to risk getting dragged into the argument on a trip to the kitchen. The small fridge didn't have much, a few bottles of kombucha and energy drink, hummus, cheese snacks and other dip. Luckily, Ixchel had some crackers up in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, forgot about these,\" Ixchel noticed that also in her closet was a partially opened bag of chocolate truffles, the cheap kind easily picked up on sale over the holidays. Holding her bounty to her bosom, Ixchel began arranging snacks by her workstation as she brought up her Steam account, not feeling in the mood to stream but wanting to distract her mind with some games she hadn't played in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were lost in a haze of Ixchel's impromptu gaming marathon, with dragons beaten, traps dodged, hospitals infiltrated, coasters designed and haunted asylums explored. All the while Ixchel continuously grazed on her snacks and drinks, forgetting how much she had eaten and nearly emptying her limited foods in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that was my last kombucha?\" Ixchel said, some time later, having paused her game to realize her fridge was empty. The break in sounds from her battle royale streak was enough to draw her attention to pinging alerts on her social chat platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Obsidian54:</b> Yo Chel, open up!<br>\r\n<b>Obsidian54:</b> The guys are here, did you %#$&amp;-ing forget you're hosting this week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the friend tag and time, Ixchel's eyes grew wide. \"Oh no!\" It was her gaming group, and she had complete forgot to set up for D&amp;D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a weight in her stomach she didn't expect, having mindlessly cleaned out her snacks, Ixchel stumbled a bit extracting herself from her computer to go downstairs to let in her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Chel,\" Audrey said as Ixchel crossed to the front door. \"I could really use your help with dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, um,\" Ixchel replied, flustered. \"I've already got a previous commitment. It's game group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those nerds\" Reagan said, aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey elbowed her. \"Be nice, you and Uma have some odd friends yourselves.\" Catching herself, Audrey tried to backpedal. \"I didn't mean your friends are weird, Ixchel, they're just...different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to feel her face flush, Ixchel opened the front door where her gaming group was waiting. \"Hey Obie! Wong! Jenson. Sorry I forgot about the game tonight. Let's set up in the den.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, typical.\" Obie, short for Obsidian, and shorter than most everyone else, thrust a case of craft soda into Ixchel's hands. With dark hair, eyes and freckles on her pale skin, Obsidian had quite the different look compared to Ixchel. And that went without highlighting her most noticeable feature, a pair of large breasts stretching the logo of her metal band shirt. \"The guyz brought pizza, it'll get cold thoon tho hurry it up.\" Obie's distinctive raspy voice was due to oversized front teeth, as she talked with a lisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ixchel!\" Wong said, two pizza boxes in his hand. Wong was something of a chubby guy himself, with glasses almost as thick as Ixchel's and wearing a loud Hiwaiian shirt and khaki shorts, owing to his Asian-Pacific heritage. He greeted the other residents of the townhouse clustered in the kitchen. \"Ladies, excuse us, we've got a raid on a heavily fortified fortress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sounds fun,\" Audrey said, trying to be polite but not really getting the point of their meet-ups. \"Have fun then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding out the gaming group was ironically it's thinest member, owing to Ixchel and Wong's doughy physiques and Obie's stocky voluptuous build. Jenson was a tall, rail of a man with nebbish looks and a large nose, carrying source books, a case of miniatures, and several rolled up maps. He muttered a dry hello before following the others downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, nerds,\" Reagan said when they were out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice,\" Audrey hissed. \"Ixchel can have friends other than us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the den, Ixchel and crew heard the grunts of Uma working on a set of sit-ups. \"Hey, Uma, sorry to interrupt,\" Ixchel said needily, \"but we need to set up here, it's the most space in the townhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*phew!*\" Uma stood to her full height, glistening with sweat and workout clothes leaving her toned, fit body on display. \"K, ok, I can see where I'm not wanted,\" she rolled her eyes, grabbing a towel as she needed to shower anyways. \"You guys do what you do.\" She sashayed her way out, catching the eye of the men and giving them a knowing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pigth,\" Obsidian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now,\" Wong said, mock taken aback, \"there's beauty within the female form that can be appreciated by all, and many have it different ways. You and Ixchel got your own brand of hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pleaze,\" Obsidian said, knocking onto Wong's shoulder with a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how about we just get ready and play,\" Ixchel said, growing more embarrassed although that soon diminished with her gaming friends gearing up for another adventure. They'd met early on in college and had been playing tabletop and video games since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zides, pizza'th getting cold,\" Obsidian said, chomping into a slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special six and BBQ chicken,\" Wong said, passing out slices on paper plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe I shouldn't,\" Ixchel started, already feeling full from the snacks she had grazed on all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, Jenson's got us up against the Prince of the 13 Pits of Hell,\" Wong said excitedly, pushing a plate Ixchel's direction, \"so I also brought the chips and onion dip. We need fuel for such a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning despite herself, Ixchel took the plate as everyone settled into character for the game. She put on her cat ears for her Tabaxi rogue, Obie belched after a soda just like her Amazonia barbarian after ale, and Wong's Elven warlock shared his giddy outlook, in contrast to his horrifying eldritch master. Jenson, not one to talk much in other areas of life, oddly was a good fit for Dungeon Master as he came up with elaborate plots detailed in short, sometimes dry but straight to the point descriptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, this is fun!\" Ixchel said an hour into the adventure, on her third slice of pizza. \"We're trying to destroy a demonic monolith empowering a legion of devils and hold back the flow of molten steel from the armories! I don't know why I can't get any of the girls into this, I think they'd have so much fun. They were arguing a lot today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zave it for meatzphere, not the game,\" Obsidian said, drinking out the last of craft soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they do for fun?\" Wong asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Uma's always working out but she's jobless, the twins have college and Audrey works the most next to me,\" Ixchel said, chewing. \"And if they aren't watching TV or vapid programming they tend to get on each other's nerves a lot. I dunno. I miss when me and my cousins were younger and would play the N64 and board games. I wish they would try something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" Jenson cut in dryly. \"The two-headed ogre bursts its way through the locked door, a swarm of imps behind him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" Ixchel cried, \"I thought I tied him up back in the gatehouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna chop itz headth off!\" Obsidian yelled, rolling for the axe attack.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week later, Ixchel made her way up the apartment steps of Wong's third-floor flat for another DnD session. Her week had been busy with modifying some company software, she even had to be onsite for two days, so Ixchel was frazzled for her memory and Jenson's campaign was the only relief. She had completely forgot what each of them were surprised to bring, so along with her tabletop gear she carried an offering of taquitos in a covered dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chel, great to see ya!\" Wong answered the door, shirt as loud as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel smiled, then caught a pleasant scent in the air. \"Is that Chinese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Wong grinned. \"Family set me up with some leftovers after a catering deal fell through. Plenty to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Ixchel frowned, feeling like she did too much in bringing taquitos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWong's four room and bath apartment was more cramped than the levels of the townhouse at 8422 Fordham, with Ixchel and the host brushing past the kitchenette to the living room where Jenson and Obsidian had already set up by the window. Half of his glass coffee table was covered with the game map and Jenson's DM screen, while the other was filled with a small feast of lo mein, kung pao chicken, mushu pork, fried rice and tofu soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Ixchel said, \"that's quite the spread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Living above your family's restaurant has it's perks on occasion,\" he grinned. \"Although what did you bring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taquitos, which I guess doesn't fit--\" Ixchel began before she was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zit 'em here,\" Obsidian said, pushing some cartons aside as she brought a box of lo mein to her lips. \"I had brought chipth and brewzkith.\" Obie was sitting on the floor to be closer to the food, flanked by a big bag of pickle chips and a few boxes of craft soda and iced coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel paused after a thought. \"Wait, that's your family's restaurant downstairs?\" She asked Wong, confused as she crossed in front of the join on her way to the apartment entrance. \"Wang's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWong chuckled. \"My aunt and uncle's, the distinctly more Chinese branch of the family. So yes, the Wongs and Wangs are related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeth, ith hot in here,\" Obie complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comes with the territory,\" Wong said as he got everyone plates, except for Obie who continued to eat out of the box. Although he was a few floors up it was the apartments tight insulated walls and preset air conditions that kept the apartment warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of hot,\" Jenson spoke, \"more furnaces in the devilish armory have come to life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeezth,\" Obie said as she set up her dice, \"hot in here and the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel had to admit it was warmer than she had liked but the game and time with friends soon distracted her. Plus, there was plenty to eat with what with her taquitos, Obie's snacks, and Wong's discount Asian food. As the campaign continued everyone would take something to eat from the offers. Jenson only had so much and eventually Wong stopped. But for the latter half of the session Ixchel and Obsidian continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lava pools around the edges of this crater,\" Jenson intoned later in the adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cripeth!\" Obie cried out, the steamy heat of the apartment and fiery environs of the game ultimately getting to her. \"I'm zick of thith zhit, when do we break into the frozen over Zeventh Circle of Hel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenson readdressed the layout of the 13 pits as Ixchel and Wong adjusted their seats along the couch. Ixchel, used to warmer climates, did remove one layer of clothing to a tank top that left little to the imagination. Having both chips, craft brew, and Chinese her stomach was feeling quite bloated, and her chest began to rise with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freckled, lisping Obsidian had a remarkably different issue of heat. Whereas Ixchel felt more of a warmth in her stomach from digestion, Obie had her great mammaries as a source of heat on her body. And while everyone wisely said nothing, they could tell that Obie wore only the one shirt so she had no articles of clothing to remove short of stripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I pop out for ice cream?\" Wong suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zpectacular!\" Obsidian said, reaching inside her shirt as she fumbled with her bra. With a might 'PLOP!' she released her overdeveloped chest from the confines as they squashed onto Wong's glass top table where she sat. \"None of you zay anything!\" she warned. Ixchel popped one last taquito in her mouth, Wong excused himself to fetch the frozen treats, and Jenson of course said little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, I am beat!\" Ixchel said at the end of another long week when she made it to Jenson's house for the DnD. Jenson lived in a converted single story home that used to be a college fraternity house until extensive storm damage had destroyed the upper floors. It was quaint and structurally sound yet creaky in odd places and carried with it a lifetime of various improvements, so Jenson usually preferred to host the game at other people's places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not only is it game night it's BBQ season!\" Wong said excitedly, saying each letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Ixchel replied. \"I've got my famous korean beef bowl.\" She proudly showed off the meal she had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've got the spareribs!\" Wong said, \"And Jenson's gonna have a delivery from that smokehouse down the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I gotth zideth, an' a can whoop-asth for theze ztupid orcth!\" Obsidian cried, vehementantly focused on the events of the game as ever. Her definition of sides looked suspiciously like a sampling of materials from KFC, only the chicken was from a spicy wing joint instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry the heater isn't working,\" Jenson said, as his home had the the opposite problem of Wong's the previous week, as everyone was dressed for the chill. Even Ixchel and Obie had opted for light jackets, making their respective chests look even more puffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Ixchel said, \"I can wear my cat mitts early!\" Along with her ears were mittens that looked like cat paws, to fit with her tabaxi rogue character, although she kept one hand bare to dish out foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're starting to turn these sessions into potlucks, aren't we?\" Wong noted, as the spread this week was as impressive if not more so than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhut-up,\" Obie said with her mouth full as she readied her dice, \"Orc zlaying time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thith zuckth zo much,\" Obsidian glowered a week later as the gang gathered again for DnD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other inhabitants of Fordham 8422 were caught off guard by the reappearance of Ixchel's friends. \"What gives?\" Reagan said, \"I thought you guys only met once a month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The landlady'th fumigating the houze for termiteth,\" Obsidian explained, causing confusion on Phoebe's face as she struggled to pick on on Obsidian's lisping accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObie rented half a house from a middle aged woman and the termite issue had gotten out of control. While normally Obsidian's schedule to host DnD would time with her landlady's bingo night, the pest issue had left them without the means of meeting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I said they could meet here since we technically have the most room in the den,\" Ixchel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all my ztuff is ztuck in there too,\" Obie said, \"although zhe made it up to me by having free reign of her coupon bookth and we went to town!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides their game materials, each member of the party was sporting copious bags from the corner stores and gas stations. Obsidian having control of this week's vittles was showing, as there was no entree, just a smorgasbord of snack foods. It was better than bumming the other Fordham residents for a meal, and soon the den was filled with the DnD gamers and various snacks in arms reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're finally out of the Prince'th Zhirteen Pitth of Hell!\" Obsidian cheered, in higher spirits, waving her arms in the air and causing an extra jiggle in her prestigious breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the party atmosphere, Ixchel also did a little jig, and her own extra jiggle was visible from breast to stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, the gamers were left to the sounds of Obsidian's lisping snores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definite sugar crash,\" Ixchel stood up, chest bouncing with the effort after checking her unconscious friend. \"I don't think I've ever had that much candy in one night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obie's got a way of picking things, yes,\" Wong replied. All the important food groups of junk food had been present in the haul, from salts to sweets to fats and carbs and caffeine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's running a bit of a fever, so I'm going to get her some medicine from the upstairs bathroom,\" Ixchel said, maneuvering her way over Obsidian's form an up the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with only the snores, Jenson spoke up after Ixchel left the room. \"So, they've both gotten bigger breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Wong quipped without missing a beat. Seeing the girls week after week, the two men would have been blind to not notice what the change in diet was having with the two females of the gaming group. Obsidian, of course, had her monstrous breasts sagging to one side in her tilted, fitful sleep as they looked too snug in her specialized bra. But it was Ixchel, surprisingly, who also had quite the increase in her chest size. The gap of her midriff seen on her undersized shirt had more to do with the material's tightness around her new sweater puppies than any inches added to her portly frame. While Obsidian had an undisclosed outset cup size, Ixchel was pushing the limits of her formerly modest C's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it that women carry their fat far more attractively?\" Wong joked. \"Whereas I'm going to have to get new shorts if I'm not careful.\" The chubby man had the telltale signs of some weight gain as well. Only Jenson, with his forever lanky frame, was immune to these collective changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose we should cut back?\" Jenson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck no,\" Wong said. \"Admit it, you like seeing them plump up as much as I do.\"</span></div></div>",

To make up for it, Ixchel was helping Audrey cook in the kitchen, as Uma and the twins were tasked with setting the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should cook more often, Chel,\" Audrey encouraged in the midst of working a recipe. \"I've always enjoyed your family's cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that good at it, you're just as good of a cook,\" Ixchel replied humbly to her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey made a sour face. \"You're the only other one here that appreciates when I try to make dinner.\" It wasn't that often that the townhouse residents made the effort to eat together, given their various lives, although Audrey typically found herself thrust into the domestic role in keeping up house and home. \"Still, it's a great spin on chili night. What spices do we need next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cumin and the adobe sauce, I can get that,\" Ixchel said. Spices and peppers were kept in a squat cupboard above the fridge. Audrey had a longer reach than her cousin, as Ixchel had to be on tiptoe to retrieve the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ixchel planted her feet flat on the floor there was the slide and the thud of several refrigerator magnets falling off the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Ixchel said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright,\" Audrey said, as both bent to retrieve the fallen magnets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey got an eye view of the problem, her head almost smacking into Ixchel's chest. Both being on the heavier side, Audrey was used to trading clothes with Ixchel sometimes, as both bonded over their misfortune in the genetic lottery. Ixchel's bosom looked larger than Audrey had remembered, and the extra weight in her chest had knocked the fridge magnets askew as Chel reached for the higher cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was about to comment on it before she thought it might be insulting to her cousin, as she wouldn't like to hear un unflattering comment about her weight either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel was oblivious to her cousin's concerns, focused on finishing the recipe, as the other ladies of the townhouse protested from out in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, aren't you done cooking yet?\" Reagan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done setting up the table?\" Audrey shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do we even eat together? It's always a pain pulling out this big table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's nice to eat together as family every once in awhile,\" Audrey said. \"Don't forget the napkins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins and Uma sat at various chairs around the table, each on their phones. Uma was nursing her shoulder, somewhat sore from her boxing class. \"Comeon, Red, get the napkins. It's worth it for chili night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe, get the napkins,\" Reagan said, her ditzy twin complying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, was it so hard to wait?\" Audrey said several minutes later as she and Ixchel brought dishes to the table. Each place setting had a heaping bowl of Mexican chili, with cornbread and sour cream in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, please, can't we eat dinner without phones for once,\" Audrey said as she sat down. Her younger sisters and college roommate collectively rolled their eyes, as everybody tucked into the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Uma said suddenly, taken aback. Reagan, noticing where Uma was staring, snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Phoebe asked, her twin needing multiple attempts to gesture as to where she should look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old folding dining table wasn't the most soundly built, listing from the head to the foot of the table. Ixchel, being on the stout side, took advantage of this lean so she wouldn't feel like an out of place little kid at the grown-up's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, confused as to the stares she was getting. See, given that Ixchel had been eating so much during D&amp;D nights recently, the weight piling on her chest had changed how she sat at the table. Instead of sitting normally, her blossoming breasts now sat on the table in front of her bowl of chili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey, catching wise to what the other roommates were snickering over, coughed. \"Reagan, honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the rambunctious twin asked. \"I haven't said anything. Just appreciating the view of the chili.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Uma added, \"and that you can look over to actually see it?\" Fresh chortles were had between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get what you're saying,\" Phoebe asked, although even the ditziest of the Durant sisters could tell that her cousin looked to have gone up a bra size or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Audrey said, trying to silence the others. \"You girls are nothing but trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have those faults <i>stacked</i> against us?\" Reagan replied, emphasizing the word to Uma's sardonic groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Ixchel asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" Audrey waved her hands. \"Let's just enjoy our food in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's clearly been enjoying it--OW!\" Reagan swore, getting kicked in the shin under the table.</span></div></div>",

After the usual pre-game banter, Jenson launched into his role as Dungeon Master with his usual dry dramatics<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though you were all successful in halting the fiendish incursion this time, you suffered many wounds during your battle. Knowing that you must recuperate before continuing your battle against the dark forces, you find yourselves in the temple of Helios, God of the Sun, meeting with the Human high priest and one of his Dwarven acolytes.\" Jensen turned to look at the newcomer. \"You can describe your character now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey Durant seemed a little surprised at the prompt, but with after a moment proceeded to describe the Dwarven priestess that Ixchel had helped her create a few days ago. It had taken a bit of prodding on Ixchel's part, but she'd eventually managed to get Audrey to agree to at least give the game a try. It helped when she described tabletop gaming as a way to forget the stresses of life for a few hours, which she could tell Audrey had sorely needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the others had been cool with letting Audrey join the campaign. Well they mostly were - Obie did her best to tone down her more biting remarks, and was mostly successful. Meanwhile Wong was his usual jovial self, his warlock immediately helping Audrey's priestess feel welcome in the party. Jenson continued to be a fantastic Dungeon Master, coming up with a new NPC on the spot after Audrey asked timidly if her priestess knew anyone in a bar they were visiting. And, most importantly, none of them mocked or belittled Audrey when she forgot which dice she needed to roll or a certain rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after three hours of investigating, clue finding, and participating in a bar brawl, the party had managed to track down the lair of a cult of evil fiend-worshippers. \"The doors slowly creak open, and you all hear an ominous chanting from deep within the structure. You will have a real fight on your hands... next week,\" Jenson narrated before loudly closing the rulebook he was holding, the signal that the game was at its end. The next few minutes consisted of everyone helping to put away miniatures, roll up battle mats, and dispose of any remaining snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty fun,\" Audrey said after everything had been put away. \"I think... I'd like to play some more. If you'll have me.\" The answers to Audrey's request were almost immediate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will,\" Jenson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Wong exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeth! We finally have a healer!\" Obie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Ixchel could do not to sob with relief. She'd been so worried that Audrey might not have fun or friends might get annoyed with her or a million other little things. She was glad this had all worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, that wasn't the end of the story.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...and thath when you zhould cazt Planar Banizhment if the cultiztth zummon more demonth,\" Obsidian explained to the D&amp;D group's newest member as they assembled at her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey, who was trying to learn what she could about the game, was also struggling to pick up on her cousin's friends' highly affected speech. \"But I thought they were devil worshipers, not demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're both the fiend creature type,\" Wong explained. \"The distinction is mainly for where they fall on the Evil alignments. But you'll want to remember your subclass's Wisdom damage bonus to fiends and undead for your attacks and spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Audrey fiddled for her character sheet. \"Which is why I want to mark the box here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help remind you of your bonuses, Audrey,\" Ixchel said, as Obsidian shouldered open the door. The group was spread across the exterior steps to the upper floor of the duplex Obsidian rented. The door jam sticking was said to be a frequent occurrence. Once the boob heavy gamer got the door forced open, a warm scent of dough and cinnamon diffused from the interior of the flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah geezth, Zkylar,\" Obsidian said, somewhat disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Obie,\" said a syrupy voice of the lanky brunette at the duplex's kitchen. \"Is this a new friend of yours?\" Obsidian's roommate was a head taller than her (as was everybody) with a checkered head scarf, ripped jeans, and a tie-dye shirt. Compared to the brash, scruffy haired and freckled lispy gamer, the other woman she lived with seemed far more mellow and outgoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you zaid you had that bake zale today,\" Obsidian murmured, having expected to have the apartment for herself for game group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That got rescheduled to next week. Hi,\" she waved, \"I'm Skylar. Grandma rents out the house to Obie and me. I know I've only met some of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ixchel, but call me Chel,\" the Hispanic-Korean began,\" and this is my cousin Audrey, with Wong and Jenson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to join us?\" Audrey offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" Skylar smiled. \"Obie's tried to have me play and it doesn't match my groove.\" She leaned to squeeze her roommate around the shoulders in a hug from the back, as Obsidian looked away, biting her lip in embarrassment. \"Besides, I want to get some recipes ready for the sale next week. Do any of you want a cinnamon roll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what that fantastic smell is?\" Ixchel said. \"Sure, I'd love to try one!\" As did everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYWAYTH,\" Obsidian said, \"let'th get back to the game and ztart chopping cultiztth already.\" She dumped herself on one end of the sagging couch next to the coffee table used for gaming. Audrey and Ixchel both had large bites of the cinnamon rolls offered by Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great, so rich and soft,\" Ixchel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to get the recipe from her,\" Audrey said, before adding quietly \"I wasn't as sure about meeting at Obsidian's place but her roommate is so nice! They're so different from each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, if Chel and Audrey considered their townhouse to have a odd collective of cohabitants, Obsidian and Skylar contrasted in every conceivable way. The former was squat, top heavy, extremely grouchy, solidly fitting in the grunge counterculture and highly aggressive in D&amp;D, and of course with her incredibly thick lisp from the size of her teeth. Her pale, freckled skin suggested she didn't get out all that much and Chel knew that Obsidian played video games far more than even she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her polar opposite, Skylar was thin and lanky with hardly an ounce of fat on her, bubbly and more feminine than Obsidian while still having a tomboy look. The tan of her skin and shine to her long hair suggested she spent more time outdoors and her cinnamon rolls were fantastic. She seemed like a bundle of positive energy, just younger than most of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think those were good,\" Skylar said, offering a tray, \"how about you try my gingersnaps? I like to give them a heavily spiced taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Most everyone tried a cookie or two as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk to drink with that?\" Skylar offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeriouzthly?!\" Obsidian narrowed her eyes at Skylar, eager to let Jenson's session get underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry roomie,\" Skylar giggled, \"just thought your friends might like some treats. I'll leave you to your game time, you won't even know I'm here.\" She retreated to what she was cooking on the stove, setting her mixer to low. Wong had to stifle his laughter from Obsidian's annoyance at her roommate's antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" Jenson said about the gingersnap he finished. \"Where we last left off, you had opened the door to the ritual chamber. Purple fire crackles from within a ritual circle, as robed figures turn your direction with ornate daggers. Roll for initiative please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fight underway, there were no interruptions from Skylar for some time, although the players could easily see her at work at the kitchen. For having her bake sale delayed she must have been getting some wares ready for the next week, as she continued to bake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat 20, heck yeth!\" Obsidian cheered, some time later as her barbarian finished off the last cultist. \"We've come and kicked their azzeth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, we've all lost a lot of hit points,\" Audrey said, selecting a healing spell from her player sheet. \"I roll d8s for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Wong said. \"We need to get this case open and analyze the cult's infernal artifacts. I'll take the Arcane test and you can roll Religion, Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let me check for traps,\" Ixchel said, her tabaxi rogue readying her lockpicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victory at last?\" Skylar asked, poking her head in above the seated gamers. \"How about a victory muffin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Ixchel turned to Audrey. \"How about we split one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got plenty for each of you,\" Skylar handed out muffins and paper plates. \"Blueberry lemon based on grandma's recipe, only I add poppyseed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" pleasant sounds were had from the pair of Fordham 8422 residents, thanks from the gentlemen, and a \"tch\" from Obsidian, who was placated with a plate of churros, which soon had to be shared with Ixchel as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, these are almost better than my aunt's\" Ixchel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like them!\" Skylar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed and the adventuring party was tracking down the source of the infernal artifacts used by the demon worshiping cult. As the investigation would take some time in game, Jenson decided to have the group dedicate their characters to downtime activities, also letting them level their characters early so Audrey could see how it was done. Wong's warlock was tasked by his patron to do some illicit works, something the rest of the group wasn't suppose to know in character. Ixchel's rogue did some side work for the thieves guild and improved her Dexterity, while Audrey supposed her dwarf cleric would keep to a devoted life of prayer and sacraments for her diety, as the group collectively helped her improve her spells. Obsidian's barbarian increased her strength and combat prowess with a bonus feat along with her class feature for frenzied attacks at her level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you're friends are staying for dinner,\" Skylar chimed in again, noticing a lull in the group's activity \"I could make you all some sandwiches maybe? Or soup, I make a killer stew. Bread and bread bowls are homemade too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itz only in-game downtime!\" Obsidian complained, \"we're going right back to zlaying the undead, zoupth too mezthy of a food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I could use the restroom, do you mind?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Skylar said, pointing. \"Around the corner, second door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go right after you,\" Ixchel added. The two were used to cramped quarters given the narrow townhouse, so when they were washing up after it gave them a chance to talk candidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, Skylar is so nice and Obsidian is just rude to her!\" Audrey exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ixchel said. \"I never knew she was such a good baker. Odd Obie's never brought anything of hers to a game night before. She mainly eats junk food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you never met her before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only once or twice,\" Ixchel said. \"We usually tried to plan Obie's share of hosting on the nights we wouldn't bother her. Rather, in hindsight I guess is was to avoid Obie getting cranky about interruptions to the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's only trying to be a good host,\" Audrey said, defending Skylar. \"I wonder how she puts up with Obsidian day in and out, I wouldn't be able to handle that girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel nodded. \"I've known Obsidian the longest of anyone in game group. I think her abrasiveness mainly stems from how her speech impediment makes it difficult for others to understand her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she call herself 'Obsidian' anyways?\" Audrey asked. \"That can't be here real name, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxchel's explanation was cut short by a shout. \"Hurry up you guyth, we gotta a new lead on a necromanzer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're back!\" Ixchel said as the pair returned to the living room. \"Wow, marbled brownies?\" Skylar had left them with another treat as the gaming session resumed. The two heartily dug into another scrumptious confection.</span></div></div>",

She was a whirlwind force, the big fish of personality in the small small pond of 8422 Fordham Avenue. The townhouse was no where near campus but thanks to Uma and the twins the house felt like a college dorm sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma had liked college. She had met her best friend Audrey Durant as her initial roommate. The blondie could be fun once you got her in the right mood and she was smart to boot. She helped Uma with the subjects that gave her issues and if Audrey couldn\u2019t figure it out she usually asked her cousin Ixchel, who was like a walking encyclopedia if one with a poor search function. In college Uma had been there to defend Audrey and help boost her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been unintentional on her part but Uma had gotten a pretty sweet deal getting to live with everyone. Not only did she live with her bestie and the brains behind the brains but the twins were all right once you got to know them. At least, when taken individually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving at the townhouse was easy living. It was crazy lively, having five girls under the same roof. Uma liked that otherwise it would have gotten too boring. Yet, not being a relative of the Durant or Park families she got to sit outside the whole sibling rivalry and family drama business that would harsh her mellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a place to live without much rent had come at a nice point too. Uma had been a star athlete in college and had been training to get on a professional team. Unfortunately her antics which had passed for college volleyball didn\u2019t mesh with a squad looking to make the Olympic team. Sure, Uma knew she was awesome but she didn\u2019t want wear herself out this early in life. She liked volleyball but she had plenty of other things she liked too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer old squad didn\u2019t take kindly to Uma eating outrageous food that wasn\u2019t part of the nutrition plan, sleeping past workouts because she had come in too late from the club or pulling pranks on her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer roommates at 8422 Fordham Avenue didn\u2019t judge, which Uma liked. They knew how to chill. Well, usually. And Uma was left to follow her own groove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe she was late with her share of rent. Because she really didn\u2019t have much of a income that she didn\u2019t already squander. But she\u2019d pay the Durants back once she got famous. Became a big star athlete, a celebrity with endorsements. It didn\u2019t have to be volleyball. Uma did track in high school. Or lacrosse, she still had her old sticks. She could try something new like soccer or swimming, maybe. Get to the Olympics on her own terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeday. Eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, the statuesque African American was coasting through life since she had quit the team. The townhouse provided all the comforts of home and plenty to entertain Uma and there were plenty of others to share the work. Most also having to handle Uma\u2019s share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have the same focus as when she was an underclassmen riding into college on her sports scholarship. She wasn\u2019t lazy, per sae, but Uma had become something of a procrastinator who pushed off what she didn\u2019t want to do until tomorrow. Her training also wasn\u2019t consistent so Uma had gone to seed. Not unfit but she had gained more than a few pounds since college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma didn\u2019t care if she went up a weight class. As long her muscle tone was still visible she didn\u2019t care about her size. She could just pour on the coal to drop the weight if she had to. If it ever came up or rather went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see how the cycle continues as Uma waffled on her ambitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were thicker and it wasn\u2019t from squats. Uma still rocked her blue jersey, though, as she put the finishing touches on coloring her 'do. Maybe it was the years of living with blondie (Audrey) as Uma had taken to the color, bleaching out her tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, why did everyone think Uma didn\u2019t keep herself busy? Honey, Uma Ferro was plenty busy. She had a full day ahead of her. Another kickin\u2019 day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had gotten her college roommate at breakfast, the most important meal of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was the most leisurely meal for the jobless, teamless ex-athlete, as Uma was usually free to meander about the kitchen of the townhouse. She took items from the fridge and cupboards, having concoctions from spicy omlettes to horchata poured cereal to nutella sandwiches to pinching Reagan\u2019s private stash of toaster pastries as her options on any given day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma had still been in her pajamas, lavender pieces, while putting the finishing touches on peanut butter and blueberry jam topped frozen waffles.

Can\u2019t recall most of it but I had some good sleep.\u201d Sat at the breakfast nook, Uma prepared her silverware to cut into her waffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife and fork met formica table as Audrey picked up the plate, looking mightily steamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Uma called out, \u201cthose are my waffles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean our waffles,\u201d Audrey fumed, having some scary eyes behind her glasses. \u201cWaffles that belong to those of us that actually tow the mark around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s got your panties in a bunch this morning?\u201d Uma asked, reaching out for the plate. However she didn\u2019t want to get up from that sweet, comfortable seat where she had sat just right in the breakfast nook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had the height advantage in this position, raising the plate well above Uma\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Uma! When\u2019s the last time you actually coughed up your share of the rent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed the job market sucks right now,\u201d Uma replied, annoyed. Cripes! It didn\u2019t seem like Audrey was going to let this point go today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve been saying for two years,\u201d Audrey fumed. \u201cIxchel is the only one who gets her share of the rent due on time. I\u2019m bustin\u2019 my butt from two jobs just to keep the rest of us afloat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebe and Reagan don\u2019t pay rent,\u201d Uma countered, solely focused on the taste of her topped waffles that she had been denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe twins going to college gets us a discount. Marginally, I know, but every little bit helps. Trust me, if I find either of them are abusing that trust they\u2019ll be the next ones either out looking for a job or kicked out on their asses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma was stunned. \u201cYou can\u2019t kick me out! We\u2019ve been besties since college, Audrey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me do it,\u201d Audrey sighed. It was difficult for her to confront Uma like this but she had no other choice left. \u201cWe have to support each other here or we\u2019re not going to make it. But we need an additional stream of income and frankly, you\u2019ve become a bit of a mooch lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma exhaled sharply, defeated. \u201cFine. But would you let me eat the damn waffles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey kept a firm grip on the plate. \u201cIf you promise to have at least three possible jobs you could apply for by the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, okay okay,\u201d Uma replied sourly. The bad taste left in her mouth even spoiled the taste of the waffles somewhat once she finally got Audrey to return the plate. The oldest Durant sister hadn\u2019t gone too far before she shoved that morning\u2019s classifieds under Uma\u2019s nose for \u201cbreakfast reading material.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma supposed she had been taking advantage of the cushy situation being a roommate of the townhouse had afforded her. When she was pursuing athletics full time she hadn\u2019t developed much in the way of other job skills. It wasn\u2019t a hopeless prospect to find work, only an annoying one. She made not have much experience but Uma knew to play to her strengths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore noontime Uma had some possible job options that she had found from the paper and online. She better make Audrey believe she was earning income fast or her blonde bestie might actually go through with kicking her out. That's why she wanted to look good before going out to interviews. A good first impression was what employers looked for, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nowhere near the crazy that could pass at the townhouse on any given day but it left the ex-athlete on edge since Audrey had given the ultimatum. Most of the classifieds didn't sound like anything she'd be able to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, yeah, there were the menial jobs like janitorial but Uma didn't want to make herself miserable like Audrey just to make her share of the rent. Others she didn't have the qualifications for, and her search for various job openings was a puzzle that got Uma into carb-loading mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom sports meets to test cramming, Uma had done her fair share of carb-loadings for energy. Today's was less than desirable for two reasons: the lack of quality carbs to be had at the townhouse, and the fact that this job hunt did not trigger a physical endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore of Reagan's secret toaster pastry stash had been reduced along with a bowl of stale cereal that Uma ate by hand without milk, while she waited for some frozen garlic bread to bake in the oven. Sure, it may be another sign of her mooching but if she could both find some work that wasn't horrid and would get her college bestie off her back, Uma didn't think that Audrey could complain too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the lack of desirable jobs and methodology behind her search reminded Uma of her best skills. She may have a decent if average education and a lack of work experience but above all else she was good at sports. Old stuff, new stuff, didn't matter as Uma could adapt herself quickly when training. Maybe finding a job that utilized her athletic pursuits would be the fire to get her going again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe the opportunity for an easy, carefree lifestyle with the possibility for juicy, edible perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some grit and determination (and cheap buttery garlic bread) Uma soon found herself a job that catered to both.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the next morning at breakfast where Uma was putting the finishing touches on some more toasted waffles, again earning the ire of Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uma, please, we talked about this yesterday.\" The speckled blonde made a grab for the waffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Uma was too quick this time. \"You said this was for those that tow the mark around here and I'll soon be employed after two weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blinked. \"Why two weeks? I don't follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriumphant with her un-pilfered waffles and a job she'd be good at, Uma shared the flier with Audrey. \"The city is running short on lifeguards this season. They're looking for powerful swimmers. I just need to get my CPR certification renewed and go through some training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey gave the flier a once over. \"Alright,\" she sighed, miffed at how long it would take for Uma to get her first paycheck. \"I'm glad you were able to find something, Uma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Orientation starts today,\" Uma replied, making sure she had a good breakfast to meet the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifeguard training was dead simple compared to the athleticism Uma used to do in her heyday at college. She and a mixed co-ed group of trainees went over basic exercises the first day, both to test the endurance of the lifeguard prospects and to get them familiar with procedures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not nearly as grueling as boot camp the trainees were drilled by a certified instructor in the manner of life saving. There were exercises in diving, using lifesaving techniques with the medical dummy, rescuing a child-sized dummy and each other, going over signs of drowning and medical emergencies to watch out for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Uma it got her back into the drive of having regular practice, and the excuse to carb-load at every breakfast. She was rising to the top of the class of cadets, second only to a woman who had been lifeguarding since she was a teenager. Uma had the energy, tenacity and practicality to overcome the rigors of training. Plus, she met a lot of new people and even got them to meet up for drinks. At the smoothie shop, rather than the bar, as lifeguard training attracted the natural fitness junkies. Uma was missing some of her partying lifestyle but that could wait until she graduated and had the spare income to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver those two weeks her weight was kept in check. For now, anyways. Uma was also looking forward to how chill most of the shift as a lifeguard would be, as for all their practice emergencies were not as common as training made them out to be. Some of her fellow trainees, who had worked or knew people that worked past seasons, talked about the unspoken 'perks' that came with the lifeguard position depending on where you were stationed. It garnered a lot of acclaim from the public, for one, and some businesses by the swimming hotspots gave special attention to lifeguards on or off duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would not have believed you earlier but Uma was well on her way to finding her perfect job. She was dedicated, yet independent. Provided a valuable service, yet had an easy workload outside of emergencies. It used her muscles while remaining relaxed, if alert. And she got to be the center of attention, with the privileges that came with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they say, pride comes before the fall. Waterfall, in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her training was complete, where was Uma posted?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Gradulation day, Freshie!\" One of Uma's fellow lifeguard trainee's gave her a clap on the back. Julie was a redheaded, freckle covered woman Uma's age that kept her hair in a ponytail behind a shade visor. Julie had given Uma the nickname as, unlike most others in training, Uma had never done lifeguarding before nor had she been on a competitive swim team. The two had hit it off talking after their courses, swapping stories of their athleticism. Julie had been on swim team and tennis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My roomie's been waiting for this day,\" Uma laughed. Indeed, Audrey had been crossing off days on the calendar with a rainbow's worth of colored pens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind catching my back?\" Julie asked, holding a bottle os sunscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Uma obliged, as Julie held her ponytail out of the way. Uma had never seen anybody go through as much sunscreen as Julie. The pale redhead never tanned, just had more and more of her freckles crop up across her body. Sure, she needed more shade than the average lifeguard but nothing stopped her during a rotation. Her senses were sharp, helping keep her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you suppose we'll end up?\" Uma asked as she used the dregs of the sunscreen to catch some missing spots on her own arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping its not the beach,\" Julie said as she repacked her ready bag. \"When I moved here last year I was only there two weeks. The lifeguard towers were so run down that we kept having to patch up the boards. I've heard the city still hasn't dealt with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang,\" Uma munched on her morning power bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeculation died down as they met up with their instructors. Once everyone was assembled, the new cadets were given their stations for the rest of the season. Given the myriad of water and public pool features nearby, a centralized lifeguard program was created and sponsored by the city. Uma waiting with baited breath for her name, hoping for a decent posting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferro, you'll be at Flush Zone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma kept to toothy grin while cheering on the inside. The waterpark? Awesome! Doubly so when Julie was posted there as well after several other surnames were called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Julie hissed as she and Uma high-fived as their team prepared to leave, having already developed a buddy handshake. \"Flush Zone may be noisy, a bit smelly, but more exciting in the day-to-day than other places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad to be here with a new friend, unlike the other squares,\" Uma whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not all squares,\" Julie nudged Uma as they entered the staff &amp; equipment room at the waterpark, already dressed in their red and white lifeguard onesies with fanny pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma nearly froze upon seeing who was in charge of the waterpark's lifeguard team. \"Django works here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies,\" said the smooth voiced Django, \"glad to see some fresh faces in here, especially those at the top of the class.\" Django was one of the trainers for a few days of their lifeguard training. He had a hint of Caribbean heritage and a stocky, well muscled physique with a friendly smile. Uma had been smitten instantly, earning relenting jokes from not only Julie but the Durant twins as well after she let slip to Phoebe one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to be here!\" Uma said, trying to contain herself, as she found a seat where Julie was elbowing her in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Django introduced the rest of the veteran lifeguards he went through orientation with the newly certified lifeguards. \"Work at Flush Zone presents some additional challenges to ensuring safety but nothing too different than what you went through in training. We use 2-hour station rotations, so you'll both be poolside and monitoring some of the attractions. Pool checks are at 2 pm every other day. We show up before opening to run through drills and a staff meeting. I'll be having you rotate more frequently to get used to the attraction stations but don't worry if you don't get to everything, there's some overlap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDjango held up an id badge. \"Keep your card on you at all times. They're your keys into the staff areas and we use them for digital check-in after performing certain inspections. Plus, they give you a discount at the concessions, so they're very important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter earned a chuckle, as Uma licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was a frenzy of learning how to keep focus while fitting to the needs of the waterpark. Flush Zone was ironically poorly named for how ambitious it was; a complex of pools, climbing structures, a lazy river, several water slides and a zip-line, it wasn't the best looking waterpark and was somewhat sparsely populated, even for the early season. While not as run-down as Julie had described the beach facilities, two of the slides were out of commission for repairs. That had been three weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, while safety was of the upmost importance, Django encouraged a sense of fun for the lifeguards. It was a pretty fair system, all things considered. The biggest incident Uma had to stop thus far was breaking up some kids blocking one of the exit ladders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day, Uma joined up with Julie again as the two were tasked with helping riders out of the water rafts from the giant slide and fielding them on the conveyor back to the top of the structure. Which netted them the same lunch period on the schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break time!\" Julie cheered as the pair met up at a staff exclusive area of picnic tables, as she opened up a bagged lunch from a waterproof lunchbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am famished!\" Uma announced, setting down a packed tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chicken strips and the hot dog meal?\" Julie scoffed. Uma had already taken a shine to the concessions discount, the tray also graced with some extra fruit and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The work here works up an appetite,\" Uma said before her first mouthful of hot dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sotra,\" Julie shrugged. \"When you're spending time in the water like we just did. Otherwise not so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma didn't pay much attention to Julie's opinion. Audrey had been more stringent about perceived 'mooching of the household vittles' as Uma went through her lifeguard training. Short of getting her usual munchies and getting back into a physical regime, Uma found herself extra hungry at meal time, hence her fry-up double compared to Julie's tunafish sandwich and carrots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuna, really?\" Uma challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pack my own lunches, thank you,\" Julie replied, \"with the tastier, healthy option. You don't know what you're missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, I don't mind tuna. I can't stand the smell of it around all this chlorine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should mind how much you eat, or it'll be an hour before you can be swimming,\" Julie teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma stuck out her tongue. \"We both know that's a load of tosh,\" Uma shot back, as the proposed dangers of stomach cramps from loss of blood flow to the muscles while digesting had been proven wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A big eater, I see,\" Django said pleasantly, coming to join them with his own lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma found herself inwardly embarrassed being caught with this much food by a guy she was crushing on who was also the lead lifeguard. She downplayed any awkwardness with her response. \"Figured I'd get my calories in at once to free up time on my next break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad of an idea, Ferro, just keep your hydration up.\" Proper hydration, given their heavily chlorinated environment, was one of Django's biggest concerns. \"So how are you ladies finding work here at Flush Zone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the lunch break featured plenty of discussion, job facts, talking about the latest movies, and some pointers before Django left the new friends. Afterwards, Julie ceaselessly teased Uma about 'hitting' on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't hitting on him,\" Uma said later as the pair were tasked poolside, keeping their eyes trained on the swimmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looked like he was hitting on you, though, with the size of your lunch.\" Julie said from under the lifeguard umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard Django said he played football in school, same as my brother,\" Julie quipped. \"Footballers typically eat like horses, there's a camaraderie around it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Uma said. \"It was a good deal with the discount, it was practically two for the price of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no need to share my corn chips with you on the next break,\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUma pulled her sunglasses down with a finger. \"Girl, since when where you so ribbing compared to our time in training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're out of boot camp now, Uma,\" Julie waggled her own glasses. \"More time to tease when there's less oversight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could end up being a longer summer than Uma thought. She went to put up her sunglasses when she noticed a feature at the corner of the waterpark she had yet to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlush Zone had a gourmet ice cream stand? Mocha chip, butterscotch swirl, razzleberry, peanut butter chunk, birthday cake. She watched some kids and parents lined up to the stand, instantly envious of their double-scoop cones. Suddenly, Uma had a new plan for her next break.</span></div></div>",
