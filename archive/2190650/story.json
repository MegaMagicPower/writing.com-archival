Your kind would have perished long ago if not for other species that had emerged roughly at the same time as humans. These species varied in size and shape but they were always bigger than humans by a long shot. They could have easily used humans as a food source or bait for larger game, but rather saw them as a resource and an ally. Humans helped keep their camps clean and helped with making tools and getting into places they couldn't reach. On rare instances there were clans out there that DID see humans as a meal, so if you were a nomad or refugee you had to approach new camps with caution.

Slowly sitting up he began to stretch his grey furred back, the toned joints unwind, he then threw his massive arms over his head and unintentionally flexed his huge biceps. Blinking his golden eyes your father warmly smiled as he grabbed his huge and firm white furred pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say Zve, i thought i be the one waking you. After placing you in my chest you immediately were resting!\", the huge wolf chuckled as he pulled his pecs apart to relieve the pressure of his buff beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been the sole survivor of the human clan in the north. During the nefarious winter period you clan attempted to travel south in hopes of reuniting with their brethren. Despite being a youngling at the time, you could remember seeing the group get smaller and your parents growing weaker as they gave you most of their food. Help came too late as your father's clan the Alphas came across the few left of your clan. Despite giving aid both your parents passed and you were the sole human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a human, the pack immediately brought you in. Winter was no longer a issue as the beautiful fur of the giant buff warriors kept you warm. You were soon fostered by the next chief Wolfren, treating you as his kin and teaching you of the pack's traditions and meanings. Even upon growing up you still felt close and grateful to have such a blessing from the spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zve, little one?\", your father's booming voice brought you out of the flashback. His clawed furry fingers reach in between his pecs, you were gently plucked up and pulled out of the furry canyon. Wolfren looked concerned as he placed you on his large palm and brought you before his bright eyes. \"My son i was asking about your dreams, are you well? You usually are so lively in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clasped your hands, feeling guilty for not paying attention. \"I apologize father, i was just....reminiscing on the past. I know by now all members of the pack at 19 would be warriors, and i unfortunately can not fill that tradition for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the whole space seem to shift as Wolfren stood up, his large pawpads stomping into the earth. The wolf had a look of shock and anger on his face. You dipped your head, of course you father would feel as ashamed as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zve why in the spirits would you think that!?\", Wolfren's deep voice boomed as he brought you to his massive chest. \"Do you think I'm that vile that i have that shame for you? You are my son and you being a human does not change that, our pack does not treat our kin as such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widened your eyes as your father looked down at you with saddened eyes. \"Please tell me, have i made you feel that way?\", you shook your head furiously. \"No father! None of this is because of you, I'm very grateful to be your son. I just feel shameful that i cannot be like the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfren suddenly tilted his palm, the soft furred flesh pressed you to his firm pec. The chief gently held you as he stood towering high. \"My son, you do not need to feel this way. I Iove you now and will always, know that you are resilient and were made my son by fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as your father comforted you, his warm palm and heartbeat calming you. Wolfren smiled as well as he looked down, he kept you in his giant embrace for a little longer before pulling away. \"Now then, i believe i shouldn't keep our pack waiting. I'll gather my supplies and we will go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, your father set you down on the pile of furs. You looked up in awe as from your father's mighty stompers was his toned legs and large thighs. His white furred manhood rested on his rock sized. balls, despite being limp it was still a good 8 inches. You briefly saw his eight chiseled abs before he stepped over the pile, his balls bounced as you now looked up at his huge round rear. Despite being muscle the large cheeks bounced and grinded together with his steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father's tail swished above his humongous ass, he hummed as he grabbed a small sewn together loincloth. Pulling it up his thick thighs, Wolfren did need to use his paws to manoeuvred the clothing to contain his manhood. His butt was practically uncovered as a thin piece of the fabric ran between his cheeks. Next, Wolfren wrapped his leather waist strap around his wide torso and began attaching his hunting materials. His sacred blade, laid on his hip and the red fabric dyed with his his clan's blood was wrapped around his pulsing buff arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath, the hunts were rather intense. Anywhere on your father's large body was a resting spot for you and you could feel his intensity in his focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfren placed a hand on his chest, giving a prayer to the spirits, his father, and ancestors. He asked for survival amd safety for everyone and you. Turning around he looked down grew determined for the hunt. Now then where to keep you during the event?</span></div></div>",

He slid up onto his elbows suddenly and you tumbled down off his chest off and down onto his stomach and settling in his navel, you shook your head and looked at him as he let out another yawn. \"Sorry boy, forgot I put you there, I think the hunt will do fine without me today....\" He said closing his eyes and laying back down. A hand drifted past you and you watched as it began to absently scratch his exposed sheath and large balls. You grunt and squirm out of his navel, your father reacting little to your presence as you usually were somewhere on him as a few minutes without his warmth would result in your death in the glacial plains that the tribe lived on. You walked up and began banging on the underside of one of his cliff like pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But dad, you're the CHIEF, they need you to lead them, you not coming could spell a possible moot to remove you.\" You say pressing your shoulder with all your weight behind it to try and discomfort the large chest muscle of your adopted dad. After a couple seconds a growl escaped him and fingers plucked you up and tossed you gently into a bundle of furs in the corner of the hut. You right yourself and watch your father heave himself to his feet, furs and hides falling away exposing his light gray coat to the dim room, his fur had a pattern of stripes and spots all over his back, coming to an end on his massive rear, a short tail drooped over the large cheeks. His thighs rippled with muscle as he did another stretch and let out a sigh. You were away from him for less than ten seconds and a chill was already assaulting your senses, despite you wearing a furred tunic and some primitive pants. There was a reason your original family didn't make it. You were on the brink of death when Gliron, your new dad found you. you watched your dad glide across the room way too quietly for a being his size and pick up a loin cloth, wrapping it around his waist and tying it in a sort of fundoshi style. Satisfied with being dressed for the hunt, he quickly sifted through the furs and retrieved you. He pressed you to his chest to heat you up a bit and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best we be off Boy, I'm gonna put you...\"</span></div></div>",

He slid the hand holding you down his stomach and into the tight hide cloth of the minimal garment. The fingers guided you over his large sheath and cupped you between it and his mammoth balls, the hand lingered for a bit before withdrawing, you quickly snuggled into the folds of loose skin of his groin, pulling the skin and fur around you to brace for the coming weather. The sound of rustling cloth was heard as your father stepped into the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chief Gliron blinked as he stepped out into the open air, a wind kicking up snow and whipping it into his eyes from the banks built up against his hut. His feet crunched into fresh snow and he squinted to look around the tribe, many other males of the clan were mirroring him, stepping out of the hut in their usual single loin cloth thong and the occasional rudimentary bandoleer across their muscled upper bodies. A small group had already gathered at the far side of the camp and Gliron made his way over, the cold this morning even affecting him slightly as he walked....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The temperature in your fathers loins dropped substantially in a short time, with cold clinging to the outside of the cloth and seeping through, causing the big cats scrotum to draw up tight, and threatening your cocoon of skin. You feared this would happen as the morning had already felt exceptionally cold. It only took a few more minutes and finally the scrotum ejected you from its folds, depositing you onto the cold material of the loin cloth. You instantly rolled onto your stomach, and luckily your father was standing still at the moment going over the hunt plan, giving you a chance to make it to the fall back locations, making it into his cheeks or climbing his sheath and going into it, both spots may cause him some discomfort, but you knew he'd understand and implore you to go there at a time like this, he was probably well aware of the situation already, with tht in mind you....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You dug into the tightening folds of your fathers scrotum and heaved yourself up, your breath fogging up your vision in the dark, dank recess of Gliron's thong. His body shuddered as your weight pulled on the taut skin, but other than that he showed no visible response. No one in the clan knew of you, and in Saber tooth culture the weak were food and the strong were king. If the others discovered your existence and that Gliron was harboring a human, he'd be seen as weak and kicked from his leadership and possibly exiled. With another pull you grasped onto the fur of his sheath, the soft cartilage sagging as you climbed up it. your back was digging into the soft musky material of the loincloth and through the fabric cold air seeped through your clothes and into your flesh, sending your hairs standing on end. With a final pull, you made it to the top and wiggled your way into the slit, the cartilage relaxing as Gliron let you inside, closing back up and sealing you in moist and rancid darkness, but it was warm at least. You slipped in next to his member, which was a good bit bigger than you, and awaited the hunt to be over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliron shuddered and relaxed as he let the boy slide into him, the feeling was unpleasant as his rough hide rubbed against his sheaths inside walls and he longed to rub at it but he was in the middle of council and though it wouldn't raise to many questions, the Chief doesn't usually rub his crotch in front of the clan. His second in command, a big brown cat named Bone Snapper, spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just shiver or something, Gliron? Cold finally wearing you down after all these years huh?\" The bigger male said. His chest, neck, stomach, thighs, and arms were covered with scars, many of which were from Gliron himself. Bone Snapper, or just Bone, loved to fight, and always was trying to usurp Gliron. He had beaten his way up the clan ranks, but Gliron was too good for him to best, and for that Bone respected and hated him with a passion, but wouldn't openly show either. Gliron wouldn't be surprised if just because he saw Gliron shiver, he's try to kill him on the hunt today. Gliron hadn't killed Bone solely because the bastard had four kids to feed and their mother died to a polar bear raid, and Gliron wasn't about to care for them just because their father wanted to rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't think so Bone, just feel like I drank too much firewater last night.\" Gliron said, smacking on a slur. Bone laughed and patted him on the back just a little too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bachelor like you can afford that. Not me though, I gotta stay sharp.\" Bone said with his eyes closed and a toothy smile, Gliron didn't let his clan know but he preferred the company of the same sex rather than a woman. Bone was one of three that knew that about him, and once after Bone attacked him in his hut he mounted the bastard and they spent the night together, he's had a couple more encounters with the large Cat of that nature, although its a hate fuck, Gliron can't help it, Bone had a huge ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you say Bone, just watch my back out there and don't put a spear in it, its been a week since your last attempt and you're getting me anxious.\" Gliron said glancing over his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, I'm too hungry too think about killing you today. So what's the plan? Are we hunting ferals, or are we raiding today?\" Bone said, his smile widening again. There were reports of a rabbit camp about five miles south of their village, and they didn't know that they knew they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raiding, their numbers are low and their hunters are lower. We set out and will be on them midday, they set up in a forest so we should get the drop on them. Let's move out my friends.\" Gliron said, and with Bone by his side, he set out for the rabbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swaying as your father walked rubbed you slowly back and forth within him, rolling you across his member and making you a little sick. The stuffy air in the musk filled chamber wasn't helping and you knew you were gonna need to surface soon for air already otherwise your dinner was going to paint the fleshy walls of Glirons sheath. You spread you hands and gripped the flaccid member, managing to still most of the swaying, but soon you knew it was going to get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliron sat in a low tree branch, overlooking a small snow hare camp, maybe 50 strong. They would only bag half a dozen or so, and take the supplies they had gathered. Hare's reproduced...well like rabbits, and the numbers they take would be restored in just a couple months. A hunter hare passed by beneath Gliron and went over and examined a footprint that was at the base of a tree nearby. He was young, maybe seventeen winters, shame really. As he beant to look at the large indention, a blur came from above as Bone Snapper dropped from the tree above the Hare and landed on top of him, smashing him into the snowbank. With a quick motion bit down with his large fangs on the back of the Hare's head and lived up to his name, breaking the young hunters neck, a spurt of crimson painted the pale bark of the tree next to the two. Gliron looked back up and notioned with his head and tail to the other dozen Sabers in the trees, all of them ranging from pure white to pure black. With o sound they all dropped from the branches and skulked into the camp, silencing at least seven more Hares before a cry rang out and the women and children began to scatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too Blood!\" Bone shouted out and the primal roars of the Sabers echoed off the trees as they announced their full presence to the scared Hares. About two dozen Hare hunters rallied and began sparring with the Sabers, and despite being on average a foot sorter they held very well with powerful kicks and fast jabs with spears and knives. Gliron made the mistake of going into a hut too early, only for a hares powerful kick to smack him square in the chest and knock him a good ten feet out the door. Gliron landed on his ass and felt the boy jostle around in his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry kiddo.\" Gliron grumbled as he stood up to face what had to be the Chieftain of the Hares. He was snow white and almost as tall as Gliron, with holes in his ears and scratches all over him. He wore an ornate loincloth that draped down to his knees between his legs, which rippled with hard muscle. A spear flew towards Glirons belly and he sloppily flopped out of the way, the spear catching his thong and hip, cutting both of them. His thong flew off and now Gliron was dancing around nude, not that it really mattered. He deflected another jab with his own spear, following the motion with smacking the Hare with the butt of the polearm across the face, sending an incisor flying out of his mouth. The Hare didn't flinch like Gliron thought he would however and made another jab, this one digging pretty deep into the gray Saber's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me!\" Gliron snarled, dropping his spear and grabbing the hilt of the one still buried in his leg. As soon as his hand touched it the Hare let go, knowing he couldn't match Gliron in a tug of war and instead whipped out a knife, going for his throat next. Gliron again was caught off guard as the hare lunged at his face with the crude tool. He pivoted and fell back again, catching himself with his hands and delivering a good kick to the Hare with his leg that didn't have a spear in it. The Hare fell back with a grunt, blood pouring from his mouth from where he lost his tooth. Gliron didn't bother getting up and instead ripped the spear from his leg and threw it, the weapon bore through the Hare's eye socket as he was getting back up, and he collapsed back to the snow, dead in an instant. A cheer rang up and Gliron glanced to see his men had gathered around, blood smeared on their mouths and bodies. They had finished their work early and had gathered around to watch their leader fight, probably hoping he would die so they could claim themselves chief but it hardly mattered. Bone appeared over him and offered a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good kill, Gliron, that was a smart bastard there.\" The brown Saber said with his stupid smile. \"He even took your Cloth mate.\" He said as the others chuckled. Gliron rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round up the bodies and supplies that you can find, we're off, I need to tend these wounds at home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to be sick for sure, but that didn't matter because your father seemed hurt. He was on the ground and his heart beat was quickened. Voices could be heard after a moment and you could hear Bone, the big brown saber that would most definitely eat you if he found you. After a moment Gliron spoke and you took a deep breath of his musky crotch air. You wriggled your way back towards the entrance after a moment to try an get some air for a second but before you reached the top Glirons entire sheath clenched, holding you in place, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliron clamped down on the kid, he was about to expose himself while Gliron was standing around nude and oozing blood from a few different places, a perfect opportunity to look extremely weak. After a moment he let up and the boy didn't try again, good, at least he had been in his sheath otherwise he would have fallen out and been trampled by Gliron or the Hare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gliron, check this out!\" Bone called from a nearby hut. Gliron groaned and limped over to see Bone hold up a box. Gliron peeked in and blinked. Inside was roughly 30 humans, a tribe maybe. \"What should we do with them boss? Bring them back? Leave em' here? Kill em'\" Bone said a little too happy. Gliron looked back at the humans huddled in the corner of the box, staring at the big bad carnivore, they looked like they were members of the Hares clan in a sense. Other Sabers were gathering around, as humans were rare this far north. Gliron snorted and spoke carefully...</span></div></div>",

Looks like we're having human for dinner!\"</i> Bone shouted enthusiastically. <br>\r\nSome of the men cheered with him, the others gave a half baked cheer, not really all the excited by the prospect of human meat. It was well known among most everyone that human meat was notoriously disgusting, only to be consumed at the most desperate of times where starvation would be otherwise assured. Some say they'd eat their own shit before they ever find themselves eating human meat. The likely reason some of the men cheered anyway was because the prospect of completing dominating another tribe and taking their humans as prisoners was empowering. Though, back in Gilron's father's day, the only time anyone really partook in eating human meat was either for drunk dares or because specific rituals or rites of passage required it. Most of the time they would use humans for any entertainment they could muster, and simply leave them to starve once they got bored. This wasn't out of any malicious intent, they were simply indifferent to the idea of humans. To them, it simply seemed like a waste of time and energy better spent on hunting. There are only very view sadistic and depraved individuals who actually enjoy eating humans, individuals who love the idea of conquering and having complete control over a being so much smaller than themselves; much like how a serial killer starts out by killing stray animals before moving onto bigger game.   <br>\r\nBone gave a devilish grin as he peeked into the box of terrified humans huddled together in furs, and notes that every single one is male. What a lucky find for him to find his favorite type of humans so far up north like this. Bone's fellow tribesmen look at him with annoyance, much like how one would look at a man child who overindulges in childish behavior; a trait that most grow out of long before his age. Just as bone was about to grab one of the screaming humans, he is stopped by Gilron.<br>\r\n<i>\"We're not gonna us 'em for your... games, Bone.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\"<br>\r\n\"Because we ain't fuckin' cubs.\"<br>\r\n\"You're acting like the fucking cub, Gilron\u2014\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"IT'S CHIEF TO YOU.\"</i> interrupted Gilron with a warning, the look in his face stern and angry. <br>\r\nBone swallowed, losing composure and his grip on the box. He reposed by folding his arms together and looking down at Gilron with a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<i>\"You've gone soft, haven't you?\"</i> Bone countered, <i>\"why do you care what I do with these little shits, huh?\"</i><br>\r\nGilron didn't say anything, instead he just stared at Bone. <br>\r\n<i>\"You're getting old, Gilron. Only the old care about those as weak as them. Now, give me the box old man.\"</i><br>\r\nBone put his hands out, expecting to receive the catch back from his chief. The other cats stared at the two, curious to see how this would play out, and who would be truly dominant in this outcome. <br>\r\nGilron stared down into the box pensively with an expressionless face, the human that almost became Bone's prey looked up at him. Although he was terrified, he looked much more at ease under this cat's mercy than the other. The human shook as head, as if pleading with Gilron not to kill them. He recognized that look, the very same look his son gave him when he found him all those years ago. No, he knew he couldn't let Bone have them in good conscious. Damn if he was weak, he didn't care. At the very least, Bone didn't know that. <br>\r\nHe looked up from the box and said, <i>\"You're right... maybe I have gone soft.\"</i><br>\r\nHe closed the box and brought it to the still burning fire pit of the hares. <br>\r\nBone shifted his glance worryingly. <i>\"H-hey... what do you think you're doing, Gilron?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"It's chief to you. Say it again and I'll throw your toys into the fire before you even get to use 'em.\"</i><br>\r\nBone quickly panicked. <i>\"W-wait, that's a waste!\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Oh? I could've sworn you sayin' somethin' about them bein' little shits?\" </i><br>\r\n<i>\"Those are rare little shits, Gil\u2014\"</i> bone stopped himself.<br>\r\nGilron started tipping the box on it's side, slowly moving it into the fire.<br>\r\n<i>\"Chief! I mean Chief!\"</i> Bone pleaded. <br>\r\n<i>\"Well, who's soft now?\"</i> Gilron snapped. <br>\r\nBone gritted his teeth, unable to say anything. Gilron moved the box away from the fire, and approached Bone. <br>\r\n<i>\"Stay in line, and I might think about sparing one of these little shits for your... games,\"</i> Gilron said, <i>\"besides, I have a better idea on how to use 'em. Giving 'em to you would be a real waste though.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"What do you plan to use them for, Chief?\"</i> one of the by-standing cats butted in and asked curiously. <br>\r\nGilron did in fact have a purpose in mind, although he wondered if he should keep it a secret from his men for now. That purpose in question was...</span></div></div>",

You are dismissed Verdun.\" Your father said nodding at the fox, who took a deep bow before walking out of the throne room. You observe your adoptive father, complimenting him mentally, as he wore a form fitting purple military jacket with slate gray tights, emphasizing his large butt and package. The jacket was trimmed with gold that accentuated the crown he wore. His feet were adorned with polished black boots. No doubt he was the very picture of authority. You and your brothers wore a very similar outfit but instead of purple your jacket was a dark blue with silver accents instead of gold and the crown you wore was smaller and silver. Your father reclaimed his seat and the castle steward called the next citizen to step forward to address their grievance. You sigh and prop your head on you palm, bored out of your mind, a large digit tapped your head, knocking you forward a bit and causing your crown to fall in your lap. You look back with a scowl at your oldest brother Mot, who was looking down at you sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pay attention and learn a thing or two about ruling Hap, you may need it one day.\" The white bear said looking back up at the court hearing. Mot was roughly the size of your father, and was the crown prince, signified by the Amethyst inlaid in the head of his crown. His muscles swelled beneath his blue jacket and a prominent bulge was visible through his tights. You put your crown back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, you and Verdi plan on dying on me soon?\" You say looking back at him from your chair. Mot sighed, not looking back down at his kid brother, and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best to be prepared for anything, now be quiet and listen or father will hear about your failure to listen to the people.\" You snapped back forward, fathers anger could be vicious, you'd only been the victim of it twice, and it never ended well. The hearings went on, finally coming to an end halfway into the afternoon. When the last commoner walked out of the throne room and the doors shut behind her, Verdi jumped up and stretched, letting out a sigh before clasping his hands together and turning towards his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that was truly a long court, shall we adjourn for some dinner?\" Verdi said with a smirk he never took off his face. He was 20, as Mot was 23, and your father being a respectable 48. Verdi had the same build as his brother and father, and had the same great ass and bulge as well. You truly felt like an ant among these gods. King Styrke sighed and turned in his chair to face You and Mot, his eyes saying everything. Mot sighed, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very well, lets get some dinner and review all the cases that have transpired today.\" Mot said standing up, casting you in his shadow. Your father seemed pleased by the answer and turned to the Steward Caine, a thin jackal that had been in this castle as long as Styrke has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lord Caine would you see that dinner finds its way into the dining room shortly? Me and my sons shall be in the dueling room, please inform us when it is served.\" You sat up as Caine left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are we to witness Mot and Verdi's swordsmanship in a bout father?\" You say excitedly, you always enjoyed watching your brothers spar, wishing you could join them. Your father nodded at you with a smile, standing up and making his way out of the room, Verdi followed close behind. Mot offered you his palm, and you climbed on and were whisked out of the room. You looked up at your brother, who was obviously distracted in thought, probably processing all the interactions that had occurred that day, you thought it best not to ask him pointless questions. After a short walk you found yourself in a large room that had plush chairs lining its walls with a few tables between them. The middle of the room was bare of furniture, and one corner had an assortment of practice weapons. Verdi was standing near them, stripping off his jacket and crown, leaving his torso bare to the stone room. His white fur was bright against the dull grey stone, and his muscles underneath looked as if they were made by the very stones of the keep. His tights did little to hide the outline of his large sheath and balls beneath the cotton and silk fabric. His white stubby tail stuck out above his globular covered cheeks as he drew a wooden longsword from a rack. Your father appeared next to Mot with his palm outstretched, without a word you were transferred into your dad's rough palm as he walked over and took a seat in one of the chairs, he placed you on his thigh and you tried to ignore the large bulge he had between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mot, why don't you show me how well your spearmanship has become.\" Your dad says with a lazy smile. Mot nodded, stripping to mirror Verdi before grabbing a wooden spear from the rack. Your brothers took their respective positions on opposite ends of the room, they turned and faced each other, waiting your fathers signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Begin!\" Your dad commands. Verdi approached Mot cautiously, obviously at a disadvantage due to Mot's reach. Verdi took a feint before coming in with a swing from the other direction. Mot smacked the blade away and with the same motion brought the butt of the spear up between Verdi's legs, pegging him right in his nethers. Verdi gasped and dropped to his knees, cupping himself, only to look up and find Mot's spearhead an inch from his eye. Your father chuckled slightly and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Verdi, when faced with a spear, you want to get inside his reach as quick as possible but also not overextend yourself, fail to do so and you'll end up where you are now. Again!\" Your father shouted. This went on for another 30 minutes, the results being similar almost every time, which was frustrating your father slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Verdi, take Hap and observe me.\" Your father said standing up and setting you in the imprint his ass left in the seat. You look up at the tower that was your father as he tossed down the kingdom crown in the seat next to yours as well as his coat. As he passed Verdi, he snatched the sword from his grip before taking up his position on the other end of the room. Verdi grumbled as he absently rubbed at his sore bulge, plucking you up with his free hand and setting you on his own thigh as he sat down. his other hand still rubbed at his bulge, obviously not caring his brother was inches from the action. Your father looked like he was chiseled from marble, his muscles well defined and his stomach a pure power gut, he took a stance and began his bout with his oldest son. Mot took a much more cautious approach now, fully aware his opponent was many times more skilled than he. They engaged each other with test swings and jabs, testing for a weakness in the others defense. Suddenly Styrke stepped in on Mot, ducking under a jab and thrusting his sword at Mot's face, Mot leaned back, bringing his spear around, smacking the sword down and bringing the shaft towards your fathers stomach. Styrke jumped back from the short swing before bringing his sword down on the back of Mot's knee, causing him to drop down on it. Styrke followed the movement up by spinning around and placing the swords wooden blade to his son's throat. Mot dropped his spear and smiled at his dad, accepting his defeat. Styrke lowered the sword before looking back at Verdi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's how it's done Son, I want you to spend tomorrow working on your form, take one of our kings guard to be your sparring partner.\" Verdi grumbled as he glanced down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How come Hap doesn't spar? He rather enjoys watching it, why not find him a teacher?\" Verdi says glancing up at your father. You followed his gaze to your father, never really considering actually asking that very question. Styrke took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hap is a strong boy, but the necessity to protect himself in this degree is a little pointless. Most of our dealings are with other Anthro's, and I hope I can protect him from this particular type of interaction involving them. Instead Hap is to be taught more diplomatic approaches, when he comes of age I hope to send him to other kingdoms to negotiate trade and treaties for the benefit of my reign as well as your's Mot. He will be a great value to the family.\" Your father says giving you a big smile. You blush due to it, but also can't feel a tinge of helplessness beneath it. Your father didn't view you as an equal to your brothers, he saw you as something he had to protect and shelter, and while you understood why, that didn't stop it from hurting. Caine suddenly entered the room, announcing dinner was now served. Servants came in and collected the clothes around the room as you were carried by Verdi in his palm as he followed you dad and Mot into the dining room. Everyone took their seats, and Verdi placed you at your personal table that sat on the table next to your dad's plate. Caine looked at his bare chested lords and told some servants to go draw some baths. You ate in silence, occasionally answering questions from your father as he quizzed you and your brothers on the issues addressed at court today and to explain why he handled each one how he did. When you finished dinner....</span></div></div>",

You sometimes missed the days you were among humans, as you now found yourself quite alone despite being among your family. You sigh lightly, trying to decide what you were going to do tomorrow, since there was no court hearings or classes planned. You could spend it with father, but he would probably be spending the day in his study writing letters and working on his maps. Mot seemed to distracted recently to babysit you, and Verdi seemed like he was to train all day, which was rightfully so as the second son was supposed to be the general of the kingdoms forces. You actually had an uncle but he was rarely at the castle, instead he was constantly going from fortress to citadel, examining defenses and the troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What troubles you Hap?\" You jump and look up to see your father looking down on you with a concerned expression. You blush, embarrassed in front of your brothers by your fathers show of concern. You glance at them but see Verdi was arguing with Mot for hitting his balls so much, saying something about how Mot won't have nephews and nieces if kept doing that. You turn back to your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just trying to decide what to do with the morrow, I have no classes planned and it seems both of my brothers shall be occupied.\".

You climb into his hand, leaving your brothers behind as they continued their argument. Your father walked to his chamber and found the bath that was in the floor had been filled with steaming water, the window above it was open and a light snow had begun, a rogue flake fluttering in before melting from the rising steam. Your father walked over and placed you at the lip of the tub before standing up and taking his boots off. You undressed as well but kept an eye on your dad as he began to slide off his tight pants. He wiggled his enormous ass and thighs out of the material, His flesh expanding more as it was no longer confined by the fabric. He stepped out of the pants and rubbed at his legs and ass, obviously enjoying the dull ache running through them. He turned and walked to the window, you watching his Goliath balls swing beneath his meaty sheath as he did so, and propped his hands on the window sill, enjoying the cold air on his white fur. His wide back rippled with muscle, and his stubbed tail sat above his gargantuan cheeks, each cheek the size of a human house. His thighs quivered with every shift he made. Suddenly he turned an eye back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you find me endearing son?\"He said turning his head all the way back at you, a look of amusement across his face. You turn beet red and sputter out a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-of course, but who wouldn't father? You aren't a king but a god among men to be sure. You make others halt when you are fully clothed and hypnotize them when you are nude.\" You say averting your gaze, truly embarrassed at being caught staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Son there's no reason to be shamed, it's quite alright. I've been aware of your glances and peeks for a couple years now. So I just figured we could get a little more personal tonight to show you I embrace your form of affection.\" He said this as he turned and walked over to you, towering over you by planting his feet on either side of you, leaving you under his swinging balls. His knees bent as he lowered himself, letting his feet slip off the lip of the tub up to his knees as he sat on the stone floor. a dull slap was heard as his rear and thighs settled on the stone and left you face to face with his balls and sheath, which was many times larger than you. You still had your pants on but your father could easily see your manhood twitching beneath the fabric. You stood there awkwardly, not sure what to do exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on son, worship this 'god' of yours.\". Your father said chuckling and looking down at you. You hesitated a moment before slowly walking up to your fathers musky balls, stretching out a shy hand and touching his right one before pulling your hand back. When nothing happened, no anger or punishment ensued, you returned the hand to the fuzzy flesh and began to slowly rub it. After a second you added your other hand and brought your body a little closer to the warm flesh. Your father grunted softly as your massage picked up in speed and strength, you glance up to see him making a strange face, he obviously didn't expect to actually be influenced by your touch. As you continued his hand began to squeeze and massage at his sheath, and eventually he coaxed out his member. It cast you in it's shadow as it continued to grow, a dark grey monument that had never graced your eyes before. You rubbed with more passion, throwing your chest into it and basically grinding yourself across your father's testicles. The gloves were off as your dad began to pump himself, grunting deeply at the pleasure he was feeling. You climbed up his balls clumsily and crawled to the folded skin that was his retreated sheath, you propped a foot on it before putting your whole upper body into the effort of pleasing your father. His other hand cupped his balls, pressing you more into his member as he reached climax. The muscle above you engorged more and began to pulsate as it shot it's seed all over Styrke's thighs and the floor. Your father let go of his dripping member and fell onto his back, panting heavily. You stayed where you were for a minute, still softly rubbing at the member. You look down and see you had released in your pants as well and weren't even aware of it until now. You two stayed like that until... </span></div></div>",

Chase was wearing a simple white dress shirt with a black tie, and a pair of Grey slacks that were a little tight on the dog.

You may be out from under the ass, but you were still stuck in Chase's chair and far away from any access elevator to reach human walkways and rooms. Though humans and Anthros worlds were quite merged, when one slipped completely into the others world was when accidents occurred.

You release and land on your feet with a practiced grace, looking up at the Zebra leaned over you working on some reviews. His ears were faced back a bit signifying he was not having a pleasant time with his work. After a moment he tossed down the pen and stood up, you crouched down to avoid his arm as he stood up and walked to a filing cabinet and began going through it, giving a good opportunity to check out your manager. Joseph was a huge gym goer, and had a strong man build rather than a chiseled model. His Biceps bulged against the white dress shirt and his pectorals and muscle gut was easily outlined through it. His tan pants were tight on his lower body, wrapping around his huge ass giving him a slight wedgie at all times as well as squeezing his large thighs and calves. His tail lashed with visible frustration, and after failing at finding whatever file he needed he slammed the cabinet shut and stomped back over to his desk and plopped down in the chair again.

You blinked, Joseph never asked help of anyone, him doing so now rather than reprimanding you tells you volumes that you were, in fact, his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...you don't wanna get Scott to help you with this? I mean I don't mind but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"David, shut up and help me with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You walk over and follow with him over numbers and statements, looking for any anomalies that your co-workers may have missed. Awkward small talk was all that accompanied you and Joseph as you worked, but as the day went on and the sun had sunk to the horizon out the window, you and him had begun cracking jokes and talking about things more freely. You offered to stay late and help him further, and as the last person walked by and out of the office for the day, you still found yourself actually enjoying Josephs company. He caught you off guard however when suddenly he undid his tie and unbuttoned his shirt, exposing a v-neck undershirt. His Pectorals swelled underneath it as if taking a gasp of air on their own, being partially freed from their confines. You couldn't help but admire their size, and letting your eyes linger on the nipples poking through the shirt as well. Joseph stretched and massaged his chest before slowly rubbing his gut, letting out a content sigh before looking down at you and realizing what he actually just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, err sorry David, work shirts never fit me well and it's one of my simple pleasures to remove them at the end of a day and enjoy the freedom of it. I can put it back on if you want me too if you're uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, it's fine, it's just you have a really great body Joseph, like I'm fighting the urge to touch you right now, haha.\" You said the last part as a partial joke but Joseph seemed to take it a little serious however. He bounced his pecs and gave you a warm smile while raising his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah I see I have an admirer then, would you like too?\" He said in a seductive voice. You look away, embarrassed and not sure what to say. You'd never had a relation or long physical interaction with an anthro. And of course this was your manager so this could influence your work life for years to come. You decide.... </span></div></div>",

Your friend Mack laughed as he pushed open the door to the strip club, you were riding on his shoulder and super excited. Mack was a chubby Leopard in his late twenties, and your childhood best friend. You two did almost everything together, and when you found out that both of you had the hots for the same gender, things got even better. Today you were celebrating your birthday at the strip club, and there was something even better. The Dirty Dusk, the club you were trying tonight, had just opened a new stage to the public, one for human viewers only that they were calling the Humane Hall. The stage room was actually a small room for the anthro stripper with a pole in the center, and the walls were copious amounts of balconies that human spectators viewed from, leading to A LOT of close encounters with tongues, bulges, asses, and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't wait Mack, I hear my favorite dancer is going in the Humane Hall tonight.\" You say gripping the shirt of Mack tightly. He glanced at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It gets better bro, I rented you the VIP spot.\" He said giddily. Your mouth dropped open. The VIP spot was a Cantilevered balcony that protruded out a good foot in anthro measurements into the stage, and was about level with most dancers waist, which of course meant a lot of close, personal encounters with the dancer. This on top of that alot of dancers use the VIP in their act, it was certainly going to be an interactive night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mack how much did that cost? I don't know how to thank you!\" You say running awkwardly down his shoulder and hugging his fuzzy neck. He purred and blushed, before holding up his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Send pics, I hear that your favorite has been using your spot as a dildo, not sure if its true, but snap some pics if he starts. Now here's your stop.\" Mack grabbed you with a practiced  motion and placed you on a human walkway which led into a neon filled tunnel. You walked into the hall and came to a kiosk where a gentleman had a clipboard. You gave your name and he had you fill out some paperwork that had some stuff on it so if you got hurt it wasn't the clubs fault yada yada. You were escorted to an elevator that led down and opened to a balcony that was extremely narrow and surrounded by glass, at the end of it was a chair with a seat belt on it. You looked at it than looked around. The stage hall was cast in pink and blue neon light from the ceiling and lights that lined the numerous human balconies that had hundreds of human silhouettes bustling anxiously for the show to begin. You felt numerous eyes on you as the guide that had followed you out began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The dancer is gonna greet you and include you in the show kid, at some point he's gonna ask if you wanna get personal. If you say yes, the glass walls around the balcony will retract and you'll be in contact with him, when he tells you to buckle up, you better buckle up, this things only been open a month and already two humans have gotten a ride backstage in the dancers rear, followed by a ride to the hospital shortly after. Just do what he directs and you'll do fine. Have fun. The guide said before walking away. You took a seat in the chair, not buckling up and after a few more minutes the lights dimmed and the crowd roared, you rocked back and forth, suspense killing you as your favorite dancer emerged through some curtains on the other side of the room...he stood tall and beautiful, his perfectly sculpted body catching the neon within his curves and giving him an alien glow....he was a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Goliath stepped through the curtain, his silver coat reflected the blue neon light with such intensity for a moment that many audience members were made visible in the dark room. A cheer erupted as he strode in, and he loved it obviously. Despite his bulk and size, the gargantuan horse, who had a good foot on Mack, moved with an otherworldly grace. He had a huge chest and rippling abs that seemed like a moving valley. Goliath however had another nickname that related to what he was best known for, the Devourer, and as he strode in he pivoted on his feet to demonstrate how he gets the name. Being a horse, Goliath was blessed with a large butt, add that he was a belgian draft to it and he gets bigger back there, and on top of that genetics and a good diet have given this stallion an otherworldly ass. Goliath turned around, wearing nothing but a black thong and a bowtie, and the crowd erupted again at the celestial body in the middle of the room, his cheeks looked like silver planets, and complimented his back and thighs perfectly. Goliath knew what he had so he had gotten his tail docked so that he could show off his goods better, leaving nothing but a short stub that draped over his upper glutes. the horse backed up and let his cheeks slide around the pole until they had completely gone around it and met upon the other side, completely embracing the metal object in a glute grip. People cheered again and the horse stepped around until his enormous bulge was only meters in front of you. He looked around the room until his gaze came to you and he lingered for a bit before smiling deeply and true, your heart melted. He began to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks for coming out Ladies and Gents to my show tonight, I plan to give you quite the spectacle. Tonight I'll be taking it nice and slow. We also have a birthday boy who's gonna help me out, give it up for Alex!\" He said presenting a face up hand at you, leading to another round of applause, you blushed at the attention. Music began and Goliath reached behind himself and grabbed the pole and began to dance moving in a way someone that large shouldn't be able to. After a few moves his act picks up with him and he interacts with the audience more, like slowly rubbing his chest up the walls, allowing himself to be stroked by dozens of hands, his groin greeting the lower levels. One guy tried to cling to the thong material, but Goliath looked down and saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah, none of that now, don't need you to fall now.\" He said like a teasing lover, and the guy let go. It was at that point you noticed the earpiece in his ear and the camera in the corner of the room, so someone was watching for anybody that tried to hitch a ride apparently. Goliath hooked his thumbs int the thong and in slowly worked it off as the night went on, eventually exposing his sheath and balls to the audience, being greeted with a roar of lustful screams. The stallion danced in a way where his rear found itself right in front of you and in your daze of awe at the size of them, Goliaths voice reached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to give Alex here a little tour, where few humans have gone before. Wish him luck everybody!\" Cheers erupted again and the Cheeks became larger until they were on either side of your position. Flesh pressed against the glass and pretty soon you were concealed within the ass crack of your favorite dancer. The neon light that ran on the floor of your viewing platform lit your vision as you watches tonnes of muscle and fat slide by across the glass. Your breathing got heavy and the front of your jeans strained as Goliath slid further and further onto your observation point. After a minute of slowly easing onto you, the core of Goliaths ass came into the light. His dark grey anus pressed against the glass, basically encompassing it as it emerged. The puffy ring was quite a bit bigger than you and it clenched slowly, as if winking. An intercom came on suddenly and made you jump out of your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Alex, I'm watching on cam and Goliath just gave me the signal to ask if you want the glass lowered, he's doing other stuff at the moment but you need to answer fast, Just make su-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES\" you shout suddenly, obviously catching whoever was on the com off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Ohkaaay, anyway make sure your belt is on so you don't get taken into his back stage. Glass lowering in 3, 2, 1....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The glass began to retreat in front of you, retreating to some slot behind you or something. Goliath felt the movement and pulled his pucker off the glass but not out of sight, the way he moved told you he actually enjoyed this part as well. When the glass was gone the hole approached again, being cast in ethereal light. You reached a hand out and stroked the hot leathery surface, causing it to shudder but not retreat. Instead Goliath brought his hole down on you, pulling you in slightly as he began to twerk on the outside. Even in here you could here the roar of the applause as he went to town on your tiny form. It wasn't until you no longer felt the chair and were being lifted up by a sphincters grip that you had not put your seatbelt on. In a slight panic, you thrashed at the hole to try to fall back to the platform, but Goliath had a show to do so he sat completely down, his final move on the VIP you had heard. The chair that was supposed to be your salvation became your damnation as it pressed you up into the hole with a wet pop, and you found yourself in hot, damp darkness. The walls convulsed and squeezed you, claiming their unexpected surprise before Goliath could figure out what had transpired, and you were pulled a little deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoliath felt Alex go inside him, and his presence was still there even after lifting back up a little, uh oh. He signaled the camera that Alex was up his rear and pulled himself off the platform, the audience dying down to murmurs and gasps when they saw their fellow human was no longer present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Always wear your seatbelts folks, its the law. Alex is safe and sound with me though, don't you worry.\" Goliath said putting his hands on his hips like a superhero and the crowd erupted in his chant, these people believe anything. He thanked them for coming out and walked backstage to find Reese, the Rhino security guard, waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go get him out, I gotta throw him to the curb.\" The burly rhino said.

Aren't you gonna get that birthday boy out?\" The rhino said crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, after I get that private lap dance done, that polar bear in room 8 is a pretty affluent dude so I'd hate to keep him waiting.

You couldn't get your bearings and had no idea where Goliaths sphincter had gone. Despite the shear panic you felt, this was actually quite the turn on, you were pretty sure you had creamed yourself at least three times since being pulled in, you had had dreams about being in a situation like this with Goliath, and here you were. Despite the possibility of him twitching could break all your bones, you were extremely content deep down. In a twisted way, you didn't want this to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoliath slowly stepped in to find a polar bear lounging on a bench, wearing a polo shirt and slacks. His eyes quickly scanned the draft horse before making a grunt of approval and Goliath began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an hour his time was up and Goliath stumbled into the locker room, exhausted. He opened up his locker and pulled out his jeans and t shirt and quickly put them on over his thong. He took off the bow tie and threw it back in the locker, grabbed his shoes, and was quickly out the door. What a long day...He climbed into his truck and drove the two miles home to his property out in the woods near town. He went inside his ranch style home and as soon as he was through the door his pants and shirt were back off, it just felt more natural to him that way. He laid down on his couch and began massaging his muscles to work out all the sore spots he had gained. Some dude had pinched a nipple too hard, another squeezed his balls, that one human had gone...was still up his ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shit Oh Shit Oh Shit!\" Goliath began to shout, jumping up and running to the bathroom, grabbing some Vaseline an smothering two fingers with it. He ran back into the living room, laying back on the couch with his legs in the air, he had to use his free hand to open up his cheeks more to get at his hole, damn ass being so big...With a moan he slithered his digits into his puffy ring and began to dig around for the human. Would he still be alive, still concious at most? He felt something and tried to grab it, pressing it into his walls and making him moan more, his confused privates reacted by his cock sliding out of its sheath up his belly, it twitched with every autonomic response due to his insides trying to push his fingers back out. He finally got a good grip and slowly pulled the human out of him. In his moment he chuckled to himself about giving birth to a healthy baby boy. The human...Alex was it? He seemed to be....</span></div></div>",

You look up at your dog daddy, and sigh again, showing off that famous teenage drama. Marcus was well built and in great shape, he didn't look overly bulky but he filled out his clothes more than enough. His pecs swelled with each breath underneath a tshirt with some image of a sloth and the word \"believe\" plastered beneath the image. His stomach wasn't really flabby, but a few beers every other day had been enough to hide his six pack for the past couple years. He wore some gray gym shorts that had ridden up his meaty thighs and he seemed to think going commando was okay as you could clearly see the outline of his sheath and bulbous balls through the thin fabric. His padded feet down on the floor board had on some flip flops. You couldn't see it, but you heard his tail brushing the floor behind him as it slipped through the slot in the car seat for it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glance at Vance, who stared mindlessly ahead. He was larger than Marcus, both due to species and lifestyle. Marcus literally participated in bodybuilding competitions, and was quite successful despite being in his early forties. His tank top left his large biceps exposed and some portion of his bulging pecs. His stomach was pure muscle, and the chair he sat in was struggling to hold all of the man that he was. He felt your eyes on him and his own eyes, green as the passing forest, locked with you and he smiled before going back to the road. In your observation you failed to see Marcus reaching for you, and before you knew it you were whisked up and being cradled in your over affectionate dads grip, canines... Marcus licked you, coating you in saliva and causing you to let out a distressed yell, startling Vance who whirled and glared at Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Marc, we talked about that, licking him is gonna make him catch a cold.\" Vance said staring at the road again. Marcus just looked at you endearingly, and you picked up where Vance left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not 7 anymore where giant dog tongue is fun, I'm sixteen dad, so show me some respect.\" You say, but the thumb and index around you tightened as the sound of the dogs tail picked up intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww listen to you, trying to be big and tough. There's no friends out here to impress Kyle, so you can relax. Here I know a good place for you to chill out, though its probably on the hotter side.\" Marcus said snickering, and before you or Vance could do anything he leaned over and peeled back the neck of Vances tank top, his impressive pecs and cleavage below. You yelp as you suddenly plummet down into the brown hair and muscle, Vance made a \"huh?\" sound as Marcus did that, but you slid a good ways in before the muscles tensed and held you in place. Vance growled, the sound coming from all around you as Vance fussed at Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn dog, why do you have to mess with him so much?...Oh well at least down there you can't bother him for the rest of the trip....\" Vance says as you hear Marcus snicker. It's always been this way, Marcus was loving but would mess with you and Vance often. While Vance was Orderly and Protective. Marcus loved to tease you, and that included you ending up in some pretty awkward situations. Heck one time he had dropped you in Vances underwear drawer just as the Grizzly was leaving the shower, you were stuck in the front of a pair of briefs for two hours before rescue came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" Vance said. You scaled back up the pecs, using the hair as handholds. The muscles relaxed to let you squeeze by and after a minute you popped out of the top of the shirt to see...</span></div></div>",

You had hoped for privacy during this trip but it looked like you'd be sharing the space with the bumbling goofs that you called dads. Nearby a relatively new dock stretched about twenty feet out into the blue lake. Vance threw the car in park and opened his door, stepping into the cool air of the boreal forest. You clung to the neck of the shirt, you had figured Vance was going to get you out, but also remembered he needed his hands free to carry his bag and cooler, so he left you dangling over his chest. If you fell you'd get caught in his cleavage again. Marcus hopped out of the passenger and walked past, you couldn't help but notice the wedgie he had from his gym shorts. His tail wagged lazily over his large cheeks as he walked up and unlocked the cabin door, and Vance began to follow. The bear slapped the shepherds rear and admired the jiggle as Marcus turned and winked at him and you. You groaned in embarrassment as the door finally opened and you all slipped inside. Your assumption was right, the cabin was only one room save for what looked like a bathroom. One corner was the kitchen, another was a couch and lounge chair. The other two had a queen bed and a small table. Vance grumbled disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told them we had a human with us, but I don't see any furnishings...\" The Grizzly said surveying the room. Marcus came up and clapped him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, he can sleep with us. Besides we don't know if this place has feral rats in it anyway.\" Marcus said winking at you. You swallow, feral animals were one of the leading causes of deaths in humans. Humans were easy pickings for almost all of them. Vance pushed Marcus and growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop messing with him Marcus.\" Vance said dropping his bag and the cooler before pulling you out and setting you down on the dining table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only voicing hazards, its not me messing with him. Kyle you'll be sleeping with me and Vance, I'm not having some rat get full on you. Now...\" Marcus said taking off his shirt and tossing off his shorts. You gawk and turn bright red as your dad gets naked just like that. \"Who wants to go swimming?\" Marcus said putting his hands on his hips. Vance sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wear something Marcus, there are other cabins around here and I don't need you giving the Smith Family a show.\" Vance pleaded. Marcus smiled, reaching down and pulling out a red thong, making Vance sigh again. The shepherd slipped into it and put it in place by letting the band go with a snap. He looked at you and you realized he wanted you to go swimming as well. You answer him with...</span></div></div>",

Marcus plucked you up and walked out the door, Vance watching his crazy lover exit with just a thong on. You couldn't help but peak over and watch his bulge flop and bounce around as his thighs bumped it. Marcus strolled down the dock and without warning leaped off the end. You scream as you fly hundreds of human feet down towards the dark water, Marcus took the impact, but you flew out of his hand and splashed into the surface. You sank a few feet down and quickly came back up, looking around bewildered. Waves tossed you about but quickly settled, leaving you bobbing and alone on the water. Marcus suddenly erupted from the water, his coat glistening, and his pecs bounced as he planted his feet on the lake bed, he wiped his eyes and looked down at you grinning, letting his tongue lull out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man thats refreshing, huh kid?\" He says. The water level came mid way up his stomach, but your dad still was towering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, refreshing. I'd like to stay near you though, this pond may have fish in it and I don't wanna get eaten by one.\" You say swimming towards his stomach. Marcus however falls back and begins to paddle away, making you nervous as he smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay laddie have you 'eard of the tales of the furred fish, the carnivorous canine, the dog of death? Well you are about to pay witness to him first hand.\" Marcus said in a pirate impression before disappearing into the water with barely a ripple, leaving you alone again as he messed with you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One time. One time is all I ask for him to take my fear seriously\". You mutter to yourself. A movement and the slosh of water catches your eye to your right but as you turn there was only ripples receding from the point of disturbance. You were genuinely afraid now. In the distance however you saw what made the noise as the tip of Marcus's tail surfaced before disappearing back under the water, you sigh as you watch your dad roleplay a sea monster. At least you thought he was roleplaying until the water erupted beneath you and pearly white canines surrounded you before closing shut, sealing you in darkness. You bounce past Marcus's tongue, which tried to catch you and failed, leaving you to tumble into his throat, the walls of muscle undulating as they took in a morsel, pulling down into the canines body. A gag reflex sounded but wasn't enough to stop your descent into Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus felt Kyle slide right past his tongue and smack into the back of his throat, before his stupid muscles treated his son like a piece of meat and pulled him down. Marcus gagged at the sudden intrusion and sputtered but Kyle was too far down already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\" He said in a strained, choking voice. \"That was NOT how I intended that joke to go.\" He said as the pressure of Kyle dissipated, meaning he had arrived in his stomach. Marcus rubbed his gut and let out a belch on accident, pond water and teenagers made him gassy. He was about to shove his hand into his mouth to puke when Vance came stroding out, the dock protesting the bears enormous bulk with numerous creaks and groans. It appeared the uptight Grizzly had found the swim thong Marcus had bought him and was wearing it well, the Navy blue material held the large bulge in place. Vance rotated before striking a rear lat spread pose, showing off his impressive rear before he turned back around and made a puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Kyle?\" He said a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as you plummet into the dimly lit room that was your dad's stomach. You land with a splash in pond water and melted food, sinking into it before erupting and gasping, sucking in the acrid, stale air. You were still stunned he actually ate you, he had never gone that far before. Looking around reveals the ungodly amount of junkfood he had been eating on the car trip. Half chewed candy bars, beef jerky, cheese sticks, it was all here in some form, and luckily it seemed to have severely diluted the acids potency. The walls quiver and the sound of a belch sounded above, obviously your entrance had let some gas escape. You weren't sure what to do, you had been sat on, forgotten in underwear, and in mouths more time than you can count, but never eaten before. As you stewed for a bit the muffled sounds of your dads going at it could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You SWALLOWED him?\" Vance said exasperated. \"How do you accidentally eat someone Marcus?\" The bear said pacing the dock while Marcus sat still in the water, his ears plastered to his head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was playing as a sea monster and missed him with my tongue, so thats how I guess. And besides he was worried about fish eating him so in a way its better that-\" He began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you believe you're in the right for eating Kyle, get him out now!\" The bear said sliding off the dock towards Marcus. The dog sighed and stuck his hand into his throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls groaned around you and clenched below as you were squeezed into the mass of partially digested gunk before shooting up your dads esophagus and back into the fresh air. You fell back into the pond before emerging, floating among chocolate and meat chunks. Vance sighed in relief nearby and the bears careful fingers retrieved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, look at all that wasted food...\" Marcus said staring at his mess bobbing in the lake. Vance growled at the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you actually live in this reality or are you really just stupid? You eat our son and you're worried about wasted gas station snacks?\" The bear said angrily. Marcus shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle was fine, I knew it the whole time, and I was in the process of getting him out before you distracted me.\" Marcus said as Vance put you on the dock edge. Vance ignored his spouse and turned his full attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright kid?\" He said tenderly. You turned red as he treated you like a kid again, you hated feeling so helpless around these giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it wasn't bad in there, I knew he would get me out despite what it seemed like.\" You say taking a seat on the dock ledge. The bear hoisted himself out of the water, casting you in shadow as he did so. You turn even more red to see him in a thong now, his bulge outlining his thick sheath and house sized balls. With a wet plop, his enormous rear crashed near you, sending out air that blew past you. His thigh was inches from you, and his thick fur clung to the muscles, letting you truly appreciate his build. Marcus came up and Vance let out a warning growl but the dog ignored the bear. He checked you over and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make a great sea monster huh?\" Marcus said as his tail began to create a whirlpool behind him. You hesitated before smiling, for an odd reason, a small part of you wanted to go back in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did scare me dad, so I guess so.\" You say, making the dog laugh. Vance let out his famous sigh again....  </span></div></div>",

He had adopted you when you were six and you've come to know him better than anyone else in your life. He was well fit for his age, being 48 but still his pecs swelled under his tank top and his exposed arms bulged with each movement. His mid section had gone pretty flabby due to all the late night games involving beer, but that's about where his dad bod ended. He wore a size too small pair of plaid pajama pants that hugged his thighs and ass, giving him a permanent wedgie and leaving little to the imagination of what his junk looks like. You looked back up at his face where green eyes glanced at you as he rounded the couch. His ears were cropped and his black and brown muzzle had flecks of white on it to signify his years. He slid past where you were, his stubby tail standing erect over his globular pajama clad rear as he began to sit down on the cushion next to you. It took some willpower not to jump over and get sat on by your godly dad, you had 'slipped' before just to get under him. He was usually lax when it came to instances like that, often laughing them off or play with you for a minute or two to 'teach you a lesson', but you enjoyed it too much and you desired more of it sometimes. When he got settled, you both didn't say anything as he continued watching some gameshow. After an hour or so passed, the front door opened and in walked your older brother Joseph walked in with a book bag slung over one shoulder, and you began to admire him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joe was 23 and in his fourth year of college, where he also was a member of the football(american) team, making your dad prideful and you a bit jealous. He was as tall as his father and had the same fur color and build, only difference was Joe was more fit and his fur was more vibrant than his dad's. He walked by behind the couch and went to his room, probably to change you assumed, you went back to your studying when a vibration shook your couch cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh dad gross.\" You say staring up at your dad, who glanced at you with one eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? Burritos never sit well with me. Besides no one told you to study right next to me.\" He said looking back at the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You told me, you won't let me do it in my room because you don't trust that I'd do it.\" You say giving him a irritated look. Your 'room' was really just a dresser drawer in your dad's room, with a ladder built in to help you in and out, though your dad usually carried you out. Your dad narrowed his eyes while smiling .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh right. Haha oh well.\" He said chuckling as he went back to watching TV. Joe slipped back in the room and took a second looking at something on his phone before taking a seat. You looked up at him, he had decided pajamas were overrated tonight and was just wearing a pair of neon green bikini briefs. His abs rippled with muscle and his pecs slowly heaved with each breath he took. His underwear simply covered the skin as the material was so thin every crease in your brothers sheath and balls could be seen through the fabric. His thighs and calves were huge and could easily crush a human house between them. He finally looked up to see his dad on the left seat and you in the middle so he took a seat on the right side of you before smiling and leaning down too you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heya Shrimp! Studying as usual I see, haha!\" He said as he took a finger and pressed your upper body into the couch firmly before rocking it back and forth over you a couple times. Your dad smacked his hand off you and you got up sputtering and scowled at him. He smiled back, obviously wanting to play with you more but your dad would interfere. Despite the rough greeting, you and Joe loved each other, and often he liked to play wrestle and pin you with different parts of him, his bulge, his butt, his chest, all the while taunting you and not letting up until you acknowledged how great the said area you were under was great and mock worship it a bit. You sometimes relented just to stay underneath him longer. You left your thought only for him to still be staring at you, waiting on you to make your retort at him. You didn't want to anger your dad so you went back to reading your textbook. After a few seconds you heard Joe huff before he threw a leg over his knee and began playing on his phone. The family trio sat in silence for awhile before.</span></div></div>",

He grunted acknowledgment at you before glancing at Joseph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Jo Jo, do your old man a solid and fetch a beer for him, would ya?\" He said propping his feet up on the coffee table. Joseph stood up and walked towards the kitchen, you watched his huge rear as he left. Your dad hollered overhead. \"And find some pants while your in there boy, I'm seeing way too much of you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah.\" A simple reply came from the kitchen, causing your dad to chuckle and turn back to the TV, nudity around here wasn't that big of a deal, sharing your dad's room with him lead too countless times of seeing him naked, he even walked through the living room once when you had friends over naked, giving your friends a show, you had scolded him for it but only got a \"my house, my rules.\" remark. Joseph came back into the living room, tossing a beer at your dad who caught it without looking, before reclaiming his spot next to you. He spread his legs out so you were mere inches from his thighs on purpose to taunt you, before cracking open his beer and taking a swig. You sat up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey can I have some?\". You ask looking back and forth between the large dogs.

Joseph however, being the big big brother he was, wet his finger with the beer, getting a drop on his padded finger and placed it down on the cushion near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on Shrimp, take a taste, rules are meant to be broken.\" Joseph said looking at his father with a smile, who returned the expression with a stern face but didn't say nothing. You climbed up on his finger, the flesh radiating heat and a feeling of security, as you reached down and sucked up the drop, expecting something amazing. Instead you were greeted with a taste of yeast and bitterness. You coughed and sputtered, much to the amusement to the two dogs watching you, who began to laugh and yip like a bunch of coyotes. You fell back and gagged, getting covered in the beer still left on your brother's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was awful! Dad how do you drink so much of that stuff?\" You say looking at the still laughing Dober.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's an acquired taste son, come here you're gonna catch a cold now being covered in that stuff.\" Your dad said, taking his shirt off in a quick motion and tossing on the cushion between him and Joseph, exposing his huge pecs and slight belly. He plucked you off Josephs digit and slid back a bit, getting in a slouched position, and depositing you between his pecs. You laid there awkwardly, feeling like a little kid, and not making eye contact with Joseph who was obviously finding your position funny. You glanced in his direction and froze when you saw what you could've swore was him rubbing his bulge between his thighs at the sight of you between dad's pecs, maybe he was just scratching an itch? Your father helped you along by stretching his shoulders, pulling his pec's apart, letting you slip between them further before relaxing and causing them to pinch you between them. You wiggle a bit to get comfy as the family settles and begins to watch whatever the TV was playing. You couldn't help but notice your fathers package in the bottom of your field of vision, the large plaid covered bulge nestled between his beefy thighs. Your father made small talk with you and Joseph as the night went on and would occasionally flex his pectorals to play with you. Finally he stood up, you still in between his pecs and turned, tossing the remote too Joseph, who caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm turning in for the night Joe. What about you Felix? You wanna stay up with Joseph or do you wanna go to bed with me? You look quite comfy so I see no problem having a little father-son sleep over huh?\". He said looking down at you. You thought for a second, you haven't slept in your dad's bed with him in awhile, so turning this down might be a missed opportunity. But Joseph was rarely home anymore, having ton's of friends and responsibilities with football and college, and with dad in bed you two could play around and you could get up close and personal with him maybe. Joseph was looking at you from the corner of his eye, waiting to see if you were sticking with him or pop's. You decide and say... </span></div></div>",

Joseph smiled slightly and wished you both goodnight, also adding that you should come to his room in the morning too play some video games with him or something.Your father walked into his room and threw back his covers, before glancing down, you thought he was looking at you but after a second you realized e was looking at his pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatcha think Felix? Should I take them off or keep them on?\". You blinked and looked at him, not only were you sharing his bed with him tonight, but he could be naked as well? He'd never done that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, your house, your rules dad. I know you get hot in those tight things but you do what you want.\". You say, hoping he does. And he did. Your Father hooked his thumbs into the waistband and shimmied the pajamas down to his ankles, the action bunching up his pecs and smothering you in their flesh and fur.When he stands back up he kicks the pants to a corner before turning off the light and jumping into the bed, not pulling up the covers yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"See ya in the morning son, stay on my chest though, don't wanna squish ya.\" He said closing his eyes. He was out in 10 minutes, snoring off the beer with a deep slumber. You wiggle out of his pecs and look around in the dim light. You only sources being a nightlight near the bathroom and light coming under the door to the living room, signifying Joseph was still in there. You climb on top of your dad's left Pectoral and surveyed his body. He never got around to pulling up the sheets so his privates were exposed to the cool air of the room. His large sheath hiding his member from view, and tan balls drawn up slightly but still loose between his thick thighs. You slide down his pec and begin your trek across his soft stomach, the flesh caving in and making it hard to stay upright and causing you to fall a few times. Soon you reached his soft but slightly firm pelvic area and were able to walk right up to the lips of the sheath. You reached up a shy hand and touched the skin of the sheath, scared to do too much or else you may wake him up and any chance of this happening again may not occur. After a moment you slowly stroked the flesh and put a little more pressure behind the touch. Your dad snored away, obviously unfazed by his small son touching his privates. You were too scared to try to get inside the sheath at the moment so you went around the side of it, keeping a hand on it as you slowly made your way to your dad's large fuzzy balls, each one many times bigger than you. You slowly got down onto your rear and slid out onto the loose skin between the orbs, the flesh out here reminding you of a water bet slightly. You settled here for a time, listening to the chorus beneath you and enjoying the heat, after a moment....</span></div></div>",

C'mon Felix, let's go.\" Joseph said standing up and scooping you into his palm and trekking off into his room. A musky smell hung in the air and as Joseph turned on the light you were greeted with the sight of clothes slung all around the place. Joseph deposited you in a rugged recliner in a corner of the room as he turned on the gaming system and grabbed his controller and a tiny box that contained your controller. You watched him as he moved around the room, his brief covered bulge swaying with each step he took and his huge bubble butt bounced as his hips swayed. You didn't notice him ever notice your observation, but he responded to it regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your definitely taking a good gander at me aren't ya shrimp?\" He said finally turning and looking at you after putting a fighting game in the system.

Your physique is quite impressive.\" You said looking over your shoulder. A shadow loomed over you and you looked up to see a brief clad butt hanging over you. Joe's cheeks swallowing the material and being visible through the slightly translucent briefs. looking past the mounds your brother looked over his shoulder with a large smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I have grown Felix, thanks for the compliments, but I know exactly what you were doing, you're the age where all that goes through your mind is lust. We got all night so let's play some games.\" Your brother said sitting down, you dove forward as his butt slammed down where you were just sitting. You stared back at the large package now before you as Joseph chuckled, handing you the box and selecting play options. You sat up and got your controller, Joe took the box away and looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well get comfy bro, I need to beat you fair and square.\" He said, he himself shifting back and forth, his package sliding slightly across the cushion. You look up at him, and then look around trying to decide where to sit. \"Here let me help.\" He said, picking you up and setting you on top of his brief clad balls. You freeze, not sure what to do. The flesh beneath you giving as you sank into it, like a big bean bag chair. You look up again at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, this isn't uncomfortable for you?\". You say.

You decided to go with it, choosing your character and settling back into the damp fabric and enjoying the warmth of your bro's balls. You stayed there for some time, talking smack but ultimately losing most of the matches against Joe. You had gotten comfortable, constantly shifting around and patting the large sack you were on every time you won a round as a sort of mock consoling to your bro. You talked with him a good bit as well, holding the longest conversation you'd had with him in a year. Soon you both began to grow bored and decided to do something else.

As he does so he slips off the tight briefs and lets them drop to the floor and you look away red in the face. \"Dude, okay what are you doing?\" You say as he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're not fooling me kid, I know you enjoy me, so lets get a little closer huh? and don't worry I'm well practiced at throwing my weight around so you'll be fine.\" he said leaning down and putting his hands on his knees, his colossal balls dropping down a little to cool from the recent confines of the tight briefs. \"Take off your clothes Felix, this'll be fun I promise.\" He says with a sly expression. Not wanting to kill his mood and also deep down wanting to be smothered by his alpha body you comply and take the same stance as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And...Begin!\" He says leaping across the room like a predator trying to grab you, in the past he always began like this so you instantly sprinted as fast as your one inch frame could go through the carpet to the right, just narrowly dodging the crashing bulk of canine which sent tremors through the house, that was new, and scary how much more he weighed. This game wasn't really wrestling, it was more 'Felix dodges Joseph until Joseph catches and does what he wants'. You wanted to be caught, but that was no fun to just let him have you, although now he wasn't clothed so it was more tempting to be caught. You were so caught up in thought you didn't see him quickly slide up and predict where you were heading and with an audible <i>plop</i> your world became warm and dim. A chuckle resounded from somewhere and suddenly, warm furry flesh pinned you to the floor...You were under Josephs...</span></div></div>",

You paled and finally realized where you were. Everytime you had wrestled Joseph had had some form of clothing on, but now that he was nude, you had no issue sliding into his ass crack. Another clench and he pulled you further in with such precision that you wondered if he had practiced for this moment. You laughed nervously and let him have his way for a minute before lifting your hand and tapping the fatty wall to let him know you give. The clenching stopped for a second but then continued, pulling you upward into his cheeks. You shout at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Joey! I give up! Get me out now!\" You yell as another clench, long and drawn out, squeezed you even further upward.

You let out a scream and instantly start punching and kicking your brothers enormous sphincter, which in turn he just laughs at. The hole could easily swallow something twice or even three times your size, and the way it was pulsing you couldn't help but think you were on the menu. You shout out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Joseph I give! Just get me away from you asshole!\" You say trying not to touch the gray/black flesh.

I won't tell anyone, promise!\" He says like he was on the edge of his seat. You groan, and with little dignity, lean in and plant your face as far as you can, but as you'repressing your face in, Joseph relaxed and your head went in with a soft pop. Before you could react, Joseph seized you and with a loud squelch, sucked you into him with one clench. You were dazed for a second, but the searing walls and abhorrent smell told you where you were, and instantly you began to freak out, punching and kicking at the walls around you in an attempt to break out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"JOSEPH, GET ME OUT NOW OR I'M TELLING DAD.\" You yell at the top of your lungs but no response came except for distant groans and squelches of the canines digestive track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck me, that was good.\" Joseph said standing up and rubbing his lower belly, his cock at full mast and dripping what was left of his orgasm. Felix was still banging away, and he knew he had to get him out before it gets to the point of where he tells dad and Joseph isn't allowed to ever even talk to his little human bro again. He couldn't help it though, at a Frat party there was a human that climbed into his ass and gave him the best orgasm Joseph had ever had, and he needed that experience again. Joseph cleaned up the mess he made as fast as possible and let his cock recede back into his sheath before climbing onto the bed and spreading his cheeks before pushing his brother out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The walls finally clench up and squeeze the life out of you before you slid back through the dark hole and fell a bit before landing on a soft surface. Looking up you saw the asshole winking before Joseph let go of his cheeks and they made an audible smack, sealing away the cursed hole. Joseph grabbed you and pulled you in front of him before sitting down, and you looked at him with the most hateful expression you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell was that Joseph? You just ate me with your ass! Do you think I enjoy that?\" You say to him, in which he glances down a bit and smiles. You blink and do the same and turn bright red at the erection you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I would say you did. So what do you wanna do now, its your turn to decide, I had last choice so its only fair you get to choose what we do next,\" He said happily. You rub your chin, looking around the room, and then back at Joseph, and then his chest, and then his colossal junk really close to you, you smile and say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyrannosaurus Rex. Your dads eyes were half closed, obviously exhausted from his day at the construction site. He wore nothing but a small tank top that didn't quite cover his belly, and a pair of grey compression boxer briefs. The rough skin of his belly was a cream color while his back, arms, head and limbs were marbled stripes of orange and brown. His whole body was covered in a layer of fat, but not enough to make him look squishy, if anything it made him look stronger and more formidable. His dulled eyes glanced down at you as he sat down on the cushion next to your right, his huge rear sending a shock wave through the couch as he made impact. He let out a huge sigh as his thick tail slid out from behind him and draped itself off the couch on his right. You glance at him as he begins to eat vigorously, obviously the day didn't go very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rough day dad?\". You say without looking up at him, the scraping of the plate slowed as he cleared his mouth of food before speaking. And when he finally did with accidental authority, being the foreman will do that to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"More than rough, some idiot decides to drop a bunch of steel today, it took out a good portion of the projects left wall, and that's gonna take a whole nother' week to fix.\". Your father said with renewed anger. You close your textbook and walk over to your dad, where he picked you up and placed you on his bare thigh without much thought before going back to eating. He had found you on a job site when you were four, when a bunch of his men had found you and were goofing around with you in a fun but rough way. From the way your dad told it, he made it sound like they were all but about to kill you, but you knew most of the guys and knew none of them would do anything like that. He had put out a child found statement with the police, but months went by and no one claimed you, so James, your new dad adopted you as his own. Now you sat on his naked thigh, rubbing it to try and calm your dad. Anthros always relish in the touch of humans, it's unknown why but the minute touch of a human seems to release chemicals in the brain that relax them a bit. As you rubbed at the soft flesh under his rough skin, you couldn't help but let you eyes drift to the large package that the compression boxers were hugging and keeping in place. The outline of your dads mammoth balls and monolithic sheath could easily be seen through the fabric. You weren't unfamiliar with the sight of his package, sometimes you and your dad even take showers together, and sometimes when he is dead asleep you venture down and touch his privates, but have never dared to climb on them or try to get in his sheath. Your massage didn't seem to be helping your father much, as he still looked quite pissed. You look at his bulge one more time and decide you were gonna risk it, at most he'll probably tell you not to do that and place you back to your books. You stand up and walk down his thigh towards his knee and halfway you drop onto your rear and slide down his inner thigh. Your father glance down, thinking you slipped and a hand appears but you wave it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine here dad.\" You say and begin to massage his inner thigh, the hand hovers a minute before he shrugs and goes back to eating and watching tv. As the night goes on you slowly drift up his beefy thighs, looking to your left you could see down the incline was what looked like a colossal grey boulder blocking the path in a ravine, as your fathers package was bulged outward and the spandex was pulled taut around it, disappearing and forming wedges between the bulge and his thighs. He didn't seem aware yet that you were very slowly making your way towards his crotch, but he was obviously enjoying your efforts down there as he seemed much more relaxed. Eventually, you were just mere human inches away from the package, which towered way over you, it had a ghostly blue color to it, due to the only light being the tv shining down the canyon of your dads legs, and it gave the bulge an ethereal glow. You could smell the musk coming off his left nut, which was many times bigger than you. You let one hand slowly work its way into the wedge between his balls and thighs, and as soon as the hand wormed its way in the whole thigh tensed at the sudden intrusion. Noise could be heard as your dad sat up slightly to look down at you. You look up to what you expect would be an angry face, but instead are greeted by a look of surprise. Your father stared at your location and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um whatcha doin' there Jamie?\". He asks with a sort of smile forming on one side of his face. You look him in the eye and then back at his bulge, and then back at him and say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I must've gotten to caught up in what I was doing to see I had gotten this far down dad, sorry, you want me to come back up?\" You say removing your hand, which was slightly damp, before stepping away for him to grab you. He didn't reach down for you however, instead he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm no you're fine right there son, in fact, if you could do papa a favor and give the boys there a quick rub, i'd really appreciate it, it's been a long day.\". He says in an almost pleading voice, you...</span></div></div>",

You reached out an experimental hand and pressed it to the crease that was the space between his balls and pushed, your hand easily sinking into the squishy flesh behind the boxer brief spandex. You began to gyrate the hand slowly putting a little more pressure and soon you put your other palm nearby and repeated the movement. Your father slouched back a little above you and let out a long breath, closing his eyes, and obviously enjoying the attention. After a minute you had started to put your entire body into the massage, pressing into the soft flesh with most of your weight and burying your face in the large bulbous scrotum. While you massaged, the boxer briefs became even tighter as a the top of your fathers sheath grew as something partially emerged from it. Your father cleared your books and put them on the table and retrieved you before shifting on the couch to where he lay on his back and placed you on his clothed pectoral and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thanks son, that helped a bit.\" And left it at that. you blinked and looked back down his body, passed where the shirt left his slightly pudgy belly exposed, and where the boxers became less taut as your fathers member slid back into his sheath, the elusive cock still never seen by you. You look back up towards his face where he was looking at the television, his face lit up in that ethereal blue white, years of stress and hard labor evident on his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can help down there some more dad, you just gotta ask, you were obviously enjoying it.\" You say looking up at him. He just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're not some human body servant, Jamie, you're my son, I have to show some decency and restraint with you. I shouldn't make or let you just play with my bits anyway, I already regret making you rub my nuts.\" He said still looking at the TV. Even though he was saying that as a dad thing and meant no disrespect or harm in the words, they still hurt you for some reason. You were immensely attracted to James, and here you were standing on his large chest, and he was essentially off limits to you, sure one day you could find an Anthro friend or Mate that would do all kinds of things with you and their body, but would they ever be the man that James was? A rare species that was built like a mountain and loved you. You sigh and sit down, the flesh under the cotton shirt sinking in at your weight, and you began to absently knead the flesh around you with your hands, your vision darting between the TV and the distant mountain that was your fathers crotch. After about twenty minutes your vision notice something under the tank top not far from you, one of your fathers nipples. You get a wicked smile and stand up and begin to walk, but not directly towards it, instead heading for a small hole in the tank top as if you were examining that. You felt your fathers gaze drift to you for a second but he obviously had little interest in what you were doing and you felt the gaze disappear as soon as it had begun. You walk past the hole and soon find yourself at the short cliff that was the edge of your dads right pectoral and hopped down onto the softer fatty surface that was the beginning of your fathers massive stomach. You turned and kneaded the edge of his pectoral, which twitched a bit at the touch and your father eyed you, the deep green of his eyes shining as he thought about telling you to stop rubbing him. After a moment he seemed to think nothing of it as his chest was probably one of the more sore spots he currently had and welcomed the treatment despite his earlier rant. You slowly worked towards his nipple, and after a few minutes your hands glided over it and you began to knead it like you had the rest of his chest, however at the furthest point of a palm pressing into it, you squeezed it slightly, and in no time you could tell it was getting flushed with blood. You only did the action a few times as-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jamie....\" You look up to see your father looking straight at you with a tired expression. \"I know what you're doing, is playing with my dong really that important to you? I didn't even know you had that kind of attraction to me son, but maybe we should talk about this thing you're trying before you try it, huh?\" You turn red at the words and how easily he figured you out, on the scheme and your sexual preference. You stammer something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'm sorry, it's just that you've been such a good dad and, I thought, if I could do something that made you happy and feel good, that I'd be able to pay you back for at least a little of what you've done...\" You say looking down. Your father rubbed the back of his head and waited a long moment before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Parenthood isn't about reward, it's about results son. I don't want you to give me anything, just your love, but I guess you're trying to give me that in a more concentrated dose at the moment.\" He chuckled. \"I guess since you're a senior in high school now and of age, I can indulge you a bit, just so you no longer have to wonder. I am after all, like you in the sexual preference department, tough I've been too busy to be in the game. Might as well let you have me as a first time so you know a good time from a bad time when you're on your own, just don't expect all of your encounters to be as good as me.\" He lets out a belly laugh, shaking your stunned form. You just nod your head wordlessly as your father scoops you up and carries you to his room. He places you on the bed as he strips of his shirt, and worms his way out of the tight boxers. His tail lashed lazily around above his enormous ass, the globular, fatty muscles painted brown and orange. He turned around to face you and put his hands on his hips, between his legs hung his large, gray cock that was the size of a bus to you, and that was with it flacid. His sheath was bunched up around its base and hanging below were his bulbous balls, each about the size of a human bedroom. He spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jamie, where should we begin?\" You answer him </span></div></div>",

Soon colonies were being established on other planets and entire worlds were being claimed by specific species, leading to Space factions forming akin to the days of stone age tribes. Despite this 'purity' movement, humans were still accepted everywhere and could join any colony without discrimination. Sedimar was still colonized by all races as well as some of it's first colonies, but a majority of the anthro's found themselves on an alien world where only their own species was found, excluding humans. This of course led to some worlds having resources that another did not, and long, devastating faction wars rang out across the stars for said resources.

His slick black and white skin reflecting campfire and highlighting his toned muscles with great detail. He wore a brown leather loincloth that had designs of animals in a tribal fashion weaved into them. A knife hung from the belt of the loincloth, the lower part of it anchored by a strip of leather tied around his enormous right thigh. The Orca sniffed and snorted at the stale air. He glanced over at the jumble of furs that you resided within before slipping back out of the tent. You breathed a sigh of relief, only to inhale sharply as the Orca returned, tugging the carcass of a deer into his tent. Your nose and senses told you of recent death and your flight response wanted to kick in. You however gritted your teeth, knowing this may lead to a chance for a meal. The Orca dropped the deer on the dirt floor, his large tail sweeping behind him as he began to crouch down. His tail passed over you and his enormous rear crashed to the ground in front of the furs. Unlike the front of his loincloth, the back was only a thong in which the leather disappeared into his heavy cheeks. The sound of flint against stone, followed by light erupting to what was still visible past the giant figure told you he had started a fire. The Orca pulled his knife from its sheath and set to work carving the deer. You crouched back down and waited, hoping for an opportunity to grab some cooked meat. Your brief thought distracted you long enough for you to fail to notice the Orca reach behind himself and grabbing the fur above you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With a quick motion he ripped it off, exposing you to the room. You held still, but when your eyes darted to see him setting the fur out next to himself, you relaxed and quickly dove behind a wrinkle in the fur that was still beneath you. You waited for awhile, as the Orca cut up the carcass, placing the red meat onto the fur that had been above you. When he was finished the giant male rotated himself to where he was facing the meat pile. You watched his heavy rear slide, kicking up a storm of dust as he did so. His hands and mouth glistened red in the fire light, from working and tasting his kill it seemed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His knife moved with adept precision as he worked on the slabs of flesh, cutting away sinew and tossing it to the side.

Already one of you had been eaten, another grabbed by an anthro child for a toy, and another unceremoniously shoved into a passing anthros sheath. A sudden thud pulled you from your flashback as you look on to see a small chunk fall off a skewer and land in the dirt. You glance up at the hunters to see they didn't notice, as they were too busy laughing at one of their own making obscene gestures that imitated having sex. With starvation driving you, you squeezed through your bars and fell to the ground on the other side of them, only to spring up and dash for the meat on the ground. Another human yelled after you to come back but you ignored them. After a short while you pounce on your bounty and tear at the slightly cooked meat with hunger, not savoring any as you barely chewed.

Underneath the fur was a beautiful display of large pectorals and abs that rippled with every shift he made. Looking down you saw that this particular Hyena decided loincloths were overrated and instead had opted for nudity, as his large sheath and balls hung free over the edge of the tree stump he had as a seat.

He narrowed his eyes at you before letting them drift to the meat, where he took two fingers and tore off a small piece perfect for you. He gave it to you and you consumed it quickly before looking back up wearily at the Hyena, who let out their famous laugh before leaning back and holding a palm out toward you and looking at his two friends across the fire, who had been watching with dull curiosity the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gentlemen, I present to you Swift, my new companion, may he last longer than Golden Shower, who died living up to his name. No thanks to you Broke-Fang.\" The Hyena said, his eyes narrowing at the hyena closest to him. This hyena had a long loincloth that had many fangs and claws threaded into the cloth, with one fang in the center of the loins belt. The hyena being addressed sneered, exposing that one of his canine fangs was broken, and the one that was left looked just like the one that was the central display on the loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not my fault that rodent couldn't swim, he shouldn't have been standing where I was pointing my cock.\" Broke-Fang said crossing his arms like it wasn't his fault at all. \"Besides Free-Wind, If I recall, half of your 'pets' end up in you anyway, so don't act like the death of your toys is solely on everyone else.\" You gulp at that, this Free-Wind character may be your death yet. A hand gently wrapped around you and rolled you into it's palm, where the giant thumb began to rub your head gently. You froze in terror, knowing one quick jerk from the thumb could snap your neck. Free-Wind spoke to his accuser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not this one, I got a good feeling about this guy, he's a fighter, and I don't eat fighters.\" He says looking down at you with a morbid fascination. The other Hyena spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's shaking like a leaf right now, doesn't look much like a fighter to me.\". You look over at this hyena, who seemed to have an obsession with knives, as he probably had ten to his person, one on each upper arm, one on each thigh, two hanging on a belt around his waist, and four on a bandoleer that ran diagonally across his sculpted chest and belly. The belt also had a shredded loincloth hanging from it, but you could easily see bits of his crotch through the torn material. Free-Wind looked at him, then at you and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh whatever Many-Knives, he's got my blessing so both of you respect that please.\" He said as he moved his hand off his thigh and closer to his body, you looked back, curious to see what he was doing and gasped. The other side of Free-Wind's palm was pressed against the mouth of his sheath, the slit clenching vaguely as if waiting for a meal. You fell on your butt and scooted backwards, which caused Free-Wind to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, Swift, don't run, this is your new home, embrace it, its nice and warm on a cold desert night like this and cooler than the searing day, you'll love it.\" He said shaking his palm and tilting it causing you to begin sliding towards it. You weren't buying it, the musk alone was potent enough to almost knock you out, inside was probably ten times worse. Also you had heard tales of humans even being consumed by anthro cocks, and a few humans in this very camp claimed they had been to the depths of an Anthro's balls and made it back out. Either way you weren't keen to become a human that doesn't make it out. Your legs make contact with the soft sheath and instantly you could see the lips relax, swallowing your legs to their knees, causing you to make a frantic yelp. THis of course caused all the Hyenas to begin laughing. Free-Wind tilted his hand vertical and you descended up to your chest in the sheath before suddenly the lips contracted and kind of held you in place. You kick your legs but find them wedged in the oily leather walls below, making their movement slow, and they felt no presence of the canine cock who's residence was the sheath, it must be further below. Free-Wind let out a content sigh and put his hands on his hips, proud of his new catch. You tried to pull yourself free with your arms but the plump lips of the sheath gave way to easy to your pushing and the interior walls clamped down harder in response to your attempt of removal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"None of that now Swift, I give you food and a home and you try to leave? Humans, they want something and so you give them it and then they don't want it.\" Free-Wind said, his friends laughing with him. This went on for a few minutes but soon they grew tired of taunting you and went back to cooking and storytelling. You sigh and prop a hand under your chin and let your elbow dig into the sheath lips as hard as you could, to no avail as Free-Wind seems undisturbed. He probably has had so many humans in your spot that anything you do to try and hurt him or make him uncomfortable has been attempted before. So you just watch the giants talk around you and listen to the fire and sizzling of fat. You glance over the lip of the sheath to see how far down you'd drop if you managed to slip out, and confirmed that you wouldn't survive. your gaze drifted from the ground to the huge balls of Free-Wind, which could easily fit you and maybe half a dozen more humans inside comfortably, they swayed at every tap from your masters thighs and shift of his hips, lightly slapping the wood of the stump behind them. Satisfied with your observation, you found yourself quite tired, but hard to fall asleep with your upright position. You sigh and await Free-Wind to finish his dinner, hoping you can escape when he retires to his tent....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Free-Wind failed to retire after his dinner it was at that moment you remembered that Hyena's active at night as well as day. Your captor laughed and told hunting stories with his pals, slowly forgetting about the human hanging halfway out of his plump sheath. You sway slowly, realizing you were in for a long ride here. Some other Hyena walking by began talking to Free-Wind, making him turn around on his stump to speak better with the newcomer. As he turned your view from between his thighs changed, going from just looking at two Hyena's tearing off meat on a fire to a view of a good portion of the camp. The night was dotted with at least 40 more campfires like the one you now sat at now, or rather hung at. Hyena's danced and wrestled at these oasis's of light, sending shadows dancing all around in a eerie fashion. Their eyes caught the slightest of light, making them glow even if they weren't even close to a fire. You shiver at the sight of the malicious giants that ruled your kind and drifted your vision to where the cage of captured humans were, and your heart went into your throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cage was now empty, and a Hyena sat nearby with red warpaint on his arms and chest, as well as his thighs. He was in a relaxed prone state, licking his lips and rubbing his slightly chubby mid-section as if he just enjoyed a meal. You let out a loud gasp that caused the ears of Free-Wind and his friend to twitch and them to look at you. Free-Wind blinked, obviously just remembering you were there, and then he followed your gaze and letting out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha! Looks like Fights-Anyone deemed your friends delicious Swift, they no doubt fought valiantly against his tongue and inner workings.\" He said looking down at you, his companion eyeing you as well before rolling his eyes with a smile and walking off. Upon hearing his name, Fights-Anyone got up and walked over. You watch with new found fear as the obviously brawny Hyena approached. His muscles weren't as defined as Free-Wind, but rather they were covered in a layer of fat, giving him a larger, more imposing appearance. His belly rippled with each step he took and he wore a loin cloth that was stained with various blotches of brownish red spots and smears. Free-Wind smiled at the fellow Hyena, who gave him a clap on the shoulder in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I heard my name Free-Wind, do you want to Fight?\" He said in a dull deep voice, saying the statement in a way of greeting instead of a threat. Free-Wind stood up and embraced his friend, pressing their bodies in full body hug. Free-Wind's sheath was pressed into the fabric of Fights-Anyone's loincloth, his sheath smothering you from behind the fabric. Being so close to the loincloth let you deduce the stains were in fact blood stains, and if you remembered correctly, this particular Hyena gets in fight's constantly, and when he wins he dabs his loincloth onto a bloody nose or cut of his beaten opponent, taking it as a trophy. The reason they were hugging in such a passionate manner as well was due to them being blood-brothers or even mates possibly. As you still continued to be pressed into the loincloth, muffled cries could be heard from somewhere past the fabric. Before you call out however, they broke the embrace, and you watched the bulge behind the loincloth slide out of your range, and with it the cries for help. Free-Wind spoke high above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No need for that my Friend, no I was just explaining to my new pet here that you were a worthy adversary for his friends that I assume you just ate.\" Free-Wind stated, gesturing to you. Fights-Anyone looked down at you and blinked before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha ha ha as if! I'm pretty sure their battle cry was something like 'Please don't kill me!'. Truly brave, that. If it's any condolence, they aren't dead yet, I can feel them still kicking in here.\" He said slapping his belly. \"And of course there's the two I got marinating right now for a later snack.\" Fights-Anyone said, lifting up his loincloth and exposing his large sheath and balls. His other hand reached down and rubbed at the top of his balls and bottom of his sheath. \"They're too deep to see on the surface, but the two most squirmy earned the right to stay under my knot tonight, They will no doubt taste amazing in the morning.\" He said with a toothy grin, letting his loincloth cover up his crotch again. You gagged at the thought of how he treated your kind, like candy it seemed. Fights-Anyone dropped to one knee, his nose inches from your face as he inhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You smell sweet little guy, I bet you'd taste amazing.\" He said as his tongue went up underneath Free-Wind's balls and up his sheath before the large pink muscle plastered you in saliva. A quiver ran through Free-Wind as the tongue retreated, a strand of saliva connecting it with you as he stood back up to full height, severing it finally. \"You're good, but not ripe yet.\" He jested before pressing a fist to Free-Wind's chest and walking away, His enormous back and ass contorting and shifting with each of his foot falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He like's ya!\". Free-Wind said, as if that was a good thing. Free-Wind looked longingly after Fights-Anyone before reclaiming his spot on the stump and continuing his stories with Broken-Fang and Many-Knives. The saliva cooled quickly as did the night air, and you soon found yourself shivering uncontrollably, your upper half at least. You look down at the lips holding you, and grimace, thinking about the two poor souls at the bottom of Fights-Anyone's sheath. The cold was getting unbearable though and you needed shelter. With deep inhale, you attempt to wiggle deeper into the plump sheath of Free-Wind. He feels your struggle and relaxes his grip, letting you slide in with gravity alone all of a sudden. You are enveloped in darkness and musk as you...</span></div></div>",

He typically was known for his short temper and he quickly dealt with people who have wronged him, sometimes personally executing them on the spot. This cruel justice was not biased as human servants suffered the brunt of this. Being a figure of power, Remius delighted in playing with his human servants and slaves, and not really watching out for them as he went about his day. Half a dozen humans perish in the Royal Palace daily, and almost all of them were from Remius. He would crush them, eat them, shove them into his orifices, or call over an anthro slave or servant and have them do something with a human. You had been at the palace for a month now, and somehow had managed to survive despite being classified as one of the Emperors body slaves, which had the shortest longevity of any servant in the palace. You were respected by almost all the other servants in the palace, and even some of the royal guard had taken note of your resilience. Despite this, Emperor Remius still hadn't acknowledged you or was even aware he had a human body slave that has tended him for over a month and was still kicking...until one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You scrubbed as hard as you could muster on the wooden surface, the smell of Varnish burning your nostrils. You worked in silence with three other slaves nearby, working on the same task as you, which was maintenance on Remius's favorite balcony chair. You weren't exactly assigned this work by him, as you were all body slaves, but he had forgotten to bring you all with him as he got up and went elsewhere, and a passing guard assumed you were there to clean and maintain so he had fetched some varnish and given it to you. One slave threw down his rag and cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is pointless! Why are we even trying! We all know all of us will be dead within a week, might as well enjoy our time as long as we can.\" He said looking around at you and the other two slaves. No one spoke or made eye contact with him, as to get tied up with his treacherous act would mean death also, there were ears everywhere in the palace. The slave speaking out, as well as you and the others wore nothing but a subligaculum, a leather loincloth that wrapped around you to make a brief like cover. Most slaves walked around in one, but other inhabitants either wore flowing robes, armor, or nothing(Like Remius). The slave looked at the others and scoffed when suddenly all of you were cast in shadow. You all look up to see a Ram in a silver and gold breastplate looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Slaves, his majesty is looking for you and is quite displeased, come with me now.\" The Ram said in a professional manner, outstretching an open palm for you all to climb into. You and the other two go with no questions asked, but the outspoken one stood there with his arms crossed. He looked up at the Ram and spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm no slave, I'm a prisoner. And besides, his 'majesty' got up and left us on the arm rest here, knowing damn well we can't get down from here and follow, if he wants me he had to come back and get me.\" He says, not moving. You blink, watching this spectacle, this man had to be insane. The Ram tensed up beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You forget your place maggot, and if you weren't requested right now i would smash you to paste under my heel. But rather, I will let his majesty deal with you himself.\" The Ram said, grabbing the rebellious slave and yanking him up with his free hand, making him let out a painful cry. You were carried down a couple halls and past many open rooms before you were brought into one that had a large ottoman bed in the center where Remius lay propped up on one elbow, his sculpted nude body displayed to the room. Two Royal guard were at the back at the room, playing some kind of game with marbles, they could be distinguished from other guards by their gilded gold armor with emeralds inlaid in the breastplate and a forest green cape hanging from their shoulders. One of them was a White horse and the other was a Red Fox, Aegis and Maximus if you remembered correctly. A bull and wolf slave stood on the other end of the room with hands clasped waiting to be called upon. Remius paid no mind as the Ram soldier approached him, as he was caught up in a gladiator fight happening in front of him. A Rhino was swinging a spear wildly at a Tiger, who was using just a sword to parry the jabs, they were both only in subligaculum as well, and their muscles swelled with severe use, sweat gleamed off of them and the tiger had a gash that was bleeding a good amount underneath his right eye. The soldier gave them a wide berth and approached Remius, The Royal Guard paid no heed but you knew they were ready to pounce if he was an assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here are your Body Slaves your Holiness.\" The ram said bowing his head and placing you and the other two on the edge of the ottoman, while dropping the rebel on his butt closer to Remius. The Emperor didn't look over but waved the Soldier away, who left the room in an instant. You didn't hesitate as you walked past the rebel slave and dropped to a knee and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We are here at your call my lord, permission to service you?\" You say keeping your head bowed but eyes up to watch for a somatic response. Rather, Remius turned and looked at you with a peculiar smile and actually spoke directly to you, a rare thing for him to do to a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My my, someone knows exactly how I like it, rarely does a slave perform my required etiquette before engaging me. You must be well trained, unlike most of these captives that they bring to tend me. Tell me Slave, what market do you hail from so that I may request more of you?\" He says with a smile that warmed and chilled you at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The same market as all before my Lord, I just have been in your service for a month now and watched where others failed, I took my time to see what you preferred and what invited your wrath.\" You say keeping your head down still. A chuckle escaped Remius, a sound rarely heard as it made the Gladiators stop and the Royal guard to pause in their game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Truly? So this means you are a veteran at tending me?\" He said in a jestful way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No my Lord, not in the slightest, but if you give me the opportunity I may become one given time.\" You say. Remius propped himself up a little more, his chest swelling as his muscles contorted under his shining short coat of cream and tan fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So be it, this is quite an interesting development, I was not aware one had lived so long under the duty of tending me. I will be more cordial with you and name you head of the body slaves, first of the title. Don't mess up now...er do you have a name?\". He asked politely. You hesitated, fearing this was all a jest and he was just going to kill you at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The only thing I have is my slave number, which is K390.\" You say sorrowfully. Remius clicked his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...you'll be Kay from now on, relish in the pleasure of being named by Emperor Remius, Kay.\" The Buck said, actually holding a smile for once, which instantly faded when the rebel spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All of our slave numbers start with a letter, am I M now? You don't get to-\". The rebel was suddenly lifted high in the air and held in front of Remius, who frowned at the slave in between his thumb and index. He glanced at the gladiators who still stood there staring and they flinched under his gaze, instantly resuming their fight and filling the room with clatter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You deplorable insect, you misunderstand. Kay gets a name because he proved himself. You get nothing because you are nothing.\" As Remius speaks you notice his sheath relax and slide back as his pale, pink member erected itself over you and the other two body slaves. You whisper back to them, taking on your new role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lesson one, don't speak unless spoken to during work, only when introducing or moving to a tender location for confirmation. Breaking rules equals death.\". You say somberly. Remius continued releasing his cock, the member dwarfing all of you as he rolled onto his back and inserted the rebel up to his neck in his cock head. The rebel, who was indeed crazy spat insults at the Buck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You Royal Bastard, you killed my country! You won't kill me! I'll kill you! I will aven-!\". He was cut off as Remius placed his thumb on the rebels head and let his dick consume him, a bulge slowly drifted down the length of the cock, wriggling the whole way before disappearing into the folds of the sheath at its base. Remius rolled back on his side and continued watching the fight, after a couple seconds he moaned as one of his enormous balls showed signs of life inside them, muffled screams and curses barely reached your ears as Remius rubbed his balls almost lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fret not slave, for just as your country was absorbed into my empire, your body will be absorbed into mine. So enjoy the hallucinatory madness that envelops you as you are slowly digested by my balls over the next few weeks.\" He said before leaning back into his original position to continue watching his entertainment. A whimper escaped one of the slaves behind you, causing the Buck to look at you and them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Kay? Get to work, I feel the inside of my sheath may need tending, my feet are a tad sore, and my hole may require service.\" He said before looking back onto the fight. You blink before ordering the two slaves to tend to the other two regions as you tend to...</span></div></div>",

You had only been in his ass once and he seemed pleased enough to let you back out, a reward that others that ventured there rarely received. You turned to the remaining two slaves, one of which seemed to have soiled himself from Remius's display, which you really couldn't blame him. There was a common belief in this empires culture that a male anthro consuming a human with his member and digesting them led to strong offspring, so many medical shops sold live humans for that sole purpose, a terrible way to go, but one of many in this cruel world. Remius just did it for pleasure and the rush of power it gives. You point at the soiled one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You tend to the Great One's feet, you don't seem fit to tend his majesty's private regions, and you.\" You say now pointing at the other one who seemed nearly about to soil himself. \"You will climb into his supreme sheath and tend its walls, remember, the goal is not to cleanse but to please, body slaves seem to forget this and it leads to their demise. He is able to cleanse himself and takes insult if you assume you can to better.\" You say before turning and walking across the cotton sheaths towards the monolithic monarch laying on his side ahead, still watching the gladiators. After a few steps you didn't hear anything and turned around to see the other two still standing there, looking grim. You blink and then hiss through your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you doing? Loitering leads to death!\" You say taking another step back towards them. The one who was assigned to Remius's crotch spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It all leads to death, why are you even trying? We are literally deemed parasites, to cling to this buck until he grows tired of our scratching and rubbing and ends us in a uncaring fashion.\" He said glumly. They didn't seem to notice but you could feel cold green eyes on your back, Remius was watching to see how you handled this, or at least was wondering why he still wan't being tended. You cross you arms and ignore the beads of sweat forming on your skin and calmly respond to the gloomy man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Better to have a quick death by being crushed unknowingly rather than being digested in a pool of seed for weeks like rebel is going to suffer. It's bleak but it's life, die now or later, your choice.\" You say, knowing it was not the best morale booster, but it seemed to be enough to get them moving. Gloomy and Soiled looked at each other before trudging off for their respective positions. You take a deep breath and turn around to see Remius smirking at you with an eyebrow raised, before mouthing the words 'We'll talk later'. You bow before walking underneath the arm propping up his elbow and rounding to where his large back was to your right. Muscles contorted and flexed softly beneath his shining coat and you couldn't help but admire what a magnificent specimen he was. Looking down the length of his back, a docked bushy tail stood erect and pressed against his lower back, the underside faced outwards towards the two royal guards that were at a table a few meters from the ottoman bed. Past the tail was your destination, two enormous globes of flesh with a deep crack running between them. Remius's Left hand was resting on top of the upper cheek in a relaxed state as he continued to watch the gladiators fight, the hand slowly rubbing his fleshy mound obviously admiring one of his most famous features. His ass was usually accentuated in many statues and paintings, as well as his scrotum and pecs, having these three features in a large and refined state was a status symbol in the empire, and the Emperor was not lacking anywhere. You took another deep breath and slid down the slope that Remius's weight created on the cushions. When you bumped into the spongy flesh of his ass, the muscle under the fatty layer twitched and Remius looked back at you and smiled before sliding his left hand slide down and gripped his cheek, pulling it up and exposing more skin that his crack had obscured. You looked up into the abyss, still not seeing your destination, but Remius's eagerness to accept you into it will speed up the process. You place both hands on the steep incline of the lower cheek and crawl your way up and into the Buck's ass crack, when you were a good ways in, Remius let go of his grip and the cheek settled back into place with a muffled slapping sound. Now in total darkness you crawled towards your destination, the fur getting more thin the further you went. Remius was surprisingly being gentle with you, as if something was crawling in your ass, you'd have unconsciously clenched and restrained it. The air was filled with the stench of scented body oils and perfumes, hinting that Remius had recently bathed and cleaned himself up. But despite this the hint of his natural musk was in the back of your senses. Your observation was cut short as the your hands met a sudden steep incline filled with crevices that ran up until they met at a shallow uneven cavity that could no doubt be the Emperor's holy sphincter. The cheeks diveted near it, which made a small pocket that you could slide up onto your knees within. You take a deep breath and reached out in the darkness, your hands meeting the cavity and running their ways to either side of it. The walls shuddered in anticipation but the Emperor showed resolve and stayed relaxed. You leaned in and planted your face into the cavity, opening your mouth and working your tongue through its crevices, being the only being in the world that could bring an emperor to his knees and not be executed for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remius lifted a cheek to help Kay on his way to his hole, tantalizing at the thought of having him inside of his ass. He was already on a dominant streak, feeling the tiny rebel still thrashing blindly in his right nut, stimulating him and making him want to jerk him back out and consume him again. But no, He needed to perish and in the most humiliating way possible.The other two body slaves scurried to where Kay had ordered them, the one that seemed to have no hope scurried up onto Remius's inner right thigh and looked quizzically at the bundle of skin resting around the still exposed member of his Master, obviously trying to figure out some way not to become trapped in its depths. Remius watched him from the corner of his eye as the one he would call Gloom treaded uncomfortably across his groin, obviously unaware that his minuscule weight could still irritate his lord in his sensitive spots. Gloom halted and stared at the bulbous balls near him and seemed to watch in fear as the occasional bump from rebel could be seen, after a couple seconds his primate brain seemed to finally tell him that he shouldn't dally lest he end up there as well, and he proceeded to climb into the sheath lip against the towering member, disappearing from sight but not touch. Remius let out a soft groan as the human Gloom sank deeper into his cock pocket, squirming in a slightly panicked style to try to right himself. His enjoyment was halted when he caught the scent of fear piss on the air and looked to see the other human at about his knee, making his way for his lordly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\". Remius said quietly, as to not halt the gladiators who were taking to long to draw deep blood. The human whirled around and looked as if he heard the toll of death's bells. Remius continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are not in a worthy state to tend me, covered in your own excrement, Aortus!\". Remius said snapping his finger. The Grey wolf hurried over and bowed before him. Remius pointed at the one he decreed as Filth now.<br>\r\n\"Take him to the slave baths and clean him, then return him to me, quickly now.\" Remius said waving his hand. The wolf bowed deeper before plucking filth and taking him away, the stench following him. Remius huffed, and realized Kay was pretty far in and let go of his cheek, letting it drop with a satisfying weight to it. Just as he looked back at the gladiators the Tiger parried a Jab by the Rhino and slid his Gladius across his Thigh, cutting deep and dropping the Rhino to his knees. The Tiger spun his blade and brought it to his opponents throat before looking at the Emperor for judgement, his eyes going from Remius's face to his still exposed cock, to back to his face, swallowing. Remius smiled warmly, giving a thumbs up for the Tiger to spare his foe, who nodded before helping up the Rhino and leaving the room with him. Remius sighed, absently letting his left hand drift to his balls and rubbing them, causing more thrashing. A soft pressure deep between his cheeks made him gasp as Kay had finally found his mark. The human made a surprising impact on Remius's senses, and it took the Bucks full will not to begin jerking it outright. He panted lightly, wanting Kay to quit teasing and to get up inside him already, his hand drifted and let fingers graze his inner cheeks before...</span></div></div>",

The roar of a crowd sounded like distant thunder, and it crescendo-ed in what you assume was one of the performers executing the other. You tensed at the noise, wondering if it was your fellow cell mates demise that they cheered. You'd tended to half a dozen gladiators at this point, cleaning their wounds, keeping them company, and tending to other 'needs' as they requested, whatever kept them sane and happy. Human slaves sometimes found themselves in the job field of being gladiatorial caretakers, and it was honestly better than what other positions were out there. Besides the occasional caretaker being squashed or eaten, deaths in this field compared to other jobs were slim. doors opened and chains rattled as someone was being guided back to their cell, you sat up and scooted to the edge of the cot so you were visible. The cell door swung open and a wolf in roman style armor glanced at you before moving to the side to let the monstrous, muscular gladiator that was your current job lumber in. He was a good head taller than the wolf soldier, and only wore some armored greaves and a loincloth. He was a large...</span></div></div>",

Morum strutted into the room, undoing his belt and letting his loincloth drop to the floor, exposing his colossal junk to swing freely in the small space. The wolf soldier looked at it with huge eyes but kept a straight face. You noted the cut on Morums chest that was somewhat deep and still bleeding and his busted lip where he probably took the butt of a sword to the mouth. Morum was known for letting his opponent get a few hits to get his confidence up before Morum either gutted him with his horns or just broke them with his large hands. You got up and ran to the other end of the cot where a needle and thread were ready to go for you to sew him up. As you ran across the cot, Morums eye glanced at you and he let a smile grow across his face, before he turned and began talking to the wolf, continuing an apparent conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway Warrus, I took out his eye with my horn then uppercut him with my hammer before bringing it back down on his chest. Blood shot out of his mouth like a fountain, quite proud of myself.\" Morum said sitting down on the cot, his moon sized cheeks came close to landing on you, air ruffled your straw clothes as they made impact. You showed little reaction because you had been working with Morum for a year now, and he loved you messing with his butt and teasing you with it. He knew what he was doing though and purposefully missed, but also was indicating he'd want attention back there later. His tail lashed as he eased himself on his back, his hands finding his groin and he rubbed at it while groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to say though, that raccoon must've known I'm packing downstairs because he was quick to kick me there. Hey doc I may need you to go inside the boys later and check for damage.\" He said turning his head towards you, his breath washing over your small frame and dampening you as you prepared the needle by sterilizing it in a candle. You looked over your shoulder at the enormous face of the bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm I'm sure you're fine in there Morum, last time I went in you took me into the next match you had, if I recall me bouncing around in there got you a boner and that gazelle almost cut your dick off. So if I do, you better get me out asap.\" You say finishing the needle and climbing up his arm and hopping across to his enormous pec, the muscle was swollen from the trauma and use. Before Morum could retort you began lancing the needle over the wound, which was wide enough that if you weren't careful you could fit in the gash. Morum hissed as did his skin from the still hot needle, you made quick work and asked the guard to seal it for you and he obliged. After he helped, he left, locking the door behind him. Morum groaned, his fingers coming up to explore the wound but you slapped them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Morum, leave it alone. I don't need your dirty fingers rubbing all over it.\" You say standing over the cut defiantly, the hands hovered for a second before they drifted down and started groping his sheath and balls while moaning. Jeez these guys get so laced up on testosterone that murder and sex are the only things on their mind. Morum growled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc....I need you inside me, somehow please...I just killed a guy, I'm so pumped and I need a release.\" He said throwing his head back as his cock snaked its way out of his sheath. You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok, just be careful.\" You say, fingers grabbing you before you had finished speaking and pulled you towards his...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stared out, bored, at the passing titans on this market day. The sun was causing you to blister as you had been exposed to it for a good 8 hours. Most of the humans that were brought out to market with you had been sold. Some were taken into careful hands, others yanked skyward screaming, and some unlucky bastards just popped in some mouth without a second thought. You should probably be freaked out, but it was such a daily occurrence that you weren't fazed by it anymore. Other humans lounged around in the wooden barred crate as Your owner advertised you all with glee, he had made a killing today and was down to only four or five of you. You looked over the last few, some of them may have been half siblings, though you were unsure, family wasn't really a concept in this life, best not get attached to someone who had a 50/50 chance of even being around tomorrow. You glance back up at your master, who was some scrawny lizard that bred humans just to make a profit on them, there were probably three other breeders within spitting distance of his stall, but that didn't stop the huge demand that consumers(some in the literal sense) caused in their buy up of man flesh. A shadow passed over you and you let out a sigh of relief as you look up to see who was the blessing that blocked out the afternoon sun. Your gaze ran up a midnight black stomach and chest to see a Jackal that may as well be the god of death Anubis himself. Your mouth dropped open as the beings golden eyes expertly inspected the last half dozen humans in the crate with you before the gaze locked onto your form. He deftly snapped you up between two fingers and deposited you into his palm where he gently but firmly rolled you around, inspecting your nude form with deft precision, you'd had it done to you before but it always was degrading, but you're a slave so no one cares. His eyes left you and looked down on the smaller lizard who stammered out a welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-why noble Kairon, so nice to see you've deemed us worthy to be blessed with your presence today, I must apologize, if I had known you were coming down this evening I wouldn't have let my best stock walk off with the common rabble.\" The Lizard brown nosed. He was usually feisty and would've gone off on someone who had handled one of his humans without showing coin first, but from what little you've heard Kairon was head of the Anukmhet family, and they had a third of the city in their pocket. Kairon waved a dismissive hand at the compliments and turned you over again so that you were staring him in the eyes. His voice came out like Thunder that was made of silk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't intend to come, but there was business to attend to and recently I've felt a strange itch to get myself a little pocket friend.\" The Jackal said, your heart skipped a beat, being a pet to someone of this stature is one of the best positions a human could hope to achieve, it had its own dangers but at least it wasn't a fight pit or someones stomach. The lizard chuckled nervously and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...And that one...he suits you?\"He said cautiously, not wanting to offend, no matter how small it may be. The Jackal huffed, his thumb descending and stroking your head, you held still, a natural prey reflex as the eyes of a large predator were on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm unsure, he seem's....docile. I want one that will catch me off guard, stir up a life a little for me.\" The Jackal said, making you tense up. The lizard came to your defense unknowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pssh that one does everything I tell him NOT to do, if that's what you're looking for, that's the one you want my lord.\" The lizard said truthfully. A small smile appeared at the corner of Kairon's mouth as he brought the palm against his muscled stomach and quickly quizzed the Lizard on your health and then tossed a gold piece at him, which caused the Lizards eyes to light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-My lord! He's only twenty copper, you might as well take the rest of them and then some!\" The Lizard called out as Kairon turned away. The Jackal didn't look back at the Lizard as he responded his families motto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anukmhets only deal in gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... You stayed silent, as did Kairon as he ascended the steps to his villa, walking silently past servants and a couple other Jackals that were similar to him except for height and bulk. He eventually entered a wing that you assumed was his private bath house and sleeping quarters as a pool in the ground steamed with candles lit around it. He set you down at the lip of the pool and walked over to his wardrobe where he slipped out of the simple garb he was wearing and took a moment to let the cooling evening air dance on his short coat. He was well muscled, his back rippled with it, leading down to some defined, large glutes that thrummed with strength above thighs that could probably crush boulders. He turned and began to walk towards the tub, and you got to observe his front as well, starting with pecs the size of a small human village, and abs that were like a plain of ebony. Below he was well endowed with a fat sheath and bulbous balls that could probably repopulate the planet before running out of juice. His paws sent echoing plaps throughout the marble halls and soon enough he stepped over you and settled into the bath without a word. His head drifted back with his eyes closed and a long breath escaped him as if he had held it all day. One eye opened and settled on you, and he spoke directly at you for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I envy you in a way human, you don't need to deal with the daily image and renown that I have to uphold. You live day to day, with a sense of acceptance that it may be your last on Sedimar, and you are...ok with that. Me? I have to lead my family to greater heights, threaten some merchants, and stay on the good side of the other houses that rule this city. Life is hard.\" He said closing his eyes again. You frowned, that wasn't the way you saw the world, you wanted to live, the fact that he just wrote you off like if he just smooshed you right now you'd be okay with it bothered you immensely. So you did like the Lizard said you would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh boohoo I have lots of money and free will, but yeah the one inch tall tasty human that was marketed at only twenty copper and is now stuck here listening to that has it way easier.\" You say crossing your arms. Kairons eyes snapped open and rolled to look at you, his mouth forming an expression of surprise before it broke into a smile and he let out a belly laugh that resounded down the halls. A servant passing through looked at his lord mortified as if he had just heard his death sentence, The servant that was a goat glanced and noticed you next to the pool and blinked before running out of the room. After a few more seconds Kairon calmed and wiped some tears from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh dear that Lizard wasn't lying, you're perfect, I was not expecting that. Most bow their heads or agree with me, no one ever talks back, but a human that can die by me sitting on him has the nerve to say that to me, ME, a god in this city. Oh boy we are gonna have a time together Quip.\" He said sliding up and crossing his arms on the pool lip and resting his head on them to stare at you. You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Err...Quip? I guess that works since I don't have a name, I could've thought of something better but you're the boss-\" You begin to say only to be cut off by him laughing some more. His eyes locked onto you and you swore he was analyzing every speck of grime on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are quite the filthy little thing, get in here.\" And with a sudden flash you were in his hand and being lowered into the rose scented water and being scrubbed by gentle hands. as he did so the Jackal lifted himself out of the pool and sat on the lip as he bathed you to have better control. When he decided you were done he plopped you on his thigh and let out another sigh. \"I don't want to leave this room for the rest of the night Quip, I don't feel like putting on the mask, so instead I'm just gonna talk, and you're gonna listen.\" He said, a hand absently scratching his balls and letting them drop back to the stone with a meaty plop. You glanced at the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not like I have a choice anyway.\"You say looking up his muscular torso at his face, which gave off one of those genuine smiles again. And so he just talked and you gave your two cents on matters or what he was thinking and he valued your thoughts, the talk went through the evening and close to midnight before Kairon...</span></div></div>",

His purple eyes quickly observed progress on ongoing projects, some of them containing other humans. Eventually he reached you his gaze locking on to your own and a cold smile formed and he bared his fangs at you. He spoke, his voice icy. \"Well human, I'd say it's high time we begin shall we? Let me first introduce myself, I'm Veris, I'm the king's advisor and Sorcerer, I specialize in cryomancy and onomancy. And you-\" He said tapping the glass. \"Are going to be my new assistant. The rest of the lot I bought are guinea pigs. Fail to comply with me and you'll end up next to them.\" He said finally, you gulped visibly.

What are my duties as your assistant and...why are you naked?\" You say wincing expecting to get squished instantly.

You yourself were wearing a cotton shirt and laced pants and nothing else.

The wolf continued. \"You'll find bread crumbs and water thimbles over on the table near the door. Also don't talk to the ones you interact with, just give them what they need and move on, I don't need you to become a martyr on your first day.\" The wolf said walking over to a desk and dropping into it with grace, his tail waving absently, causing more snowflakes to occasionally drift from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh and walk to where Veris had been sitting on the table, and as soon as you reached the edge, translucent stairs sprung into existence leading to the floor. You blink and look back towards the wolf who didn't look bothered or seem to notice the sudden conjuration. You shyly put a foot out and found the staircase solid enough to hold your weight. You make your way down and as soon as you step off the last step the staircase dissipated. You blinked, then shook your head and continued towards the table near the door. When you neared it another staircase sprung into existence, and despite quite the climb you made it easily to the top where a basket around your size full of bread chunks and a anthro thimble modified into a human bucket waited for you. You tethered the basket to your back and picked up the bucket and looked for the first subject. You could see a human form hunched over in a similar container to the one you came from on the table on the other side of the door frame. Just as you thought a bridge would be nice, one sprang forth between your table and the next one, appearing as a swaying rope bridge. You made it across and peered at the human in the container and swallowed. The man was nude and thin, and he clutched an arm that was black with frostbite up to the elbow. His wild eyes shot up and locked on yours and all you could see the drive of prey deep within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you, you were in the human market with me...looks like you're free, get me out of here!\" He whispered frantically. You looked down and noticed two thin chutes worked in the glass, one with a bowl on the other side of it within the container. You knew this was a test by the sorcerer, he was most likely listening right now though he looked focused on the scroll at his desk. What you did now determined if you lived or became this man. Without hesitating you dropped a chunk of bread down one chute and poured water down the one with the bowl. The man looked down at the supplement and then back at you his eyes now sunken.\"I see...\" he said gravely and just sank to his knees sobbing. You winced and turned away. You repeated the scenario nine more times, with some screaming at you, while others just stared passed you, their spirit already dead. Finally you came upon your first corpse, it was a woman laying on her back, and where her heart was, an ice shard the color of blood shot out of her chest, her face locked into a face of anguish. You turned green and fell to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please don't spoil my work station human, you'll see many more gruesome sights then this being here I promise.\" You jump and turn to see Veris bent over at the hip, his hands clasped behind his back staring at the woman with cold eyes, his head above you and to the right slightly. His eye drifts down to you, and studies you with the same cold gaze. You just stared back, remembering the statement about questions only being answered in the beginning, and after a minute he broke into another cold smile and said. \"Good, you burn with questions, but you're tempered with restraint, these are good signs that you'll prosper as more than just an assistant here, human.\" He said straightening and walking back to his desk. You look up and see the container was open. You put down the basket and thimble and thought of a ladder and lo and behold one sprang into existence on the outside and inside of the container in the same translucent material. You climbed into the container and walked up to the woman, and bent down and closed her eyes. You next gripped the dark red ice and broke it off an inch from her sternum and slung her over your shoulder, she was terribly light. After getting her out of the container you looked around and saw in the corner of the room was a patch of dirt where no stone was. As you made your way there you grabbed a small mixing spoon and when you reached the dirt you dug a grave, before burying the woman and said a few words over her. As you did you were thrown in shadow and you looked up to see you master's nude form looming over you, one of his paws were mere inches from you and you hadn't even sensed it getting there. He spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You've done what you're told, you listen to what I say, and you respect those who others seem to ignore. Well done, student.\" You blink again, and the wolf plucked you up to eye level. \"When walking the market a few days ago, I sensed a string of magic emanating from some humans that you were a part of, I thought it wasn't possible that a human could have an affinity for magic but of course curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't pinpoint which human had the affinity and i was on a schedule so I bought a couple dozen humans, I needed test subjects anyway and unfortunately humans are the easiest and most responsive to my work. Needless to say I isolated you within a day, and am curious and eager to see what kind of magic you can handle.\" He said smiling, you stared in disbelief, if you had magic, and could learn it...then you could escape, and may be the only human in the world that could be a threat to Anthros everywhere. Veris's eyes studied you and his grin grew more feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahhhh, so the first thing you plan is vengeance on us? Careful pupil, your eyes are windows to your goal. I could bite your head off or freeze you now and not even bother with teaching and learning your skills. I may be playing with fire here but I'm willing to turn you into a tool of mine. Now-\" Veris said but was cut off as his lab door flung open and the wolf spun in a growl. He gripped you in a fist but was careful not to crush the life out of you. Standing in the door was a Bull, his form filling the doorway and his horns scrapping the top of the frame. he wore colors of forest green and gold, a blossoming tree was the sigil he wore on his surcoat. He furrowed his brow at Veris, taking in the sight of the naked wolf, and his vision drifted to you in his clutch. The bull cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Veris, the king requires your council, please be sure to dress yourself this time when you meet him, he has company, and don't give me the 'nudity is best when working with the arts' crap. Leave your plaything here as well, I might get hungry.\" The bull said licking his lips. Veris snarled but straightened back into his regal stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course, Tauric, but I warn you Bull, my test subjects are quite flushed with all manner of ailments, I can't promise that you won't be leaking blood from your ass after a few hours.\" The Wolf said walking to his desk and placing you down on it and grabbing a white robe nearby and nothing else, tying it closed and holding his arms out at the bull for his satisfaction, who still looked wary and weighing the risk of bleeding out of his ass. The bull shook his head and waited for Veris to walk out before shutting the door, leaving you alone except for the other subjects. This was another test you knew, he could've held you, but he was giving you the opportunity to try and escape, or stay and learn. You knew he'd find you, besides, being one of a kind as a human sorcerer could have a multitude of benefits. So you decide to....</span></div></div>",

So you looked around the desk to occupy yourself until Veris returned. Ironically, or planned, a book lay open on the table that discussed the channeling of magics through meditation and focus. It gave detailed descriptors on how to summon forth your reserves of the arcane power. You followed along, crossing your legs and focusing on your breathing. After a few minutes you began to feel something, you opened your eyes and seized the feeling, and suddenly you fell through the table, as if it wasn't even there in the first place. You scream as you tumbled towards the stone floor below, letting go of the feeling as you fell. Before you hit the ground however a force caught you, leaving you suspended in the air. You blink and turn to see Veris smiling widely in the door way before bending a finer in his outstretched hand and bringing you toward him with telekinesis. You stop about 2 feet from him at chest level and he takes off the robe he had donned for his audience with the King, exposing his sculpted snow white form to the dim room once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remarkable, not only are you flushed with magic, but you are a Transmuter as well!\" He said reaching out a palm and dropping you in it. \"This means you can learn the tricks of phasing, flying, and maybe even altering yourself as well as others. Though that one requires a formidable amount of power, something I don't sense in you.\" He said sorrowfully, but quickly smiled again. \"This calls for some experimentation!\"</span></div></div>",

He was enormous in every way, starting from his exposed clawed feet all the way up to the two black horns that sprouted from his head. He wore some Silver leggings that hugged his muscular legs, showing off their definition and size. Between his thighs rested a large bulge that shifted at his slightest move. He wore a jacket that screamed military aesthetic as it had ribbed golden thread going down his torso. His face was two toned, with the top of his head being cyan and his chin and neck being cloud white, his eyes were blue but with a purplish glint in his iris. He sighed, his chest heaving against the jacket he wore, threatening to pop the buttons with his bulk. You looked around to find a way to contact him and saw beyond the chair his heavy tail lay still, a perfect ramp leading up to him. You trudged passed his enormous feet and under the canopy of his throne, which let out occasional groans as it held the insurmountable weight of its owner. You reached his tail and noted how fine his hide was, it felt warm and smooth to the touch, and the scales blended together so well that the texture almost looked like human skin, but felt very different. This also proved very difficult to climb but you managed as you slowly shimmied up this gods tail to reach him. As you were halfway up the tail however, the steward spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Court is now adjourned and will reconvene in two days from now, bring any concerns or grievances with you at that time and our noble lord Clourax will listen with passion.\" The steward says, the king let out a small chuckle at his last statement. You could hear the crowd leave the hall, and were almost halfway up the tail when suddenly two large digits pinched you and pulled you off the dragon. You let out a gasp as your ribs threaten to break under the immense pressure. You are turned around and come face to face with what appears to be a snarling Lion.

The dragon blinked and leaned forward squinting at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What...is it, some kind of homunculus? If so it definitely came from the sorcerer kingdom Verpima. Dispose of it for me Dante, thank you for your vigilance.\" The dragon said leaning back again in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\" You shout, obviously startling everyone at your sudden outburst. \"I'm not a homunculus! I'm a human!\" You say. Clourax looks stunned, before speaking softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A homunculus that talks? This is grave news, no telling what other advancements in magics Verpima has made, I must make a declaration of war at once! Shalor, my paper an ink!\" The dragon said waving at the steward, who you now saw to be some badger. The lion shifted uneasily, which brought the dragons gaze back on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who sent you little one? Was it Gaz of the Gloom court? Or maybe Corronit the mad Dragon? Tell me and I promise not to kill you.\" The Dragon said smugly and leaning back in to look at you. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm not a homunculus, I'm a human!\" You say again, getting frustrated. The dragon furrows his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, humans are myths, little forest creatures that come to your windows at night and raid your pantry. Nice try homunculus but you'll have to do better than that.\" The Dragon said as his steward returned with a small table that had parchment and ink on it. Your mere minute interaction with the king was about to start a war that would probably kill thousands, you had to think of something fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you got me I'm a homunculus, but I wasn't sent here to kill you my lord!\" You say quickly your eyes darting around looking for a reason for you being here. The Dragon halted his hand from grabbing the quill, and looked at you with a smug smile curling up his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, though any idiot could see what you are, so tell me construct, why are you here?\" He said propping his chin up with his hand. You look at him, and then down at his large bulge that twitched as if on cue to your observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sent from Gaz as a gift to be your personal body servant! To help satisfy any need that arises!\" You say quickly. The lion holding you shifted uncomfortably and the steward raised his eyebrows. Clourax just smiled bigger, before standing up. He was a good head taller than the lion soldier that held you. He held out his hand and the lion put you into it. You look up at the wicked expression the dragon held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll test that right now, and if you fail to impress, Verpima can expect an army at their door, and you can't expect all the ways I know how to kill, especially something of your size.\" Clourax said before whisking you off to his private quarters. He throws you onto his bed as he shuts the door, and you recover in time to see him peeling off the jacket. His chest heaved at freedom, much larger now that it was out of those confines. Next he hooked a thumb in the leggings and eased out of them, exposing his junk to the room. His flacid cock was probably the size of a small bus, and his testicles the size of a small building. He stretched, turning around and giving you a first time look at his massive rear. He turned back around and smiled at you before laying down beside you, his junk flopping a few feet away from you as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see what you can do...\" You begin with </span></div></div>",

You even saw some walking around with trays in speedos with drinks on them or they were dancing around on poles which meant that they were clearly male dancers.

And trying to get one of the patreons attention might be tricky as well since not only were there so many, but quite a few of them might be pretty buzzed or flat out drunk. So that would be even more dangerous since you had no idea how they might act when seeing you after some many drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so with this idea in your head you moved back a bit closer to one of the smaller pole dancer areas to not only stay out of sight, but to not get stepped on as you look around for certain male anthros to ask for help from.

And by the looks of it, it looked like he was heading towards the bar area to set the tray down. That would give you a chance to get his attention if timed right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you soon saw a massively muscled anthro male cheetah in a red jockstrap walk up and onto the small stage that you were underneath.

So while you canned the giant club area with very loud music and changing neon lights two giant anthro male bouncers stood out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a giant massively muscled tan furred rat who was standing over by the bar.

After a few minutes of struggle you emerged back on top of the bundle, now a couple feet away from the roo, and you took in a breath at the true revealed size of the beast. He was probably the size of Godzilla or the like, that much could be said. He still lay on his back, his chest and arms adorned with large muscles that boasted that they saw a lot of use. His stomach was rather large and jiggled slightly at the minute movements he made in his sleep, but you didn't doubt muscle lay underneath that thick layer of fat. You say 'He' due to the monstrous bulge right below the stomach, wrapped behind a layer of cotton and spandex of gray boxer brief material, the size of his junk was easily compared to a small house back in your world. A huge thick tail emerged from underneath him from what looked like above his glutes, and the whole limb lay still save for the tip which twitched absently. Your observation continued to his monstrous legs, his thighs carrying hundreds if not thousands of tons of fat and muscle underneath his short coat. His legs ended on enormous, beastial feet that looked like a mix of a humans and a kangaroo, each digit on them looking capable of crushing a bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy shit...\" You say to yourself, what were you looking at?

You flew over the creamy expanse of the Roo's gut and chest and stopped a hundred or so feet from his enormous head.

He scratched at his head like it hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck, no more straight Everclear, I've gotta be hallucinating, yup this is all the hangover...\"He said groggily without taking his eyes off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everclear? I've got that back home! Is this like a parallel universe or something?\" You actually ask earnestly, the danger you were in leaving your mind for a second. The roo looked at you some more with a look of absolute terror and fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're....talking, and to me to boot. What are you little dude?\" He said honestly, but more to himself than to you, but you replied regardless. Might as well try to get somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm a human, and I don't think this is my planet. I was relaxing and somehow ended up in the alley that's right next to this building. I was trying to contact you because I had no idea on what else to do. So...could you help me out?\" You ask as politely as you could, but as you were talking, you were coming to a grim conclusion. No one knew you were here, and no one here knew what you were. This guy could kill you now or do something similarly terrible and face no punishment. You tensed up and fear of your demise came to the forefront of your mind again. The kangaroo blinked and rubbed his head again, before...</span></div></div>",

And suddenly I'm woken up to find a tiny hairless....What were you again?\" He said trailing off, his apparent hangover catching up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human, I come from a world where we have creatures that sort of look like you, but more...feral I guess.\" You say, starting to doubt your choice in seeking help because this guy seemed to be the opposite of that. You shifted only to realize you were still standing on his gut, your feet sinking a good bit into the short haired flesh. It seemed uncomfortable to you, but the Roo seemed to not care, hell he was still just laying in his underwear and having a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...yeah I'm gonna have to say that I'm a bit useless to you buddy. Hell I don't even know where to tell you to go to even begin getting back home.\" He said scratching his head, a nonchalant gesture that hammered home your hopelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well then I guess I'll just have to go find someone who can help me. Sorry for bothering you Mr. Kangaroo.\" You say as you look around for the best way down off his belly. As you were doing that he threw his hands up to pacify your retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, slow down there lil' guy, you probably don't wanna do that. There's no telling what can happen to you out there, this town is pretty rough for people my size. You? You'll just be a stain on someones foot in no time. Just...stay here for a bit and I can fill you in on this place, this...world.\" He said passively. You stared back up at him, and beyond the glazed look of hangover, you saw a semblance of humanity in his green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...ok, I guess I'll take you up on that offer Mr. Kangaroo.\" You say, cheering up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The names Mason lil' guy, now how about we get some food? I'm pretty hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's your name? To be honest I like lil' guy better, pretty fitting if I have to say.\" The big Marsupial said. You thought it was a little demeaning but so far this guy was an ally, so whatever kept him on the good side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can call me that.\" You say cheerfully, and got a grunt in acknowledgement from the titanic mammal. You were standing on an island in the middle of his kitchen, watching him go about making some colossal sandwich. He deemed clothes not necessary, so he was still moving around in the tight boxer briefs, advertising his package and huge ass to his home. This man was confident in himself, or just lacked decency. You for one found the whole sight queer, watching him move on his large feet while his tail lashed lazily from side to side to adjust so he could keep balance. After a minute he opened the fridge across from you and bent over to grab something, and his rear came mere inches from your position, casting you in shadow and just hammering home how suddenly insignificant you were. Mason stood back up, cracking a beer he had pulled out and took a large swig, none the wiser that he just shoved his ass in your face. He picked up the sandwich and took a bite from it, then leaned on the counter while talking with his mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you come from 'Earth', well we call this rock 'Sedimar'. It sounds like humans are your only dominant species, well we have hundreds on here. Mammals , Reptiles, some Avians, it's a real shit show. You can imagine racism and stereotypes run rampant and believe me it does, but somehow we make it work these days, used to be real bad back in the dark ages.\" He said taking another bite of sandwich. You were about to ask about the other races when you noticed something about his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you eating meat? I thought kangaroos were Herbivores.\" You ask innocently. He made a sour face and scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, not here, I wanna say almost everyone on the planet are omnivores and carnivores, no one really is on the Vegetarian train around here. That's probably another reason to stay here for a time. Hell when I found out you weren't a bug a primal instinct wanted me to pop you in my mouth.\" He said taking another, more exaggerated bite. You turned green, not just from the thought that for a moment you could've been devoured by this monster, but because he just told you so carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see, and why didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're really small, and you're intelligent and honestly kinda cute. My consciousness would've haunted me if I ate you, so instead here you are talking to me and not playing roommate with this sandwich.\" He said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a straightforward guy Mason. Thanks for not eating me.\" You say, meaning for it to be sarcastic but it came out honest. \"So...is it normal for you to stay in your underwear when you have company over?\" You say. Mason blinked then looked down, as if noticing for the first time how under dressed he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest I thought I at least had sweats on, but at the same time I wasn't expecting company and it is MY apartment. Also everyone knows you're packing something under all the cloth, so why do we even bother hiding it?\" He said popping the rest of the sandwich in his mouth and looking at you with a rebellious expression. \"Anyway like I said, I don't think you should expose yourself to anyone, I'll see if I can find any news and such on your kind popping up or any kind of science stuff going on that may have brought you here. Until then you're gonna be stuck with me.\" He said casually. You grimaced but you didn't have a choice really, this guy kind of had control over you now. It could be way worse though. Despite your better judgement you were beginning to really like Mason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sounds good to me, so what do we do now?\" You ask, expecting you both to begin searching the streets for evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now? Now we spend my day off playing a game that just came out.\" He said polishing off his beer and pressing a hand to his belly, letting out a belch before plucking you off the counter and putting you on his shoulder. You scramble to grab his fur to hold on as he chuckles and pulls out another couple of beers from the fridge and retreats to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason! I wanna get home, no offense but I like when things are my size!\" You yell up at him, making him wince and to flick his ear that was facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill lil' guy, I can hear you just fine without the yelling. Like I said, I can't really do anything so just hang out with me and relax.\" he said sitting down onto an extremely worn futon that had seen many years of its owners ass on it. You grumbled and crossed your arms as Mason booted up the game and began to play. For thirty minutes  you sat watching him play some shooter game, feeling your hope drain again. It was when you looked down you saw a chance to do something. Mason's tail was looping around his rear and ran parallel with his leg down off the couch, pressed close to his body. Wedged between his tail and pressed against his right cheek was a smartphone that you hadn't noticed before, he must've picked it up the same time he grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason can I use your phone to look for news about my kind?\" You say looking back at him. He didn't look at you but grumbled a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just don't text or call anyone, and forewarning I have no idea what may be open on the browser right now so don't say I didn't tell you.\" After he said that he waited for him to move you and the phone off to the side, but he kept gaming like you were able to do it yourself. After a couple of seconds you huffed out a thanks and walked down his clavicle and judged your trajectory. You could slide down the center of his chest, squeezing by his pectorals, and try to land on top of his gut, but if you pick up too much speed you may crash right into his bulge...Screw it you'd do that. Better than falling off his shoulder and breaking a leg or something.  With a jump you began your descent sliding down the behemoth body of this laid back giant. He didn't move at all, either so he didn't affect you or just because he was to engrossed in his match. You squeeze between his pectorals, the fur brushing and tickling you as you passed by. His shoulders were drawn back and relaxed so you didn't get caught between the large muscle groups. As you came to where his chest meets his stomach you...</span></div></div>",

You just smile back at him and he shrugs and continues to game. As you are working your way to his side to slide down to the phone however, a ringtone emits from your destination. With a curse Mason reached down and picked up the cell, putting it to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up Boss man.....uh huh....uh huh, mmmh yeah I'll be there in like twenty.\" Mason said with annoyance before hanging up, letting out a sigh and glancing at you. \"Some college twerp is having a huge party for his 21st and is renting out basically the whole club with mommy and daddy's money so I gotta go in early to help get the place set up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want me to do? Come with you?\" You ask honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. You're gonna stay here lil' guy until I come back. I can't have you on my shoulder or pocket all night, It's gonna be rough tonight, lots of drunks being tossed out and I wont be surprised if I have to clobber some people. I'll ask around about any weird happenings for you ok?\" He said scooping you up and walking to his bed room. He dropped you on his bed before opening up his closet and throwing a pair of ray cargo pants and a plain black T-shirt on the bed nearby. He let out another grumble as he quickly slid on the tshirt before he grunted and tried to slide into the cargo pants,which were obviously a bit small on him as he bounced in place trying to get them to slide over his upper thighs and large ass. His ass and belly bounced with the hops until finally with hard tug the waist band got over the roos butt, but not without giving him a permanent wedgie. You weren't gonna lie, Mason was kind of hot and you'd be lying if said you weren't a little turned on right now. With a groan and a slightly pained face, Mason rubbed at his rear before turning towards you and speaking while zipping up his fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay here buddy, I'll be back around 3am and then we can look into your predicament. Until then just hang out and stay inside.\" He said tucking in his shirt and pulling out a Gray zip up jacket and throwing it on. As he turned to leave you...</span></div></div>",

The big Red didn't even seem to notice your presence as he continued to casually stroll through his home, unaware his guest was hanging onto his plump tail. He emerged into some tiled hallway that screamed old run down apartment complex and turned to lock his door. You climbed up his tail further to lessen the incline and to prevent getting tired as quickly as he strolled out onto the street that you had seen that reptile strolling down earlier. Now that you weren't in such a panicked state you looked around at the environment around you. Huge buildings, incomprehensible in size to you, stretched to the sky all around, the street teemed with vehicles driving past, all looking somewhat similar to what humans drive, with a few tweaks here and there to accommodate for it's drivers physiology. What surprised and fascinated you the most however, were the other people Mason passed.The first person to come in sight was some goat woman chatting on a phone striding past Mason as he exited his apartment. On a bench sat a pretty muscular tiger reading a newspaper. A jogger passed by and it was a German Shepherd in a track suit. The variety and color of species astounded you, to see a society manage to exist with such differences was a marvel of its own. After a few blocks and surprisingly no pedestrian honing in on your tiny form hanging onto the large kangaroo's tail, you pass an alley way and Mason halted and began conversing with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thomas, what's going on man, you get called in too?\" He asks with a meaty thump following the question, a pat on the back most likely. The creature named Thomas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, not to pleased either, was almost caught up on my show. Hope this kid knows he's already number one enemy in our sights. What's up with you Skip, I haven't had a shift with you in weeks.\" The voice said, it was musical and a little lighter in tone than Mason. You also assumed Skip was Mason's nickname around his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh well nothing new really, had something weird happen this afternoon...hey have you heard anything about-\" Mason began before someone clapped and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Catch up later gentleman, we have 30 minutes before we open and there is much to be done.\" An authoritative and obnoxious voice called out. You were pretty sure that was the manager, and also pretty sure Mason wanted to deck him as the Kangaroo's whole body tensed up, muscle rippling in his legs like he was about to pounce on the guy. With a grumble, Mason began making for the club entrance. You however...</span></div></div>",

You glanced over your shoulder to look at Mason one more time. He was walking into the building with a slim but muscular snow leopard who must've been Thomas. You feel a slight tinge of sadness, but shake it off, you knew the guy for like four hours, relax. The night got dark fast and you found yourself walking down a dark and filthy alleyway with cardboard boxes and dumpsters galore. You trudge on, street light and one light over a service door for the club being the only thing guiding you. After about two hours of walking around you were pretty sure no human was around, if one had come to this world about the same time as you, you'd be pretty sure they'd be long gone. You turned to make your way back to the street, but realized it was suddenly crowded with anthros waiting to get in the club, so you turned and began to walk the other way, not sure where you were going. As you passed one particular dumpster however something caught your eye that sent chills across every portion of your being. You neared the point of interest and it confirmed what you thought it was, a portion of a human skeleton that had been picked clean. You gagged and vomited up what little was in your stomach before inching closer. Whoever this had been didn't seem to have lasted long on this planet, and while the bones and scraps of meat left told you that this happened about a week ago, they also told you that something had gnawed on them. A squeak in the darkness confirmed you suspicions and fears and out from the abyss under the dumpster, a feral rat emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh shit\" You say under your breath. The mangy beast was probably ten times larger than you, and its beady eyes focused on you with a hungry avarice. Without missing a beat, you turned and began to run, the rat taking pursuit a second later. You didn't have long to think, so you made sure to begin running...</span></div></div>",

A toothpick among cigarette butts was the only feasible thing and you grabbed it as you passed. You whirled on the rodent who slowed instantly and eyed you warily, circling slowly and waiting for an opening to get at you. You held the tooth pick like a spear, the point facing the beast as you slowly backed up, only to find yourself pressed against one of the bags. The rat closed in slowly and you knew this was going to be it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" You shout at the slobbering rodent, who's eyes gleamed with a ferocity that was otherworldly. It prepared itself for a pounce and you readied to receive it, tooth pick in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason shut the service door behind him and lit the cigarette in his hand, bunching up his shoulders as he forgot his jacket inside but was to lazy to get it. Damn kid was making a mess of the place and Mason alone had thrown out three of the guys friends for starting fights. At least out here there was no drama-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A small yell came from Mason's right, causing his large ear to flick in the sounds direction, his head followed and the sight before him made him smile and get angry all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rat crouched down, it's victory was sure, there was no way you were gonna best it, it had overwhelming size on you and it knew it. You smiled slightly, how stupid was it that you were going to be eaten by an alien rat in some back alley on another planet. You look on as the rat springs towards you...only for something larger than it to crash down on it, dust kicks up and you cough and blink to try to see what happened. When the dust settled a second later you saw a giant padded foot had crashed on the rat, which was squeeling in pain and protest and trying to bite at the meaty digits that held it down. In response the toes and foot flexed, bringing to your ears the sound of bones snapping. A shrill scream came from the rodent and you looked up to see a familiar face in the darkness above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason!\" You yell happily, you were not expecting this! His face was cast in an orange light from a lit cigarette hanging in his mouth, from down here his true size made you finally realize just how small you really were. The Roo snarled and tightened his toes around the rat before quickly sliding the foot backwards, sending the rat flying off down the alley only for the sound of something hitting metal to sound. Mason took a drag from the cig and bent down on his heels, looking at you patronizingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I recall I told you to stay put, not use me as a ride to get out. It's been what, two hours since I left the house, and you were already almost eaten. You're lucky I haven't kept my new years resolution to quit smoking, otherwise you'd be rat droppings tomorrow.\" He said taking another pull before reaching down and crushing out near where you stood before continuing. \"So here's your choices lil' guy, because obviously you're not listening. I can leave you right here, or you come with me and do as I say, I want you to make it through this but you aren't capable of that on your own. Maybe you'd find someone who'll pause their entire life to help you, you won't get that from me, but I will help how I can. Make the call kid.\" He said grimly. You bow your head, he was right, you couldn't survive out here by yourself, but maybe you could find someone though. You look up and say...</span></div></div>",

You look at him with a exasperated look which he growled and continued. \"I gotta go back in to work and my pockets are too tight and full of crap for you not to get crushed. My natural pocket is pretty deep and the skin and fat and muscle will insulate you from the pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to go in there.\" You say like a spoiled brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't want you to leave the apartment but here we are, take 'em off.\" He said annoyed. You strip down, standing on top of your shoes as you slide out of them so you don't step barefoot on the gross ground. An appoving huff sounded from Mason and he gently plucked you up. In the dim light his sheath glowed with a supernatural shimmer, it was plump and loose looking, but besides a small indention on top it gave no outward signals about what waited within, you took a deep breath as Mason angled your feet into his sheaths mouth, and with almost no resistance you slipped inside. The inner walls were velvety and honestly quite comfortable. The fingers retreated and gravity did the rest, letting you sink deeper within before finally bumping in to the owner of this space. You got heated as soon as you made contact with the flacid cock, and you tried your best not to move too much so you didn't stir it. Mason felt your arrival at the bottom, as he began to move. The wall at your back gained a little more pressure but that was it as Mason pulled up the briefs and re-fastened his pants. With a distant grunt he stood up and began walking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason felt the alien weight of having a living being deep in his sheath, it felt good, real good. He pulled up his boxers and was buttoning his pants when Thomas opened the door calling his name, the Snow Leopard paused at the sight of his coworker zipping his pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you pissing out here or something?\" Thomas asked inquiringly. Mason shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta keep the rodents at bay somehow, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got some guys breaking shit at the bar, We need the big guys for them, so that's you and Vince.\" Thomas said. \"Go get your radio too, we were calling you on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit my bad man. Yeah lets go get these fuckers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason rounded the corner to see his targets, some fox and another kangaroo, he was a gray however and was a good foot shorter than Mason. The two were being extremely loud and harassing the bartender. Mason saw Vince, a Rhino of similar stature to his own come up the other side. Vince took the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, grab your stuff and get out, you're done here for the night.\" The Rhino said putting a hand on the Fox, who tensed and looked genuinely scared. The kangaroo however looked at Vince, and then at Mason and smiled before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on man, you can't kick us out. Especially you bro, you wouldn't kick a fellow Jack out because he was a bit rowdy, it's what we do.\" He said turning back to his beer. Mason reached down and grabbed the smaller roo by the base of his tail and lifted him upside down. The roo blinked in surprise as he was now being suspended by his taller cousin instead of finishing his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Boomer, I'm universal when it comes to kicking people out of here, cousin species or not.\" He said and looked at the fox with Vinces hand still on his shoulder. He decided to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours of similar scenarios, the club began to thin as it got later in the night and bouncers like Mason and Thomas who came in early got to go home. Mason walked through his door and emptied his pockets before stripping down to nudity and plopping into his bed. He rubbed his thighs and crotch, working out the aches that those tight cargo pants imposed on him. As he fondled himself however a little bump inside his sheath reminded him of his passenger. He was tired, real tired, so he asked simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay in there lil' guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The words were muffled but clear, and they stirred you from your snooze.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine, doing real fine in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay for you to stay the night in there, I'm real tired and I know you'll be safe down there.\" He said while yawning. You snuggled deeper into the wedge of loose skin you had claimed, its soft texture soothing you almost into a trance. You were tired too, and sleeping somewhere that made you feel safe was honestly welcoming. He must've been naked as some light made its way through the skin membrane of the sheath and cast a faint orangish gold light inside the pocket. His member was like a large central veiny pipe that dominated the space, but the loose inner skin made pockets like the one you were in available and just far enough away that the temperature was perfect. You had read once that kangaroos were masters of regulating body temperature, and the loose skin around you had a cooling touch. You imagined it would tighten up a bit now that it wasn't in the tight confines of those cargo pants, but not by much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be fine, I wasn't expecting it to be nice in here, no wonder you didn't want my clothes in here, you gotta keep it clean.\" You say yawning yourself. An amused grunt is all you get in response and the lights go out, and sleep soon finds you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The night went on and you slept rather well, better than back in your world in a bed in fact. When you finally stirred, the pocket was cat in dim light, most of which seeped down from the entrance to this sanctuary. Muffled sound of the TV going made you realize that Mason was probably in the living room and you had even slept through him moving around. You rolled onto your knees and stretched the skin and fat of the sheath easily giving to your weight, and greatly hindering the speed of your movement. Seeing how you didn't really have a way out you looked up the flacid monolith that was Mason's cock. The large muscle was a dark gray color, the same as the skin underneath masons fur all over the rest of his body. Here at the bottom of the sheath, the skin didn't hug the phallus, but further above it   the sheath walls wrapped around it, securing it so that it didn't slump in the loose space. You hugged the member and began to shimmie up Masons member, causing a surprised grunt from your host. The flesh underneath you stirred a bit, but didn't expand as you climbed up the living tower before finding your self crouched on top of the dick. Above you the sheaths mouth winked a bit as Mason was detecting you right beneath it and reflexes wanted him to clench up. You stood up and squeezed your upper body through the soft mouth and into the blinding light and cold air of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well good morning, or afternoon I should say. I'm surprised honestly, I thought me waking up or me making lunch would've stirred you awake, but I guess it's just that cozy down there.\" You blink and look past the soft belly and large pecs at Mason's smirking face. You look down the valley of thighs and boulder like balls below the sheath you were sticking out of, before looking back up at your host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's embarrassing and costs a good bit of my dignity, but yes, it's amazingly comfortable in there. It's so soft, and roomy at the bottom. And when I'd expect it to get hot, you stay cool down there.\" You say absently petting the top of the sheath, not really realizing you were doing it. Mason chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm a kangaroo, we evolved in a barren, scorched land, and keeping ourselves cool became a must to survive out there. As for the soft and roomy part, I'd assume it derives from the females of my species and their pouches, and while I don't have one, some of their characteristics show up in the one biological pocket I do possess.\" He said scratching his chest. \"I didn't even feel agitated by your presence in there so if you wanna call that your sleeping quarters you're welcome to it.\" You place your hands on the sheath lips and pulled your self all the way out, the soft cartilage closing up behind you slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I appreciate it, so what are we doing today?\" You ask hopping over to the nearby thigh, almost missing and slipping into a wedge between it in the sheath but righting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm watching the news for anything about your kind, as well as scouring the internet. And besides for some old conspiracies of 'little hairless aliens', You aren't really trending lil' guy.\" He said somberly. \"But in a way that's good, it means no one from your world are trapped as well, and will fall to this more violent world. They wouldn't be as lucky as you to find a tolerable protector.\" He said reaching over to the table next to the couch he sat on and grabbed a lighter and a cigarette, pinching the cig in his lips before lighting the other end and relaxed back on the couch. You sat on his thigh, shifting uncomfortably, unsure what to do as Mason just lazily watched the TV with you on his naked upper thigh with no indication to remove you from your spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you aren't working today or going out?\" You ask, sitting down as you realize the Roo wasn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah, the club apparently got pretty wrecked from the party at it so some clean up is needed before its reopened. So time to spend the day getting wasted and hanging around commando. Oh err, hope you're fine with that, I'm a bit of a free spirit.\" He said as if he had modesty. You of course had no choice but to keep him happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's no problem, I did spend the night with you in a very intimate way, so seeing your goods on the outside doesn't bug me.\" You say, noticing you're stroking the short fur of the thigh you sat on, you really liked petting this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks bud, you can stay commando too, your clothes are on my night stand though if you want me to get them, I washed em' for ya so you don't have that alleyway stench on them. Excuse me a sec kiddo gotta get a drink.\" He said picking you up and placing you on the cushion next to him before standing up, You were cast in his shadow, his large tail unraveled and flew over you as he stretched. His enormous bulky ass flexing a bit before he released the stretch, making the slabs of muscle and fat to drop and jiggle a good bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn\" You whispered as the Roo walked to the kitchen that was only separated from the living room by a bar counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You want something to eat? I imagine you're hungry since you haven't eaten for something like 24 hours.\" Mason said opening the fridge and flicking an ear in the direction of the couch to listen out for your response. You agree and he comes back with a glass of some dark liquor and his other hand cupped. He bent down and lowered the hand to you, and within was some bits of what looked like feta cheese and clippings of some sandwich meat. Hunger gnawed at you suddenly and you climbed on the hand and retrieved the items, the hand stayed down for a second as if he had given you the choice to retreat back to the sofa but you stayed making Mason genuinely smile, a warm expression that made you feel the same as you woke up in his sheath, safe. He pulled the hand holding you inward and laid it on his thigh again while placing the drink down on the table and tapping the ash of the cig into a tray before grabbing the drink again and taking a swig before returning the cig to his lips. \"Don't feel rushed to leave kid, you're welcome to stay, I got soft spots for little guys in need, that's been most of my dating life.\" You look up at him with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! I had no idea you uh....swung that way. Thanks for the offer, it's a relief knowing you don't want me gone.\" You say finishing your snack before hopping out of his hand so he could make use of it again, landing on the fatty furry thigh once more. The hand rose a second later to retrieve the glass of alcohol and began to swirl it, Mason looked down at you, taking the cigarette from his lips before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah chicks are way too demanding for my taste, it takes a guy to really get a guy, and no problem, make use of my place and me as much as you want...within reason. Don't start selling my stuff like my roomate in college did, he's missing some teeth now.\" Mason said before turning his attention towards the TV and turning it to some horror movie. You sat quietly for a time and actually got into the movie, though horror films weren't really your thing. What enamored you were the actors and how different they were from one another. Some busty lab was running from this skeletal abomination, only for the hero, who was some antelope guy to step out from a tree and swing an axe at the thing, it caught it in a clawed hand and the antelope guy just stood there like all B rated horror victims do, only for him to get disemboweled by a swipe of the things other clawed hand. A Bear in a varsity jacket ran up from somewhere with a chainsaw and cut a hand off the thing only for it to turn on him and he ran off as the antelope dropped to his knees holding his intestines in his hands. Mason scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Always so damn predictable, never any good horror films anymore\" He said shifting, forgetting about you for a second and sending you tumbling down his inner thigh. You find yourself landing...</span></div></div>",

He grunted and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn lil' guy didn't know you liked me that way!\" He said laughing before attempting to retrieve you, you however slid up to your knees and waved him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm fine here Mason, this is actually really comfy, it's like a giant furry waterbed.\" You say laying back down to watch the movie in your new spot, the flesh making you sink a good ways into it. Mason for once seemed unsure about your spot choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...just watch the elbows and knees, unlike most of my body, I can actually really feel you there.\" He said shifting a little. You stayed there for awhile enjoying the cheesy horror film and the comforting presence of your new protector. You went on laying there on your back, one arm occasionally stroking the cream colored fur around you and getting the occasional grunt from Mason in response. It wasn't until you glanced up at him that you realized the reason for his initial unease. His member was sticking s good way out of the sheath. He wasn't giving it any attention, probably out of respect and some semblance of modesty for your sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason are you enjoying me down here that much?\" You say surprised but also in a teasing way. He bit his lip and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, kinda. I enjoyed you in my sheath too. Having so much control and power over another sentient life is really something I seem to enjoy. Don't take that the wrong way though, I don't intend to like, enslave you or anything lil' guy. But I couldn't ask you to get freaky with me, so please forgive my over exposure.\" He says looking around, showing a shy, vulnerable side of the Kangaroo Bouncer who had been so nonchalant and unfazed by everything before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you're fine Mason. I don't mind indulging you for some time, you are after all, doing me a solid by keeping me safe until I find a way home.\" You say sitting up and rubbing harder, kneading his soft balls and causing a small moan to escape the Roo's lips.

Your head shot up and Mason let out a half yell, half curse and soon your world went dark as Mason grabbed a nearby pillow and placed it over his crotch. You were pressed into the velvety fur with such force that the flesh and fat of the balls enveloped you almost entirely. You gasped for breath and thrashed, which caused Mason to apply more pressure to subdue your response. You stilled and he let off a bit on the pressure and you listened out for whatever was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yo Mason what's up! check this out dude I got that new game we talked about...\" An overly excited wallaby said, walking in the door as if he owned the place. Mason growled at the smaller male. Wyatt was a red-necked wallaby, and Mason's neighbor. The guy was only 19 and living with his friend that was some scrawny lizard. Mason suspected Wyatt had an affinity for the larger red kangaroo, as he would try his best to touch Mason or rub up against him. Wyatt gawked at his neighbor naked on the couch. \"O-Oh!!! I'm sorry Mason! I really need to knock!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn right you do kid! I don't know what backwater place you come from where everyone walks in on people, but you're liable to get shot in the city doing that!\" Mason said, genuinely angry. The wallaby was in no way his friend, and no matter what Mason did aside from physical force he could not get the message across that Wyatt wasn't welcome here. Mason slipped a finger under the pillow and began scooting the lil' guy up his scrotum until he reached the folds of his sheath, the human got the message quickly and began to wiggle his way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah I know...ANYWAY check this out!\" The annoying wallaby said closing the door behind him and seating himself right next to Mason despite there being three other seats in the living room. Mason turned red in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wyatt...when did I infer that I wanted you right next to me, and when did I invite you in.\" Mason said, his arms tensing with frustration. Wyatt shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I figure at our point in the friendship, I can let myself in. You're welcome at my place anytime after all.\" Wyatt said confidently, this guy.... A tug at the bottom of his cock pocket told him that the lil' guy had dropped to the bottom, and he himself had also retreated completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I give up.\" Mason said throwing off the pillow and standing up. Wyatt turned beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...I thought you were just in your underwear, but now I see the problem here...um ok I'll just...\" Wyatt mumbled standing up as well, coming up only to the chest of Mason. He hurriedly tried to squeeze by Mason and 'accidentally' brushed the back of his hand across Masons junk. The action squished lil' guy up into his cock, and Wyatt froze. \"Wait what is that? Some kind of growth?\" The wallaby said turning around and reaching a hand back towards Mason. In a split second he was flipped around and placed in an armlock in a way that the larger male just had to twist his arm a little more and it would break.<br>\r\nThe wallaby yelped and Mason leaned down and muttered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wyatt, would you please LEAVE MY HOUSE.\" He said throwing the wallaby forward towards the door. Wyatt ran out into the apartment hall but turned around before the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason, you should really get that looked at, it could be cancerous!\" Wyatt said in a terrified tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The only cancer here is you Wyatt, get out!\" Mason said walking up and slamming the door on the wide eyed wallaby that was focused on his bouncing junk. Mason let out a long sigh and walked back to his room, throwing on a tank top and some gray sweat shorts. Both fit him rather snug, riding up his rump and plastering to his chest and belly, but it would suffice. He went back to the door and opened it, and Wyatt scurried back in. Mason rubbed his temples and looked the Wallaby up and down. He was skinny, the complete opposite of the beefy Mason, but he moved quickly, meant more for running than fighting. Mason intimidated him but for some reason the guy just felt safe around him, perhaps he had an aura about him that made small things flock to him for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let me guess Wyatt, Darv is dealing again and you don't wanna be associated or familiarized by the addicts so you came here?\" Wyatt said shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...all I need is for them to think I always have a needle on me and they get me on the street.\" Wyatt said not making eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that's a start on being street wise but they'd also know if they attack you Darv may not sell to them anymore, I know he wouldn't but they don't. Anyway put in the game, lets take a look.\"....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in the skin cradle you settled down, listening to a musical voice yabber on about some game.

Wyatt took it as an invitation to use the muscled appendage as an arm rest however, his arm an inch from Masons thigh, Mason didn\u2019t scold him, he just let the kid fantasize. Wyatts head kept turning slightly as he peeked glances at Masons bulge, causing the kangaroo to finally say something however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDamnit Wyatt would you stop thinking about my crotch? You want me to whip the bits out right now?\u201d Mason said putting a hand down his pants and cupping himself, lil guy squirmed a bit within the sheath at the sudden pressure. Wyatt shot a look at the action then swallowed before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Um you\u2019re not helping Mason, it\u2019s not my choice I crush on you hard.

Sorry that I unconsciously taunt you all the time. I had a crush when I was your age too. He was big and strong and confident, but it couldn\u2019t happen. Now you\u2019re in luck because unlike that guy I tend to prefer the same sex like you, but if I do anything with you it\u2019s gonna make it worse for you.\u201d Mason said scratching his chin. Watching Wyatt go from somber, to shock, to misery. Kind of tugged at Mason\u2019s heart strings. With a sigh he lifted his tail and plopped it behind the wallaby, wrapping it around him And pulling him against Mason\u2019s side. The Wallaby made a small gasp as his face pressed against the side of Masons fatty pec, and he dropped the controller letting it clatter to the floor. Mason wrapped an arm around Wyatt and continued. \u201cScrew what I just said, if I can give you something my crush didn\u2019t, it never hurts anyone to dream.\u201d Wyatt sighed deeply and let his hand fall on Masons thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThank you Mason, thank you...\u201d Wyatt said closing his eyes, enjoying the feeling of protection and warmth that Mason emitted. He asked a question while his eyes were closed. \u201cMason what did I feel when I brushed against you...I\u2019m being honest when I say it worried me...\u201d The wallaby said, his hand sliding  over Masons inner thigh. Mason sighed and looked up at the ceiling, before standing up and dropping his shorts. Wyatt gasped as Mason retook his seat, his ass brushing Wyatt on the way down, making the Wallaby look like he was about to cream his pants.

However, seeing all of this did make you a blush a bit as you weren't expecting this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you looked around the gym and found a few anthros guys who hoped you could get some help from. The two that stood out ot you right away was a heavily muscled raccoon who was wiping himself down after using one of he machines for a workout it would seem as his fur and muscles had some droplets of sweat rubbing down the various muscles and curves of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked over to your right and saw a heavily muscled skunk who was sitting at the front desk. Though from the looks on his face he seemed to be eager to get started on his own workout. And it would take a bit of time to get over to him. But if he stood up and headed your way that would make things easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so after giving it some thought while also making sure you were hidden and safe you decided to head over towards the heavily muscled anthro male.......</span></div></div>",

You then heard his deep and yet smooth voice when he commented, \"Phew, that was quite the workout for the past two hours. But I'm feeling good and pumped now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me.\" You let out, while you did your best to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The raccoon let out, before you saw him look down over his pecs and his brown eyes are set on you. You then found yourself being picked up by the giant anthro and then placed into his open palm before he added on, \"Hey little guy, don't think I've ever soon you here before. What exactly are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm a human from a place called Earth, and my name is Tim.\" You told the anthro, as he stood up and began to walk away from the machine he had been sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human? Earth? Afraid I've never heard of those things before. But regardless of that it's nice to meet you Tim. My name's Brock.\" The raccoon replied with a big smile on his face.
