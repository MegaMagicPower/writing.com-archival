Your kind would have perished long ago if not for other species that had emerged roughly at the same time as humans. These species varied in size and shape but they were always bigger than humans by a long shot. They could have easily used humans as a food source or bait for larger game, but rather saw them as a resource and an ally. Humans helped keep their camps clean and helped with making tools and getting into places they couldn't reach. On rare instances there were clans out there that DID see humans as a meal, so if you were a nomad or refugee you had to approach new camps with caution.

Slowly sitting up he began to stretch his grey furred back, the toned joints unwind, he then threw his massive arms over his head and unintentionally flexed his huge biceps. Blinking his golden eyes your father warmly smiled as he grabbed his huge and firm white furred pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say Zve, i thought i be the one waking you. After placing you in my chest you immediately were resting!\", the huge wolf chuckled as he pulled his pecs apart to relieve the pressure of his buff beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been the sole survivor of the human clan in the north. During the nefarious winter period you clan attempted to travel south in hopes of reuniting with their brethren. Despite being a youngling at the time, you could remember seeing the group get smaller and your parents growing weaker as they gave you most of their food. Help came too late as your father's clan the Alphas came across the few left of your clan. Despite giving aid both your parents passed and you were the sole human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a human, the pack immediately brought you in. Winter was no longer a issue as the beautiful fur of the giant buff warriors kept you warm. You were soon fostered by the next chief Wolfren, treating you as his kin and teaching you of the pack's traditions and meanings. Even upon growing up you still felt close and grateful to have such a blessing from the spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zve, little one?\", your father's booming voice brought you out of the flashback. His clawed furry fingers reach in between his pecs, you were gently plucked up and pulled out of the furry canyon. Wolfren looked concerned as he placed you on his large palm and brought you before his bright eyes. \"My son i was asking about your dreams, are you well? You usually are so lively in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clasped your hands, feeling guilty for not paying attention. \"I apologize father, i was just....reminiscing on the past. I know by now all members of the pack at 19 would be warriors, and i unfortunately can not fill that tradition for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the whole space seem to shift as Wolfren stood up, his large pawpads stomping into the earth. The wolf had a look of shock and anger on his face. You dipped your head, of course you father would feel as ashamed as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zve why in the spirits would you think that!?\", Wolfren's deep voice boomed as he brought you to his massive chest. \"Do you think I'm that vile that i have that shame for you? You are my son and you being a human does not change that, our pack does not treat our kin as such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widened your eyes as your father looked down at you with saddened eyes. \"Please tell me, have i made you feel that way?\", you shook your head furiously. \"No father! None of this is because of you, I'm very grateful to be your son. I just feel shameful that i cannot be like the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfren suddenly tilted his palm, the soft furred flesh pressed you to his firm pec. The chief gently held you as he stood towering high. \"My son, you do not need to feel this way. I Iove you now and will always, know that you are resilient and were made my son by fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as your father comforted you, his warm palm and heartbeat calming you. Wolfren smiled as well as he looked down, he kept you in his giant embrace for a little longer before pulling away. \"Now then, i believe i shouldn't keep our pack waiting. I'll gather my supplies and we will go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, your father set you down on the pile of furs. You looked up in awe as from your father's mighty stompers was his toned legs and large thighs. His white furred manhood rested on his rock sized. balls, despite being limp it was still a good 8 inches. You briefly saw his eight chiseled abs before he stepped over the pile, his balls bounced as you now looked up at his huge round rear. Despite being muscle the large cheeks bounced and grinded together with his steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father's tail swished above his humongous ass, he hummed as he grabbed a small sewn together loincloth. Pulling it up his thick thighs, Wolfren did need to use his paws to manoeuvred the clothing to contain his manhood. His butt was practically uncovered as a thin piece of the fabric ran between his cheeks. Next, Wolfren wrapped his leather waist strap around his wide torso and began attaching his hunting materials. His sacred blade, laid on his hip and the red fabric dyed with his his clan's blood was wrapped around his pulsing buff arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath, the hunts were rather intense. Anywhere on your father's large body was a resting spot for you and you could feel his intensity in his focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfren placed a hand on his chest, giving a prayer to the spirits, his father, and ancestors. He asked for survival amd safety for everyone and you. Turning around he looked down grew determined for the hunt. Now then where to keep you during the event?</span></div></div>",

Bring his paw down he gently scooped you up into his hand. You felt a wave of comfort as you were shifted onto the warm plump pawpad, the black pad cushioned you as a field of grey fur stretched out. Bringing you close to his pecs, Wolfren rose before walking near the entrance of his hut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening the flap for a second a chilling breeze with snow flurries blasted in, Wolfren grunted as he quickly closed the flap. Sighing your father rubbed his thick neck. \"My word, the dark months are already sending their wind to halt our progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark months was a period in which the brutal full force of winter hit the region. The sun was sealed behind clouds and the winds were said to be controlled by the dark spirits wishing to put their victims into a chilling sleep. Of course hunts were more frequent as food needed to be secured for a time to avoid hunting in the blizzards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfren looked stern as he brought you to his face. \"Zve this weather is not good for you and sitting in my fur alone wont protect you. You'll need to stay in my buttocks until we're finished.\", the chief spoke with seriousness, you weren't surprised as should a threat ever concern you Wolfren would be quick to place you in a secured part of his powerful body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded. \"Ok i understand father, try to be careful when you rest my room.\", you joked chuckling. Being between your father's large cheeks wasn't any less comforting then his pecs. Both were warm, were seemingly endless in their size, and had his scent. Rather it be to hide you or rest if you grew tired during a meeting, your father's massive rump was jusr as much a home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing a smile at your upbeat attitude, Wolfen brought his other paw around and pinched the thin strap between his furred glutes. \"I'll keep that in mind, though you've never complained about a little pressure.\", Wolfren chuckled as he pulled out the loin strap, his cheeks seemed to inflate in their roundness as the strap was pulled down. Slowly bringing his paw around, you were greeted by the humongous butt of your father. It's size was like two mountains with white fur in between both grey cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his palm, you began to slid towards the warm dark crack of your father's butt. Sliding off the paw pad finger tips you fell on top of the cheek, despite the muscular glute the fur and fat still cushioned you. Wolfren feeling your small speck on his large rump palmed both cheeks and pulled them apart. You began to sink into the crack, the familiar pressure of the two warm cheeks began to envelop you as you sank into the ass. Warmth surrounding you as your father's sweaty smell filtered through, darkness grew more intense as you were like a mere dot in the butt. Despite falling for a minute into the sweaty white fur, you still were between the cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of his cheeks, Wolfren sighed as he felt a small speck between his glutes, his son safely held there in his rear. Pulling up the loincloth, the pressure increased slightly as the loin strap ran up the crack, despite this the fabric didn't actually reach you, proving just how deep you were. The walls of firm fur soon vibrated as Wolfren patted a cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Zve i won't be able to hear you, if you need something please squirm as much as possible. Stay safe my son.\", Wolfren smiled walking over he bend over to pick up his spear, the process squeezing you as his butt stuck out, the loud swishes of his tail booming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the entrance, Wolfren clasped the flap and tore it open, prepared for the dark month's ferocious winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief....</span></div></div>",

He slid up onto his elbows suddenly and you tumbled down off his chest off and down onto his stomach and settling in his navel, you shook your head and looked at him as he let out another yawn. \"Sorry boy, forgot I put you there, I think the hunt will do fine without me today....\" He said closing his eyes and laying back down. A hand drifted past you and you watched as it began to absently scratch his exposed sheath and large balls. You grunt and squirm out of his navel, your father reacting little to your presence as you usually were somewhere on him as a few minutes without his warmth would result in your death in the glacial plains that the tribe lived on. You walked up and began banging on the underside of one of his cliff like pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But dad, you're the CHIEF, they need you to lead them, you not coming could spell a possible moot to remove you.\" You say pressing your shoulder with all your weight behind it to try and discomfort the large chest muscle of your adopted dad. After a couple seconds a growl escaped him and fingers plucked you up and tossed you gently into a bundle of furs in the corner of the hut. You right yourself and watch your father heave himself to his feet, furs and hides falling away exposing his light gray coat to the dim room, his fur had a pattern of stripes and spots all over his back, coming to an end on his massive rear, a short tail drooped over the large cheeks. His thighs rippled with muscle as he did another stretch and let out a sigh. You were away from him for less than ten seconds and a chill was already assaulting your senses, despite you wearing a furred tunic and some primitive pants. There was a reason your original family didn't make it. You were on the brink of death when Gliron, your new dad found you. you watched your dad glide across the room way too quietly for a being his size and pick up a loin cloth, wrapping it around his waist and tying it in a sort of fundoshi style. Satisfied with being dressed for the hunt, he quickly sifted through the furs and retrieved you. He pressed you to his chest to heat you up a bit and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best we be off Boy, I'm gonna put you...\"</span></div></div>",

He slid the hand holding you down his stomach and into the tight hide cloth of the minimal garment. The fingers guided you over his large sheath and cupped you between it and his mammoth balls, the hand lingered for a bit before withdrawing, you quickly snuggled into the folds of loose skin of his groin, pulling the skin and fur around you to brace for the coming weather. The sound of rustling cloth was heard as your father stepped into the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chief Gliron blinked as he stepped out into the open air, a wind kicking up snow and whipping it into his eyes from the banks built up against his hut. His feet crunched into fresh snow and he squinted to look around the tribe, many other males of the clan were mirroring him, stepping out of the hut in their usual single loin cloth thong and the occasional rudimentary bandoleer across their muscled upper bodies. A small group had already gathered at the far side of the camp and Gliron made his way over, the cold this morning even affecting him slightly as he walked....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The temperature in your fathers loins dropped substantially in a short time, with cold clinging to the outside of the cloth and seeping through, causing the big cats scrotum to draw up tight, and threatening your cocoon of skin. You feared this would happen as the morning had already felt exceptionally cold. It only took a few more minutes and finally the scrotum ejected you from its folds, depositing you onto the cold material of the loin cloth. You instantly rolled onto your stomach, and luckily your father was standing still at the moment going over the hunt plan, giving you a chance to make it to the fall back locations, making it into his cheeks or climbing his sheath and going into it, both spots may cause him some discomfort, but you knew he'd understand and implore you to go there at a time like this, he was probably well aware of the situation already, with tht in mind you....</span></div></div>",

His body shuddered as your weight pulled on the taut skin, but other than that he showed no visible response. No one in the clan knew of you, and in Saber tooth culture the weak were food and the strong were king. If the others discovered your existence and that Gliron was harboring a human, he'd be seen as weak and kicked from his leadership and possibly exiled. With another pull you grasped onto the fur of his sheath, the soft cartilage sagging as you climbed up it. your back was digging into the soft musky material of the loincloth and through the fabric cold air seeped through your clothes and into your flesh, sending your hairs standing on end. With a final pull, you made it to the top and wiggled your way into the slit, the cartilage relaxing as Gliron let you inside, closing back up and sealing you in moist and rancid darkness, but it was warm at least. You slipped in next to his member, which was a good bit bigger than you, and awaited the hunt to be over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliron shuddered and relaxed as he let the boy slide into him, the feeling was unpleasant as his rough hide rubbed against his sheaths inside walls and he longed to rub at it but he was in the middle of council and though it wouldn't raise to many questions, the Chief doesn't usually rub his crotch in front of the clan. His second in command, a big brown cat named Bone Snapper, spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just shiver or something, Gliron? Cold finally wearing you down after all these years huh?\" The bigger male said. His chest, neck, stomach, thighs, and arms were covered with scars, many of which were from Gliron himself. Bone Snapper, or just Bone, loved to fight, and always was trying to usurp Gliron. He had beaten his way up the clan ranks, but Gliron was too good for him to best, and for that Bone respected and hated him with a passion, but wouldn't openly show either. Gliron wouldn't be surprised if just because he saw Gliron shiver, he'd try to kill him on the hunt today. The only reason Gliron hadn't outright killed the cat was a couple reasons, one was he was a great second in command, others were more personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't think so Bone, just feel like I drank too much firewater last night.\" Gliron said, smacking on a slur. Bone laughed and patted him on the back just a little too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bachelor like you can afford that. Not me though, I gotta stay sharp.\" Bone said with his eyes closed and a toothy smile, Gliron didn't let his clan know but he preferred the company of the same sex rather than a woman. Bone was one of three that knew that about him, and once after Bone attacked him in his hut he mounted the bastard and they spent the night together, he's had a couple more encounters with the large Cat of that nature, although its a hate fuck, Gliron can't help it, Bone had a huge ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you say Bone, just watch my back out there and don't put a spear in it, its been a week since your last attempt and you're getting me anxious.\" Gliron said glancing over his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, I'm too hungry too think about killing you today. So what's the plan? Are we hunting ferals, or are we raiding today?\" Bone said, his smile widening again. There were reports of a rabbit camp about five miles south of their village, and they didn't know that they knew they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raiding, their numbers are low and their hunters are lower. We set out and will be on them midday, they set up in a forest so we should get the drop on them. Let's move out my friends.\" Gliron said, and with Bone by his side, he set out for the rabbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swaying as your father walked rubbed you slowly back and forth within him, rolling you across his member and making you a little sick. The stuffy air in the musk filled chamber wasn't helping and you knew you were gonna need to surface soon for air already otherwise your dinner was going to paint the fleshy walls of Glirons sheath. You spread you hands and gripped the flaccid member, managing to still most of the swaying, but soon you knew it was going to get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliron sat in a low tree branch, overlooking a small snow hare camp, maybe 50 strong. They would only bag half a dozen or so, and take the supplies they had gathered. Hare's reproduced...well like rabbits, and the numbers they take would be restored in just a couple months. A hunter hare passed by beneath Gliron and went over and examined a footprint that was at the base of a tree nearby. He was young, maybe seventeen winters, shame really. As he beant to look at the large indention, a blur came from above as Bone Snapper dropped from the tree above the Hare and landed on top of him, smashing him into the snowbank. With a quick motion bit down with his large fangs on the back of the Hare's head and lived up to his name, breaking the young hunters neck, a spurt of crimson painted the pale bark of the tree next to the two. Gliron looked back up and notioned with his head and tail to the other dozen Sabers in the trees, all of them ranging from pure white to pure black. With o sound they all dropped from the branches and skulked into the camp, silencing at least seven more Hares before a cry rang out and the women and children began to scatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too Blood!\" Bone shouted out and the primal roars of the Sabers echoed off the trees as they announced their full presence to the scared Hares. About two dozen Hare hunters rallied and began sparring with the Sabers, and despite being on average a foot sorter they held very well with powerful kicks and fast jabs with spears and knives. Gliron made the mistake of going into a hut too early, only for a hares powerful kick to smack him square in the chest and knock him a good ten feet out the door. Gliron landed on his ass and felt the boy jostle around in his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry kiddo.\" Gliron grumbled as he stood up to face what had to be the Chieftain of the Hares. He was snow white and almost as tall as Gliron, with holes in his ears and scratches all over him. He wore an ornate loincloth that draped down to his knees between his legs, which rippled with hard muscle. A spear flew towards Glirons belly and he sloppily flopped out of the way, the spear catching his thong and hip, cutting both of them. His thong flew off and now Gliron was dancing around nude, not that it really mattered. He deflected another jab with his own spear, following the motion with smacking the Hare with the butt of the polearm across the face, sending an incisor flying out of his mouth. The Hare didn't flinch like Gliron thought he would however and made another jab, this one digging pretty deep into the gray Saber's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me!\" Gliron snarled, dropping his spear and grabbing the hilt of the one still buried in his leg. As soon as his hand touched it the Hare let go, knowing he couldn't match Gliron in a tug of war and instead whipped out a knife, going for his throat next. Gliron again was caught off guard as the hare lunged at his face with the crude tool. He pivoted and fell back again, catching himself with his hands and delivering a good kick to the Hare with his leg that didn't have a spear in it. The Hare fell back with a grunt, blood pouring from his mouth from where he lost his tooth. Gliron didn't bother getting up and instead ripped the spear from his leg and threw it, the weapon bore through the Hare's eye socket as he was getting back up, and he collapsed back to the snow, dead in an instant. A cheer rang up and Gliron glanced to see his men had gathered around, blood smeared on their mouths and bodies. They had finished their work early and had gathered around to watch their leader fight, probably hoping he would die so they could claim themselves chief but it hardly mattered. Bone appeared over him and offered a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good kill, Gliron, that was a smart bastard there.\" The brown Saber said with his stupid smile. \"He even took your Cloth mate.\" He said as the others chuckled. Gliron rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round up the bodies and supplies that you can find, we're off, I need to tend these wounds at home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to be sick for sure, but that didn't matter because your father seemed hurt. He was on the ground and his heart beat was quickened. Voices could be heard after a moment and you could hear Bone, the big brown saber that would most definitely eat you if he found you. After a moment Gliron spoke and you took a deep breath of his musky crotch air. You wriggled your way back towards the entrance after a moment to try an get some air for a second but before you reached the top Glirons entire sheath clenched, holding you in place, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGliron clamped down on the kid, he was about to expose himself while Gliron was standing around nude and oozing blood from a few different places, a perfect opportunity to look extremely weak. After a moment he let up and the boy didn't try again, good, at least he had been in his sheath otherwise he would have fallen out and been trampled by Gliron or the Hare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gliron, check this out!\" Bone called from a nearby hut. Gliron groaned and limped over to see Bone hold up a box. Gliron peeked in and blinked. Inside was roughly 30 humans, a tribe maybe. \"What should we do with them boss? Bring them back? Leave em' here? Kill em'\" Bone said a little too happy. Gliron looked back at the humans huddled in the corner of the box, staring at the big bad carnivore, they looked like they were members of the Hares clan in a sense. Other Sabers were gathering around, as humans were rare this far north. Gliron snorted and spoke carefully...</span></div></div>",

Looks like we're having human for dinner!\"</i> Bone shouted enthusiastically. <br>\r\nSome of the men cheered with him, the others gave a half baked cheer, not really all the excited by the prospect of human meat. It was well known among most everyone that human meat was notoriously disgusting, only to be consumed at the most desperate of times where starvation would be otherwise assured. Some say they'd eat their own shit before they ever find themselves eating human meat. The likely reason some of the men cheered anyway was because the prospect of completing dominating another tribe and taking their humans as prisoners was empowering. Though, back in Gilron's father's day, the only time anyone really partook in eating human meat was either for drunk dares or because specific rituals or rites of passage required it. Most of the time they would use humans for any entertainment they could muster, and simply leave them to starve once they got bored. This wasn't out of any malicious intent, they were simply indifferent to the idea of humans. To them, it simply seemed like a waste of time and energy better spent on hunting. There are only very view sadistic and depraved individuals who actually enjoy eating humans, individuals who love the idea of conquering and having complete control over a being so much smaller than themselves; much like how a serial killer starts out by killing stray animals before moving onto bigger game.   <br>\r\nBone gave a devilish grin as he peeked into the box of terrified humans huddled together in furs, and notes that every single one is male. What a lucky find for him to find his favorite type of humans so far up north like this. Bone's fellow tribesmen look at him with annoyance, much like how one would look at a man child who overindulges in childish behavior; a trait that most grow out of long before his age. Just as bone was about to grab one of the screaming humans, he is stopped by Gilron.<br>\r\n<i>\"We're not gonna us 'em for your... games, Bone.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\"<br>\r\n\"Because we ain't fuckin' cubs.\"<br>\r\n\"You're acting like the fucking cub, Gilron\u2014\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"IT'S CHIEF TO YOU.\"</i> interrupted Gilron with a warning, the look in his face stern and angry. <br>\r\nBone swallowed, losing composure and his grip on the box. He reposed by folding his arms together and looking down at Gilron with a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<i>\"You've gone soft, haven't you?\"</i> Bone countered, <i>\"why do you care what I do with these little shits, huh?\"</i><br>\r\nGilron didn't say anything, instead he just stared at Bone. <br>\r\n<i>\"You're getting old, Gilron. Only the old care about those as weak as them. Now, give me the box old man.\"</i><br>\r\nBone put his hands out, expecting to receive the catch back from his chief. The other cats stared at the two, curious to see how this would play out, and who would be truly dominant in this outcome. <br>\r\nGilron stared down into the box pensively with an expressionless face, the human that almost became Bone's prey looked up at him. Although he was terrified, he looked much more at ease under this cat's mercy than the other. The human shook as head, as if pleading with Gilron not to kill them. He recognized that look, the very same look his son gave him when he found him all those years ago. No, he knew he couldn't let Bone have them in good conscious. Damn if he was weak, he didn't care. At the very least, Bone didn't know that. <br>\r\nHe looked up from the box and said, <i>\"You're right... maybe I have gone soft.\"</i><br>\r\nHe closed the box and brought it to the still burning fire pit of the hares. <br>\r\nBone shifted his glance worryingly. <i>\"H-hey... what do you think you're doing, Gilron?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"It's chief to you. Say it again and I'll throw your toys into the fire before you even get to use 'em.\"</i><br>\r\nBone quickly panicked. <i>\"W-wait, that's a waste!\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Oh? I could've sworn you sayin' somethin' about them bein' little shits?\" </i><br>\r\n<i>\"Those are rare little shits, Gil\u2014\"</i> bone stopped himself.<br>\r\nGilron started tipping the box on it's side, slowly moving it into the fire.<br>\r\n<i>\"Chief! I mean Chief!\"</i> Bone pleaded. <br>\r\n<i>\"Well, who's soft now?\"</i> Gilron snapped. <br>\r\nBone gritted his teeth, unable to say anything. Gilron moved the box away from the fire, and approached Bone. <br>\r\n<i>\"Stay in line, and I might think about sparing one of these little shits for your... games,\"</i> Gilron said, <i>\"besides, I have a better idea on how to use 'em. Giving 'em to you would be a real waste though.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"What do you plan to use them for, Chief?\"</i> one of the by-standing cats butted in and asked curiously. <br>\r\nGilron did in fact have a purpose in mind, although he wondered if he should keep it a secret from his men for now. That purpose in question was...</span></div></div>",

You need to learn that humans may be weak, but they are strong in other ways. Our definition of strength is very skewed, I want you all to learn that it comes in many forms.</i>\" Gliron said. \"<i>And those who think I'm weak for such a course of action speak up now, so i can rip your throat out and get it over with.</i>\"  He said reaching down and tearing the loin cloth from the rabbit chief and grabbing a burning branch from the fire. Gliron pressed it into his thigh wound with a loud sizzle, holding it there to close the wound. He made no expression as he did this, another way to demonstrate he's ready for another fight. No one challenged him, not even Bone who still stood nearby. Others in the crowd held many expressions, some excited, some disgusted by Glirons choice. The chief wrapped the loincloth around the wound before making his way towards the dead leaders hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>After you're done looting, come to me to recieve your human, I count 30 of them and 35 of you, so those of you who absolutely oppose this can be in that difference.</i>\" He said before slipping inside, voices chatting as soon as he was out of sight. Gliron gasped and all but threw the box of humans down before collapsing to his knees. The Hare must have broken a rib or two with his kick, and the adrenaline was fading and the pain was increasing. He fell forward onto his hands and knees and let his head droop as he caught his breath. The humans in the box nearby stared at him fearfully, but some had a look of gratitude behind the terror. He smiled slightly before sliding into a sitting position on the fur covered floor and reaching into his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fingers found you and pulled you quickly into the frigid air of some foreign hut.

Gilron was on his feet in less than a second, teeth bared and claws out. Bone looked up at him smugly, not moving an inch from his leg crossed position on the floor. His fingers curled inwards towards you, the claws at the end extended, an obvious threat on your life. Gilron however wasn't backing down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Bone, hand him back over now, I chose that one.</i>\" Your father said biting off the last few words.

Gilron followed but Bone put a hand on his chest firmly, causing Gilron to suck in breath and wince just a tiny bit. The reaction was not lost on Bone however.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Oh, Ho-Ho! That hare did more than cut you I see, he broke a rib or three.

Besides Gilron, if the clan knew you had a human this whole time, they may think this lil guy has done some magic to warp your mind into adopting humans. It's ludicrous but it has a grain of truth I think</i>.\" Bone said taking another step back, reaching up and putting you on his shoulder, where you stared wide eyed at your father in such a compromised state. This was your fault, if you weren't here all of this would have gone well. Bone turned to walk out before your father grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Bone Snapper please, he's my son, I'll step down as chief and give you the position if you just hand him back to me.</i>\" Gilron said, a tear going down his face. Bone turned and saw this and was actually shocked. They stood there staring at each other, but Bone just shook his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Son? You love this human that much? I'm sorry Gilron, I'm taking this human and not your seat. If you gave it to me, then I wouldn't be formally recognized. But I won't kill him alright, think of it as an apprenticeship. I can't go back as that is the sign of weakness.</i>\" Bone said reaching the door, before sighing and looking back. You yourself look at your Father, his face hardening again and he just nodded at you. You were on your own, as was every member of the Saber clan. When you leave this tent, Gilron wouldn't be your father anymore, but your chief.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>My Son</i>\" Gilron said. \"<i>It's been an honor raising you, stay strong.</i>\" He said, you tear up a little and nod. Bone gave you two a second longer before stepping out into fresh snow, the flap closing on the tent and the life you knew. A wind kicked up and you huddled near the neck of Bone as he made his way through the camp. Sabers were everywhere, skinning carcasses, looting tents, and cleaning themselves of blood. You had always been hidden from them, and you felt wrong to be exposed in such a way. Some made way for Bone as he passed, as he was second in the line of command. Many noted the human on his shoulder and the whispers began. Bone halted as another gust kicked up, his loincloth billowing and exposing is thong wrapped bulge underneath it. You almost flew off his shoulder if you hadn't grabbed handfuls of fur. He yelled out over the wind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Hurry it up Lads, weathers changing.

He looked at you struggling to hold on to him. \"<i>So how the hell have you survived if wind alone is about to end you? This is your chance to prove the worth of your kind, kid.</i>\" He said as he walked over and helped another Saber  throw a body onto a sleigh.

This didn't go unnoticed by Bone, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Lad? Spit it out yer gob!\" he demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His rugged and deep voice vibrated throughout your body, his musky warm breath crashing into you like waves and making you flinch. You couldn't ignore the size of those massive incisors on this gigantic Smilodon. You never really got use to the ones on your father\u2019s, so now, suddenly thrust into the world of the tribe, and forced to look at the maw that wasn\u2019t your father\u2019s was ringing alarm bells in your mind.  You knew your father was larger than normal from the few tribesmen you were able to peek at, but this one, the one that held your life at his mercy, was the largest Smildon by far in the tribe. In fact, the largest of any giant you\u2019ve seen in your life. The fact that you only now knew of his existence in the tribe made you wonder how you even missed him. You simply stared dumbfounded, trying your best to quell your fear for your sake and your father's. Bone became annoyed by your silent staring.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oi! Are ya even listenin' ya lil shit? Do I need to pull your head out of yer' arse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hesitated to answer, you were caught off guard by the giant offering to pull your head out of your own rear end. You couldn\u2019t tell if this was a joke or not. Still, best to go with the least offensive responses for this beast, lest he resent you as much as he did your father.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded your head in rapid succession and said \u201cY-Yes sir\u2026 Sir Bone, s-sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir?\u201d Bone parroted, \u201cHah! Aye! I like the sound of that! Sir Bone!\u201d he said with a hearty chuckle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone looked at you expectantly, but you just stood there in awkward silence with a timid face. Bone\u2019s smile faded back into his usually grumpy look as he huffed, then he continued his stride while paying you no mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind became stronger, your gripped onto his fur for dear life, preparing for the worst. Your father had never been able to put you on his shoulder, lest he risk exposing you to the tribe.  Now you can see that that wouldn\u2019t have been ideal anyway.<br>\r\nHe would often tuck you safely in his garments, with the loincloth being the most secure location. Still, even that wasn\u2019t always safe. You remember the first time you crawled up your father\u2019s sheath, and how a mix of horrific arousal was drawn across his face. He nearly jumped into the sky the moment you did that, prompting you to fall back out into his loincloth as you only made it halfway in.  Your father looked more worried than you ever saw him at the time, and he thought he may have shoved you in by accident. He was guilt ridden, ashamed, and hot as his rock-hard member pitched a tent in his loins. When you explained to him that you had purposefully crawled in because of the cold, his guilt transformed into fury. He took you half a mile from the camp just so he could roar and scold you on your behavior. That was the scariest your dad\u2019s ever been to you, but even then, you knew he would be the very last giant on earth who would ever, could ever, hurt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thanks to your persistence, the idea eventually grew on him, as it was the most practical and safe way to keep you hidden during his travels. When you expressed how grateful you were to have him as a father, and how much you admired him, for some reason, you also confessed your feelings towards him. Once again, shame had down casted over your father, believing he had failed in every regard at being a parent. Yet, once again, with time and continued assurance from you, telling him how all you ever wanted was to please him, to make him happy, he relented. In any case, you weren\u2019t related, so even while he was your father and the most important man in your life, you never found it odd pleasuring him in that way. <br>\r\nIt was a different matter entirely for your father, however. Since he\u2019d raised you as far back as you could remember, even while you were old enough by then, there was always going to be guilt in his eyes. Guilt that he had no choice but to isolate you; guilt that he was the only person you could rely on for survival; and guilt that he was the only one you could love in that way. <br>\r\nYou remembered the day he first gave you permission to pleasure him that way. How when all was said and done, that he couldn\u2019t stop crying throughout the night. How he held your tiny body to his chest and just wouldn\u2019t stop apologizing, murmuring on about how he\u2019d \u201ccorrupted your innocence,\u201d and how terrible of a father he was. That was the first and one of the few times you\u2019d ever seen your father cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wondered if this was one of those times, how painful it was for him to hold back tears. You wondered if tonight, your father would be sobbing all night long in his tent once he was alone, this time being truly alone. You knew he was blaming himself, he always has, seeing as all he\u2019s ever done was try to protect you your whole life. Truth be told, he couldn\u2019t protect you forever. You always knew it was inevitable, you just wish he could understand that. <br>\r\nEven so, your father did his best to prepare you for when the inevitable came, even if he hoped it would never arrive. Though he had been your only real exposure and interaction with the Smilodons, you were well versed on their lifestyle. You knew what you needed to do to increase your chances of making it out alive with your captor.  Now was the time to make impressions. Might makes right in this world, and you needed to show that your might is worth respecting, that you weren\u2019t afraid of any challenge, and especially unafraid to die.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHEY!\u201d you shouted, as you stood with your legs spread wide and your hands balled into fists, \u201cI\u2019M TALKING TO YOU, YOU OVERSIZED KITTY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBone turned his head in your direction, barely registering what you said other than shouts. You flinched but continued still, aggressively breathing in a stomach full of air in your nose with your eyes clenched tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLOOK AT ME YOU FUCKNG AIRHEAD, BEFORE I TURN YOU INTO A FURCOAT.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now you fully captured Bone\u2019s attention, his brows a mix of surprise, anger, and curiosity. <i>Aright, no going back now</i>, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDO YOU SEE THIS?! DO YOU SEE HOW ANNOYING THIS GODDAMN WIND IS?!\u201d you shouted as your hand stretched outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOi, Lad\u2026 Are ya off your h\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSHUT UP! THE ONLY THING I WANT OFF OF IS YOUR FUCKING SHOULDER AND OUTTA THIS DAMN WIND!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you knew it, your legs were dangling in the air and the Smilodon\u2019s face was only inches away. He had sickening grin plastered across it, his eyes dilated and were laser focused on you, you could hear a low growl under his breath. Your blood turned cold and a prickling sensation travelled up your back. You immediately lost all vigor, now replaced with fear. Even if you hid it as best you could, Bone could smell it on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHah! Lost your balls didya, laddie?\u201d he asked, his question feeling more like a statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You said nothing in response, instead you crossed your arms together and put all your effort into staying calm and keeping a straight face. You would not allow this tiger to subdue you into fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCat got your tongue too? Your nothin\u2019 but a daft bug, lad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, you remained silent, not even breaking composure as you dangled. It may have even impressed Bone himself. But he wasn\u2019t done taunting you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAye, maybe ya have,\u201d Bone said as his grin morphed into full fanged smile, the inside of his maw in full view, \u201cby the looks of it, I wouldnae ride \u2018em to battle either,\u201d he said as he poked your groin with his clawed finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gasped, involuntarily kicking Bone in the eye in your shock. Normally any strike wouldn\u2019t even phase a giant like him, but at your size and in such a sensitive organ, it felt like being stabbed with a needle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYAOOOW!\u201d he howled as he staggered backwards, causing you to toss around a bunch but not being dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You couldn\u2019t help but give a light chuckle. This high and mighty cat spent so much time trying to intimidate you and build himself up, only to be caught off guard for underestimating his adversary\u2019s son. This absolutely did not go unnoticed by Bone\u2019s sensitive, and he only glared menacingly in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOi, ya little bastard! YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?!\u201d he roared; and for the first time, making you genuinely fear for your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI COULD RIP YA APART WITH ONE FANG, SHOVE YA IN MY GOB AN\u2019 SWALLOW YA DOWN MY GULLET HOLE, AND YA WOULDNAE EVEN MAKE A BULGE GOIN\u2019 DOWN\u2026  And yer lookin awfully nice right now, laddie\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fear was palpable now, plastered all over your body. Your attempt to gain respect by looking tough had only ended in Bone\u2019s humiliation by his biggest adversary\u2019s son. You huff air in and out realizing this mistake may have cost you your life. The oversized Smilodon pulled you in closer, you could only clench your eyes as hard as you could in fear of anticipation. You waited for the worst, then he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Bone say?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were terrified, dangling upside down, the only warmth was the light mist that poured from the growling mouth only inches from you. A rumbling sound built in the Cat's chest and bubbled its way up his throat before coming out as a genuine laugh. You rose your brow as you looked at Bone laugh and wipe his watery eye from where your foot made purchase. One or two other hunters were nearby and they had witnessed the spectacle, and when Bone met their gazes, they averted the look and walked off hurriedly. He composed himself and looked at you with his good eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Got fight in ya like ol' Gilron, I like that. It'll keep the days interesting.\" He said stepping into a nearby rabbit hut and settling on the floor with a solid thump, dust billowing out from underneath his bulk. He set you on the ground and ripped a bit of hide off a drying rack, reaching back out side and grabbing a handful of snow, and wiped it on the hide, making a primitive wash cloth. This was the first time you had gotten time to observe this goliath. He wiped down his chest and arms, the muscles underneath the coat bulging and flexing as he cleaned himself. His bent stomach rippled with valleys formed by its abdominal muscles. His legs were stretched out, his toes flexing and shaking dirt from them. His calves and thighs, jiggled and twisted with enormous amounts of muscle and fat reserves. Your sights set on his loincloth, which unlike most of the tribe wasn't thin leather, but rather some cloth that used to be white, but sweat and blood over the years had made it an off color. It still was the same fashion though, a thong that had a drape come down from the waist, covering the more explicit details of the groin and coming down a little past the knees. His coat was a chestnut brown all over, but his chin, down his chest and belly and groin, and out his inner cheeks to the underside of his stubby tail was white.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone suddenly sniffed the air and smiled, standing up and leaving you on the dirt floor as he dug through a sack in the corner of the hut, his ass was big just like the rest of him. The cloth thong disappeared in it and its two large muscle groups jostled as their owner shifted his stance as he rummaged through the sack before pulling out a slab of Jerky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0:Oh ho ho! Lookie here!\" He said looking at your small figure on the floor with another heartwarming grin, you smiled back even though he had threatened to eat you not ten minutes before. He continued.\" Pacifist vegetarians my fat arse. These leaf munchers eat meat just like the rest af' us.\" He said throwing the slab down on a fur on the floor near you, the gust it made from the impact almost knocked you on your ass. He sat down again, also almost knocking you over from his carelessness. Gilron had always been gentle, making no quick movements and stepping in his tent like he was stalking prey so he didn't disturb or hurt you. Bone was a complete 180, but also a foot taller and probably fifty pounds heavier than your dad. A meat scrap the length of your arm landed near you and pulled you from your thoughts. Bone was looking at you with an annoyed expression. You replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-yes Bone Sir?\" You say, unsure if continuing your aggressive stance was wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said are ya hungry, lad? I can't imagine ya've eaten since early this mornin'. I need ya to fatten up so you make a better travel snack.\" He said with a smile before turning back and ripping a chunk out of the slab. \"Definitely someone from a moose clan, this.\" Bone noted before swallowing chunks many times bigger than you without chewing. You pick your own meal up and without really thinking you walk towards Bone. He had taken a criss cross sitting position, but you easily slip under where one of his ankles was off the floor. You emerge in a fortress of fur and muscle, Bone's thighs relaxed but twitching now and then to keep Bone upright as he ate and moved. Ahead of you was Bones package, wrapped in that strange cloth. He had sat on the drape, pulling it down and pressing it into his crotch, making his sheath and enormous balls visible slightly through it. You walk over and sit down, pressing your back into the spot where his balls diverge, and instantly everything goes still. Heat rose behind you, and the slight sliding sound of Bone's cock slipping from its leathery confines could be heard, His scrotum eased out, dropping down to compensate for the increase in temperature and oozing around your form, which caused more pressure and more heat. You took a bit from your meat as Bone bent over and stared at you against his groin with a red face, some anger and some lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oi, lad! Who gave ya permission to go and sit there?\" He said huffing, the material around you becoming more taut as he acknowledged you, his member slipping a little more. You look up at him and answer honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I lack the fur and fat necessary for this climate, father always kept me close in very...personal spots to keep me comfortable.\" You said taking another bite of the jerky. Bone huffed above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ya mean his cock an' arse don't ya?\" He said and you nodded, causing him to curse. He popped the last of the slab in his mouth and chewed, thinking on that. His cock made its way back into him, but the balls stayed relaxed, the slight movements of Bone causing the cloth wrapped orbs to squish into you and envelop you. Bone didn't even realize you were bathing in his scent right now, he was unknowingly giving you a protection that could save your life. If he was the second in command here, and word got out that you were chosen by the chief first, that would make other Smilodons think twice before messing with you. Bone leaned forward and you were caught off guard as his crotch rolled over you, pinning you under his cloth wrapped balls. A curse emitted from him and he lifted off you, the drape sliding past as he rested on his haunches, returning to its position in front of his crotch. Above you was the bouncing bulge of the cat and his enormous ass, it was mesmerizing. Fingers found you and pulled you from you observation, pulling you out and into a palm that was level with Bones chest. He looked at you with a tired expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yer gonna be way more work than I bargained for huh?\" He said huffing. You smile up at him, taking another bite of the jerky you somehow managed to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really, just keep me fed and warm and safe, and I'll find a way to be of use to you.\" You say smiling at him, though behind the smile a pain for your father was still there. Bone perked his ear up and looked towards the flap before suddenly standing up and walking outside, the wind and snow had gotten worse. He carried you in his hand as he made his way back to the hare chief hut, where Gilron was barking orders. Your old man still lacked a loin cloth, his nethers exposed to the whipping cold but it didn't seem to bug him much. Gilron noticed the titan that was Bone enter his sight, and gave him a neutral expression but fire was still in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bone, move yer big arse and help Lockjaw with that sleigh!\" He said pointing to where a shorter but stocky Smilodon was securing the rabbit bodies to a long primitive sleigh. Bone nodded and headed over, the Black and Grey Smilodon smiled at Bone and then grinned at you, before returning the deeper expression back up at Bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened, I thought you were gonna eat the boy.\" Lockjaw said slapping Bone on the shoulder, who grumbled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, did you? Or didya not even grab one?\" Bone said checking the sleigh with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aye I got one, he's right here!\" He said smacking his bulbous rear. \"Right up against my hole, and lemme tell you Bone, it feels quite nice, takes all my will not to cream my cloth, it does.\" He said smiling. \"You should put your lad somewhere safe and warm too, don't want 'im blowing off yer shoulder and into a bank, you'd never find 'im.\" The Tiger said gripping the sleigh handles. You look up to see Bone looking at you thoughtfully before..</span></div></div>",

Lock jaw laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can understand that, word is that lil' bugger popped you square in the eye, Havik and Thornfur saw it happen. Spirits above only know what he'll do to your cock.\" Lockjaw said reaching over and squeezing Bone's groin, making the larger cat jump and swear. Lockjaw was a few inches shorter than Gilron, and a foot and a half than Bone. He carried two amber knives made from his fathers teeth on the sash across his chest, and had a habit of jamming them up into foe's chin and into their brain, locking their jaws shut in the process. A few rabbits on the sleigh had open wounds under their chins that showed Lockjaw kept the habit.The Black and Grey cat continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hurry it up Bone, doubt the lad will hurt ya, not when he's warm and safe down there.\" Lockjaw said heaving the last body onto the sleigh and gripping one side of the sleigh. Bone looked at you with a wary expression before he tilted his palm, causing you to gasp as you suddenly began to plummet. You sail past the plump sheath and catch the cradle of the loin cloth, sliding into the plump balls that seem to relax more once you slid into them, pinning you in place. You look back up to see a nonchalant expression settle across Bones mug and he let the cloth slap back against his lower belly, casting you into dim light, with tiny rays coming through the rough cloth here and there. Bone began to move, and the cloth formed a tube in it that already threatened to pull you under his soft balls. You gripped the material and had to turn your head to avoid getting a mouthful of musky fur. Each step the titan took made a different predicament for you. He bent down? Try not to slide out away from the warm balls. He readjusted himself? Turn your body or suffocate in scrotum. He jostled a bit? Don't slip underneath him and end up in his rear. The shear inexperience or indifference was obvious between Bone's movements and Gilrons. Bone was not aware how a simple brush of his thigh could threaten your life. You were safe here, yes, but the new foe was the body of your protector. Thick fur, thick fat, thick muscle, all looking to smother and squash you. This was the price for warmth. You gripped handfuls of Scrotum as Bone seemed to finally be on his way back to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone watched the chief's son plummet into his crotch and bump against his bulbous balls before letting his cloth close back up. He had to fight the urge of his cock emerging and tenting here. It happened all the time in the clan, but that didn't mean it wasn't teased. Policy made it where members often would taunt the cat with a hardon, grabbing it while passing, backing their rears up to it and taking it between their cheeks, Bone didn't feel like dealing with that right now. He turned to see Gilron staring at him from a few yards away. The Silver and white cat met his eyes, before glancing at Bones package. Bone met the chiefs eyes again and winked before turning back and helping Lockjaw to get moving. Lockjaw smiled merrily at his larger clanmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All better, human secured for the road? Good, now use that bulk of yours and lift this pile of meat onto the tread.\" He did that and soon was trekking back through the fresh snow for home. Bone noted most hunters didn't have any visible humans on their shoulders. He asked Snowcoat, a pure white smilodon that was almost the same size of Gilron about it. The cat was walking in front of him with a basket of herbs. He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Same as you I imagine, mines in my loincloth right now so he don't freeze and all. Not chief though, I 'eard he didn't take a human. Rumor has it you took the one he chose, that true?\" The white cat said, his outline hard to make out in the blizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aye it is, I think this was the youngest out of the human group. Gilron wanted him but messed up his words, I was able to pull one on the ol' chief.\" He said amicably. Snowcoat smiled, or at least Bone thought he did in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can't wait for you to claim the seat, Bone. Then we can get revenge on that Polar Bear tribe for a few years back and stop with all this passivity.\" Snowcoat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey watch your tone Snow before I add some red to your white, Chief is a great leader, you were just a cub when that raid happened, you don't know what we lost in it, what he lost in it.\" Lockjaw said growling. Bone eyed the Black cat, noting his stance in clan politics. Snowcoat just spat on the ground near Lockjaw and turned forward again. Bone thought and looked over his shoulder. Half a dozen cats followed behind the sleigh, and a silhouette was farther behind them, which had to be Gilron. Bone huffed, focusing on the feeling of the human rolling against his nuts, and savoring the experience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gilron wheezed in the snow, his lungs protesting from the intrusion of his ribs being where they shouldn't be. His wounds had closed but his chest was searing agony. He had managed to convince Havik to lead instead of him and that he'd take up rear for stragglers and threats. He left out that he'd most likely be the straggler. The blizzard was getting worse and Gilron was nervous. This was Blood Wolf territory. And while the cats had size and weight against the wolves, they were swift and vicious, using primitive axes and fangs to gouge flesh from enemies, eating it raw. Many a hunter in the caravan had scars from encounters with them, and at least half a dozen Icefang's, the clans calling name, had met their end from them in the past two winters. This was the perfect weather for a quick ambush, which is why Bone was placed on the meat cart. He was the best fighter besides Gilron so it made sense for him to guard the bounty, but it wouldn't be a surprise if he met his end as well fighting off the scavengers. They wouldn't be able to make off with the big cats body, just kill him and take a rabbit, and then Gilron could recover his son from that vile cats nethers. He halted as he thought he heard a howl over the wind, and a smile crept across his fanged face. <i>Just a little longer my son</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your arms grew tired and you gave up on clutching the balls, falling to the cloth and letting them roll on and off you again and again. They didn't put much pressure on you, so if you just timed your breathing with Bone Snappers stride, you were able to deal with it. A howl over the wind sounded and a cry rang out farther up the caravan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wolves on the prowl...\" Came a call over the wind and your shelter jostled as Bone let go of the sleigh and got in what was probably a crouched position. Cold wetness soaked your back as e must've gotten so low he was resting his groin in the snow. His balls drew up and you scurried underneath them and behind them, You would get hypothermia if the cloth got soaked, and you'd take your chances in Bone's ass rather than trying to stave off a slow cold death. you looked up and saw the fabric was bowing, making a U shape before closing off and slipping into furry flesh which was the beginning of the cats asscrack, you yourself were angled slightly near his taint, the taut skin coated with a velvety fur. Bone lifted up slightly, obviously not liking the fact he was teabagging snow and soaking his garment. You were still prepared to slide into the tight confines if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone got low to the ground, feeling the snow melt when it came in contact with his warm body, a pulling movement could be felt as the human ran across the cloth and under his balls to reposition near Bone's taint, this was strange but Bone had bigger things to worry about than a human getting up in his gooch. He lifted himself up a bit to see if anything had appeared in the treeline and as he did and arrow slid across his cheek before making a wet <i>thunk</i> into a hare body behind him. A howl ran out and 20 wolves, all white with red war paint on them, poured out of the woods. A roar rolled across the snow from Gilron, and others joined the call. Bone jumped to his feet and faltered as he accidentally shot his passenger way up main street. He grumbled, spread his legs and sent some probing fingers in and guided the human up against his tail hole, where there was much less friction.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another arrow flew by his head and he dodged it, feeling a whisker lose and inch. He pulled his hand back out just in time to dodge an axe swing aimed at his face as a wolf snarled wordlessly at him. Bone dodged the second swing with less effort, and brought his palm up under the canines chin, hoisting the wolf up before bringing him back down headfirst into the snow. Bone placed a foot on the wolfs head and took his feet in his hands, twisting the whole wolfs body while keeping the head in place with his foot, an audible crack rang out from the neck and the wolf went stiff before ragdolling a moment later. Bone let go of the wolf before picking up his axe and chucking it into the treeline where he split the bowmans snout in two with it. A howl rang out from the treeline to the right and 20 more wolves poured from the otherside. The wasn't a quick raid, this was a pogrom. The wolves were trying to take out the Icefang's here and now. Bone turned again to see Lockjaw with one knife caught in the chin of a wolf while the other plunged into the dogs sternum and went down, disemboweling the wolf in one graceful motion. The cat laughed gleefully as he did it. Bone smiled at him before stars danced in his vision and he went face first into the snow, groaning as he rolled onto his back, the pressure squeezing Gilrons son and making him squirm, he coughed up a little blood where his lip was bleeding only to look up and see a wolf standing over him with a club, the wolf raised it with a snarl and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the wolf winded up to deliver what would've been a powerful blow, a flash of amber caused the wolf to stumble and looked confused at the ivory hily protruding from his chest. He blinked and watched as his warpaint was mixed with his own blood. Bone groaned and got to his feet, feeling the human wriggle in the wrinkles of his asshole, wedged there from the fall, what an alien feeling.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone gripped the handle and yanked the blade free of the wolf, who sputtered, a fountain of blood began pouring from the wound and the wolf stumbled forward, attempting to grapple Bone but ending up just hugging the larger cat around his waist. The hands of the wolf gripped the cats soft fur, looking for something to hold as his life drained from him. Bone put a reassuring hand on the wolfs head before reaching further down and drawing his chin up and drawing the knife across his throat, painting Bones right thigh red with blood. The wolf dropped to the snow and Bone tossed the knife back to Lockjaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks, I owe ya brother.\" He said, and Lockjaw nodded before ducking as another wolf came running up swinging an axe at him, as he ducked his knife slid across the wolfs abdomen and sending a scarlet stream splattering across the snow. He pivoted back around and drove his other knife into the wolves skull. Bone picked up the club that had beaten the back of his head, just as another blood wolf ran up screaming, a stone mallet way to big for the pup pulled overhead. Bone jabbed with the club, punching it into wolf's open maw before pulling down hard, breaking his jaw and pulling some teeth in the process. Bone brought the club back up and uppercut the wolf, knocking him off the gtound a good two feet before he fell back to the earth, unconcious or dead, it mattered little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's with these whelps? This is slaughter....\" Bone said to himself. Lockjaw answered anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I heard they got hit by the polar bears as well this summer, their best were killed, these are probably all thats left.\" Lockjaw said picking up a spear and hurling it, the polearm passed clean through a wolf that was fighting Snowcoat. As the weapon passed through, Snowcoat gripped it and began wielding it against another wolf, as the one hit faceplanted, his spine severed. Bone laughed and lumbered towards two wolves advancing on the cart to try and salvage something from the slaughter. They saw Bone, blood dripping from his loincloth, their brothers blood painting his lower body and crystallizing in the cold, giving him a ragged look. He dropped the club, and opened his palms towards them, beckoning them to attack. The wolves bothe wielded spears and with a quick glance at each other they let out a yell and attacked the behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your were squeezed back and forth as the globular muscles surrounding you took turns supporting Bone's weight. You had already been chucked in here by gravity, and the Bone fingered you deeper within. By what you could hear over your own blood in your ears and the damp squelching of Bones cheeks shifting and sliding, the clan was in a battle. Gravity suddenly disappeared for a second before a shockwave ran through the muscles of Bone, jostling you and driving you right against his hole. The orifice clenched and grabbed an arm, but the movements were to sporadic and you were able to prevent yourself from being pulled into it. You had gone completely inside Gilron a couple times, and the pressure and heat is immense. Gilron did it when you were about to freeze to death, and he had little options. When you asked how he felt about it, he never answered, but that was an answer. He enjoyed it, but felt shame for feeling that way since you were his son. Bone seemed preoccupied, so if you got sucked in, he might not be able to keep from crushing you. So as he battled for the clan, you battled for yourself against a hungry, unaware maw that kept grabbing your limbs in an irregular pattern...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gilron groaned as he pulled his spear from the eye of a wolf, clutching his ribs. His vision was blurry with pain as he watched his men cut down the wolves. There had to be between sixty and seventy wolves in total, but they were no match for the veteren hunters of the Icefangs. Gilron glanced towards the meat sleigh to see Bone standing over a wolf with his foot on the canines throat. His claws extended and the foot pulled back, ripping out the wolves throat. Another wolf was getting back on his feet nearby, obviously taking a few fists to the face from the large cat.  Bone walked up casually and lifted the wolf up to full height before delivering several quick punches to the chest of the poor whelp, stopping his heart. Bone turned and winked again at Gilron before sauntering off towards the next wolf in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After several more minutes of bloody battle, Gilron walked among his men to see what the casualties were. They had killed roughly 50 wolves, their corpses mangled and twisted in many gruesome ways. The cats only had one casualty, Greenfoot, a slim cat that was an expert climber and scout, he had been baited into the woods near the beginning of engagement and was surrounded and butchered. He killed three before they got him. Other than that everyone had a scratch or three but were still able to travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gilron, we need to go after 'em, if we track them back to their camp we can finish this fight.\" Bone said and many men echoed his idea. Gilron leaned on his spear and made a shallow sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I'm not betting on the rumor that their best is dead, this was likely a culling, the blood wolves love to fuck, look at all these bodies, their barely twenty winters. This was an initiation, those who came back would join their pack, and those who didn't aren't worth the time to give a proper burial.\" Gilron stated, and the enthusiasm died some. He continued, looking at Bone and Lockjaw. \"You two know this, the wolves are usually more organized and lethal, if that was the true pack, our casualties would probably be half our hunters.\" Gilron said. Bone hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you doubt our strength Chief? Don't use yerself to measure our prowess, if the clan is weak it falls on the leader!\" Bone spat, and many muttered agreement. Gilron tensed, this was a different kind of challenge, he had to tread carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't say that, we are strong, but cunning and numbers can beat strength, we must have cunning as well if we were to fight them. But we have others to worry about, how is everyone's humans?\" Gilron said. Many blinked, remembering their new companions, and the next few seconds were filled with grunts as the cats pulled their humans from whatever recess they had ended up in. Bone slid a hand behind him and dug deep, Gilron kept a neutral expression but anger burned inside him that his son was in this Brutes ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pulled into light with quiet pop, leaving the warm, tight confines of the Cats rear and pulled around into his palm. You blink and look up at the amused expression of Bone. Grunts of approval and disapproval rang out around however. Most humans seemed to have survived in pristine condition, but about five or so lay dead in some form or another in their hosts palms. Another four couldn't even locate their humans, whether their bodies had claimed them or they had fallen out and trampled in the battle was unknown. Your father suddenly sighed, his vision glanced over you but didn't linger, but his eyes told you he was relieved you were alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So nine dead? I assumed it would be worse, let this be a lesson, always remember where the humans are, and what your body is capable of.\" He said, turning and looking at a solid tan Smilodon that had sharp green eyes, his loincloths belt was made of a briar vine, its thorns poking his flesh. \"Thornfur, bury Greenfoot and see if his human is still alive, send his spirit to the Far Wilds. Catch up when you can, Bone stay with him.\" Gilron said brushing past the big cat, his scent washing over you in his passing and calming your senses. You watched your father go and the rest of the clan followed, the convoy leaving the scavenged bodies of the wolves behind. Bone spat again, and eyed Thornfur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shaman duties suck huh Thorn?\" Thorn just blinked then began searching Greenfoot, removing his necklace and putting it in a pouch on the briar belt. He moved his hand to the belt and grunted as he forced one of the thorns into his side, drawing blood and dabbing it up with his thumb. He took the digit and drew a crest on Greenfoot's forehead, closing his vacant eyes with his other fingers. Bone grunted approval and deposited you on his shoulder. The blizzard was dying down, but it was still cold as sin out here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So did ya like it in there, Lad?\" Bone asked eyeing you as Thornfur worked. You laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really, you almost pulled me up into you, maybe next time let's avoid situations where that happens.\" You say shivering. Bone scoffed and looked down at his painted belly and loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah shite, My cloth is a mess, those stains aren't coming out.\" He said in a somber way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why is your cloth different from the others?\" You ask. He turns and smiles, the first time he seemed happy to answer you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not originally an IceFang, I come from the GiantClaws, the IceFangs are another species in a sense, I come from the largest of the Sabres. My clan died out when I was a cub, I looked enough like them that they accepted me, but when I got to full size, it was obvious that I'm a cut above them.\" He said. Thornfur looked up and scoffed, and that got a hearty laugh from Bone. \"My cloth is made of Hemp, a plant that grows in the south. It was my fathers, it has seen much blood on its strands.\" He said as Thorn covered Greenfoot before standing up and walking off, and Bone followed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thorn searched the corpse of Greenfoot, only to find the body of the deceased Smilodon\u2019s human, tucked away in the chest pocket of his coat fashioned from leather and fur. To Thorn\u2019s surprise, the body hadn\u2019t retained any visible injuries, not even being crushed under the weight of the corpse. But the human was blue in the face, likely suffocating to death as Greenfoot\u2019s corpse constricted him of air.  Thorn shook his head disappointedly, then laid the human\u2019s body on Greenfoot\u2019s chest, once again drawing his own blood as he painted another symbol. He hummed a mantra of sorts, probably giving the human the same passing rites as his fallen comrade.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watched this, becoming somewhat demoralized. A third of the humans your father had recruited had been lost now. <i>Damn, that leaves only 20 left</i>, you thought to yourself. You shook it off, there was nothing you could\u2019ve done. Better to move on than to linger on the loss of humans you never knew. At the very least, the fallen humans had received a proper send off, thanks to Thorn. Thorn was the one after all, who had the responsibility of sending everyone to whatever plane lies beyond death. This was just another one of the many sendings he\u2019d do in his life. You looked at the face above you, and saw that Bone also had a disappointed grimace. It may\u2019ve surprised you but considering the side he\u2019d revealed to you so far, seeing his reaction gave you some reassurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You lightened the mood and broke the silence by saying, \u201chey, Bone, mind if I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone shifted his eyes towards you without moving his head, \u201caye, go on, lad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy is your name <i>Bone</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He chuckled faintly, \u201cit\u2019s short for <i>Bone Snapper</i>, me lad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your mouth opened preparing another question, but you stopped as you put two and two together; instead, you said, \u201cI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a reason you got that name.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone smirked slightly, \u201cknew ye were smart enough to put two and two together,\u201d he stated, then followed up with, \u201cbut why <i>tell</i> ya, when I can <i>show</i> ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Admittedly, you turned a bit cold by that statement, unable to tell if he was joking or threatening you. Before you could respond, Bone suddenly whipped an ivory knife behind himself with his other arm. He seemingly pulled it from his hip holster without making any indication of doing so. The knife whistled as it flew across the air before making a loud thud as it made its mark. The unexpected jolt had thrown you off his shoulder, but Bone caught you in an instant before you could even realize you were falling. A large canid shadow fell from the trees some distance away and slammed into the earth below. The morbid howling and cries of a wolf echoed across the forest. When you regained your footing, you saw the wolf clasped it\u2019s leg in agony as the knife had landed deep into its knee. The leg had been completely bent backwards; the whiteness of bone could be seen piercing out of the now loose skin of the kneecap. Bone had thrown the knife with so much force that it broke the wolf\u2019s knee in an uncountable amount of pieces. <i>Ouch</i>, was all that came to mind. Bone had answered your question in the most brutal fashion he could have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank ye, Thorn,\u201d bone said, \u201cdunno how you spot that bugger from all the way \u2018ere.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn gave a nod and a thumbs up in response. You looked at Thorn bewildered, unaware that he gave any sort of signal that someone was hiding up in the trees. Glancing at the forest some yards away, the foliage the leaves provided meant the wolf must\u2019ve been well camouflaged. Yet somehow, Thorn had not only spotted the practically invisible wolf from so far away, but also gave an accurate enough indication for Bone to strike the wolf without fail. This seamless and incredible teamwork all happened with you being none the wiser. You knew you had a lot to live up to if you ever wanted to prove your worth to the tribe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThorn! How did you do that?\u201d you asked incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s Thorn for ya,\u201d said Bone, \u201che\u2019s spotted and hit birds from a mile away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn gave no indication of showing off or any sense of pride, he merely shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t know how \u2018e does it, but the lad\u2019s wasting his gift on shaman duties,\u201d Bone said with a mocking tone on the last part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn actually seemed to take offense to Bone\u2019s last statement, glaring at him with irritation on his brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBone approached Thorn, gesturing for him to stick his palm out. As he did, Bone slid you from his clawed and burly hand onto Thorn\u2019s lean and muscled one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGonna need ye to hold onto \u2018im while I take care of the mutt over there,\u201d Bone said, then looked down to you and gave you a reassuring grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWait, Bone?\u201d you inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he ventured deeper into the forest, leaving you in the care of another stranger. Naturally, you were a bit worried. You hadn\u2019t even gotten use to being with Bone yet, and now, yet again, you were in the hands of an entirely different Smilodon. You looked up at Thorn pensively, then he looked to you on his palm. The two of you just stared awkwardly at each other, but after few moments, the giant gave you a soft smile. You felt the back of his clawed finger pet your back, which startled you just a bit. He continued stroking you ever so gently, being cautious and aware of his own strength. Your worries faded as quickly as they came, as you felt genuine kindness emanate from this Smilodon, putting you at ease. You felt the soft vibration of his quite, barely noticeable purring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was strange. You\u2019ve always known Smilodons to be about survival of the fittest, but these giants were not at all heartless, the opposite in fact. But you knew their priority was on survival. Surviving meant they weren\u2019t granted the luxury of being very expressive with their emotions. Still, like your father, there always laid a softness inside their rough exterior, in each of them.  </span></div></div>",

Amazingly, the canine hid his pain and merely grunted. Bone leaned his forearm against the canine\u2019s neck, pinching him against the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow many more of ya are up there?\u201d Bone asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf didn\u2019t respond, instead he just glared at Bone hatefully. Bone reacted to the response with an increase of pressure on the wolf\u2019s injured leg. The wolf gritted his fangs in anguish, his eyes clenched shut as he gasped for air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll ask again\u2026 Are ye the only bugger left?\u201d asked Bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hardened wolf still refused to say anything. Bone didn\u2019t seem bothered. He grinned gleefully, menacingly, as he put all of his incredible mass onto the leg now, testing the wolf\u2019s limits. The wolf bared the pain as best he could, until he could bare it no longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf yelped, then screamed, \u201cY-Y-YES! PLEASE, ENOUGH! I\u2019M THE LAST ONE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone, with a familiar sadistic smile whispered, \u201cI. Don\u2019t. Believe. Ya.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI SWEAR! I SWEAR ON LUNA! ON STELIOS! ON LUPUS! BY ALL THE GODS!

He shook it off. <i>Caught in the moment</i>, he thought, and continued. The wolf barely opened his eyes in surprise upon hearing about Bone\u2019s human, but it was not missed by Bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s true then\u201d bone said, \u201cyer stalking my human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf shook his head \u2018no\u2019 violently in response. The wolf\u2019s supposed denial pissed Bone off even more. Still, the fact of the matter was that Bone wanted to get back at a wolf, any wolf, for Greenfoot\u2019s death. Any wolf that thinks they can disrespect his tribe will suffer his wrath for it. He gripped the injured wolf\u2019s wrist, then pulled on it as hard as he could. The wolf screeched in pain to no avail. Then, Bone finally pulled hard enough to hear a pop, causing the arm to dislocate out of its socket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSTOP! STOOOOOOP! I\u2019LL TELL YOU WHERE YOUR HUMANS ARE! JUST STOP!\u201d the wolf pleaded desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone raised his eyebrows in surprise, then remembered the four humans they lost in the battle with the wolf tribe. Maybe what remained of the wolves came back to reap the losses. Finally, after so much torture, Bone relieved the pressure, knowing that he\u2019d went above and beyond breaking this wolf for it to be any threat now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat humans? Where ja\u2019 find \u2018em?\u201d Bone asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf gasped in relief, \u201cwe found them\u2026 in the\u2026 snow\u2026 when we attacked you\u2026\u201d the wolf claimed, pausing every few seconds to catch his breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow many?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAbout five\u2026 I think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone thought for a moment. The Ice Fangs had only four missing humans, so he wondered if this wolf was lying, or if it was even their humans to begin with. Still, the wolf kept this information hidden until he was at his most desperate. If there was a chance these humans were the Ice Fang\u2019s, they knew they couldn\u2019t let the wolves disrespect the tribe by claiming them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Bone demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf hesitated and said nothing. Bone grabbed the wolf\u2019s one working arm and began to pull that one as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAHHG! FUCK! NO! STOP! THEY SHOULD BE AT OUR CAMP BY NOW,\u201d the wolf cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone did not let up though.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do ye mutts want with ar\u2019 humans?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA RITUAL!

Ye don\u2019t even \u2018ave the decency to kill \u2018em first? All for what? Yer fookin\u2019 rituals? Ye sick wolves just want to torture small creatures for the sake of it, don\u2019t ya?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf sunk his head low into his lap in shame. In the moment, the wolf likely knew he was dead. He had just betrayed his kin by revealing the knowledge of their plans, a plan that could save their dying tribe from the Polar Bears that had all but decimated them. Even if the sadistic Smilodon let him live, there was no going anywhere with his injuries. Even if by some miracle he made it back, his kin would kill him then and there. He began to snicker manically, which transitioned into a full-blown laugh. He looked up at Bone and gave him a maniacal smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf it means we can become the ultimate warriors and save our people, then we\u2019ll sacrifice as many humans as it takes!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">You\u2019d had seen the torture Bone inflicted on the unfortunate wolf. You looked away, unable to stomach much of the screaming or bleeding. You thought it was all very unnecessary, and Thorn thought the same. He scrunched his snout as he winced just hearing it. He\u2019d respectfully turned around so you wouldn\u2019t have to witness it any longer. Since you couldn\u2019t hear what the two were saying anyway, you covered your ears, waiting for it to be over. Thorns ears perked, he suddenly jolted his head back in Bone\u2019s direction, then sniffed the air. His eyes opened wide and became entirely slit, his stare intense, his breathing rapid, and his eyes darted left and right as he focused his gaze deep into the white greenery lowly lit by the sunset.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThorn? You okay?\u201d you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn\u2019s gaze fell on you now, his brows wrinkled with anxiety, as if pondering something. Thorn grunted apologetically to you, then his long maw became fully agape. Before you could even react, you were sprawled face first onto Thorn\u2019s large, slimy, pink member of a tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cW-WHAT THE HELL?! THORN?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His maw clamped shut, the zigzag pattern of his fangs aligning before casting you into darkness. A jolt of momentum threw you far back, and you landed just inches away from his uvula and the tunnel that was his throat. You would\u2019ve fell down the throat if the tongue hadn\u2019t pushed you back to the center. The heat was immense, you felt the rapid thumping of his heartbeat, his breathing now labored. On the outside, Thorn sprinted on all fours as he made a mad dash into the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBone found himself in flight as he was thrown several feet backwards, and just as he was, a flurry of arrows planted themselves where he stood in the snow-covered ground.  A good number of them struck the battered wolf, the one buried deep in his head brought instant death.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone could only react with, \u201cWHAT!\u201d before being shoved behind a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn, being much smaller than the muscle bound Smilodon, had managed to carry them both to safety just in the nick of time. An arrow whizzed past the tree, barely missing Thorn\u2019s head. Thorn signaled for Bone to keep his head low, peaking his own head slightly beyond the protection of the trunk. He ducked his head back just as quickly as an arrow struck the tree\u2019s base. He had seen it now though, a dozen or so wolves perched on the tree branches like hawks, as their eyes glowed white in the darkness. Only creatures such as Thorn would\u2019ve noticed in time, but just barely. Any Smilodon, even an impressive one such as Bone or Gilron, would\u2019ve never survived the encounter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone\u2019s curiosity betrayed his instincts, and he glanced beyond the tree just for a moment. His appalled expression indicated that he saw it too. He knew these were no wolves, or they would\u2019ve never stoked this much fear in him. These were the living folktales he\u2019d witnessed only once before in his life, the ones who invaded every nightmare he\u2019d had since he was a cub. These were the same monsters that wiped out his birth tribe. The fact that so many had been so close to him and he hadn't even noticed one, terrified him. It reaffirmed the stories of old; monsters who made not a whisper, not a sound even as they hunted in the night. The wolf who fell from the trees was but a meager tribesman, but he was alongside these monsters somehow. A fact dawned on Bone. They had seen, no, permitted the torture of the wolf through inaction, then killed him themselves. The meager wolf couldn\u2019t have been affiliated with these monsters, or he would\u2019ve pleaded for their help. Despite being shoulder to shoulder with them, he was not even aware of their presence or that he was being watched. If they had been the ones to attack the Ice Fangs today, there would be no one left alive to tell the tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of them were at least a foot taller than bone, protected head to toe in an unnatural amount of muscle mass and fur. Instead of being gnarled and scarred from a lifetime of fighting like most warriors, they were unscarred, unkempt, and looked like they had not even seen a scrape from battle. Yet, each one likely saw more battle than Gilron and Bone would\u2019ve seen in a lifetime combined. They had a grace to them, which was contradicted by their fatal nature. Combined with the paleness in their eyes that stared intensely at the two Smilodons, as if they were evaluating their prey; they looked very unnatural, but fascinating. <br>\r\nBone gripped the knife to his hip as he lay in the cold, snow-covered roots of the tree, readying himself for whatever was to come. Thorn shut his eyes and took a deep breath through his nose. He stood up, walked into the open, and revealed himself to the monsters that yearned to hunt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTHE HELL ARE YE DOIN, IDOT!? THEY\u2019LL KILL YA!\u201d Bone screeched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, Thorn showed no fear, making full eye contact with the predators. His eyes glowed a bright green, his pupils changed from sharp slits to large, soft, and rounded ones. Ones unlike any a Smilodon would be naturally born with. The wolves\u2019 eyes were soulless and devoid of emotion. Thorn\u2019s were lively and passion filled. The glimmer of determination in Thorn\u2019s eyes told them he was prepared to kill more than a couple of them if he were to fall today. The wolves reacted to this by slowly sliding back into the darkness of the foliage, not once taking their attention off Thorn. Soon enough, they melded into the leaves like the wind, soundlessly retreating into the forest and allowing their prey to live another day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorn and Bone huffed a sigh of relief when they were sure the monsters were gone. Bone still remained covered under the safety of the tree trunk, not taking any chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre they gone?\u201d asked Bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone relaxed upon his response, only to immediately tense up again when a thought crossed his mind. His eyes widened as he grabbed Thorn by the shoulders and desperately shook him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThorn! Me human!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn put a palm on Bone\u2019s shoulder, trying to calm him. He guided Bone\u2019s hand with his own and placed it under his chin, then opened his maw and slid the human onto Bone\u2019s cream-colored palm. A wave of relief, confusion, and anger had overcome Bone, the still present adrenaline clouding his mind. To see your unconscious and slobber covered form exit his tribe brother's mouth, as if you were someone else's prey and not his, enraged him. He grabbed his tribe brother by the neck and pinned him against the tree, his face contorted in fury, his gummed fangs protruding as he growled ferociously.  A puzzled Thorn merely stared at Bone with a quizzical expression, without even the slightest bother about being pin down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTHE HELL WAS \u2018E IN YAR MOUTH FOR?\u201d demanded Bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn blinked meekly in response, understanding the anger had made Bone forget he could give no answer. Bone\u2019s eyes lowered, he looked at the human kept safe and sound in his clawed hand, then his senses returned to him. He recognized his tribe brother\u2019s cautious efforts to protect you. Thorn coughed, calling back Bone\u2019s attention. Bone looked back at him apologetically and released his grip, chuckling quietly with embarrassment.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOi\u2026 Sorry, lad. Thought the worst\u2026\u201d said Bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn gave an empathetic nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awakened by the commotion of your giant guardians. You felt the groggiest you\u2019ve ever been, you shivered as the moisture from the saliva made the icy wind leech you of your heat. <i>Wait, why am I wet?</i> You thought to yourself. You lifted your arm and noted the increase in weight, then you realized you were covered head to toe in saliva. You looked up to find both of the giants staring at you concerned. You looked at Thorn, and in response he gave you a familiar gentle smile. Then you remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You jumped to your feet, \u201cWHAT THE HELL, THORN! WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?!\u201d you said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn whined woefully and hung his head low apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone spoke for him and said, \u201che did eht to keep ye safe, lad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKeep me safe?\u201d you parroted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAye, we were attacked by\u2026 <i>wolves</i>. The mutt wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh\u2026\u201d you looked to Thorn, \u201csorry for freaking out there, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNothin\u2019 needs explaining, lad. We get it. We\u2019re giants, and yer not. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d react the same way if we were ye.\u201d Said Bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You still felt remorse for making the gentlest Smilodon you\u2019ve met so far feel so guilt ridden; he had only tried to protect you after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m happy you did Thorn\u201d you said, to which Thorn\u2019s ears had perked up, \u201cwho knows what would\u2019ve happen if you didn\u2019t. Maybe just give me some kind of warning next time\u201d you said as you smiled to Thorn, rubbing the back of your head with your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn\u2019s sunken posture transitioned back into a high standing and enthusiastic one. He smiled toothily at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[Thank you little one, I apologize once more. I will properly warn you in the future.] <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo need to apologize. But I do I hope I never need to be <i>properly warned</i> ever again,\u201d you chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone tilted his head sideways in curiosity, \u201cbeg yer pardon, lad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, nothing\u201d you said, \u201cI was just tellin\u2014\u201d you stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then the thought suddenly dawned on you. <i>Who said that? </i><br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

It felt so near, yet nowhere close at the same time. The voice almost floated in midair as it spoke to you, you just couldn\u2019t pinpoint where. It was as if two, maybe three people of completely different tones were speaking in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone wrinkled a brow, \u201cthar what is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe other voice.

He wondered if the human was troubled by something he wasn\u2019t seeing. If the issue were about Thorn, he wasn\u2019t surprised, considering what\u2019d transpired. He knew Thorn was no threat to the tribe; not because he saw him as weak, but because he knew he was disciplined. Thorn would never hurt a fly unless agitated, so most underestimated him despite his incredible but reserved talents. The fact remained though. For all his nurturing temperament, Thorn\u2019s strength was equal to Bone in spite of his size; the only reason he\u2019d not been a higher-ranking member being that he refused the offer. Bone worried that even with his incredible discipline, Thorn may one day hurt the human in ignorance of his strength. He knew Thorn would never <i>intend</i> to do that, but still. If that time ever came, Bone knew he wouldn\u2019t be capable of restraining himself. He knew that he would try to brutally cripple Thorn even if he didn\u2019t want to. He may even unintentionally murder him for such\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, everything\u2019s good\u201d you said, interrupting his train of thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone snapped out of his trance of anxieties, \u201coh, alright then...\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though his mind was no longer focused on you two. His attention now was on the sudden and intense feelings he just had. He was stunned by the fact that he would ever think about killing a tribe brother such as Thorn, <i>and all for a human?</i>  <br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

They were celebrating in a fashion, and centered in the festivities was a dozen smaller wolves that had blood and dirt smeared all over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[That must be the survivors of our attackers, Gilron was right, they were initiatives to the pack, youngsters that had no experience.]<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thorn observed. You couldn't make out as much detail, the Smilodon had you beat in the vision department. He further hammered home his prowess with his sight as he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[The alpha male is there, and a human is on his shoulder.] <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He said. You squinted and made out a white wolf that was a head taller than the others. He wore a blood red loincloth that seemed quite ornate and well made. He also had a leather sash going across his bare chest that held a knife and a small pouch, and on his thigh another leather strap fastened a stone hatchet to the large muscle. You couldn't make out no human however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't see him Thorn, or our other humans...</i> You trail off your thought message as thorn used his other hand to tug his loincloth through his briar belt, letting the cloth drape over the branch. You stare dumbfounded at the plump sheath and balls of your companion. As you stared Thorn let out a sigh and his cock slowly emerged from its warm confines into the frigid air. His scrotum drew up slightly now being exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Take off your pelts] He nudged your mind with the thought and you slightly felt compelled to do just that. You shook your head and thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why would I do that?? What the hell are you doing Thorn? This is no time for you to be doing this stuff.</i> You say looking at him angrily. Frustration flashes on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I need both me hands, and don't need ye bein' in the way, trust me when I say I know what I'm doin'. Hurry up this is uncomfortable keeping maself hard in a blizzard.]<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He said and you felt that compulsion flash through your emotions again. Was he doing that? Without another word you slid off Gilrons pelts and stood in the cold air with your teeth chattering. Thorn rotated his palm to where he could pinch you with two fingers and lowered you towards his cock head. This was new, what was he.... Then your feet slipped into his urethra. You gasp and begin to struggle but more fingers secured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THORN WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?</i> You say in thought and out loud, A finger covered your face and kept most of your cry from spilling out. Thorn hissed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Idiot boy! I said trust me! Yer too powerful for yer own good honestly. Ye didn't take the calm vibes I was sendin' at all. Ye'd be warm inside me and ye will still be able to see.] <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He said as you got up to your waist inside him, he was oozing pre and your own member was hard as a rock as it was enveloped by the much, much larger male. You stop shouting and just watch in terror as the member swallowed you like some snake, it would clench pulling a good portion in before relaxing, only to clench again to claim more of you. Eventually you were up to your neck and all you could do was stare up at Thorn who winked at you before winking his dick and pulling you all the way inside of him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A few minutes went by and suddenly you found yourself freefalling a short distance before plunging into a hot liquid. Your first instinct that you had somehow ended up in Thorn's stomach. A quick feeling of the walls told you otherwise. You eyes picked up on the almost nonexistent light that seeped through the membrane of the walls and realized you were in his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[How do ye fair, little one?]<br>\r\nYou jerk in response, his voice had always been like a tickle at the back of your mind, but suddenly it rattled throughout your head, and around the walls that surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GAH! Why are you so loud suddenly?</i> You send out questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Since the outside world is no longer distracting ye, and the fact ye are inside me, ye world essentially is me now. I fill yer thoughts and senses, and control yer fate while like this, we are tied together in this union.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So what you did this just to get me out of the way?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Mmm yes and no, but I want ye to try something. Focus on me and think of seeing beyond yer cell, try to see through me.]<br>\r\nThorn said and the Cell you were in began to wobble as he moved. You focused hard on what he said and after a minute, memories began to play of you running across a branch. You became puzzled, as you didn't have any memories of that, and the vision faded. You tried again and the memory came to you again, only you were in a different tree. It wasn't until memory you took a step and the scrotum shook that you caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>AM I SEEING THROUGH YOUR EYES??</i> You shout in thought and excitement. The memory stopped and a groan rang through Thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Little one, please refrain from putting so much force behind a thought, ye almost made me fall out of this tree. Yes ye are perceiving through my eyes. I want ye to temper yer thoughts though as ye are much more ingrained in me, you could easily compel me to stumble with yer fear or excitement and that could get me killed. Now, do ye see the human now?]<br>\r\nThorn said as the memory shifted its sight back towards the camp and focused on the large wolf. Sure enough you made out a human on his shoulder adorned with a pelt that was the same color of his companions coat. He was smiling and laughing at something the Alpha had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh I see him, and he seems genuinely happy to be with the group that just murdered his protectors.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Keep in mind little one, we did murder yer rabbit protectors to procure ye, so no deep connections were made, and the rabbits got ye from the wolves through theft, am I correct?] The big cat asked and caught you completely off guard, you didn't know where the other humans were from. They could very well be original members of the Blood Wolves. From the atmosphere, you could tell Thorn honed in on your hesitation, a predator of thought as well as flesh, terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If I recall, Bone supposedly took ye from Gilron, am I wrong?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh...no you're not but let's focus on-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Bone originally opposed having humans, and his rivalry is legendary with the Chief. To suddenly take a human just because it was Chiefs choice made sense but is too shallow an attempt to aggravate Gilron, no you had to be more valuable to Chief for Bone to change his ideology.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thorn I don't see why any of this-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Ye aren't a member of the human tribe we've obtained, are ye? Ye've been a member of Ice Fangs fer' way longer than Bone and Gilron are making it out. Gilron was your guardian and Bone figured that out, so he claimed you in defiance of Gilrons choice to bring the humans in.]<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything. Thorn couldn't speak, so that wasn't an issue. But he figured it out and he wasn't there, what happens when the humans confide in their Smilodon companions about what occured in the hut. It could be seen as Bone beating Gilron in cunning and he could lose the Chief spot to Bone. Thorn felt your emotions and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Those details would've helped from the beginning, this childish bout between those idiots are going to get us all killed. If the humans are from the Blood wolves, it may be futile to try and recover them. We may just have to ask nicely.] <br>\r\nYou were brooding until that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait what? You mean walk into the wolf camp and ask for them back?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Precisely]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That could go terribly wrong in more ways than one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[True, but if the humans I rescue are just bonded with wolves, the wolves will track their scent back to our camp and a raid will ensue. If I die to prevent such a travesty, I'll be content.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't feel so noble, Thorn</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I need to get ye back out to be my speaker. Don't worry they'd probably keep ye, once again, humans are rare around here. Ye could make an addition to their clan or be used as a valuable trading piece.]<br>\r\nThe memory of the camp became dark as Thorn began to get you out. A few seconds later and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a wet pop you slip out of Thorn and back into his palm. He quickly closed his palms around you and drags you along his thigh, using his fur to dry you off quickly before reaching for a thorn on his belt and removing your pelts where he stuck them to it. He puts them in his palm next to you before cupping his hands closed to keep you warm as you dress. You give him a mental acknowledgement when you were ready and he places you on his shoulder before climbing down the tree. He glances at you as he begins walking straight for the entrance of the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Ye ready?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hell no but I really don't have a choice in this do I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Good Point.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this didn't work you'd never see your father again most likely. It wasn't long before a bark rang through the camp as Thorn approached, and the festive noise died down. Two wolves stood with spears at the entrance of the camp, but Thorn walked by them with no opposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why didn't they attack?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Wolves are curious creatures, a Smilodon approaching by himself is obviously not here to fight, I obviously wanna talk, and even if I have nothing to give, they take great interest in other races.] Thorn added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt eyes and turned to see more than a dozen wolves focused on you solely. Some curious, some hungry, some malicious. You squirmed a little under the gazes. The wolves were roughly the size of Thorn, but a few inches shorter. However among the wolves was an occasional canine that dwarfed the others, their features were sharper and their muscles rivaled Bone's, unlike the leaner builds of their tribe mates. You must've leaked the observation to Thorn as he answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Dire Wolves, I heard the Blood Wolves had them, but they are exclusively reserved to hunts and Camp defense, They breed slower and their pup mortality is high, so losing one is a great loss to the clan. The fact they have this many however is concerning, not just for us, but the Wolves as well, they must be threatened by something that we don't know about.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorn approached the center fire where the chief was seated near the dozen warriors that had raided your clan. He rose, a Dire himself as he stood as tall as Bone, and addressed Thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hail spirit speaker of the Fangs, I am chief Moonheart. You approach with no weapons, and no other clan members. We respect your position as an ambassador and will not harm you if no harm comes from you. You come during a time of celebration, please join us.\" He says outstretching his palms and making a wide gesture of peace. Thorn bows his head slightly in acknowledgement. You note the human on Moonheart's shoulder looked worried about the intrusion, and was making expressions as he stared up at Moonheart's face. The wolf wasn't showing any expression, but it was clear they were communicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The human is talking to Moonheart. They have a bond.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Those with an affinity can easily connect with an anthro, that human probably found the wolf attractive and made the connection in some way. It doesn't bode well about the allegiance of the humans, but it doesn't completely throw away our chances. Respond for me, having a staring contest with the Chief doesn't seem wise.]<br>\r\nThorn said and you stammered out a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh Thornfur thanks you for the invitation, and agrees to join in your merriment.\" You say quickly. Moonheart's gaze shifts to you and smiles, but his eyes sent another message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wonderful, please have a seat and warm yourselves, we celebrate the end of the culling, and the birth of warriors!\" He howls and the entire camp erupts with him, sending chills to your very core. The ambiance returns as the wolves go back to celebrating, but its obvious that they were all watching you and Thorn. Thorn sighed and took a seat on a log near the center fire and the Chief soon joined him, sitting on the side of Thorn that you were on. His scent washed over you as he sat down, and you felt extremely exposed being caught between the two predators. The wolf adjusted his loincloth and spoke while looking at the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You have quite the stones to walk in here while we celebrate Speaker, what is it that you want.\" The words were cold, the same as the Wolf's eyes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Tell him we want what was taken from us, the humans are our clan.]<br>\r\nYou convey that as nicely as you could, Thorn didn't look at the wolf as you did, instead fixing his gaze on the flames as well. The wolf chuckled lightly and looked at you sideways, his eyes catching the fires glint in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Part of the Ice Fangs? Twigs here told me they were part of the Snowfoot's. That's the rabbits if you were wondering.\" He said gesturing at the human on his shoulder who was staring daggers at you, he was roughly your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[They abandoned them, so we claimed them by right of abandonment. Ye kidnapped them from us.]<br>\r\nYou continued conveying to Moonheart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say we took them as a reward, humans are rare after all, if you want them back you'll have to make a deal.\" He said looking past you at Thorn, who was still staring at the fire. It was obvious he knew what you and Thorn were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[What do ye propose?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice Fangs pack up and leave, get out of this taiga, go south or north, I don't care. You know there isn't enough room for us. The Bears are returning, if one of us is gone, they may pass over the other without a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[We've been in this land longer than ye Blood wolves, it's where our ancestors resided. We won't leave. Maybe an alliance?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonheart scoffed and laughed at that. \"Do you speak for your chief or yourself on that Smilodon? I thought you were all about being the strongest, asking for help is beneath you. If you abandon your principles that's worse than abandoning your ancestors lands.\" He said turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I'll talk to my Chief, if not an alliance than at least a truce until we get through their passing. Ye seem to know about the potential humans provide. I have to ask, have ye merged?]<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what that meant but when you conveyed it Moonheart whipped his head back around and looked dead at Thorn, who turned and looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know about you Ice Fang's, but that is considered the highest taboo in this clan. Sacrificing your complete solidarity in that way corrupts your soul, and you won't make it to the far lands, but looking at you Speaker of the Fang's, I see you have done such a thing. I'll pray the spirits look past it when your time comes.\" The wolf said heated, but took a breath and calmed a bit. \"I apologize, that was unkind of me. Reach a conclusion with your chief and meet me back here in two nights. I'll return your four humans to you then despite the outcome.\" He said sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Five humans]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moonheart chuckled. \"No...Four, Twigs here has been in the clan since he was five. We were to trade him back from the Snowfoot's after they found him in the forest but you kind of killed that deal. It was luck one of our warriors recovered him in the raid. He, in a sense, is my son, and future chief of the clan.\" He said smiling fondly at the human. A pang of hurt ran through you as you longed for your own father. The emotion hit Thorn through your connection and a reassuring finger came up and patted your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Interesting that the leader would go from the largest in the clan to the smallest.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, he is a master tactician, and knows our lore better than our shamans. He will lead our people to a bright future. In fact the other day he-\" Moonheart cut off as a alarm bark ran out suddenly nearby. Moonheart and Thorn stood up and turned around as heavy footsteps sounded from behind to see Bone marching up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Ah Shite-]<br>\r\nThat's all that crossed your mind as Bone slugged Thorn across the face sending him stumbling almost into the fire. Bone's fingers deftly snatched you off Thorn's shoulder and let go of you before sending you spiraling through the air. You crashed into something soft and white and a hand quickly secured you, and you soon realized you had been thrown into Moonheart's chest and he held you now. He glanced down at you in surprise before both you and him looked back at  the two cat's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told ye thick headed arse to GO TO CAMP.\" Bone said slugging Thorn again across the other cheek, stumbling him again. Bone continued. \"I didn't mean THIS CAMP!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He swung again but Thorn ducked it and delivered a quick jab to Bone's stomach, who grunted and tucked his belly in to avoid most of the impact.  Cheers began erupting from the wolves as they cheered on the combatants. Thorn backtracked, avoiding the crushing reach of his larger clanmate, waiting for Bone to miscalculate. You knew Bone wasn't that dim though, he only attacked if he knew he was gonna hit his mark. From here you could see the blood in his eyes, was he really that protective of you already? How long had you been together? Half a day? Movement brought you back to your senses as Thorn moved in suddenly, deftly dodging a fist aimed at his head and slipping past Bone before doing a low sweep kick and knocking Bone on his large ass. The large male grunted as Thorn was suddenly on top of him throwing quick jabs at his face forcing him to put his hands up to protect himself. Bone pulled up a powerful leg and caught Thorn under the chin, slinging him down onto the dirt and pinning him with his calf. Bone sat up and quickly put his hands around Thorns throat, choking the Shaman out in a few seconds. Bone released the grip before it turned fatal and sat back panting. The crowd went silent with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dunno why he thought he hadda' chance.\" Bone said getting to his feet and pointing at Moonheart. \"I'll be takin' that back now. You got any firewater?\" The wolves cheered and began clapping backs as Bone propped Thorn up against the log and took you back from the Wolf Chief and a skin of firewater from a passing wolf, chugging its contents and letting it stream down his face before sighing...</span></div></div>",

He grunted in acknowledgement and nodded at the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks, what's that stuff, I can feel it already. My tips are all tingly.\" He said as he placed you on his shoulder, you were focused in concern on the unconscious Thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We've been taking to calling it 'moonshine', due to it being clear like the shine of our guide at night. We make it from Maize, so during winter we can't make it unless we take it from our stores. If your friend there succeeds in his mission, I'd be happy to share how we make it.\" Moonheart says with the smile that was obviously fake. Bone grunted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what mission would thatta be?\" Bone asked, and Moonheart explained all that they had covered. When the Wolf finished Bone spat to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What gets me is that ye 'ad peace talks with a damn mute. How tha hell did ye get all that from 'im\" He said jutting a chin at the prone cat. You paled, that didn't even cross your mind. Moonheart caught on that the Ice Fangs didn't know about the stuff of humans and saved the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He drew in the snow and the human on your shoulder helped translate, it was quite easy actually.\" Moonheart stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight, aight then..\" Bone said grabbing two more skins off a hook nearby and sliding down to the ground, using the log as a backrest. He tossed one skin onto Thorns chest and began chugging his own. Moonheart gave his fake smile before departing, joining in with a nearby group of wolves and leaving Bone alone with you. The sun was almost gone , a pink and orange glow all that was left in the sky to the west. Above the aurora danced slowly across the sky, lore stated it was the collection of the spirits that had perished on this day departing for the Far Lands, Bone watched it move and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Greenfoot is up there somewhere, hope he enjoys the endless warmth the Far Lands provide, along wit' tha bountiful prey.\" He said taking another swig, his gulping loud as you watched his throat expand as he took in the liquid.From here you couldn't help but observe the physique again of Bone. His enormous chest heaved and fell, his breasts swelled with power, the space between them deep and inviting, you longed for the cleft between your fathers pecs, where you spent many a cold night within. Beyond his chest was a landscape of white fur, with hills rising underneath it that marked his abs clearly, forming tiny valleys between them. Beyond was the blood stained cloth that covered a mound that you had been up close and personal with already, but you longed to visit again soon as well. It rested between his tree trunk thighs as he idly rocked his legs back and forth, setting the bulge to wobbling. Without a word, and while he was watching the sky, you slid down across his chest, the flesh giving slightly at your weight as you made your way to the cleft. As you slid in he became aware of your intrusion and his pecs tensed up and squeezed you. It hurt a good bit but he quickly realized it was you and relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are ye doin' lad?\" He said as he looked down on you. You wriggled a little deeper before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha's comfy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extremely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Gilron always put ye there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every night, his heartbeat put me to sleep, letting me know something that powerful would keep me safe through the night.\" You say slipping even further in, no doubt about it, Bone's cleft was twice as deep, you could probably slip completely in without being seen from the outside, but that also meant you could get completely crushed. Bone relaxed and you slipped up to your neck in his chest before he let his chest close slightly, pulling you into a warm embrace. His heart beat drummed below, pulsing through your body and calming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yet makin' me feel guilty lad, I stole ye from yer old man. I can't go back on what I did, and I can't replace 'im, but I can be there for ye. Get some rest, we got a long walk in the mornin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" you ask as he took another swig. He belched loudly before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imma stay up, don' trust these pups, they killed Greenfoot and 'ere I am among em, and Thorn may try to attack me when he comes 'round. Sleep tight laddie.\"<br>\r\nHe says looking up at the fire. You close your eyes and focus on the heartbeat. And before you knew it the troubles of today were giving way to another tomorrow....</span></div></div>",

How you slept at all through this was a mystery. You blink as sunlight streams into you face over the tree tops and observe the sights around you. The bonfire had died down to embers and crackled weakly, and beyond it a dozen or so wolves lat sprawled over one another in different forms of rest. Some blatantly snored like Bone while others blinked their droopy eyes, fighting off the aches of a hangover. A couple wolves were up and moving around, beginning their chores for the day. Nearby Moonheart ate what seemed to be somethings cooked leg, tearing off a piece and handing it to Twigs on his shoulder. The Chief probably didn't leave the Smilodons unattended during the night. You look to your left and see Thorn propped up no more than a foot away from Bone looking at the dying fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh Thorn! You're awake!\" You say excitedly. The mute Shaman looked at you and smiled, but no voice rang in your head. \"Did you say something? I couldn't hear you.\" You say and Thorn frowned before putting a hand on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He was knocked unconcious, the bond was severed, you need to reestablish it.\" Moonheart said without looking in your direction. You glance at him and then back at Thorn, who nodded in agreement with the wolf. Moonheart continued. \"Sleeping or lack of full consciousness will sever all but the strongest bonds. If you were to knock me out, Twigs would still be connected to me. Hell, our bond is strong enough to where I had full contact with him throughout him being in your custody, thats how the culling found your group.\" You frowned at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sent the new guys to save your son?\" You scoffed at the Chief, who smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Noooo.....I sent the new guys to distract you while my Dires isolate and kill the cat that had my Twigs.\" He said reaching up and patting Twigs on the head. You were a little agitated about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why not just negotiate like Thorn here did, why kill one of ours?\" You say. Moonheart laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me, was your first plan to get your humans back talking about it? I bet that big fellow you're on fully intended full blown war. That face you made tells me I'm right. You seem to be the only human that understands your actual value, and Thorn there seems to be the only Ice Fang that realizes that too. Your big guy may not realize it, but violence is the best way to get your humans back. The only reason I offer your's back in this fashion is because it may be the only guarantee to survive the White Winds.\" Moonheart said tossing the bone of his meal into the dying fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"White Winds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Polar Bear tribe, big brutes larger than your snoring friend there, I've seen one rip a dire wolf in half with his raw strength. And they're smart, they can sneak right up on a camp and destroy it in seconds.\" Moonheart said, idly groping at a scar that he had on his stomach. You pause and think for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You said Twigs was on Greenfoot, but we found Greenfoot's human dead with him.\" You ask. \"How is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"During the scuffle, the human panicked and tried to attack Twigs, my son took some string from the sack he was in and strangled the man with it. Shame really but it had to be done.\" Moonheart said taking out a knife and beginning to sharpen it. \"It had come down to that man and Twigs, all the other humans had been picked, Twigs thought he could get stuck with your Chief so we could get two birds with one stone, but your Chief told this Greenfoot fella' to take both of them.\" The wolf noted. You clench your teeth, anger at the human on the Wolf's shoulder boiled over. That little shit had tried to get your father killed, and only because he had lost you and didn't want to replace you did he survive. You took a deep breath and glanced at Thorn, the cat opened his mouth and pointed a finger into it. Seemed he wanted to reestablish the bond so you nodded your head. As he began to reach for you however a large hand shot up and gripped Thorn's wrist, making him jerk in surprise. A growl rumbled beneath you as Bone sat up, teeth bared at the smaller cat. A few wolves that were lounging nearby perked up at the sound and watched closely, wanting to see if it'd evolve into another scuffle. Bone spoke through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ye keep yer damn paws off of 'im, he's not leavin' me side again, understand?\" This time was different, instead of it being an intent to brawl, Bone held the intent to kill, and Thorn knew that. The mute tiger remained calm and stared into Bone's eyes, before looking elsewhere, a sign of resignation. Bone let go of his arm and sat up, you still squished between his pecs. Moonheart eyed the big cat wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sir, are the reason I may have to reconsider my proposal with the speaker there. You lot are too aggressive and pugnacious.\" He said moving Twigs to his other shoulder, so that his body was between him and Bone. Bone spat and looked sideways at the white canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dunno 'bout that lad, 'ave ye seen yer men out there? Not much different cept' we Cats don't sniff each others asses.\" Bone said stretching. \"Don' judge yer choice on me alone, in a sense, I'm not one of these kittens.\" Your protector stood up and pulled you from his chest and set you on his shoulder. Moonheart seemed unamused at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We will see, now if you don't mind I'd say you overstayed your welcome, you'd best be off before my boys come around and remember you killed their sons yesterday.\" Moonheart said standing up and gesturing Bone and Thorn to follow. You all walked through the camp and exited on the north side. Moonheart stopped at the end of the clearing, Pine trees casting you in cold morning shadow as the wold turned to Thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I await your return in two nights, Spirit Speaker, if I don't here from you, the humans remain with us.\" Moonheart said, giving a shallow bow to Thornfur, who returned the gesture. With a wave the wolf chief marched back into his camp, Twigs on his shoulder glaring at you. Bone snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As if we'd make a treaty with these bitches, ay Thorn?\" Bone said turning and facing the shorter cat, who just glared at him before walking off and beginning his way home. Your protector grumbled out of the side of his mouth at you. \"What's with 'im Lad?\" You look at him in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You did just threaten him for just reaching for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah you did, everyone felt the murderous intent you held.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah Shite....Thorn I didn' mean that!\" Bone said as he trotted after the Shaman, you holding on as he carelessly bounded through snow drifts.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The morning stretched into midday as the two cats marched through a forest that looked the same everywhere you went, how they were making their way back to camp was completely lost to you. No one spoke the whole time, you had tried to strike up conversation with Bone once, but he shushed you. Thorn walked ahead of you two, stopping occasionally as his ears twitched and listened to sounds that you couldn't detect. You sigh and lounge against Bone's neck, the big cat paid you little mind, his body tense as he marched after his smaller clan mate. Why the were so uptight was beyond you sin-. Then the arrow cut across Bone's shoulder where you had been moments before, a string of blood came out of the gash as it flew onward towards Thorn. The mute tiger dropped to the ground as the arrow embedded itself in a tree a few feet ahead as Bone hissed and dove behind a fallen log nearby. Blood poured and steamed on his shoulder, filling your senses with its metallic smell. You panic and take off your chest pelt, blotching at the wound trying to stop the bleeding covering yourself in his blood in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn it lad I'm fine, it's not as bad as it looks.\" He said pulling you off his shoulder and noting you dripping in his life water. \"Ah shite now yer gonna get the cold death soon if i don't clean ye\" Bone noted as he pivoted and looked over the log. You looked around for Thorn but he was nowhere to be seen, there weren't even footprints in the snow to hint where he had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't see anything.\" Bone whispered, pulling some moss off the log and pressing it into his shoulder, a curse slipped through his lips as he ducked and another arrow nicked the tip of his ear and sailed on through the Forest. \"Alrighty now I see 'em, Elk archers, four of them...Shite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that bad?\" You ask slightly panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Considerin' they got the best aim in these lands and the big bulls are roughly as strong as me, yes its a problem.\" Bone sighed. \"The wolves have been fightin em' for decades, they probably don' like the sight of two Sabers walkin' out of the dog camp, that stinks of alliance. I needya to peek for me laddie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? but what if they shoot me? I can't take arrows like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah yeah but if just yer thick head goes over the log I doubt they can do much damage.\" He says as he lets you grip the bark and climb up it. You slowly peek you head over the wood and don't make anything out. The forest was way too quiet for this to be a fight right now. it wan't until what you had mistaken for low tree branches moved that you finally noted the first elk, He was pressed against a tree and was roughly the same shade of it. He was tall, as tall as Bone, and his antlers stood another two feet past his head. He wore a harness that secured a quiver on his back, and a bow was drawn and pointed directly at you, though you don't think he made you out at that distance. His breechcloth fluttered in the breeze, what appeared to be wolf teeth decorated its frontal shawl and a saber tooth knife hung from the belt. Movement to your right made you see two more of the Elk moving away, looking up in trees and following swiftly and quietly. You did not, see the fourth one. You quickly relay what you were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thorn must be splitting them up for me, and no fourth which means-\" As he said that feet crashed down near you as the fourth elk suddenly was standing on the log with you underneath him. He had two hatchets in his hands as he stared down at the nicked Tiger. The bull elk let out a huff of air, it coming out of his nostrils in a billowing steam cloud before he bellowed and leaped down onto Bone. The cat snarled as he rolled out of the way as a hatchet sank into the snow where his head had just been. Bone swept his leg out from under the Elk and jumped on top of his prone form, rolling back and forth as you watched with tense fear as your protector struggled against the foe, something you hadn't seen out of Bone before. Your fear went to horror as the other Elk stepped from a tree nearby, bow drawn and aimed at the side of the big cats head. You panic, you were about to see Bone get killed and there was nothing you could do! You stared hatefully at the Elk as he drew back his arrow. You closed your eyes and drew in a breath, you couldn't watch Bone die. When you opened your eyes however the most peculiar thing happened.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You weren't standing where you had been before, no, you were standing off to the side with a bow in hand aiming it at the tussling anthros. You were big! You undraw the bow and look down, and gasp. You were in the Elk, it was similar to when you were seeing through Thorn's eyes, but more clearly. When you moved your limbs, the Elks limbs moved, the power behind them was immense compared to what you were used too. You glanced at the log and saw a small figure covered in blood lying prone on it, was that you? A voice came ringing in your head from somewhere, it was loud and had a musical note to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>WHAT THE HELL? WHY CAN'T I MOVE MYSELF?</i> The voice rang.<br>\r\nYou ignored it and focused back on the fight going on in front of you. The Elk rolled on top of Bone and drew back the hatchet behind his head. With a grace that was not your own, you drew the bow quickly and let the arrow fly, it cut through the right eye of the other Elk and soared out the back of his head. His body stayed upright for a second before seizing once and toppling over. Bone rolled and sputtered, before freezing in a crouched position as he locked eyes with you. That murderous intent you had felt from him before bore into you and made every hair on this new body stand on end. The voice from before came back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i> I KILLED OAKHORN?! MOVE BODY! WHY WON'T YOU RESPOND TO ME?</i> The limbs began to move for another arrow, you were losing your control of the Elk body. You spoke quickly through alien lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bone it's me I-\" You didn't see him grab the hatchet, you only knew he had because it had suddenly ended up in the Elks chest after a quick flick of his arm. Scarlet blood seeped out around the axe head and you coughed before falling back into the snow. Words couldn't escape you as searing pain took over all senses, the voice in the back of the mind became stronger as it cried in pain, its anguish shoving you from consciousness.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a moment you gasped back awake and clutched at your chest, only to find no hatchet there, you sat up, the ghost of the pain still fresh as you quickly realize you were back in your own body. You look up to see Bone picking up the other hatchet and walking over to the prone form of the Elk, who weakly crawled backwards away from the big cat. Bone put a foot on his chest and swiftly brought the axe down on the bull elks's throat, silencing the raggedy breaths that the cervine took. Bone threw the weapon aside and looked at you with raised eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well lad, I've been in many fights, but I've never seen someone fuck up a two versus one that bad. The bloody idiot shot his own clan mate through the noggin'.\" Bone laughed, his adrenaline still high, but he noticed you being quiet and looking quite sickly. He walked over and crouched down. \"Ye got the look of someone who tasted death, is it really that cold out here to ye?\" He said sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no, well...yes, but it's not that. For a moment...I took over that elk with the bow.....I....killed someone.\" You say rocking back and forth slightly. The reality of all that transpired in that past few seconds sinking in. Bone stared at you with a look you reserve for a crazy person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmmm no laddie I'm pretty sure ye just sat there lookin' cute and clueless.\" He said chuckling slightly but letting it die off when you didn't give him a look or respond. A crunch of snow sounded and Thorn landed nearby, dropping out of a tree. He surveyed the situation, pausing on the body with the arrow hole in the eyesocket. Thorn looked at Bone and rose an eyebrow. Bone sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bowman over there shot his bud through the 'bulls eye' there, heh, then just stood there and smiled at me like we were besties. Laddie here is claiming he was the bull, and I claim he's completely crazy. Put an axe in his chest before finishin' the job, and find this fella rockin' back in forth.\" Bone said grabbing more moss and dabbing his shoulder. Thorn looked between the bodies, and then back at you with a look of pure fascination and horror on his face. He looked at Bone and frowned, he obviously wanted to establish that mental bond like before, but knew he'd have to fight Bone to do it. The smaller cat got Bone's attention and said nothing as usual but made very subtle gestures before loking back at you. Bone followed his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh right he wasted his pelts trying to stanch me cut. Alright laddie lets get you cleaned up and warm.\" He said plucking you up. You were rolled into his hand and the moment you were on your feet a huge pink organ crashed into you as Bone was giving you a tongue bath. He passed over you before pulling back and plastering you with his tongue and pulling you into his mouth. The place stunk of firewater and spoiled meat, but you couldn't deny the warmth it provided. Bone tossed you slowly through his expansive mouth. His large fangs and teeth not bothering you the slightest as you closed your eyes and just enjoyed the heat. Eventually he spat you back out and looked down at you before showing you to Thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There squeaky clean mama hen, now can we get moving? Don' wanna get attacked by more, doubt they'll kill each other for me again.\" Bone said. Thorn looked at you again somberly, before turning to go. Bone suddenly decided that his shoulder would be too cold and slipped you...</span></div></div>",

Thorn turned back around and started to see Bone exposing himself so casually. Nudity was not uncommon, hell, a good portion of hunters say a cloth just gets snagged out here in branches. They're more ornamental among most anthros, but humans have a more complex system when it comes to exposing ones bits, and anthros have mirrored that system in more southern lands, but here humans are more rare, and don't have as much impact.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone lowered you down in front of his thick sheath, the skin of it rolling from the pressure of its resident as Bone got excited at the thought of you going inside it. He pinched the top of his cock pocket and easily slipped your small form inside. You tumble down the leathery walls and bump into a hot mass of semi hard flesh that swelled and pulsed, it jerking a bit at your contact. You put out hands as a reaction and that caused the member to jerk again and pin you against the wall, Bone obviously inexperienced at carrying a human in his sheath. You held still, but Bone seemed quite turned up still from the scuffle, as his hand pressed in from beyond the sheath,rubbing you up against his cock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone closed his eyes and purred, enjoying the human inside his sheath, not expecting him to feel sooooo good in there. A hand tapped him on the cheek and he opened his eyes and saw Thorn staring at him with ferocity in his eyes. Bone snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Whatcha mean ye didn' kill the other Elks? Shite Thorn, shoulda told me that the second ye showed up.\" He said quickly restrapping his Breechcloth and taking the bow and the quiver from the Elk that apparently the human had puppeteer-ed...puppeteer....Pup....that was a good name for the lil shit. Bone tested the draw of the bow and notched an arrow for quick use as he and Thorn took off through the quiet woods. As Bone ran \"Pup\" jostled back and forth in the apparent space that his sheath had, he had never noticed how roomy it was in there until he threw a human into the mix. Thorn led him off their original path, taking a long way back to camp towards the barren peaks that towered over the forest in the distance. After a few miles of stop and go, the two cats emerged onto a welcoming sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Before them lay a craggy clearing in the woods filled with natural hotsprings. The pools bubbled a clear blue, steam rolling from them and keeping the snow off the branches of the surrounding trees. Thorn sighed and shrugged at Bone, then pointed at the sky, which had shifted from blue to purple and orange as the sun began its trek to wherever it goes at night. Thorn walked over to a pool and untied his briar belt, taking in a relieving sigh as he removed it, some spikes coming an inch out of his hide and instantly creating scarlet streams down the shamans thighs. Bone stared for a second and his loins ached at the sight of his nude clanmate, sure he had only removed a briar belt and a piece of cloth, but that was a world of difference to the larger Bone. Thorn eased himself into the pool and winced as all his aches came alive from the waters. Thorn didn't look it at all, but he had to have 20 winters on Bone, but instead of being bent over or weak like most Smilodons are by the time they reach 50 or so winters, Thorn was still leaping through trees and battling Dires and Elk Bulls, looking about the same age as Bone. Bone walked up to the same pool, laying the Bow an quiver nearby for quick use. He undid his breechcloth, throwing his leather strap near the bow and folding the bloodstained cloth in a ceremonial fashion before gently setting it down and easing his legs into the pool, sitting on the lip so only his feet and calves were in the water. Thorn rose an eyebrow and glanced at the cloth. Bone rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We been over this mate, it was my Pa's, only thing I got to remember my old clan with.\" He said scratching at his chest. Thorn pounded a fist on his chest twice rythmically, Bone grunted. \"True, my spirit is enough, but something material helps. I got a question for ye though, why are ye mute, you got a tongue, whats the use of it if yer not gonna talk?\" Thorn smiled at that, rolling onto his stomach and drifting up in the water until his head was between Bone's knees. Thorn extended his hands and slowly dragged them along the larger cats thighs, massaging the large muscles with a skill and dexterity that surprised Bone. The back of the hands brushed Bone's balls, teasing them and stirring up the Snappers cock, its tip popping out of its cover as Thorn drifted a little closer, licking his lips, Bone chuckled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah that's what ye got it for, thought ye preferred the fairer sex lad?\" He said as Thorn looked up mischievously and shrugged. \"Opportunist are ye? Fair enough.\" Bone said easing his upper body back on his palms, letting himself loosen up and harden, tilting his head back as lips wrapped around his other head, taking his length into the warm embrace of Thorns mouth. Thorn placed one hand on Bones hip, sliding it back and taking a handful of Bones ass, groping it as the other hand found the bottom of his balls, squeezing and pulling the giant orbs and effectively milking Bone. The large cat moaned as Thorns tongue danced down his length with such precision and dexterity, hitting all his spots just right, at the same time the groping of the ass making bone idly pump his hips, and the hand on the balls encapsulating him in slight pain and enormous amounts of euphoria. As Bone got lost in pleasure, Pup was taken up in the act as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin pulled away to reveal a queer sight that took a moment to process. Bone had made his sheath retreat, leaving it wrapped around your waist as you stared down the valley that was his thighs. Between the Thighs was the torso of Thorn, his body leading up to his mouth that slid down Bones length, only inches above you. You just stared in disbelief up at the cats getting it on. Back in the water, you could make out that Thorn was fully erect as well, clearly enjoying this as well. A loud slurp and <i>squelch</i> sounded above as the lips parted for a moment and Thorns tongue snaked down Bones length, passing over you and plastering you to Bone. The muscle slipped into the folds of the sheath, scooping up your legs and pulling you quickly up into his mouth, dragging you back and forth along the large member. You sputtered as you were tossed around, Thorn going up and down on Bone, getting highly invested in the intercourse. After a time you ended up near the back of the mouth, Bones dick head above you, the glans swelling and pulsing from the extreme stimulation. You gripped at it for dear life, suddenly being thrust over the chasm that was Thorns throat. You let out a cry at the sight and the atmosphere changed as a voice rang in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Little one, can you hear me?</i> The musical voice that was Thorn rang in your thoughts over the sound of blood pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thorn? You're about to eat me! Get me out now!\" You say in your head and out loud as Bone thrusts again, dragging you completely over. In desperation you gripped the phallus, sinking your hands into Bones slit as he obviously was reaching climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let go little one, no need for you to get crushed by being rammed into the back of my throat</i> He said casually. Bone pulled back, dragging you across the back of Thorns tongue, the muscle attempting to dislodge you from Bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as being swallowed sounds great, I'd like to pass on that Thorn.\" You say as another thrust pulled you over the undulating throat, the muscles unconsciously awaiting your descent. Thorn growled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The bond is reestablished, hurry and fall so I can finish him off and we can talk.</i> He said like he wasn't asking you to literally be food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't get me out, I'm gonna make sure I give you the shits!\" You say as you let go, screaming as you plummet down the throat, the muscles squeezed you eagerly, coating you in mucus as you descended. With a quick squeeze you popped into a dim cavity that was Thorns stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBone pulled his head back and yowled, not the best thing to do when you were surrounded by enemies, but at this moment he didn't care. Thorn kept a consistency, teasing Bone by keeping him on the edge, prolonging his climax as he worked his head. Suddenly a weight lifted from Thorns tip, but as soon as it did, Thorn changed his tactic, pulling back while sucking, then coming back down hard. That finally set Bone over, and he finished, spraying the back of Thorns throat with his seed. He fell back panting as Thorn pulled away, saliva and spunk stinging between the cock and the tip of his tongue. Thorn eased back in the water, licking his lips and looking satisfied as Bone lay there, more spent than he had been in the past two days from consistent fighting.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Bone lay in his afterglow, Thorn rolled over and turned away from the large cat, sticking a hand into his throat and triggering his gag reflex. A weight traveled up his throat and the little one came out into the hot spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorn scooped you up and drifted back to Bone, putting you gently on his thigh, before drifting back across the pool, Bone none the wiser of what just transpired. You turn back and look at Thorn, who looked at you with a concerned expression. As the tickle of his voice manifests in your mind...</span></div></div>",

An arrow grazed across Bone's thigh, drawing a hiss out of the big cat who shot up and dove into the pool, still oblivious to you as you're thrown into the air. Thorn catches you and you look back in the dim dusklight to see half a dozen Elk standing on the wood edge, bows drawn as they advanced. Thorn let out a gasp at the sight and swam to the other side of the pool, arrows whistling by and splashing in the water. Bone emerged near where he dove in, reaching and grabbing his breechcloth and Thorns briar belt before following, leaving the bow and arrows behind.. Both cats jumped out of the pool and sprinted for the treeline opposite of the Elk, only for more to emerge from the trees in front of the Smilodons.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone rushed one, sliding under a shot directed at his eye, and came up throwing his breechcloth around the confused Elk, Bone grabbed the ends of it as he passed the Bull and crouched as he pulled hard. The elk fell back, the back of his neck landing on Bone's shoulder. Bone pulled hard and an audible crack rang out as the Elks neck broke. The large cat pulled free and continued his retreat with Thorn. He glanced at the smaller male and saw you in a cupped hand as he ran, furrowing his brow and looking at his bouncing junk but not saying anything.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An Elk's bugle call rang out, and others answered it all around within the forest, filling the air with a eerie song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shite, their all aroun' us Thorn. I can't kill 30 Bull Elks with a length of cloth.\" Bone griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thorn looked around and pointed, and both you and Bone followed his finger. Bone completely went pale as a dreamcatcher hung in a branch about 9 feet up. The edges of it were lined with dense white fur. Bone growled fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Polar Bears? POLAR BEARS THORN??? Ye wan' us to try an' seek refuge with those monsters? Yeah no thank's Lad. I'll take an arrow before I go to the Polar Bears for help.\" Bone said crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if on cue, a meaty thunk sounded as an arrow dug into Bone's shoulder and the cat snarled in pain and whirled around to see three Elk closing in. You gasp at the sight of the shaft sticking out of Bone's strong shoulder. This whole time he had seemed invincible but now rivets of blood flowed down the lines between his muscles. Thorn grabbed Bone's good shoulder and tugged it telling him it was time to go, and Bone relented. Thorn quickly snapped the shaft so it wouldn't get in the way and they mad their way until the forest made way for snow covered tundra. After about ten minutes of running Bone made a slurred remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thuuurn? I tink tha' arro was poisonnned.\" He said beginning to stumble. Thorn looked at him then down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I need you to merge with him, but stay to the side and control his breathing and heart rate. I can see the polar bear village, but also the Elk behind us, we can't afford a minutes rest</i>. Thorn said glancing back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>But I don't even know how I did it earlier Thorn, I'm at a loss here.</i> You say glancing at the faltering Bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Focus on Bone, pool your desire to be with him, and it'll be so.</i> Thorn said as he turned back to focus on running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You looked at your protector, barely being able to keep himself on his feet, and focused on him and closed your eyes, reaching out with mentality and spirit. When you opened your eyes they were not your own, but rather ones that had a dark tint along the edges, pain rang from your shoulder and chest. Something felt as though it crept through your veins, and Bone's voice boomed throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Just gotta put one foot after the other.....Just gotta put one foot after the other....</i> His mind repeated this as he slowed down. You spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Bone? It's me, I'm gonna take over breathing alright? Just focus on running.</i> You say as you somehow take over breathing, though you have no idea how you're doing it, it just happens. Bone replied hazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Pup? What are ye doin' in me head? You're suppose' to be over there.</i> His gaze drifted to your limp body in Thorns hand. <i>WHAT DID THAT BASTARD DO TO YE?</i> Anger flowed throughout and you almost drowned in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Nothing! He did nothing Bone, this is my doing, I'll be fine, but only if you focus on running and not on me</i>. You said and the anger boiled away a good bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Okay then, focus on runnin'...</i> His mind slipped and incoherent thoughts filled the space.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ahead was the village, a bunch of igloo's with smoke pouring from them into the night sky. An Elk bugle sounded behind you as if they were calling the chase off, obviously walking into a village of unknown numbers would be foolish, especially if the village was filled with the legendary monsters that were the polar bears.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The enormous body of Bone faltered and despite you quickly trying to take the reins you faceplanted in the snow. Thorn stopped and sounded like he returned and lifted up Bone a bit and looked you in the eyes. You however couldn't hear him as you realized you were now in a bond with Bone. Thorn pointed a hurried finger from Bone to your limp body, obviously telling you to return to your own. You obliged but as you departed everything went dark....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gasp and sit up, looking around aimlessly. You were in a dim, circular room with a small fire crackling in a pit in the center. The floor beneath you rose and fell and looking around you saw that you were on Bones belly, fur scraps bundled around you in a sort of sleeping bag. Bone himself was nude and exposed, his shoulder and thigh bound with grass and mud, a minty scent drifted from the dressings. Thorn wasn't anywhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Spirit speaker seemed adamant to leave you on the Giant Claw, he said that you needed to find your way back, and it seems you did, two days later.\" A deep voice said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You whirled to see an enormous figure step from the shadows and loom over you. A Polar Bear. He was as muscular as Bone and a good few inches taller. He crouched down, a Breechcloth made of hide covered his sensitive bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You humans irritate me, working your ways into societies, and when your value is revealed, war happens. The only reason you are on the Giant Claws belly and not inside mine is because we are observing the Spirit Speakers request of harmony.\" The Bear said with a monotone voice. You look at him with fear and skepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't choose to be a human, I didn't ask to be alive. You can't blame me for simply being.\" You say to the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, but you can choose to die, and you haven't yet, and I hate you for it.\" He said getting into a sitting position and placing a hand over Bones chest, feeling the heartbeat. \"Your friend here will heal in time, Elk are naturalist when it comes to poison, but we are naturalist purifiers, that includes purifying the world of your kind.\" He said, leaving his hand on Bone, a challenge in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why should I die? What have I done to wrong you?\" You say looking up at the bears face. He had Ice blue eyes that burned through your soul, and you squirmed under such a colossal beings gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your abilities, your...psionics. It's unnatural, and many a species have vanished to the far lands due to wars fought for your kind. From what I've seen, you are a powerful one, and my gut longs to purge you from this world, but alas, laws of harmony leave you sitting here insulting me with your existence.\" He said licking his lips, and a shiver ran down your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where's Thorn?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The silent speaker left you in our care, he wrote that he needed to spread the chance of a peace between his clan and the wolves to stop the bears.\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you let him go? Aren't you...you know? The bears....\" You say looking him up and down. The monster peeled back the mud on Bone's thigh, and a foul smelling substance was plastered to it and around an angry cut, the bear put the wrap back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Typical human, completely devoid of any idea of what is going on. No, we are not 'the bears', the ones other tribes refer to are our Brothers who had sided with humans, and now they walk the earth as mindless vagrants beg for nothing but blood and pillaging. They are the pinnacle of what my culture preaches. That is; Purge humans, don't protect them. My gut hungers for you the more you keep flapping your lips.\" He said before bending down and kissing Bone on the lips. \"The fact you now are with my old friend makes this all the worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You knew Bone Snapper?\" You ask incredulously. And the bears eyes turned a somber note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bone Snapper now is it, huh Atanik?\" The bear said smiling down at the sleeping cat. \"Yes I knew 'Bone' here, he grew up in this area, our clans were close allies, but he blames us for the destruction of his clan since it was the Vagrant bears, and in turn I blame humans.\" His original demeanor returned and he looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My name is Kilak, in your tongue it simply means Sky, and Atanik here means 'leader', as he was destined to be so of his people.\" The bear said standing up. \"I'm fetching water, do you need food human?\" He said it with kindness, but his pure hatred for you stayed in his eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded your head and he departed, leaving you in the igloo alone with Bone...</span></span></div></div>",

As soon as it did you tried flushing it out. The surrealism of it all was a living nightmare, it was too real for you to accept. You felt the dull blade of the axe lodge into your chest, <i>or the Elk\u2019s chest</i>. You were burned by the hot blood painting you in the biting cold. Then to have it clot in your throat\u2014 It was agonizing. However, not in part due to pain, but because you were living the fear of the Elk as he huffed his last breathes. The thought of being the <i>cause</i> of that pain, <i>living</i> that pain, then <i>accepting</i> that pain\u2026 No, you never wanted to experience that again.  <i>What if that were me?

Bone\u2019s claws dug into the bed of furs he rested on as he bit his lower lip. He knew he\u2019d need to play nice to ensure your survival, despite how much he wanted to bash both of these brutes\u2019 heads in. Perhaps he could\u2019ve taken Kilak even with his injury, but he had no chance against Mishka right now. If it were his own life he wouldn\u2019t care, he\u2019d throw it away in a heartbeat out of pride. But you? <b>No.</b> He\u2019d endure anything to keep you from harm. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka sulked as he caressed your back with a claw, \u201cyou poor creature...\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shivered. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHumans are like us in many ways, you\u2019ve suffered the same as we have. Regardless of your powers, I can at least insure your safety, I promise you that,\u201d he said as he sneered at a displeased Kilak across the tent. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>He knows?

Bone shrugged innocently, as if saying, <i>don\u2019t look at me!</i> Mishka answered the question before you could ask. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWorry not, my Uncle has not betrayed your trust. We Marimiut have known the secrets that dwell beneath humans for eons.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Secrets</i>? What <i>secrets</i>?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease, human, I am no fool. It\u2019s pointless to feign ignorance.

I don\u2019t know anything about secrets or awakenings!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka scratched his jaw. \u201cHmmm\u2026 I detect no falsehood within you. Indeed, you speak honestly,\u201d he mumbles to himself, \u201cthis is strange; I was told humans could not awaken without awareness of their power\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Awaken?</i>\u201d you repeated. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kilak rolled his eyes and leaned forward. \u201c<b>For the love of spirits</b>\u2014 <i>An awakening</i> means you\u2019ve begun to use your powers only after you understand precisely what they are and how to use them. Awakening without awareness is like swimming the seas with no arms or legs. <b>Impossible</b>.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka held a finger up. \u201cNot <i>impossible</i>, but not <i>likely</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs that bad?\u201d you asked as you twiddled your thumbs.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka shook his head. \u201cIt is simply an anomaly is all, human.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAn <i>anomaly</i>\u2026 or the <b>insect is deceitful.</b>\u201d said Kilak. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka growled. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken <b>quite enough, Father</b>.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kilak backed off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka went docile again out of courtesy for you, \u201cIt only means you may excel in your abilities sooner than most. Though your kind has likely forgotten about their lost power. Perhaps we can help you better understand yours; do you know what it is?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure, it was so surreal\u2014 Like dreaming without sleep. I remember I was in the body of an elk when he killed his friend, then I <i>felt his pain</i> when Bone put an axe in him\u2026\u201d you shuddered, \u201cthe other time, I saw through the eyes of our friend, Thorn, when I was inside him\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wished you would\u2019ve cut yourself off, because Bone\u2019s face was blood red as he grind his teeth, clearly not happy at the thought of you inside <b>anyone but himself.</b> He glowered at you, expecting an explanation. You shrugged innocently. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Fascinating</i>,\u201d said Mishka, \u201cdo you remember what caused that to happen?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your attention returned to him, \u201cBone was about to get shot by the elk, in my head I wanted to save him, but I knew I couldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone\u2019s expression softened at that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, a life or death situation triggers it?\u201d asked Mishka. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe, but I don\u2019t really see the use\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen you said you witnessed what the elk saw, are you sure you didn\u2019t once try to move? Why would an elk kill one of their own, have you never stopped to consider that? Perhaps <i>your hand</i> was the one that forced it to be.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then it hit you, and you felt so stupid. When it happened with Thorn, you almost sent him flying into the ground from your excitement. It was no different with the elk, you made him kill his friend. Why did it take you this long to realize? It\u2019s why Bone named you 'Pup' after all; a \u2018<i>Puppeteer of Giants</i>.'  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka was intrigued.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis ability could make you quite the asset to your tribe, human. Perhaps it may be in both our interest if you stayed for some time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded. This Marimiut did provide answers to your questions, but the though couldn't escape you. <i>Why is he so kind to me? Why doesn\u2019t he hate me like his Father?</i> Whatever the reason, at least for now, it was mutually beneficial. Maybe you'd be able to puppeteer a giant once more.</span>  <br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Mishka moved closer to his father, perhaps to stir him. Bone inhaled deeply, discreetly rubbing his fist regularly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUncle Atanik has accompanied you for some time I assume?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUhh\u2026 Well, we\u2019re <i>recent pals</i>, but I trust him.\u201d You said. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone quelled his anxiety by helping himself to the assortment of dried and cooked meat Kilak brought.

He coughed as he pounded his chest. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You snickered at the reaction. \u201cNo, Nanuk Mishka, he\u2019s not.

You laughed haphazardly, trying to ease tension before it arose.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou <i>sensed it?</i> Like some sort of <i>empath</i> or something?\u201d you teased.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka brightened. \u201cYES! Indeed! How did you know?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You awkwardly chuckled until you realized Mishka awaited a response.   <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 <i>You\u2019re serious?</i>\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kilak rolled his eyes as he shook his head disapprovingly, knowing Mishka understood the human was joking and guessed on chance. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka raised his other palm. \u201cI only jest, human. I know you would know nothing about that. However, that was quite an accurate guess.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It made sense. You thought these bears had strong intuition, but it\u2019s because they literally see right through you. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka beamed proudly. \u201cYes, in that regard we are alike. You have your <i>psychics</i>, and we have our <i>empaths.</i>\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone snorted. \u201cOi, that <b>nonsense</b> makes for sum good <b>tales</b> for tha little wuns, buh back to yer <b>question</b>, lad.

Still, he\u2019s <b>safer wif\u2019 me</b> than anywun else,\u201d he made sure to point out. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>Your</b> human?\u201d Mishka reiterated. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A wrinkle formed between Bone\u2019s snout and brow; he knew he had offended the Nanuk somehow. Mishka rose and slowly approached him, Kilak tensed, but Bone maintained confidence by staying relaxed. You stared at Bone uneasily from the Bear\u2019s lowered hand, shaking your head as if telling him not to say anything stupid.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka stood above the injured Smilotuk. \u201cAre you implying that you <b>own</b> him?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone blinked obliviously. \u201cWell, \u2018en ah sense, <b>yes</b>.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You face palmed, as did Kilak. Admittedly, it felt good that a giant finally acknowledged you as a person. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>Truly</b>? Should we not inquire <i>Pup</i> on the matter?\u201d he said looking down at you. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The feeling disappeared. The last thing you wanted to be was a source of conflict sandwiched between two giants. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>I uhm\u2026 Well\u2014</i>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGo on, human. He cannot hurt you in my presence.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That statement surprised you. Bone was the giant in the room you were least afraid of. In fact, he might be the <i>only thing</i> keeping you together right now. Bone had to bite his tongue to keep his fury at bay.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Ah ain\u2019t the monstah \u2018ere, he is!</i> Bone thought. <i>Pup\u2019s mine!

His mind wavered. <i>Pup\u2019s human, not prey\u2026 Pup\u2019s human, not prey\u2026</i> He echoed like a mantra in his head. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Atanik</i>\u2026 Are you <i>alright?</i>\u201d asked Kilak.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYe, ahm alright\u2026 Just ah <b>stupid</b> thing te say es all.\u201d Bone chuckled.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy is that <b>stupid?</b>\u201d asked Mishka.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCause <b>ahm</b> the wun been <b>protectin\u2019</b> the little shite since I met \u2018im.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone knew that himself, but now a lingering insecurity dwell in his head. <i>The pressure\u2019s jus gettin\u2019 to me</i>, he thought. He knew he\u2019d never forgive himself if, as Pup\u2019s guardian, he\u2019d be the one to hurt him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, Bone would <b>never</b> stab me in the back like that!\u201d Pup claimed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone exhaled with relief; his human\u2019s trust in him did quell a bit of the fear. <i>Thanks, Pup. </i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bone just feels responsible for me, he doesn\u2019t actually think he owns me.

It is the <b>duty</b> of the Nanuk to be thorough when <b>protecting</b> his own and those weaker than himself.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHah, didnae even take offense, laddie!

It was evident Kilak washed them from the lack of smell Bone prided in having.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>AYE!</b> Don\u2019t ye go <b>throwin\u2019</b> things at me fookin\u2019 face!\u201d Bone said, then examined his cloth. \u201cYou took mah newest stains outta\u2019 \u2018em!\u201d he whined. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>You are very welcome!</i> But enough of that\u2014 I know Smilotuks have no qualms on nudity, but show some <b>modesty</b> here, Atanik!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was then Bone realized he was entirely nude; in utter shamelessness he scratched his balls, bouncing them in front of all of you before sliding into his garments. You and Kilak blushed together, looking away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A notion appeared in Kilak\u2019s mind. \u201cNanuk Mishka, perhaps you could <i>accompany</i> the human\u2026 Your uncle and I need to <i>reminisce</i> on the past.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His spirit brother scowled at him, not keen on being away from his human. But before he could say anything he was interrupted. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou do not mine, do you?\u201d Mishka asked.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took you a second to realize his question was directed to you and not your giant. It was strange; the largest out of all giants in the tent, to the point where he almost touched the ceiling, treated you like an equal rather than a pet or servant. Bone obviously had reservations, but the decision wasn\u2019t his. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hesitated. \u201c<i>I uh-uhm\u2026</i>\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka look disheartened but was playing it up. He raised his palms to his face and was giving you puppy dog eyes; needless to say, he wanted to get to know you personally. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Not at all.</i>\u201d You relented. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka grinned from ear to ear. \u201cWonderful! Father, Uncle\u2014 We will see you at evening meal.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kilak and Mishka bowed to each other. You honored their tradition by also bowing. Bone signaled concern, but you gestured as if saying, <i>stop worrying, I\u2019ll be fine.</i> Mishka lifted the rawhide tent flap, you gulped. <i>I hope this is a good idea,</i> you thought. </span></span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kilak gripped onto Bone\u2019s dick and yanked it through a leg opening. He put no pressure on his friend\u2019s injury but held him down on the floor with his weight, the tiger desperately tried kicking him away. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>KILAK</b>\u201d he panted. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>I know you have always felt the same, Atanik.

Kilak rubbed his own milk-soaked member, lubing his hand with pre-cum. Then fingers found themselves underneath the tiger\u2019s balls as the bear reached for his taint. His hand slid in the crack, he massaged the opening as he prepared entry. His other hand, still tightly clasped on Bone\u2019s shaft, began to rub the foreskin up and down. He rubbed around the ring of the anus a few more times. Properly lubed, he poked his fingers in with what could be called a <i>rough gentleness.</i> <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i><b>HURRRRMPHHH~</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone felt the immense wetness of fingers rubbing his prostate; his eye\u2019s fluttered, recalling a similar feeling Gilron gave him. Pup had never fully penetrated him there but tempted it much the same way his father could. Kilak rubbed the back of the shaft head in the sensitive spot; he eased his way deeper into Bone\u2019s ass until he hit just the riiiiiight spot. The tiger moaned, his tongue hanged out as his eyes went vacant. He thrusted into the air a few times, forcing his dick to rub harder against the bear\u2019s hand. The way the bear could hit both his spots hypnotized him.

He pushed himself harder onto Kilak\u2019s arm, making it go deeper. The white giant unstrapped the loincloth off the tiger, then ripped off his own. He resumed pumping the tiger\u2019s dick with more vigor. Bone\u2019s member peaked over his groin like a monument overlooking a hill. The bear licked his black lips before slurping on the head. He tickled it, trying to ease into the act, but became tired of foreplay and shoved it all the way to the back of his throat. The tiger felt his baby maker be pushed to the upper pallet of the maw by its suction, only to be released and sucked on again in repetition. The white giant demanded his throat be impregnated with the seed lurking inside. Bone was in heaven. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kilak\u2019s own build-a-bear, the one that <i>made Mishka</i>, leaked precum like a faucet, just waiting to be tugged. The ice giant withdrew his furry hand out of Bone\u2019s anus; Bone cringed at the pain as it was pulled but eased once his massaged prostate relaxed again. The tiger felt himself being rested on the bear\u2019s thighs, but the sucking hadn\u2019t stopped; he peeked curiously. The reach of the bear was jaw dropping for someone as big as him. His neck bent painfully low as he continued slurping on Bone\u2019s dick, not once releasing it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i><b>KI-KI-KILAAAAAAK~ AAAAAHM GETTIN\u2019 CLOOOOSE</b></i>! \t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Those words signaled Kilak to rub his own shaft rapidly as he licked the frenulum of the tiger\u2019s member. He brought Bone closer to his legs, taking it as an opportunity to stick his dick into him. Bone whimpered, yipping and growling from the feeling of the bear\u2019s rod kissing his rectum. He squeezed his sphincter around the hot white member, <i>inviting it</i>, <b>craving it</b>. Spirits, he hated these beasts, but this was one hell of a <b>hate fuck</b> to stop now. The tiger gripped onto the fur of Kilak\u2019s massive head as he sucked him off, then thrusted into the bear\u2019s throat as rough as he could. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i><b>AHHHH\u2014 AHHHHHHHH\u2014 AOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!</b></i>\u201d Bone roared. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His toes stretched out, he gritted his fangs, and his tail twitched in delight. His dick was numb, but he felt it move on its own command as it shot one, two, three, four loads into the white beast\u2019s maw. Kilak coughed, the milk of Bone\u2019s balls spilling from his mouth. He convulsed much the same way the tiger did, his member dumping its own seed into Bone\u2019s tight ass, cum streaming down his snow furred rod. He savored as much of Bone\u2019s salty semen as he could but wasn\u2019t satisfied with the amount the tiger had given him. He frowned as he felt it shrink in his mouth; he sucked it again, like a giant stuck in the desert sucking desperately on a waterskin. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>AHHRRG\u2014 FOKER!</b>\u201d Bone shouted, his rod still hypersensitive. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He pulled himself out of Kilak\u2019s mouth, his shaft had been licked clean. His nethers tingled in the after glow as he huffed resignedly. The bear lifted his friend up, his dick slipping out with an audible <i>pop</i> as his balls plapped back down onto his thighs. Bone winced, but the feeling afterwards was pleasing. The tiger couldn\u2019t stand, and the bear could barely stand. Kilak had dropped them both onto the furs and off the freezing rough wood. Kilak laid his head on the smaller giant's chest, rubbing around his nipple with a claw. Bone laid with his arms behind his head and his legs spread eagle, the smell of his musk emanating from his moist groin. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAye\u2026 Ah <i>needed that</i>\u2026\u201d he said. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReady for the <i>rematch?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone perked up in shock. \u201cWha- <b>Already?!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kilak grinned as he slid under the covers of the furs. His lumped form could be seen travelling back down to the tiger\u2019s crotch. Bone\u2019s ears folded back in pleasure even though he was too numb to feel anything at that point. Slowly though, the tingle subsided. As he listened to the slurping and shlucking of the bears lips on his red cockhead, his dick unfolded itself out of it's sheathe. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He sighed. \u201c<i>Roun\u2019 two eht is then.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens next?</b></font></span></span></span></div></div>",

Sure, he assured you that you were an equal, but the concept was so...<i>foreign</i>. He glided gracefully over the fresh fallen snow as he made his way around the igloos and tents that made up the Marimiut tribe. He passed others of his kind, who bowed out of his way and eyed you with fascination or hostility. He reached a tent larger than all the others which you assumed was yours and slid inside. You let out a breath you didn't know you had been holding and took in another sharp one when Mishka spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So this ability of yours....it's induced by stress?

He drew a knife from somewhere and filleted the fish with insane swiftness and precision, slicing off thin strips of raw flesh and setting them between the two of you. He tossed the rest of the fish onto the smoldering embers where the fish's oils oozed and sizzled. He gestured to the raw slices and you hesitantly came forward and tore a scrap away from one, eating it in a cautious manner. Eating raw food was not a new concept for you, but you always had preferred the opportunity to eat cooked meat, but you didn't want to be rude and ignore the appetizer while you waited on the main dish to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I assume so...although now that I think of it...I did control Bone, at least his limbs while he focused on breathing when we came here.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah so you can control it, I must say you are wasted with the Smilotuk, your value will never truly show among their dull ranks.\" Marimut said popping a slice of fish in his mouth, his ice eyes not leaving you for a moment. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'm unsure, Thorn seemed to know I could, but I still have my doubts.\"<br>\r\nYou say honestly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then let's absolve you of that.\" He states. \"Merge with me, <i>Pup</i>.\"<br>\r\nMishka says leaning forward.

No I won't merge with you an I ask that you respect that.\" <br>\r\nYou state it firmly but politely.

You squirm in the grasp as Mishka lowers you. You knew what he was doing, but the terror of actually being eaten again welled inside you, damning your prey drive to madness. You screamed and kicked, only for Mishka to lower you quicker. You shut your eyes hard to avert the terror you feel, and when you open them...you aren't sure if you feel better or even worse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>MY MY, WELCOME TO THE MIND OF MISHKA PUP</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Time is frozen. From your eyes you see your own self, dangling limply from the clawed fingers of an arm that led to your body. You weren't being lowered anymore, rather left dangling, suspended by the conflict of interest within the brain of the Marimiut.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Let's see how strong you are truly.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a sudden start, the arm spasmed and began to lower your dangling body again towards the open jaws that you couldn't close.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>NO</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The muscles swelled and relaxed, two wills sending commands to the arm as it jerked back and forth, sending your body dancing in a very stomach churning fashion. Mishka's voice laughed in merriment, obviously pleased with the results and picking up intensity, but you were getting to your limit. He knew his own body better than you, and he was going to eat you. You had to think fast. And you did. You stop sending signals to the arm holding you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Is that all Pup, I must say that's rather-</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His mental gloating was cut off as you commanded the other arm that rested on his knee to punch him square in the jaw. Effectively ending the charade as your body flew into a pile of furs. Your mind followed and you came to shortly after your landing,  gasping in air as you sit up to look at the stunned Marimiut. He blinks his eyes and dabs his lip to see his own blood. He stayed in that position for a second before laughing quite merrily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I sup-pose I d-deserved that\" He said between chuckles and wipes a tear from his eye before focusing on you again with a warm smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I apologize for the rude and uncanny test, I had no real intention to eat you, but if I didn't <i>try</i> there would be no way I'd ever get the result I seeked.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't forgive you sadly Mishka, I did not enjoy the ordeal.\" You say lifting your chin, taking in shaky breaths.

He almost whispers the next sentence, a note of jealousy in it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You love him don't you Pup?\" You go bright red as he states this.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha...NO I mean....\" you take a deep breath. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Marimiut bowed his head in surrender, and without another word he pulled the fish from the embers. The two of you ate in silence and finished. After awhile he slowly began to discuss things like the weather and history of his clan. You gave him the stink eye but after a while you dropped the act and began to have genuine conversations with him. He explained as well that when a chief becomes to old, he simply steps down, and that the strongest and smartest Marimiut fills the role until he becomes too old. You find this system to be way more functional than the Smilotuk's, where they lead until one of their own kills them. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After awhile the dinner drum beats through the camp with a resounding boom, and the Bear picks you up and carries you out to an open area that had many fires that roasted many feral game. As you are taken to a fire, Mishka places you on his shoulder and converses with his people on many matters. You soon grow tired of listening and soon spot Bone and Kilak approaching. Bone limped, but it wasn't necessarily from his leg wound it seemed. They took their seats near Mishka, Bone yelping a little as his large rear hit the frozen dirt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Atanik, glad to see you walking so well after such a long recovery.\" Mishka said smiling at him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aye\" Is the only response he got from the large Smilotuk as Bone stared at you longingly. Mishka caught this and slipped a hand up to transfer you back to Bone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pup here is quite the fiery spirit Atanik, your lucky to have him by your side.\" Mishka said in a voice that was slightly contemptuous.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That 'e is, I ain't never met one quite like 'em.\" Bone said reaching out a hand and taking you back, bringing you in close where you could hug his large chest, Kilak spat nearby at the sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fire's burned high into the night sky where the northern lights, the bridges to the Far Lands, danced with the smoke. Bone didn't speak much to you as he conversed with the Marimiut, but an occasional thumb stroked you, letting you know that you weren't forgotten....  </span></span></div></div>",

Elk is now called \"Wapiti\"</b>.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't long after the event with Mishka that Bone was wanting to be off. You were actually interacting with the Marimiut as if you were an equal, though whether the interaction was positive or negative boiled down to the age of the tribe member. Older one's around Kilak's age were prone to aggression, and seemed to want to eat you and be done with it. Younger Marimiut actually held conversations with you and asked about your abilities and your thoughts on everything. Either way this much exposure was a little jarring for you, seeing as how less than a week ago Gliron was the only person in your life that you talked to. Your days were mostly spent in the hut with Bone, using your size to deftly clean his wounds where Kilak missed and generally snuggling up to the Big Cat to keep warm. He had gone from his usual nonchalant and abrasive personality to one that was akin to a selfish lover when you were alone with him. Kilak wasn't really welcome in the hut when you were not with Mishka, and when you asked Bone why he'd turn red and tell you to not worry about it. Today was like the past two, slow with nothing but Bones fever and frustration to heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This ain' right, Aye need'a be off and home, not here with that big snowball eye fuckin' me\" Bone said propped up on an elbow while you cleaned his thigh wound. It had healed fantastically , and besides the occasional muscle spasm, Bone's leg was no doubt going to fully recover. You worked under the shadow of his clothed bulge, his cloth smelling of some scented grass the bears used to clean their cloth and bodies. Bone had stated several times that he needed to coat the thing in some Amaruq or Wapiti blood soon, he hated it being spotless, it made it 'virgin'.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're almost healed, walking and fighting now could reverse all of what Kilak and the Marimiut have done for you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck em'\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm getting the idea that you already did.\" You say, and watch the bulge near you twitch slightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"THAT AIN\"T NONAYA BUSINESS PUP.\" Bone said sitting up more and jabbing a claw at you, resting it an inch from your sternum. You didn't flinch however and Bone noticed that. he put his ears back and narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were about to reply but a sound gave you pause. A Wapiti bugle rang out on the afternoon air, echoing off the trees and plains around the camp. A moment later the sound of Marimiut's crashing around outside could be heard and Kilak came stumbling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bone...the Wapiti have gathered, we may need you...\" He said looking at you and nodding without scowling or saying something demeaning. This must be serious then. The Marimiut didn't let Bone answer as he tossed him a spear and departed the tent. You look at Bone in fear, and he just smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The fights ne'er over Lad.\" He said picking you up and setting you to the side as he stood up, using the spear as a walking stick to keep it off his bad leg.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bone, can I try a bond with you? If this becomes an altercation I want to remain in contact.\" You say pleadingly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone pauses and scratches the back of his head in an awkward fashion, you and him had discussed what you knew about bonds, but Bone was not a fan of sharing his headspace with you. You told him you aren't privy to anything he doesn't share. You had been wanting to practice them, but Mishka said you need time between him and you before being able to establish one due to the animosity you still hold against him, and Thorn was probably just reaching the Smilotuk camp by now so he wouldn't be back to explain them. That left Bone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Errr...sure laddie...\" He said plucking you up and opening his mouth slightly. \"So...do I eat ya or...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just put me on your tongue and lets go from there.\" You say confidently, but really you had no clue what you were doing, you were grasping at straws.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone opened his mouth and placed you on his tongue, you tried to ignore the black abyss at the back of his throat and closed your eyes as he closed his mouth, sealing you in darkness. You took in a deep breath of the stale rancid air and reached out with your conscious, or so you thought you were. A minute passes of nothing but wet squelching of Bones tongue fidgeting beneath you and the distant pulsing of his great heart.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sooo are ya in myy mindth yeth..\" Bone said sending you sliding around between his jagged teeth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! Quit talking I can't-\" The muffled sound of a tent flap could be heard followed by a familiar voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uncle Atanik? We need you outside the village! There's at least two dozen Wapiti gathered outside and maybe three dozen more in the trees. They've elected an official to communicate what they want, but I need all men to gather with me to show some solidarity and that we aren't afraid.\" Mishka's voice said. The Wapiti are threatening the Marimiut? This isn't good. Bone's tongue juggled you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are ye truly scared o' a bunch of bark munchers?\"  He managed by pushing you into a cheek. Even from in his mouth you could feel the cold gaze Mishka had fixed on Bone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hardly, but a fight with them would be quite the setback, especially with the Berserk Marimiut's coming back into the region. Get out here....and get Pup out of your mouth...\" He said before the sound of a tent flap closing resounded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were spat out into an awaiting palm and Bone shrugged at you before walking out after Mishka. He set you on his shoulder and walked out onto the ice field where dark figures with large antlers awaited, clubs and arrow tips made from their shedded antlers from winters past. One stood beyond them, he wore no clothes except for a leather strap that held a stone knife to his hip, his more personal bits exposed and being ruffled by the wind. His antlers were half his body length and had what looked like wolf teeth tied to string hanging from the points.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That lad knows how ta walk about\" Bone observed appreciatively, you just looked at him questioningly as he sauntered up next to Kilak and Mishka.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Bull Wapiti looked at Bone and narrowed his eyes before stepping forward until he was about 10 feet from Mishka. The Bull was shorter than Bone and the Marimiut, but his antlers made him taller in general. He spoke with a strange musical tone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Greetings Ice Brothers, I am the Great Famorn, of the Uttering Bark herd, the Conglomeration has elected me to state our purpose for the intrusion, though you most definitely have an idea what we want.\" He said letting his gaze focus on Bone again. Mishka spoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hail speaker of the Trees, yes I assume you want to take Bone Snapper of the Smilotuks for payment of blood. I am sorry to say we swore the oath of protection, and can not and will not relinquish this oath until he is safely back with his clan.\" Mishka said, his voice calm but strong in its message.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I implore you, no one will look on the act of relinquishment as dishonorable, he wiped out nearly all the males in the Dark Wood herd, and Alpha Regish wants to make his bones into trophies.\" Famorn said withouot breaking his gaze on Bone, who snorted in response.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If this Regish wan's a fight, I'll give em' one, where is he?\" Bone said eyeing the bulls beyond Famorn, then shifted his gaze to the tree line. Famorn spat in his direction which made Bone swivel back and growl as the Bull spoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He is occupied with....replinishing his sons. But the matter is more than simple blood for blood, you negotiated with the Amaruq and we perceive that as the possibility of an alliance, which is hostility towards the Wapiti. If the Smilotuk end their fights with the Amaruq, and instead ally with one another, you are now our enemy, if the Marimiut want to protect you, then they are as well.\" The Alpha Bull stated looking back at Mishka, who took the lull to speak again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can the Wapiti really afford a war with three clans?\" Mishka asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Famorn smiled again. \"We have allies too. Either way, turn over the Smilotuk, or both Marimiut AND Smilotuk can expect the woods to no longer be their friend in their hunts. You have until the Sky's eye reaches the earth's horizon.\" Famorn said turning and walking away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone gulped, it being audible with you on his shoulder, and you didn't blame him. His life is now putting hundreds of others at risk. He turned to look over at Mishka, who was still staring after the Bull.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Err, Nanuk Mishka?\" Bone posed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No Uncle, we are not letting you walk out to them. When the sun sets, we're getting you back home, and then we go to war.\" Mishka said without turning around. \"Kilak, send a runner to inform the Amaruq that we and the Smilotuk are about to be attacked by the Wapiti, and they may have an opportunity to hit them from behind when we do engage them.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mishka turned and locked eyes with you, his gaze softening and giving you a smile before walking back into camp. Bone sighed and shuffled his feet, obviously pissed that he was being viewed as something that need to be protected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Welcome to the club...</i> you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What club?</i> Bones voice rang in your head and you blinked in surprise...</span></span></div></div>",

Bone limped after Kilak and another Marimut named Happai as they traversed an ice tunnel the bears had dug underneath one of their tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This ain' the way I do things, Kilak. Lemme kill some Wapiti with you.\" Bone said, you still sitting on his shoulder. \"I needa restain mah cloth anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mishka has spoken, you aren't worth much in a fight with the state you are in. Besides we need to establish the alliance with the Smilotuk, and you dead won't help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thorn was doin' that anywho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No...Thorn was establishing your alliance with the Amaruq, you're in charge of <i>our</i> alliance.\" Kilak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The group went another few feet before Happai kicked out a thin sheet of ice and revealed a glacial stream, shallow as it flowed underneath the ice sheet and most likely into the river that they would follow home. Happai leaped down and continued and Kilak followed, Bone leaped down but his leg buckled, still not strong enough for physical activity. Kilak balanced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Careful Atanik, take it slow.\" The bear said as Bone shouldered him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don' think you can get all handsy jus' cuz ye took advantage of me.\" Bone said scoffing and hobbling onward. You rose an eyebrow and looked at Bone but he didn't return the gaze. Kilak however did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bone here is just used to being top human, I'm pretty sure that's what it is.\" He said, smiling at the scowl Bone turned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Light came through an opening up ahead and the Ice cave opened up on a rocky beach next to quite the violent river. Bone's tribe called it the Land Tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Half a night's travel and we should be home for breakfast.\" Bone said longingly. You were looking forward to home as well, maybe you'd be able to see your father again if Bone permitted it. A nearby Elk bugle rang out of the river from the forest on the other side and everyone froze. After a moment Kilak spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We have to move fast, the farther we get, the less likely we will have to fight.\"Kilak said handing Bone a spear, inferring it more to be a walking stick rather than a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wind was strong on the bank and threatened to blow you off Bone's shoulder, their breechcloths danced wildly, being held only the leather belt they looped over. The cloth runs over it, before covering the crotch and running into the ass, then back over the leather belt again so it can hang out the back, it was the only form of modesty that these titans deigned to possess. Kilaks own cloth covered package was left for you to stare at as the wind whipped his cloth horizontally, Happai was already walking ahead and was giving everyone a full view of his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ye strugglin' lad?\" Bone asked. You hadn't said anything, but you had still managed to establish a weak bond with the Smilotuk. He wasn't getting many thoughts, but he could sense distress and emotion of you, though you doubted he realized that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll be fine, just focus on your steps. I'll let you know if...I need to go downstairs.\" You say as Bone chuckled and began trekking home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wind died down some as the party made it around the bend in a river...and right into view of a Wapiti outpost that was on the other side of the river. There was no doubt that they were there for the sole purpose of monitoring the banks for them fleeing. Kilak noticed them first and only had a split second to lean back a bit as an arrow trimmed some fur off his neck. A bugle rang out, and a second later another one picked up the call as the forest came alive with hundreds of Bugles. A call of War.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone yelped as Happai sweeped him up like a damsel in distress and began running after Kilak through a rain of arrows. You slipped from Bone, yelping as you did only to latch on to the Marimut's leather belt on his hip. You struggled and partially wedged yourself into the belt as Kilak let out a growl as his ear was nicked by a passing arrow. The Land Tear widened as they ran, and arrows were finding it harder to reach their quarry with the distance and wind. Eventually the Wapiti gave up for now, a single mournful call ringing out across the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was too easy...\"Kilak noted as Happai put Bone back down, who stared at the Marimut with utter distaste. Bone reached down an plucked you from Happai's hip, who blinked in surprise, not realizing you were there.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone placed you on his shoulder and the Smilotuk continued forward, taking the lead despite Kilaks protests. A few hours passed in silence and soon enough Bone drifted from the river and crested a hill, looking down on the rounded camp that sat in the middle of a snow field, home. Bone took in a breath of relief, as did you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is where we leave you Ata-...Bone Snapper. Our people need us, and yours need you. We will see each other again soon.\" Kilak said, and Bone nodded, clasping hands with the Marimut and pulling <i>him</i> in for a long kiss. Happai and you turn away, both embarrassed by the action. They broke it off and Bone snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Next time...I'm gettin' top.\" The Smilotuk announced and turned, walking down the hill and onto the plains...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The camp was another few minutes walk, you had never seen it from such a distance so the scale of it tricked you into thinking it was closer. The wind was picking up and whipping Bone's breechcloth around his waist as he walked into the gale. It was due to this wind that he didn't hear the heavy footsteps until they were right up on him. Bone whipped around to find a pale grey Wapiti charging him with sharp antlers angled at his chest. Bone took a stance, dropping his spear and braced to receive the charge, grasping the horns of the Large Bull and sliding through the snow a few feet before coming to a halt. They stayed like that for a second, Bone wincing from his leg, The Wapiti huffing with bloodshot eyes staring up past his antlers at Bone. You hung onto Bone with renewed fear, which seemed to seep through your bond as it flickered across Bones face. He maintained composure however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye must be that Alpha Ragish lad.\" Bone inquired. \"In mah defense, yer boys attacked <i>us</i>.\" In response the Bull threw his head to the side, making it where Bone would brace on his bad leg.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone couldn't support the weight and was sent tumbling through the snow, grunting in pain as you fell off into the snow as well. You sat up, shaking flakes from your head as the Bull stomped past you, his foot crashing inches from you, his gaze set on Bone. Your Smilotuk stood up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ye know...this would be over already if it weren't for mah leg.\" Boomer said, his ears flattening and him drawing back his lips to expose his fangs. Ragish charged him again, but Bone dove forward and went under the horns, flipping the Bull by coming up into his stomach. As the Bull fell, Bone dove on top of him, raking the Wapiti with punches and claws. For something so intimidating, Ragish wasn't much once Bone got past the antlers. That was until Bone lunged for the neck, only for the Wapiti to lash his head forward. One of his antlers punched into Bones right eye and the Smilotuk tumbled back grasping at his face, blood leaking between the finger tips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone made a sound that made your skin crawl as he obviously had just lost his sight in that eye. Ragish rolled the Cat off of him and followed, ending up being on top as he took his time delivering heavy blows to the half blind Smilotuk. Despite the injury, Bone began delivering blows himself back at the Wapiti. The slug fest was a battle of Stamina, and Bone was going to lose. Ragish threw a punch across Bone's face, knocking the Cat out as you sensed it over your weak link with him. The Bull huffed, drawing an antler knife from his waist and drawing it back to punch it into the Smilotuks chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You closed your eyes and focused your hatred on the Wapiti, your hate synchronizing with the Bull's own, and when you opened your eyes you were looking down at a beaten Bone. The arms froze as you sent messages to them, and a voice quickly rang through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Human, let me have this and I won't turn you into a stain in the snow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A powerful pressure surrounded you, this guy was like Thorn! You struggled to maintain the hold of the arms, but they slowly crept closer to the Smilotuk's heaving chest. You looked elsewhere, like you had with Mishka, but the consciousness of the Bull was split, he was able to prevent you from taking over other parts of his body. So instead you invested everything,<i> everything</i> you had into the arms. They bent slightly, now angling towards Ragish. A ethereal chuckle rang out as the Bull played with you, despite you feeling your own being burning up to maintain control. Mental anguish washed over you, a pain that wasn't physical, but hurt all the same. You thought you were about to fade when in the corner of the Wapiti's eyes a hand shot up from Bone and slammed the hilt of the knife into Ragish's chest. The Bull choked, and his mind exploded into a world of memories and regrets, threatening to absorb you into them. Somewhere Bone's voice reached you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pup....PUP....Get outta of 'is head Pup! C'mon Lad!\" You followed the voice down a dark tunnel, and when you emerged you were staring at the face of Bone from the palm of his hand, blood trickled from his clenched right eye.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone made a very strange noise as he let a sob loose. He turned his gaze to the dying Ragish, and both of you watched as he drowned on is own blood. Bone hobbled to his feet, and limped towards camp...</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Immediately he felt something was off, and from him, you picked up on it as well. You would\u2019ve asked what the problem was, but at this point, you were so fed up with the constant conflict that you didn\u2019t want to anymore. A snowflake landed on your redded nose, they floated downward from the clouds of midnight, the sky illuminated in a hazy purple by moonlight. Banks of snow muffled the surrounding forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s always shit getting thrown at us from somewhere, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone smiled then nodded. Still, whatever was wrong, rushing into it would be a bad idea. Bone couldn\u2019t afford to waste energy in his injured state. The rapidly decreasing temperature of tundra at nightfall meant you would lose warmth quickly, so standing idle wasn\u2019t ideal either. The burning of frost was apparent as he clutched his freshly opened eye socket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...Bone,\u201d you peered up at him, clasping his burly thumb, \u201cbetter to go in safe than sorry.

You tasted disgusting, but the way you trusted him as you squirmed in his mouth, and feeling your texture on his tongue\u2026 It just itched a new kind of pleasure for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe we can make it stronger! You might have to swallow me, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eyes popped slightly, his tail twitched, he gulped nervously as he rubbed at his throat; a tent threatened to form in his loins. <i>He trusts meh to swallow? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY\u2019know mah stomach tends to <i>hurt</i> wha\u2019 goes into it?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You rolled your eyes. \u201cI know, just don\u2019t take too long to throw me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...Yar <i>okay</i> with thah?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d you said, \u201cI tried something similar with Thorn\u2014\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTHAS RIGHT, AH \u2018MEMBER NOW.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You bit your tongue. \u201cB-But it worked! I was able to see what he saw! I was able to do it with Mishka too without being swallowed!\u201d You paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone\u2019s face screamed as if it said: <i>REALLY? AGAIN? </i> He withheld his growl. He felt a tad betrayed, though he did understand where you were coming from. Taking a deep breath, he rubbed his chin. \u201cThah does soond like ah good wey to keep ye safe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You jumped eagerly. \u201cExactly!

C\u2019mon, I can help!\u201d You begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He shook his head. \u201cThar ain\u2019t noe reason to put ye in mor\u2019 danger like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFine! Let\u2019s try your balls then!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He nonchalantly crossed his legs, praying you didn\u2019t notice. But the thought made him crave for it, he wondered what squeezing you in would be like. He\u2019d only wrapped you in his sheathe once, and he could barely contain himself then. One thing was for sure, you sure as hell weren\u2019t going down in clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he shook his head. \u201cNeigh! Ye cood still suffocate in thar, ar geht stuck! Ah\u2019ve noe reason to risk thah!\u201d Truth be told, that wasn\u2019t the real issue. This was a matter of pride, how could he protect you if he couldn\u2019t protect himself? He needed to uphold his dignity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe <i>not you, but I do!</i> I can\u2019t let you keep risking your life like this!\u201d you shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hearty chuckle escaped him. His eye stung even more, he lodged snow into the socket to ease the itching. You cringed at the sight, hissing sympathetically. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He spoke. \u201cSince wehn do ah need yar permission t\u2019die in battle? Worry \u2018bout yerself, lad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were redder than a tomato, blood boiling. \u201cFOR FUCK SAKES! BONE, JUST THIS ONCE, TAKE ME SERIOUS!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This took him by surprise. You were tired of the stubborn tiger pushing you to the sidelines. You have a chance to prove your worth, and he still refuses to make it easy for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you dead! Damn, you are <b>DENSE</b>, but you should know by now that I care about you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His lips curled ever so slightly. \u201cPup\u2026 ahm glad\u2026 But, ye doent need\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not taking \u2018no\u2019 for an answer!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His good eye softened, glistening from tears he restrained, the salt burning in his other. He closed them, not able to look his human in the face. \u201cAh stole ye from yer pops, threatened to eatcha\u2019, an\u2019 putcha\u2019 in danger mor\u2019 than ah can count\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You punched into his palm, not breaking your gaze. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, and I\u2019m not asking anymore! I\u2019m not gonna risk my best friend ever again!\u201d Bone and Thorn had been the ONLY friends you\u2019ve had besides your father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He looked so defeated, his posture slumped. \u201c...Then, <i>as me friend</i>\u2026 ye know tha greatest honour ah Smilotuk can ask fah is to die in bat\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFUCK HONOUR! IT\u2019S YOU THAT MATTERS, NOT THAT, DUMBASS!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt his palms shake, his ears flopped back from his sagging face. He snorted as his breath quivered, <i>damn salt...</i> He was barely keeping himself together, tears threatening to overflow. You wondered if you had taken things too far. Then his forehead fell into you, rubbing against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He whimpered. \u201c<i>Yer the dumbass, Pup\u2026 Ye doent understand wha\u2019 loss is\u2026</i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He nudged harder, your knees searched for balance under the weight, your wingspan not even reaching close to the width of his forehead. The gesture was not lost on you. Affection, trust, and claiming one\u2019s territory. You closed your eyes as you leaned into the embrace, breathing in his musk as you stroked his fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>I\u2019m protecting you for now on, that\u2019s a promise.</i>\u201d You whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liquid trailed down his face. \u201c<i>Thank ye\u2026 Thank ye so much, Pup.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>To be continued...</b></span></div></div>",

You caught a glimpse of Bone spewing blood, his tusk shattered in pieces. The snow quietly cushioned your fall.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBONE!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Disoriented, you climbed out and raced towards Bone, not even thinking about the current threat, only worried about your hurt friend. Fragments of stone lie buried in the white, from a Smilotuk slingshot no doubt. Fire shot up your spine that ached at your fingertips; you frantically scanned behind yourself and met the gaze of glowing ice-blue eyes. Burning with hatred, they were affixed on Bone\u2019s collapsed form. You jumped as they flicked to you, the cold bitingly painful. But as their sharp pupils jabbed into you, they trembled. The brows lifted, the irises shifting from blue to yellow as the pupils rounded. A familiar elderly figure with silver fur unwrapped itself from the foliage. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Ma\u2019\u2026 son?</i> <i>Is it truly ye, m\u2019son?</i>\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gilron fell to his knees, dropping a \u2018Y\u2019 shaped tool, a hand quivered as it reached out to you, the other covering his slacked jaw. He dragged himself towards you, inspecting you. Exposing his palms in a welcome, his jagged teeth unveiled into a wide brim smile as his eyes swelled. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>\u2026Dad?

You felt the itch of all your sweat glands opening up at once; one image was vivid enough to make out. A sabre skull being crushed underfoot as pine tree needles melted and the earth beneath turned to coal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cM\u2019boy, what is\u2019tha matter?

That couldn\u2019t just be in your head, <i>right?</i> But your father didn\u2019t hear it; you\u2019ve never heard anything like that; all emotion had been abruptly sucked out of you. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Why did it call him a threat?</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You knew your father\u2019s love was real, so why did something feel so wrong? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He whimpered. \u201c<i>Jus\u2019 come to meh, please\u2026 Ah jus\u2019 nee\u2019ta hold someone again.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stood there squinting. You saw how frayed and matted his once brilliant fur had become; silver stained with dry blood. Gilron would never neglect himself like that, he always kept it pristine with the familiar sandpaper tongue that cleaned you every night. But even his tongue looked paler, he clearly dropped some weight as well. You wondered if your separation caused this. Either way, he was deteriorating. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWHEY DO YE HESITATE!?\u201d His roar rippled through your body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You flinched. \u201c<i>D-Dad\u2026</i> Are you alright?

The sudden realization of who threw the stone was clear. But earlier when he looked at you\u2026 <i>those eyes</i>. You rushed backed to the unconscious tiger\u2019s face. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDAD! WHY\u2019D YOU SHOOT BONE?! HE\u2019S ONE OF US!

He clenched his eyes and shook his head, knuckling himself in the temple. He denied the thought and hoped you weren\u2019t listening, but you just barely picked up on it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>\u2026What?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>To be continued... </b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</font></span></span></span></div></div>",

Everything becomes suddenly hot, and it\u2019s so unbearable you want to strip off all your clothes to stop the burning. You knew if you did this, you\u2019d be a goner.

Bone took the opportunity to plant both feet into Gilron this time, launching him into a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHRRMPH\u201d you gasped, feeling what your father felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You came to; Bone was limping as fast as he could with you in palm. Blood spilled in large drops, splattering on you as well; his lungs rattled with labored wheezes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Protect Pup!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Protect Pup! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Protect Pup!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone repeated the mantra in his head, all of which you could hear. You were admittedly confused, as you thought the link would\u2019ve broken off after he\u2019d been knocked out cold. He struggled to run in a straight path, his determination forcing him to run on his injured leg. A whipping in the air and zooming of a high-speed object startled you both, you saw the projectile crash into snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gilron\u2019s roar reverberated through the forest of snow sprinkled pine needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>BONE SNAPPAH!!!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You looked back and saw the blur that was your father running on all fours with a spear strapped to his back, a knife in his maw, and the slingshot in his hand as he sprinted. You lost track of him as he darted above, covered by greenery and the night sky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSHITE!!!\u201d Bone panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Not good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not good! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0NOT GOOD! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You heard his thoughts once more express. He couldn\u2019t maintain his pace; his leg would give out sooner or later. He slouched on his tread, just about ready to fall. Then he became lighter, as if someone piggybacked him from their shoulders. Bone watched himself run; the pain numbed now, soon enough he was at full speed as his muscles flared with vigor.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Stay with me big guy! I can\u2019t do this alone!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your voice had echoed in his head. He could finally catch his breath, a well needed break. The pain was still there, but it was bearable; he finally realized you were sharing his burden. A thought occurred to him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Whey\u2026 do ye smell an\u2019 taste like piss?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>GIVE MEH MA\u2019SON, TRAITOR!!!</b>\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gilron\u2019s voice encroached ever closer. Bone watched as you commanded his arm to plop your tiny form into his maw with reckless abandon; you felt a brilliantly warm tingle caress your body; a close save from being frozen. Bone made sure his tongue secured you and that he wouldn\u2019t swallow by accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You spoke to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Dad, I don\u2019t wanna kill you\u2026 Please\u2026 PLEASE still be in there!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bone\u2019s ears folded sympathetically. \u201c<i>Ah\u2026 Cannae believe a wee hooman savin\u2019 m\u2019life right now.</i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This helped you snap out of it for a moment.

You are dismissed Verdun.\" Your father said nodding at the fox, who took a deep bow before walking out of the throne room. You observe your adoptive father, complimenting him mentally, as he wore a form fitting purple military jacket with slate gray tights, emphasizing his large butt and package. The jacket was trimmed with gold that accentuated the crown he wore. His feet were adorned with polished black boots. No doubt he was the very picture of authority. You and your brothers wore a very similar outfit but instead of purple your jacket was a dark blue with silver accents instead of gold and the crown you wore was smaller and silver. Your father reclaimed his seat and the castle steward called the next citizen to step forward to address their grievance. You sigh and prop your head on you palm, bored out of your mind, a large digit tapped your head, knocking you forward a bit and causing your crown to fall in your lap. You look back with a scowl at your oldest brother Mot, who was looking down at you sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pay attention and learn a thing or two about ruling Hap, you may need it one day.\" The white bear said looking back up at the court hearing. Mot was roughly the size of your father, and was the crown prince, signified by the Amethyst inlaid in the head of his crown. His muscles swelled beneath his blue jacket and a prominent bulge was visible through his tights. You put your crown back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, you and Verdi plan on dying on me soon?\" You say looking back at him from your chair. Mot sighed, not looking back down at his kid brother, and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best to be prepared for anything, now be quiet and listen or father will hear about your failure to listen to the people.\" You snapped back forward, fathers anger could be vicious, you'd only been the victim of it twice, and it never ended well. The hearings went on, finally coming to an end halfway into the afternoon. When the last commoner walked out of the throne room and the doors shut behind her, Verdi jumped up and stretched, letting out a sigh before clasping his hands together and turning towards his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that was truly a long court, shall we adjourn for some dinner?\" Verdi said with a smirk he never took off his face. He was 20, as Mot was 23, and your father being a respectable 48. Verdi had the same build as his brother and father, and had the same great ass and bulge as well. You truly felt like an ant among these gods. King Styrke sighed and turned in his chair to face You and Mot, his eyes saying everything. Mot sighed, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very well, lets get some dinner and review all the cases that have transpired today.\" Mot said standing up, casting you in his shadow. Your father seemed pleased by the answer and turned to the Steward Caine, a thin jackal that had been in this castle as long as Styrke has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lord Caine would you see that dinner finds its way into the dining room shortly? Me and my sons shall be in the dueling room, please inform us when it is served.\" You sat up as Caine left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are we to witness Mot and Verdi's swordsmanship in a bout father?\" You say excitedly, you always enjoyed watching your brothers spar, wishing you could join them. Your father nodded at you with a smile, standing up and making his way out of the room, Verdi followed close behind. Mot offered you his palm, and you climbed on and were whisked out of the room. You looked up at your brother, who was obviously distracted in thought, probably processing all the interactions that had occurred that day, you thought it best not to ask him pointless questions. After a short walk you found yourself in a large room that had plush chairs lining its walls with a few tables between them. The middle of the room was bare of furniture, and one corner had an assortment of practice weapons. Verdi was standing near them, stripping off his jacket and crown, leaving his torso bare to the stone room. His white fur was bright against the dull grey stone, and his muscles underneath looked as if they were made by the very stones of the keep. His tights did little to hide the outline of his large sheath and balls beneath the cotton and silk fabric. His white stubby tail stuck out above his globular covered cheeks as he drew a wooden longsword from a rack. Your father appeared next to Mot with his palm outstretched, without a word you were transferred into your dad's rough palm as he walked over and took a seat in one of the chairs, he placed you on his thigh and you tried to ignore the large bulge he had between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mot, why don't you show me how well your spearmanship has become.\" Your dad says with a lazy smile. Mot nodded, stripping to mirror Verdi before grabbing a wooden spear from the rack. Your brothers took their respective positions on opposite ends of the room, they turned and faced each other, waiting your fathers signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Begin!\" Your dad commands. Verdi approached Mot cautiously, obviously at a disadvantage due to Mot's reach. Verdi took a feint before coming in with a swing from the other direction. Mot smacked the blade away and with the same motion brought the butt of the spear up between Verdi's legs, pegging him right in his nethers. Verdi gasped and dropped to his knees, cupping himself, only to look up and find Mot's spearhead an inch from his eye. Your father chuckled slightly and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Verdi, when faced with a spear, you want to get inside his reach as quick as possible but also not overextend yourself, fail to do so and you'll end up where you are now. Again!\" Your father shouted. This went on for another 30 minutes, the results being similar almost every time, which was frustrating your father slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Verdi, take Hap and observe me.\" Your father said standing up and setting you in the imprint his ass left in the seat. You look up at the tower that was your father as he tossed down the kingdom crown in the seat next to yours as well as his coat. As he passed Verdi, he snatched the sword from his grip before taking up his position on the other end of the room. Verdi grumbled as he absently rubbed at his sore bulge, plucking you up with his free hand and setting you on his own thigh as he sat down. his other hand still rubbed at his bulge, obviously not caring his brother was inches from the action. Your father looked like he was chiseled from marble, his muscles well defined and his stomach a pure power gut, he took a stance and began his bout with his oldest son. Mot took a much more cautious approach now, fully aware his opponent was many times more skilled than he. They engaged each other with test swings and jabs, testing for a weakness in the others defense. Suddenly Styrke stepped in on Mot, ducking under a jab and thrusting his sword at Mot's face, Mot leaned back, bringing his spear around, smacking the sword down and bringing the shaft towards your fathers stomach. Styrke jumped back from the short swing before bringing his sword down on the back of Mot's knee, causing him to drop down on it. Styrke followed the movement up by spinning around and placing the swords wooden blade to his son's throat. Mot dropped his spear and smiled at his dad, accepting his defeat. Styrke lowered the sword before looking back at Verdi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's how it's done Son, I want you to spend tomorrow working on your form, take one of our kings guard to be your sparring partner.\" Verdi grumbled as he glanced down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How come Hap doesn't spar? He rather enjoys watching it, why not find him a teacher?\" Verdi says glancing up at your father. You followed his gaze to your father, never really considering actually asking that very question. Styrke took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hap is a strong boy, but the necessity to protect himself in this degree is a little pointless. Most of our dealings are with other Anthro's, and I hope I can protect him from this particular type of interaction involving them. Instead Hap is to be taught more diplomatic approaches, when he comes of age I hope to send him to other kingdoms to negotiate trade and treaties for the benefit of my reign as well as your's Mot. He will be a great value to the family.\" Your father says giving you a big smile. You blush due to it, but also can't feel a tinge of helplessness beneath it. Your father didn't view you as an equal to your brothers, he saw you as something he had to protect and shelter, and while you understood why, that didn't stop it from hurting. Caine suddenly entered the room, announcing dinner was now served. Servants came in and collected the clothes around the room as you were carried by Verdi in his palm as he followed you dad and Mot into the dining room. Everyone took their seats, and Verdi placed you at your personal table that sat on the table next to your dad's plate. Caine looked at his bare chested lords and told some servants to go draw some baths. You ate in silence, occasionally answering questions from your father as he quizzed you and your brothers on the issues addressed at court today and to explain why he handled each one how he did. When you finished dinner....</span></div></div>",

You sometimes missed the days you were among humans, as you now found yourself quite alone despite being among your family. You sigh lightly, trying to decide what you were going to do tomorrow, since there was no court hearings or classes planned. You could spend it with father, but he would probably be spending the day in his study writing letters and working on his maps. Mot seemed to distracted recently to babysit you, and Verdi seemed like he was to train all day, which was rightfully so as the second son was supposed to be the general of the kingdoms forces. You actually had an uncle but he was rarely at the castle, instead he was constantly going from fortress to citadel, examining defenses and the troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What troubles you Hap?\" You jump and look up to see your father looking down on you with a concerned expression.

You climb into his hand, leaving your brothers behind as they continued their argument. Your father walked to his chamber and found the bath that was in the floor had been filled with steaming water, the window above it was open and a light snow had begun, a rogue flake fluttering in before melting from the rising steam. Your father walked over and placed you at the lip of the tub before standing up and taking his boots off. You undressed as well but kept an eye on your dad as he began to slide off his tight pants. He wiggled his enormous ass and thighs out of the material, His flesh expanding more as it was no longer confined by the fabric. He stepped out of the pants and rubbed at his legs and ass, obviously enjoying the dull ache running through them. He turned and walked to the window, you watching his Goliath balls swing beneath his meaty sheath as he did so, and propped his hands on the window sill, enjoying the cold air on his white fur. His wide back rippled with muscle, and his stubbed tail sat above his gargantuan cheeks, each cheek the size of a human house. His thighs quivered with every shift he made. Suddenly he turned an eye back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you find me endearing son?\"He said turning his head all the way back at you, a look of amusement across his face. You turn beet red and sputter out a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-of course, but who wouldn't father? You aren't a king but a god among men to be sure. You make others halt when you are fully clothed and hypnotize them when you are nude.\" You say averting your gaze, truly embarrassed at being caught staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Son there's no reason to be shamed, it's quite alright. I've been aware of your glances and peeks for a couple years now. So I just figured we could get a little more personal tonight to show you I embrace your form of affection.\" He said this as he turned and walked over to you, towering over you by planting his feet on either side of you, leaving you under his swinging balls. His knees bent as he lowered himself, letting his feet slip off the lip of the tub up to his knees as he sat on the stone floor. a dull slap was heard as his rear and thighs settled on the stone and left you face to face with his balls and sheath, which was many times larger than you. You still had your pants on but your father could easily see your manhood twitching beneath the fabric. You stood there awkwardly, not sure what to do exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on son, worship this 'god' of yours.\". Your father said chuckling and looking down at you. You hesitated a moment before slowly walking up to your fathers musky balls, stretching out a shy hand and touching his right one before pulling your hand back. When nothing happened, no anger or punishment ensued, you returned the hand to the fuzzy flesh and began to slowly rub it. After a second you added your other hand and brought your body a little closer to the warm flesh. Your father grunted softly as your massage picked up in speed and strength, you glance up to see him making a strange face, he obviously didn't expect to actually be influenced by your touch. As you continued his hand began to squeeze and massage at his sheath, and eventually he coaxed out his member. It cast you in it's shadow as it continued to grow, a dark grey monument that had never graced your eyes before. You rubbed with more passion, throwing your chest into it and basically grinding yourself across your father's testicles. The gloves were off as your dad began to pump himself, grunting deeply at the pleasure he was feeling. You climbed up his balls clumsily and crawled to the folded skin that was his retreated sheath, you propped a foot on it before putting your whole upper body into the effort of pleasing your father. His other hand cupped his balls, pressing you more into his member as he reached climax. The muscle above you engorged more and began to pulsate as it shot it's seed all over Styrke's thighs and the floor. Your father let go of his dripping member and fell onto his back, panting heavily. You stayed where you were for a minute, still softly rubbing at the member. You look down and see you had released in your pants as well and weren't even aware of it until now. You two stayed like that until... </span></div></div>",

Chase was wearing a simple white dress shirt with a black tie, and a pair of Grey slacks that were a little tight on the dog.

Though humans and Anthros worlds were quite merged, when one slipped completely into the others world was when accidents occurred.

You release and land on your feet with a practiced grace, looking up at the Zebra leaned over you working on some reviews. His ears were faced back a bit signifying he was not having a pleasant time with his work. After a moment he tossed down the pen and stood up, you crouched down to avoid his arm as he stood up and walked to a filing cabinet and began going through it, giving a good opportunity to check out your manager. Joseph was a huge gym goer, and had a strong man build rather than a chiseled model. His Biceps bulged against the white dress shirt and his pectorals and muscle gut was easily outlined through it. His tan pants were tight on his lower body, wrapping around his huge ass giving him a slight wedgie at all times as well as squeezing his large thighs and calves. His tail lashed with visible frustration, and after failing at finding whatever file he needed he slammed the cabinet shut and stomped back over to his desk and plopped down in the chair again.

They narrowed fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"David? How the hell did you get in here? Why aren't you in your cubicle?\" He says dropping his arms, letting them crisscross in front of him on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I finished everything I had scheduled today, and I fell off Chase's desk and ended up on the floor on the Anthro side. You dropped your pen and I hitched a ride to get to safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Surprising a stressed Zebra is hardly a safe tactic kid.\" The Zebra said lazily. You stood there awkwardly, not sure what exactly to do next. Should you just ask to be taken back to your station, or-. \"Well you might as well stick around and help me out with these reviews, I'm not getting anywhere.\" He said picking up his pen again and setting to work. You blinked, Joseph never asked help of anyone, him doing so now rather than reprimanding you tells you volumes that you were, in fact, his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...you don't wanna get Scott to help you with this? I mean I don't mind but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"David, shut up and help me with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You walk over and follow with him over numbers and statements, looking for any anomalies that your co-workers may have missed. Awkward small talk was all that accompanied you and Joseph as you worked, but as the day went on and the sun had sunk to the horizon out the window, you and him had begun cracking jokes and talking about things more freely. You offered to stay late and help him further, and as the last person walked by and out of the office for the day, you still found yourself actually enjoying Josephs company. He caught you off guard however when suddenly he undid his tie and unbuttoned his shirt, exposing a v-neck undershirt. His Pectorals swelled underneath it as if taking a gasp of air on their own, being partially freed from their confines. You couldn't help but admire their size, and letting your eyes linger on the nipples poking through the shirt as well. Joseph stretched and massaged his chest before slowly rubbing his gut, letting out a content sigh before looking down at you and realizing what he actually just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, err sorry David, work shirts never fit me well and it's one of my simple pleasures to remove them at the end of a day and enjoy the freedom of it. I can put it back on if you want me too if you're uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, it's fine, it's just you have a really great body Joseph, like I'm fighting the urge to touch you right now, haha.\" You said the last part as a partial joke but Joseph seemed to take it a little serious however. He bounced his pecs and gave you a warm smile while raising his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah I see I have an admirer then, would you like too?\" He said in a seductive voice. You look away, embarrassed and not sure what to say. You'd never had a relation or long physical interaction with an anthro. And of course this was your manager so this could influence your work life for years to come. You decide.... </span></div></div>",

He grunted at your landing, but left you there as he began peeling the tight shirt off. As the shirt went a black and white began to spread out in front of you, climbing at an angle up the zebra exposing more muscled gut and eventually peeling back to reveal the huge pectorals that had been restrained all day, the muscle groups swelling to live in the stuffy office air. Joseph managed to work the shirt over his wide shoulders, letting the article of clothing drop to the floor with a muffled thud before his hands reached up and cupped his chest, kneading the flesh and his thumbs gyrating on his black nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck that feels so much better...\" His eyes roll over you and pauses. \"Well? get to feeling me up David.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh yeah sorry.' You say hastily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You had never been on a anthros belly before, besides being stuck in a classmate in high schools pocket and Chase sitting on you, you haven't had contact like this with an anthro thanks to societies strict guidelines. You knew a lot of people got down and dirty with them, they were referred to as spelunkers and cave crawlers, as a human needed to use their whole body to stimulate an anthro typically. So using what you'd only learned in kinky videos you'd watched you began to move like an inch worm, pumping both your hands and knees as you used your whole body to rub the gut of this giant equine. You weren't sure where you were supposed to go exactly, but you really wanted to feel up his chest so you kind of zigzagged up his belly and reached them, wriggling up between his cleft as Joseph had his head rolled back, one hand squeezing a handful of his ample breast and the other absently groping the front of his tenting slacks. You somehow managed to get up on his left pec without sliding down the slick short hairs that coated his body. With an unpracticed movement you hazardously worked your way to the rubbery knob that was Josephs nipple, the flesh sinking deep from your hands and knees as you went out to it on the relaxed chest. Joseph had an eye on you and he broke into a smile as you hungrily crawled to the sensitive spot on is chest that was about the size of you. You pivoted and quickly found Joseph swapping hands to cup his pec you were on, making your ground more steady and less slopped as you kneaded his nipple.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph began to groan and you could hear his belt buckle clanking behind you. You paid that no mind as it had taken you enough time as it was to get here. You dug in deep, squeezing and tugging the nipple and making it swell, and before you knew it you took the tip of the fleshy protrusion in your mouth, biting the rubbery surface, but not hard as you sucked on it. You weren't sure if this was a thing, but the moaning you got out of Joseph boosted your confidence a bit. You weren't able to maintain this position long as Joseph abandoned supporting his tit and jarring you enough to slip down the muscular hill and back onto his muscled belly, where you bounced along to a rhythm that was obvious. You turned to see Joseph at full mast, his dick slapping lightly against the lip of the desk far above his waist. beyond the large shaft and bundled skin that was his sheath, hefty striped balls bounced between his muscular balls, still extremely loose from the hot confines of his pants. His hand slid up the length of his leathery cock with vigor, and you decided quickly on where you wanted to head next...</span></span></div></div>",

Your friend Mack laughed as he pushed open the door to the strip club, you were riding on his shoulder and super excited. Mack was a chubby Leopard in his late twenties, and your childhood best friend. You two did almost everything together, and when you found out that both of you had the hots for the same gender, things got even better. Today you were celebrating your birthday at the strip club, and there was something even better. The Dirty Dusk, the club you were trying tonight, had just opened a new stage to the public, one for human viewers only that they were calling the Humane Hall. The stage room was actually a small room for the anthro stripper with a pole in the center, and the walls were copious amounts of balconies that human spectators viewed from, leading to A LOT of close encounters with tongues, bulges, asses, and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't wait Mack, I hear my favorite dancer is going in the Humane Hall tonight.\" You say gripping the shirt of Mack tightly. He glanced at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It gets better bro, I rented you the VIP spot.\" He said giddily. Your mouth dropped open. The VIP spot was a Cantilevered balcony that protruded out a good foot in anthro measurements into the stage, and was about level with most dancers waist, which of course meant a lot of close, personal encounters with the dancer. This on top of that alot of dancers use the VIP in their act, it was certainly going to be an interactive night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mack how much did that cost? I don't know how to thank you!\" You say running awkwardly down his shoulder and hugging his fuzzy neck. He purred and blushed, before holding up his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Send pics, I hear that your favorite has been using your spot as a dildo, not sure if its true, but snap some pics if he starts. Now here's your stop.\" Mack grabbed you with a practiced  motion and placed you on a human walkway which led into a neon filled tunnel. You walked into the hall and came to a kiosk where a gentleman had a clipboard. You gave your name and he had you fill out some paperwork that had some stuff on it so if you got hurt it wasn't the clubs fault yada yada. You were escorted to an elevator that led down and opened to a balcony that was extremely narrow and surrounded by glass, at the end of it was a chair with a seat belt on it. You looked at it than looked around. The stage hall was cast in pink and blue neon light from the ceiling and lights that lined the numerous human balconies that had hundreds of human silhouettes bustling anxiously for the show to begin. You felt numerous eyes on you as the guide that had followed you out began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The dancer is gonna greet you and include you in the show kid, at some point he's gonna ask if you wanna get personal. If you say yes, the glass walls around the balcony will retract and you'll be in contact with him, when he tells you to buckle up, you better buckle up, this things only been open a month and already two humans have gotten a ride backstage in the dancers rear, followed by a ride to the hospital shortly after. Just do what he directs and you'll do fine. Have fun. The guide said before walking away. You took a seat in the chair, not buckling up and after a few more minutes the lights dimmed and the crowd roared, you rocked back and forth, suspense killing you as your favorite dancer emerged through some curtains on the other side of the room...he stood tall and beautiful, his perfectly sculpted body catching the neon within his curves and giving him an alien glow....he was a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Goliath stepped through the curtain, his silver coat reflected the blue neon light with such intensity for a moment that many audience members were made visible in the dark room. A cheer erupted as he strode in, and he loved it obviously. Despite his bulk and size, the gargantuan horse, who had a good foot on Mack, moved with an otherworldly grace. He had a huge chest and rippling abs that seemed like a moving valley. Goliath however had another nickname that related to what he was best known for, the Devourer, and as he strode in he pivoted on his feet to demonstrate how he gets the name. Being a horse, Goliath was blessed with a large butt, add that he was a belgian draft to it and he gets bigger back there, and on top of that genetics and a good diet have given this stallion an otherworldly ass. Goliath turned around, wearing nothing but a black thong and a bowtie, and the crowd erupted again at the celestial body in the middle of the room, his cheeks looked like silver planets, and complimented his back and thighs perfectly. Goliath knew what he had so he had gotten his tail docked so that he could show off his goods better, leaving nothing but a short stub that draped over his upper glutes. the horse backed up and let his cheeks slide around the pole until they had completely gone around it and met upon the other side, completely embracing the metal object in a glute grip. People cheered again and the horse stepped around until his enormous bulge was only meters in front of you. He looked around the room until his gaze came to you and he lingered for a bit before smiling deeply and true, your heart melted. He began to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks for coming out Ladies and Gents to my show tonight, I plan to give you quite the spectacle. Tonight I'll be taking it nice and slow. We also have a birthday boy who's gonna help me out, give it up for Alex!\" He said presenting a face up hand at you, leading to another round of applause, you blushed at the attention. Music began and Goliath reached behind himself and grabbed the pole and began to dance moving in a way someone that large shouldn't be able to. After a few moves his act picks up with him and he interacts with the audience more, like slowly rubbing his chest up the walls, allowing himself to be stroked by dozens of hands, his groin greeting the lower levels. One guy tried to cling to the thong material, but Goliath looked down and saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah, none of that now, don't need you to fall now.\" He said like a teasing lover, and the guy let go. It was at that point you noticed the earpiece in his ear and the camera in the corner of the room, so someone was watching for anybody that tried to hitch a ride apparently. Goliath hooked his thumbs int the thong and in slowly worked it off as the night went on, eventually exposing his sheath and balls to the audience, being greeted with a roar of lustful screams. The stallion danced in a way where his rear found itself right in front of you and in your daze of awe at the size of them, Goliaths voice reached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to give Alex here a little tour, where few humans have gone before. Wish him luck everybody!\" Cheers erupted again and the Cheeks became larger until they were on either side of your position. Flesh pressed against the glass and pretty soon you were concealed within the ass crack of your favorite dancer. The neon light that ran on the floor of your viewing platform lit your vision as you watches tonnes of muscle and fat slide by across the glass. Your breathing got heavy and the front of your jeans strained as Goliath slid further and further onto your observation point. After a minute of slowly easing onto you, the core of Goliaths ass came into the light. His dark grey anus pressed against the glass, basically encompassing it as it emerged. The puffy ring was quite a bit bigger than you and it clenched slowly, as if winking. An intercom came on suddenly and made you jump out of your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Alex, I'm watching on cam and Goliath just gave me the signal to ask if you want the glass lowered, he's doing other stuff at the moment but you need to answer fast, Just make su-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES\" you shout suddenly, obviously catching whoever was on the com off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Ohkaaay, anyway make sure your belt is on so you don't get taken into his back stage. Glass lowering in 3, 2, 1....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The glass began to retreat in front of you, retreating to some slot behind you or something. Goliath felt the movement and pulled his pucker off the glass but not out of sight, the way he moved told you he actually enjoyed this part as well. When the glass was gone the hole approached again, being cast in ethereal light. You reached a hand out and stroked the hot leathery surface, causing it to shudder but not retreat. Instead Goliath brought his hole down on you, pulling you in slightly as he began to twerk on the outside. Even in here you could here the roar of the applause as he went to town on your tiny form. It wasn't until you no longer felt the chair and were being lifted up by a sphincters grip that you had not put your seatbelt on. In a slight panic, you thrashed at the hole to try to fall back to the platform, but Goliath had a show to do so he sat completely down, his final move on the VIP you had heard. The chair that was supposed to be your salvation became your damnation as it pressed you up into the hole with a wet pop, and you found yourself in hot, damp darkness. The walls convulsed and squeezed you, claiming their unexpected surprise before Goliath could figure out what had transpired, and you were pulled a little deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoliath felt Alex go inside him, and his presence was still there even after lifting back up a little, uh oh. He signaled the camera that Alex was up his rear and pulled himself off the platform, the audience dying down to murmurs and gasps when they saw their fellow human was no longer present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Always wear your seatbelts folks, its the law. Alex is safe and sound with me though, don't you worry.\" Goliath said putting his hands on his hips like a superhero and the crowd erupted in his chant, these people believe anything. He thanked them for coming out and walked backstage to find Reese, the Rhino security guard, waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go get him out, I gotta throw him to the curb.\" The burly rhino said.

You couldn't get your bearings and had no idea where Goliaths sphincter had gone. Despite the shear panic you felt, this was actually quite the turn on, you were pretty sure you had creamed yourself at least three times since being pulled in, you had had dreams about being in a situation like this with Goliath, and here you were. Despite the possibility of him twitching could break all your bones, you were extremely content deep down. In a twisted way, you didn't want this to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoliath slowly stepped in to find a polar bear lounging on a bench, wearing a polo shirt and slacks.

He opened up his locker and pulled out his jeans and t shirt and quickly put them on over his thong. He took off the bow tie and threw it back in the locker, grabbed his shoes, and was quickly out the door. What a long day...He climbed into his truck and drove the two miles home to his property out in the woods near town. He went inside his ranch style home and as soon as he was through the door his pants and shirt were back off, it just felt more natural to him that way. He laid down on his couch and began massaging his muscles to work out all the sore spots he had gained. Some dude had pinched a nipple too hard, another squeezed his balls, that one human had gone...was still up his ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shit Oh Shit Oh Shit!\" Goliath began to shout, jumping up and running to the bathroom, grabbing some Vaseline an smothering two fingers with it. He ran back into the living room, laying back on the couch with his legs in the air, he had to use his free hand to open up his cheeks more to get at his hole, damn ass being so big...With a moan he slithered his digits into his puffy ring and began to dig around for the human. Would he still be alive, still concious at most? He felt something and tried to grab it, pressing it into his walls and making him moan more, his confused privates reacted by his cock sliding out of its sheath up his belly, it twitched with every autonomic response due to his insides trying to push his fingers back out. He finally got a good grip and slowly pulled the human out of him. In his moment he chuckled to himself about giving birth to a healthy baby boy. The human...Alex was it? He seemed to be....</span></div></div>",

Hie midsection however was covered in pure white fur which really showed off his massive pecs and rock hard eight pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while you were staring you soon saw him approach you and your large friend while leaned in close and said, \"Gald to see people still enjoy looking at my body.

And while he made his way back towards the curtain you felt him bring you up to his pecs for what you figured was safely measures as he told you, \"Alright young man, now before we get started what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Alex.\" You let out, while you did your best to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's very nice to meet you, Alex. The name's William. And this fox daddy has quite the treat for you. Though what I'm about to do may seem worrying. But you have no need to worry since I've done this many times with other humans before.\" William explained, before you saw he had grabbed some tape from the other side of the curtain. You then saw him start to walk back towards the center of stage. But as he did this you then were brought up fully to his face and then given a light kiss before he continued, \"And plus once my act is over then you and I can go backstage and then you spend the night with this big daddy, if you wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so with that said you soon found being gently pressed up against the pole and the large piece of tape going over you to most likely take you in place before William started his performance.

You look up at your dog daddy, and sigh again, showing off that famous teenage drama. Marcus was well built and in great shape, he didn't look overly bulky but he filled out his clothes more than enough. His pecs swelled with each breath underneath a tshirt with some image of a sloth and the word \"believe\" plastered beneath the image. His stomach wasn't really flabby, but a few beers every other day had been enough to hide his six pack for the past couple years. He wore some gray gym shorts that had ridden up his meaty thighs and he seemed to think going commando was okay as you could clearly see the outline of his sheath and bulbous balls through the thin fabric. His padded feet down on the floor board had on some flip flops. You couldn't see it, but you heard his tail brushing the floor behind him as it slipped through the slot in the car seat for it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glance at Vance, who stared mindlessly ahead. He was larger than Marcus, both due to species and lifestyle. Marcus used to participate in bodybuilding competitions, and was quite successful before he retired and took up a job working as a welder in some harbor. He was a pale golden brown, not too common in his species. His tank top left his large biceps exposed and some portion of his bulging pecs. His stomach was pure muscle, and the chair he sat in was struggling to hold all of the man that he was. He felt your eyes on him and his own eyes, green as the passing forest, locked with you and he smiled before going back to the road. In your observation you failed to see Marcus reaching for you, and before you knew it you were whisked up and being cradled in your over affectionate dads grip, canines... Marcus licked you, coating you in saliva and causing you to let out a distressed yell, startling Vance who whirled and glared at Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Marc, we talked about that, licking him is gonna make him catch a cold.\" Vance said staring at the road again. Marcus just looked at you endearingly, and you picked up where Vance left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not 7 anymore where giant dog tongue is fun, I'm eighteen dad, so show me some respect.\" You say, but the thumb and index around you tightened as the sound of the dogs tail picked up intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww listen to you, trying to be big and tough. There's no friends out here to impress Kyle, so you can relax. Here I know a good place for you to chill out, though its probably on the hotter side.\" Marcus said snickering, and before you or Vance could do anything he leaned over and peeled back the neck of Vances tank top, his impressive pecs and cleavage below. You yelp as you suddenly plummet down into the pale golden brown hair and muscle, Vance made a \"huh?\" sound as Marcus did that, but you slid a good ways in before the muscles tensed and held you in place. Vance growled, the sound coming from all around you as Vance fussed at Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn dog, why do you have to mess with him so much?...Oh well at least down there you can't bother him for the rest of the trip....\" Vance says as you hear Marcus snicker. It's always been this way, Marcus was loving but would mess with you and Vance often. While Vance was Orderly and Protective. Marcus loved to tease you, and that included you ending up in some pretty awkward situations. Heck one time he had dropped you in Vances underwear drawer just as the Grizzly was leaving the shower, you were stuck in the front of a pair of briefs for two hours before rescue came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" Vance said. You scaled back up the pecs, using the hair as handholds. The muscles relaxed to let you squeeze by and after a minute you popped out of the top of the shirt to see...</span></div></div>",

You had hoped for privacy during this trip but it looked like you'd be sharing the space with the bumbling goofs that you called dads. Nearby a relatively new dock stretched about twenty feet out into the blue lake. Vance threw the car in park and opened his door, stepping into the cool air of the boreal forest. You clung to the neck of the shirt, you had figured Vance was going to get you out, but also remembered he needed his hands free to carry his bag and cooler, so he left you dangling over his chest. If you fell you'd get caught in his cleavage again. Marcus hopped out of the passenger and walked past, you couldn't help but notice the wedgie he had from his gym shorts. His tail wagged lazily over his large cheeks as he walked up and unlocked the cabin door, and Vance began to follow. The bear slapped the shepherds rear and admired the jiggle as Marcus turned and winked at him and you. You groaned in embarrassment as the door finally opened and you all slipped inside. Your assumption was right, the cabin was only one room save for what looked like a bathroom. One corner was the kitchen, another was a couch and lounge chair. The other two had a queen bed and a small table. Vance grumbled disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told them we had a human with us, but I don't see any furnishings...\" The Grizzly said surveying the room. Marcus came up and clapped him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, he can sleep with us. Besides we don't know if this place has feral rats in it anyway.\" Marcus said winking at you. You swallow, feral animals were one of the leading causes of deaths in humans. Humans were easy pickings for almost all of them. Vance pushed Marcus and growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop messing with him Marcus.\" Vance said dropping his bag and the cooler before pulling you out and setting you down on the dining table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only voicing hazards, its not me messing with him. Kyle you'll be sleeping with me and Vance, I'm not having some rat get full on you. Now...\" Marcus said taking off his shirt and tossing off his shorts. You gawk and turn bright red as your dad gets naked just like that. \"Who wants to go swimming?\" Marcus said putting his hands on his hips. Vance sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wear something Marcus, there are other cabins around here and I don't need you giving the Smith Family a show.\" Vance pleaded. Marcus smiled, reaching down and pulling out a red thong, making Vance sigh again. The shepherd slipped into it and put it in place by letting the band go with a snap. He looked at you and you realized he wanted you to go swimming as well. You answer him with...</span></div></div>",

Marcus plucked you up and walked out the door, Vance watching his crazy lover exit with just a thong on. You couldn't help but peak over and watch his bulge flop and bounce around as his thighs bumped it. Marcus strolled down the dock and without warning leaped off the end. You scream as you fly hundreds of human feet down towards the dark water, Marcus took the impact, but you flew out of his hand and splashed into the surface. You sank a few feet down and quickly came back up, looking around bewildered. Waves tossed you about but quickly settled, leaving you bobbing and alone on the water. Marcus suddenly erupted from the water, his coat glistening, and his pecs bounced as he planted his feet on the lake bed, he wiped his eyes and looked down at you grinning, letting his tongue lull out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man thats refreshing, huh kid?\" He says. The water level came mid way up his stomach, but your dad still was towering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, refreshing. I'd like to stay near you though, this pond may have fish in it and I don't wanna get eaten by one.\" You say swimming towards his stomach. Marcus however falls back and begins to paddle away, making you nervous as he smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay laddie have you 'eard of the tales of the furred fish, the carnivorous canine, the dog of death? Well you are about to pay witness to him first hand.\" Marcus said in a pirate impression before disappearing into the water with barely a ripple, leaving you alone again as he messed with you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One time. One time is all I ask for him to take my fear seriously\". You mutter to yourself. A movement and the slosh of water catches your eye to your right but as you turn there was only ripples receding from the point of disturbance. You were genuinely afraid now. In the distance however you saw what made the noise as the tip of Marcus's tail surfaced before disappearing back under the water, you sigh as you watch your dad roleplay a sea monster. At least you thought he was roleplaying until the water erupted beneath you and pearly white canines surrounded you before closing shut, sealing you in darkness. You bounce past Marcus's tongue, which tried to catch you and failed, leaving you to tumble into his throat, the walls of muscle undulating as they took in a morsel, pulling down into the canines body. A gag reflex sounded but wasn't enough to stop your descent into Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus felt Kyle slide right past his tongue and smack into the back of his throat, before his stupid muscles treated his son like a piece of meat and pulled him down. Marcus gagged at the sudden intrusion and sputtered but Kyle was too far down already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\" He said in a strained, choking voice. \"That was NOT how I intended that joke to go.\" He said as the pressure of Kyle dissipated, meaning he had arrived in his stomach. Marcus rubbed his gut and let out a belch on accident, pond water and teenagers made him gassy. He was about to shove his hand into his mouth to puke when Vance came stroding out, the dock protesting the bears enormous bulk with numerous creaks and groans. It appeared the uptight Grizzly had found the swim thong Marcus had bought him and was wearing it well, the Navy blue material held the large bulge in place. Vance rotated before striking a rear lat spread pose, showing off his impressive rear before he turned back around and made a puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Kyle?\" He said a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as you plummet into the dimly lit room that was your dad's stomach. You land with a splash in pond water and melted food, sinking into it before erupting and gasping, sucking in the acrid, stale air. You were still stunned he actually ate you, he had never gone that far before. Looking around reveals the ungodly amount of junkfood he had been eating on the car trip. Half chewed candy bars, beef jerky, cheese sticks, it was all here in some form, and luckily it seemed to have severely diluted the acids potency. The walls quiver and the sound of a belch sounded above, obviously your entrance had let some gas escape. You weren't sure what to do, you had been sat on, forgotten in underwear, and in mouths more time than you can count, but never eaten before. As you stewed for a bit the muffled sounds of your dads going at it could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You SWALLOWED him?\" Vance said exasperated. \"How do you accidentally eat someone Marcus?\" The bear said pacing the dock while Marcus sat still in the water, his ears plastered to his head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was playing as a sea monster and missed him with my tongue, so thats how I guess. And besides he was worried about fish eating him so in a way its better that-\" He began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you believe you're in the right for eating Kyle, get him out now!\" The bear said sliding off the dock towards Marcus. The dog sighed and stuck his hand into his throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls groaned around you and clenched below as you were squeezed into the mass of partially digested gunk before shooting up your dads esophagus and back into the fresh air. You fell back into the pond before emerging, floating among chocolate and meat chunks. Vance sighed in relief nearby and the bears careful fingers retrieved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, look at all that wasted food...\" Marcus said staring at his mess bobbing in the lake. Vance growled at the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you actually live in this reality or are you really just stupid? You eat our son and you're worried about wasted gas station snacks?\" The bear said angrily. Marcus shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle was fine, I knew it the whole time, and I was in the process of getting him out before you distracted me.\" Marcus said as Vance put you on the dock edge. Vance ignored his spouse and turned his full attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright kid?\" He said tenderly. You turned red as he treated you like a kid again, you hated feeling so helpless around these giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it wasn't bad in there, I knew he would get me out despite what it seemed like.\" You say taking a seat on the dock ledge. The bear hoisted himself out of the water, casting you in shadow as he did so. You turn even more red to see him in a thong now, his bulge outlining his thick sheath and house sized balls. With a wet plop, his enormous rear crashed near you, sending out air that blew past you. His thigh was inches from you, and his thick fur clung to the muscles, letting you truly appreciate his build. Marcus came up and Vance let out a warning growl but the dog ignored the bear. He checked you over and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make a great sea monster huh?\" Marcus said as his tail began to create a whirlpool behind him. You hesitated before smiling, for an odd reason, a small part of you wanted to go back in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did scare me dad, so I guess so.\" You say, making the dog laugh. Vance let out his famous sigh again....  </span></div></div>",

Occasionally Marcus would disappear only for Vance to stomp on him or pull him to the surface in a headlock; obviously he wanted another go at being a sea monster. Eventually the two giants hoisted themselves and you on the dock and began to dry off by just sitting in the sun. The bear and shepherd sat crisscross staring at each other with their arms frozen like they were about to make a karate chop. The game was called something like Ninja, with the goal to smack the other players hands to take them out. Marcus swung and Vance moved his hand out of the way with little movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your eyes tell me where you're gonna swing dingus, that's why you never win, you telegraph everything.\" Vance said slapping one of Marcus's hands, eliminating it.

Marcus looked up quickly and gave Vance a 'how could you...' look before crossing his arms and pouting. Vance chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sometimes I wonder if you're just some pup still Marcus, you're so childish.\" Vance said standing back up and stretching.

Vance just rolled his eyes again and went back to the cabin to grab stuff to cook.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You note that Marcus grabs a rolled towel and lays backwards, using the towel as a head rest as he dumps you on his belly. The fur was mostly dry by now and you genuinely appreciated it as the sun was setting, the air getting colder. Marcus closed his eyes and let out a sigh, the problems of work life melting away as he relaxed. Wind blew off the lake and and ruffled his fur, and making you shiver a little bit more, so you shamefully slide into his navel a bit. He cracked an eye and chuckled at you, placing a hand on his stomach over you to shield you from the breeze.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks dad.\" You say.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No problem kiddo.\" He says, not opening his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After some time Vance walks back with burgers, and Marcus sits up, purposefully letting you slide down and end up resting on his bulge. You turned bright red as Marcus took the burger and ignored your plight until Vance curses under his breath and plucks you off the thong. He lets you take a bit of his food and have your fill. You all watch the sunset before retreating to the cabin....</span></span></div></div>",

Vance retrieved some beer and your two dads began playing drunk jenga, you joined in as well but unfortunately Vance wasn't keen on letting you drink despite you being 18. The game was fairly simple, when a person removed a tile, they took a swig of their beer, if you took a tile, both your fathers took a swig. If a player knocks down the tower, they down their drink. If you knock down the tower, both of them down their drinks. Needless to say it took less than an hour to have both your dads slurring their words and having trouble staying in their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Itzzz.....your turn bud.\" Marcus said looking at you with half closed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You smile at him and scale the tower, Vance almost knocking the thing over as he shoves a hand into its base so he can catch you if you fall. These blocks were wood, but filled with foam, so if they fell on you there wouldn't be too much damage besides it hurting a bit. You target one, and try to yank it out, causing the whole tower to wobble. Marcus sighs as he cracks open two new beers in anticipation for your screw up, and sure enough the top half of the tower falls, as do you as you bounce into Vances awaiting palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuuuuuuck...\" Marcus said handing Vance another beer and downing his own, letting out a room shaking belch before standing up on unstable legs. \"Thatz enuff of that.\" He said walking the few feet to the bed and falling onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your fathers were still in their swim thongs, and you couldn't help but watch Marcus's rear jiggle from the impact with the bed. You look up to meet Vance's eyes, he had a smug expression on his face that told you he knew exactly what you had been looking at. You swallow, drunk Vance took after Marcus in the teasing department. He turned in his chair a bit and pinched you in his thumb and index finger like a dart as he measured the distance between him and Marcus's thong clad ass, the cheeks having swallowed the thin strip of nylon and spandex that composed the revealing swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dad...wait please dad its not what you- \" Is all you got as he sent you tumbling through the air and right between the dog's gargantuan cheeks. You slip in a good ways, up to your chest, but you had extended your arms to prevent going in completely. That was of course before Marcus grumbled something and  the cheeks clenched slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that you kiddo? Stay awhile...get comfy...\" Marcus said shaking his hips slightly, adjusting his nether's beneath him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You however ignored him as a shadow passed over you, making your eyes drift up to see your shitfaced bear dad looking down at you with that same smug expression from before. Vance spoke to Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Our little fella was admiring my trophy, so I'm letting him get a taste of it. Go ahead and get in there son.\" Vance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop objectifying me...\" Marcus said, still not moving, finding ultimate comfort that only the drunk can achieve.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You tried to pull yourself out but Vance was adamant about getting you into your dog dads rear. You whipped back to the muscle bear when his knees landed on either side of Marcus's, and began to bend towards you. You look up to see the navy blue bulge of your other dad loom towards you as Vance begins to lay on top of Marcus. You let out a yelp as the cool material crashes into you, making you sink much farther between the Shepherd cheeks as Vance mounted Marcus, resting his chin on the dogs shoulder and planting a long kiss on his mates cheek, their small human son thrashing against his thong clad sheath. Marcus arched his hips a bit, letting Vance get even farther in. They both let out a sigh and...</span></span></div></div>",

You groan as you sit up, only for your head to graze a very pliable surface hanging over you. The sudden contact with it startled you, but you couldn't make out what it was as it was pitch black in the cabin and...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You blink, memories slowly coming back. Your hands felt around, feeling a material similar to the one hanging above you, however the material beneath you was thin as on either side furry flesh extended vertically until it met the material above you. The smell of pond water and an all too familiar musk reminded you that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww Fuck.\" You groan, remembering you were in between Marcus's Ass cheeks, probably sitting above his hole, and Vance's colossal bulge was hanging above you. At least the alcohol knocked them out before they got more intimate with you between them. You just hoped they'd wake up soon, as beer made Marcus quite gassy. You reach a hand up and get a feel of Vance, you were beneath his thong clad sheath no doubt, the fat and cartilage giving easy from your prods. A distant grunt sounded and Vance wiggled his hips, causing his crotch to press further into Marcus, and giving you less room, obviously he enjoyed the probing. You fell backwards, your elbows digging through Marcus's thong and digging into the sensitive flesh of his tail hole beneath, making him grunt and clench up, the soft walls around you tensing and rolling you a bit. Vance moaned in his sleep, his lovers rear massaging his package and tossing their son around like he was nothing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The clenching stopped with the thong material partially stuck in Marcus's hole, and a leg of yours as well, carefully you extracted yourself from the wedgie, only to find that Vance was even farther in now, leaving you with only two feet between the hole and the sheath. You were getting slightly panicked, being entombed in nylon, spandex and flesh would do that to anyone. You had no idea what time it was, your phone was still in your other shorts, and no light was making it into your tiny pocket. With no alternative, you adjusted yourself in the space and began to crawl towards what you hope would be towards their feet, if you were wrong you'd end up on Marcus's lower back and under Vances muscled gut, where you'd most certainly meet a crushing fate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wiggled into the tighter confines of Marcus's rear going south(hopefully) and as you went you slowly slid along the bulge of Vance, their bodies aware of your progress as they both moaned and idly grinded, impeding progress as either Vances balls pressed you deeper into Marcus's crack or Marcus held you in place as he crushed you with a clench. It took maybe twenty minutes of wiggling, but eventually your head emerged from the fleshy embrace of dog ass and you took in a breath of fresh air and blinked at how bright it was. With a final pull, you tumbled from the crack, rolling down Marcus's gooch and bouncing off his plump thong clad balls, landing and rolling back towards them as the bed indented from the mass of weight. You let your self crash into them, slowly sitting up as you rested against the soft surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright Vance he's out, we can get up.\" Marcus's voice, without a lick of exhaustion, stated.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watch as Vance retreats from his position, the monolithic bulge that had threatened to crush you passing over head as Vance got up and stretched. He looked down at your position and smiled fondly before getting up and walking over to start some coffee. Marcus seemed keen to stay where he was as his son still leaned against his sacks underbelly, comprehending what just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you shitting me?\" You say in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Language.\" Vance said while filling up the pot with water, not looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you didn't move and stayed put, we would've gotten ya, but we wanted to see if you were capable of getting out. I didn't think you would, Vance said you would, now I owe him...a favor.\" Marcus said, and you remembered you were leaning against his bits, but were too bothered to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't hear you talking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"When you've been together with someone for a long time son, you don't need talking to communicate.\" Vance said adding the filter and coffee grounds to the maker. You watched his golden brown rear as he did it, the kitchen straight ahead down the valley of Marcus's legs. His fur reminded you of Hash Browns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you were okay with that Dad? I thought you were against that kind of play with me?\" You say towards your Bear dad, and he gave you a side ways glance and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're on vacation, it's okay to have some fun. You know you had fun too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He does, you don't admit it Kyle, but you like messing around with us, why else would you still be leaning against my nuts still like they're your favorite chair?\" Marcus said swaying his hips slightly, rocking you back and forth to show how much weight you were putting back, you were indeed relaxing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You didn't give them the satisfaction of an answer, but you not replying seemed equally amusing. Vance finished the coffee and poured himself and Marcus a cup. He walked back to the bed and made a motion with his head and hissed <i>tss tss</i> between his teeth telling you to let Marcus roll over. You retreated from the warm balls and watched as Marcus threw a thigh over you and rolled over so Vance could fit on the bed. He took a cup from the bear, who then proceeded to put the pillows against the head board so they could sit up on the bed to enjoy their coffee. Vance sat down, plucking you up and putting you on his belly while Marcus slid up to be sitting next to him. As they sipped their coffee, you kind of sat there awkwardly, you had been ratted out as enjoying the intimate contact and there was nothing to do to absolve the feeling you had. Sure your dad's seemed okay and even embraced it, but now that it was out in the open...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A loud fart came from Marcus and both you and Vance scowled at him. He shrugged. \"I have a disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For the last time, you don't have Crohns, you literally live off protein and beer.\" Vance said before letting his own fart slip, and just like that you forgot about your worries as you laughed at the goofs that were your dads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So uhhh, what were we gonna do today?\" You ask up to your dads.

He looked over to see both you and Vance staring at him again with a look. \"What? I've been wearing that thing all night, we all know what each other is packing. You're looking at me like I don't do this and walk around the house in the nude anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were about to retort when the clang of ceramic came from Vance and he slid his arms past you to do the same, you stared up at your bear dad as he smiled fondly at you as he peeled off the thong as well. Leaving his junk exposed behind you. He picked his mug back up and sipped before looking at Marcus and winking. Marcus sat there for a second before commenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Someone is out of character this week....I love it.\" Marcus said leaning over and planting a kiss on the bears lips. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sat there on the Bears belly, and while the two goofs were kissing you turned to get your first clear look at your dad's junk. Every time you'd seen it before was in passing, or you pressed up against it and unable to look at it. His sheath was pointed at you, large and plump, very similar in size to Marcus, his balls however seemed to be a little more large, the fuzzy boulders large enough to fit a few human cars in probably. You turn back around to see an eye half open from Vance looking at you from where he still kissed Marcus, he saw that too, great...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed as did a sort car ride and you found yourself on the shoulder of Marcus as he and Vance weaved their way through a crowd of Anthros perusing various stalls and grills. Marcus wore a jacket with sweatpants, while Vance had sunglasses on and was sporting his usual tank top and board shorts, cold air not really bothering him much. You always enjoyed these kind of things, and liked to get a look at the local species of Anthros that preferred this climate. There were actually a good bit of bears, black and brown, but none quite like Vance in color. Cervines were also common, with many Black and White tail deer, a handful of Rocky mountain Elk, and one or two moose towering over the crowd. A Cougar would eventually pass as well. There were a few exotic species as well, not common to the area. You saw a Rhino, and at one point you caught the glimpse of some marine mammal that may have been a seal, but he disappeared into the crowd before you got a decent look. Marcus made his way to an elevated platform that hosted the human section of the bar-b-que, the platform was quite large, with human facilities and stalls. Some humans looked on with interest as Marcus set you down and began to coo over you, much to your embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"....and if you need me or Vance call us. We don't need another incident like Bagroi Beach-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dad I'm fine, I can take care of myself, I'm eighteen not five.\" You say and wave him off. He hovered for a second but the smell of something soon pulled him away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn around to find many people looking at you, and you shrug. Though Marcus had been talking at a quiet level, probably half the people here caught that you're from an anthro family, there were many reasons they have such a fascination with it, but you let them wonder. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A notification pinged and you saw that Vance had transferred a good bit of money into your account so you could make purchases, and you went on to one of the first stalls. You dealt with the usual questions; Is that your dad? Is that <i>really</i> your dad? Do you have another dad? All the questions that usually were asked to any human with a male anthro as a parent. Though the way they asked seem to imply more than just disbelief, like they wanted to know if Marcus and Vance was really your fathers, as if they could actually be biological. You didn't think it was possible, but the rest of humanity kept broaching you with the same questions.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You found a seat in a dining area that was right next to a railing overlooking an anthro table, purposefully set up so human and anthro friends/family could dine near each other. You sat there so if Vance and Marcus come along you could be near them, but also because most humans didn't sit so close to the anthros, leaving you without the invasive questioning. Most humans lived their lives with anthros in the background, having only one or two that they interact with on the regular, people like you that spent more time with anthros than with your own kind were pariahs to some degree, mainly by your choice. Humans were fascinated and terrified of anthros, and a human that lives among them is questioned to insanity about anthro living.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Movement to your right jostled you out of your daydream and you turned to look at who you though was one of your dad's. You blink when you find yourself looking at a Leopard Seal. As if sensing your sudden focus, he turned at you and blinked before speaking, his voice husky,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh I'm sorry man, I didn't see that there was a human here. Are you waiting on someone on my side? Sorry I can move...\" He said picking his plate back up and beginning to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no not particularly, I'm just sitting away from other people so they don't bug me, you're fine.\" You say meeting his icy blue eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The seal falters, and decides to sit back down, a gracious smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So uh, are you famous or something?\" He said inquiring, then paused. \"Sorry you just said you got away from people because they're bugging you and then I go and do that very thing.\" He said looking away, causing you to laugh in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No you're good. They bother me because my dad's are anthro's, and they wanna know all about it.\" You say taking a bite from your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-oh, so they wanna know if...ya know?\" He said not looking your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Know....if I actually have two dads...?\" You say looking at him side ways, what are these people going on about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Welllll you know, when two male anthros....get it on there's that small possibility that....one gets pregnant?\" He says looking at you with an expression that told you that something about this was obvious. You almost choke and look at the leopard seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're fucking with me right? That's so ludicrous, how does a german shepherd, which is a guy. And a Grizzly, which is a GUY, have a human biologically?\" You ask turning towards the Seal, you just met this guy and he was already fucking with you. Maybe coming to this was a mistake. The Leopard seal rose his palms up in a defensive pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calm down, little dude, I didn't mean any offense. But you seem to be in denial about such a thing, ask them later about it, there's no way they DON'T know about that outcome.\" He said turning back to his food as if he didn't just possibly shatter your entire existence. It wasn't his fault, he seemed to genuinely think you were born from one of your dads. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pull out your phone and do some digging, needing to find out if this is some kind of sick joke that people are playing to discriminate or something. But sure enough it didn't take long to find medical statements and articles pertaining to the very thing the leopard seal just proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hol-lee-Shit\" You say out loud, the Leopard seal turning and looking at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...you were telling the truth that you didn't believe me....yeah there's always been the speculation humans are from the unions of male anthros, and the fact that theres a small chance like 1 in 10000, for a human to be created from homosexual copulation.\" The seal rambled off, but you were too busy having an existential crisis.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You had always believed you had been adopted for some odd reason by Vance and Marcus, but they had never said they adopted you. They seemed to have left out the part where they themselves had brought you into this world as well. A lot of things made since now that you knew they were your biological fathers though. You turned and cut off the Seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay lets talk about something else, anything to get my mind off of that. Who are you? What do you do for a living?\" You say to the seal, who still sat there with his mouth forming the next word he was going to speak before you cut him off. He smiled fondly at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well my name is Butch, and I fancy myself a photographer slash artist. I'm staying in a cabin up near a pond trying to get better at sketching boreal landscapes.\" He said with a toothy smile, his voice sounding more like a bouncers rather than an aspiring artist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds like you're staying where me and my folks are.\" You say, instantly regretting mentioning them as the thoughts came flooding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahhh, <i>that</i>Shepherd and Grizzly are your dad's, I saw them out there on the pond yesterday, I approve of their swimming attire, I prefer just going nude myself.\" He said laughing. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You chat with him for a time about what he has drawn and other small talk, and before you know it, time has flown by and your phone rings. You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey bud, we're heading out, Marcus found the Beer stand and I need to get us outta here before he gets in a fight with this moose. Where are ya?\" As you talk to Vance, Butch waves goodbye and walks away, knowing you knew where he lived. You were found by Vance a minute later and headed out..</span></span></div></div>",

Marcus set his stuff on the floorboard and took you from Vance, setting you in your spot in the passenger door. You were silent the whole time, going over in your head the possibility of what Butch proposed. Whenever something was bugging you, Vance could smell it a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's wrong Kyle?\" His musical and deep voice rang in your ears, every time he talked made your chest resound from his strength, but it was always an assuring feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? Oh nothing, just met some seal and we got into some deep discussions and I'm still stewing on some of the conclusions...\" You say shuffling in your seat as Vance started the car, you looked out your window at the numerous anthros moving about the gravel parking lot. You could feel the bear's eyes on your back, but he knew you'd talk when you felt like it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marcus went on with his oblivious tendencies, he had pulled some type of honey mustard sauce jar from his bag and was sampling it with his fingers, sucking on his digits in a purposefully annoying manner. You watched the forest pass with the sound of Vance threatening Marcus about getting stains on his upholstery in the background. You all got home and bummed around the cabin until dinner rolled around and it wasn't until there was a lull in the table conversation that you dropped the bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So which of you gave birth to me?\" You ask staring down at your plate, barely having touched what was on it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reaction you got for posing the question is one you'll remember forever. Marcus was taking a swig of tea, before spitting it out in a spray across the table at Vance, who had been in the middle of chewing and ended up almost choking and ending up gasping as his eyes went bloodshot. You fathers sputtered for a second, and Marcus recovered faster than Vance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I'm sorry, what did you say Kyle?\" He said. You knew he had heard you, he was just posing the question so he had time for Vance to recover and to formulate an appropriate answer. You imagined this kind of question was never posed at a human table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who gave birth to me? There's no reason to believe that you wanted a human as a son when it came to adoption, so I must've come about naturally.\" You say, taking a realist approach. Vance answered, his voice hoarse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that's an unfair stance Kyle, do the whos and whys really matter? We love you regardless, I'd like to believe the circumstances of your arrival wouldn't have differentiated our affection for you...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"While that's true dad, I'd still like to know if you are my biological parents, and why you never told me.\" You say crossing your arms and inclining your head slightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marcus glanced at Vance and shrugged. \"Well, do you want me to handle this, or do you feel its your say so <i>mom</i>\" The Shepherd added the title with a teasing tone and in that instant you didn't need Vance to say it, Marcus just told you. Vance caught that too and flattened his ears and glared at the dog.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Subtle Marcus, <i>real subtle</i>. Yes I carried you, if we were going by  heterosexual monogamy here, I'd technically be mom as Marcus puts it and he'd be dad. But we don't, we're both just dad. Why do you ask now Kyle, did we do something that made you doubt in our love? Did you develop a longing for the human parents you thought were possibly out there?\" The bear said, the last sentences having the twangs of pain in them, as if you asking had made him feel guilty or ashamed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No....I just found out about the possibility today-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"From this seal fellow you mentioned?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well partially, I complained to him about the questioning that other humans propose at me when they see one of you guys with me. And he asked if you were my biological dads, when I denied that he shared the possibility of you BEING my dads. I never asked because I never knew, were you ever going to tell me?\" You ask looking back and forth between them. Marcus answered, his tone serious now, a rare thing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We loved you, you loved us, nothing else was needed in the equation, it doesn't matter how you came to us, it only matters that we love you. We've rehearsed this very scenario multiple times, but all that practice just went out the window. What I want you take away from this is that we love you and are here for you. Tell your friends, tell the world, do what you want with this new information, as long as you know we love you.\" Marcus said crossing his arms on the table, his ears settling back on his head, they felt ashamed now for hiding it from you, you could tell. Some fresh air and space would probably be best.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going for some air.\" You say getting up, and for once they didn't protest or volunteer to join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You walked along the pond edge, keeping to the grass canopy, all you needed now was to get nabbed by a feral owl after your streak of independence. You made your way towards the cabin that overlooked the pond and dock, nestled on a ridge among pine and fir trees. The lights shone from the inside and a blue car was parked outside. It took a good 30 minutes to get there from your parents cabin but you somehow made it without getting eaten by wildlife. You walked up to the door and rang the human doorbell that was installed at you height, surprised this place even had one. The ring for a human bell is higher pitched so anthros would be aware that they should be looking down, Butch however seemed to forget this was the case however as the leopard seal opened the door with a large smile, he must've been quite comfy as he was shirtless and in plaid pajama bottoms, his bare feet slapping out onto the concrete pad. His smile waned as he looked around in confusion at the lack of persons in front of his door. You were kind of caught up staring at him, his chest was very well defined and rivaled Vance in musculature, and lacking the ample body fat Vance had put on over the years. His stomach was on the softer side, he seemed to have a layer of blubber but it didn't overhang his waistband to much, and below that waistband was a bulge that obviously wasn't hampered by underwear underneath.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you could say your greeting Butch huffed and slipped back inside, closing the door with a slam that threatened to throw you off into the grass behind you. You blinked as the shockwave passed, and gave it a second before ringing the doorbell again. The door swung open and Butch snaked his head around in a snarled expression, obviously thinking someone was playing games with him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umm, down here Butch, Hello!\" You say standing on the tip of your feet waving both hands.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The seal blinked, obviously registering your voice but not registering the possibility that it came from a human. He slipped out onto the concrete pad and surveyed the yard, squinting out into the darkness with a perplexed expression. You broke proper human/anthro etiquette and walked up and tapped his bare foot. Butch took in a gasp and pulled his foot up and knocking you over in the process. You fell on your back and felt the breath fly out as you stared up at the starry sky through the tree branches. Butch's husky voice came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OH! Er...what was his name?....Kyle! I didn't see you there little dude, you okay? The seal said, his head popping into view.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You groan, sitting up slightly, there was a reason humans travelling in anthro territory resulted in a fine. \"Yeah, I'm good, I'm quite acclimated to being tossed around.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh well that's a relief, I was afraid of charges, come in! Come in! I can get some coffee going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Butch's idea of coffee was giving you an anthro mug, which was the equivalent of a small human pool for you to drink. You sat on the coffee table awkwardly as Butch sipped his coffee quite loudly, oblivious to the lack of convenience for your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So whats up dude, have that chat with the dads?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So who's jewels did you come sliding out of.\" He asked in such a nonchalant tone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't quite put it that way...but my dad Vance, the bear...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He struck me as a bottom.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, like, he's the one that-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No I don't need an explanation, I know what that means. You've been scoping my dads?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? Well yes...well...no? I'm not sure actually if I have or not, tell me-\" Butch said as he got up quickly, your eyes getting a view of his balls and sheath jostling behind the pajama material. He walked over, a wedgie between his thick blubbery cheeks as he gripped and easle you hadn't noticed before and rotated it, the wooden legs screeching across the floor in a skin crawling fashion as a canvas sitting on it came into view. \"-Is this scoping? It could be, but I'm doing it without malicious intent.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The canvas depicted the view from the hill this cabin stood on, your family's cabin was on the left of the painting, the dock and pond occupying most of the image. Out in the water you could make out Marcus's back, and the strip of red that was his thong. Sitting crisscross on the dock was Vance, a warm toothy expression captured him looking fondly down on a space on the dock, a spot you knew you were on at the time. You stared at the masterful painting, seeing in Vances expression more depth and love than you'd seen before, you weren't sure if it was enhanced by the painting, or if by your new found discovery. Butch pulled you back into this reality.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry if this feels like I was intruding on the family moment, I thought it was just two lovers on a getaway, and they had an energy I wanted to capture.\" The Seal said, you reply with..</span></span></div></div>",

Though you didn't say anything harsh to your dads, you still feel like you had just spoiled the trip. You had left them stewing during dinner, swiping the good vibes just because you learned they had kept the circumstances of your birth from you. It shouldn't matter where you come from, as long as they love you right?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...and that's why nuclear power is still our best option.\" Butch finished up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" You say blinking.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" Butch replied, before shifting his topic again. \"Anyway are you going to go back home, not gonna lie but this seal loves sleep ad cold and its supposed to get below freezing tonight so I'm going to open all the windows and-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah, I'll head out now, I'm not dressed for cold weather, thanks Butch for being a resort I can fall back on.\" You say, a little caught off guard at how blunt he is about asking if you're leaving.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No problem Karl-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kyle\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"-Kyle! Come over whenever, I'm here for the whole month before I head home.\" He said staring at you with a smile, you waiting on him to help you off the table. His expression waned to a look of puzzlement before it dawned on him. \"Oh! Sorry, anthro etiquette taught me not to bother humans, there aren't many on the island that I come from, we are mostly bears, seals, and some of the last Sabretooth tigers that call themselves the Smilotuk or whatever. You know I think-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Butch can you just pick me up and help me down.\" You ask, adopting his bluntness, or obliviousness rather.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Butch blinked but smiled as he plucked you between fingers, rather than letting you step on his palm, he carried you in this demeaning fashion all the way to his door before opening it and setting you down on the patio. He smiled and said \"Bye\" before unceremoniously closing the door. You flinch as wind blows past you, unsure for a second if you had offended him or if this was just how they acted on that island he mentioned. With a head shake, you hopped off the patio and made your way back to your cabin, cold air biting at you exposed calves and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you longer to get home as you thought you saw an owl flying over the pond and you had taken refuge under a piece of bark, boy was it stupid to come out here by yourself. You reached the cabin and slipped inside using the human entrance, having to open multiple doors that were precautionary against feral rodents from getting inside. You had originally tried to call one of your dads to come retrieve you from your cover when you saw that owl, but your phone had been dead....which also meant that Vance and Marcus were probably scared shitless as more than likely they had been trying to call you. Upon coming into the cabin space you found your fathers still at the dining table with beer cans littering the floor and extra chairs. Both of your fathers sat in lax positions, propping heads up with elbows as they played some kind of card game. Marcus was still clothed, but Vance seemed to be welcoming the oncoming cold, as he sat there in a pair of boxer briefs, the front pouch had a caution sign on it with the words 'choking hazard' on it and you stifled a laugh. Marcus had his back to you and you couldn't see Vance over the table. You began scaling the table leg using the hollow leg that had a ladder in it. Vance spoke as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did you call again?\" The bear asked, a hopeless note in his voice. Marcus sighed, adopting a serious tune in his.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Give him some space, let him think it over, he'll be fine. His whole world just took a hit, let him stabilize himself.\" Marcus said and the sound of a card slapping the table could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hesitated slightly as you crawled up onto the table, Marcus glanced at you and smiled, and you met the expression in a similar fashion. You turned to find Vance with his eyes sunken and looking at you, he seemed to have aged 15 years in the time you were gone, and your confidence that you could just shuffle the altercation under the rug diminished. So you spoke to Vance with the most well thought out response you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...hey.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey kiddo.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So uh....where do we go from here? I quickly came to realize it shouldn't matter how I came to be, but what matters is where I came to be, and I'm glad to be here dad.\" Your statement seemed to revive the bear, as he took in a deep breath, his massive chest rising as he looked at you with relief.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was really worried you'd wanna call the trip short and run off to college to get away from us. I shoulda' sat you down and had a talk about all this a long time ago, but its out there in a less than stellar fashion. Either way I'm glad to see you've taken a mature stance on it....Aren't you cold?\" Vance suddenly shifted in conversation and you blinked to realize you were still in gym shorts and a simple shirt. The simple mentioning of cold seemed to make you realize you were absolutely freezing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, a good bit actually\" You barely finish saying as Vance grasps you gently and...</span></div></div>",

Vance slid onto the bed and cupped you against his chest, you slipping between his pectoral muscle groups and getting a face full of cream colored fur. Vance let out a sigh and you heard Marcus somewhere clear his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I guess this will be the norm over the next two weeks. It's dark out? Well time to go to bed at 8 o'clock.\" He said and the sound of clothes sliding against fur could be heard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thats the gist of it, nothing else to do in this cabin, no TV, no internet, nothin'.\" Vance said without opening his eyes, his snout pointed to the ceiling. There was the sound of movement and then a click as the lights went out, followed by a huff from Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't take long before both of your dads were snoring, the cold air causing their nasal passages to contract, and making them all the more louder. Vance's hand had fallen away some time ago and you were left trying to squirm deeper into the cleft of Vances's pecs. With a groan you climbed up onto one of them and whisper shouted up at your bear of a dads face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaaad\" You yell, hissing it between chattering teeth. The cold wasn't lethal but it sure as hell wasn't pleasant, you just needed Vance to get you somewhere warmer. A snore from him is all you got in response.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking to your right you made out his nipple, grimacing at what you were about to do. You walked up to the fleshy protrusion, your hands cold on its warm pliable surface and instantly it began to harden a bit at your touch. You squeezed it and kneaded it in an attempt to wake Vance up, and got the exact opposite of it. The bear giggled slightly and talked in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heh heh, Marcus stop...for the last time I don't \"Got Milk\".\" Vance said smiling and threw a hand that smacked the back of the distant Marcus who grunted before letting out a snort.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kinky fuckers...\" You mumble to yourself before another chill hit you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You looked around for an alternative, Scanning the landscape of your father, your eyes drifted past his taut belly and settled on his boxer briefs. You grimaced at the thought, but when he awoke in the morning he'd understand why you would be down there. You started across the bear's belly and soon found yourself at the waistband of his 'choking hazard' boxer briefs. With a groan you wriggled your way into the band, the fur here warm and soft. You let out a sigh, getting up to your neck in the boxers, this was a good idea. It doesn't take long and you find yourself lulling into sleep with the slight rising and falling of Vances lower belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm\" Your eyes shoot open as Vance moans lightly in his sleep, and you find his hand fondling the dark outline that was his junk through the boxer brief material south of you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh for the love of-\" You began when you noticed that the bulge of his sheath was beginning to stretch and grow towards you, it took your simple brain a moment too long to realize what was going on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OH SHIT.\" You let out as you try to pull yourself free of the waistband. Your thrashing in such a sensitive area only heightened Vance's unconscious arousal, and you felt something warm and slightly damp grip your legs. You yelp as a suctioning motion pulls you back into the waistband, and in the darkness you make out Vances cockhead with your legs in its slit up to the knees. You bend your thighs and slip all the way into the boxer briefs, planting both hands on the searing hot head of Vances dick as it continues to slip out of its sheath and consumes more of you. You grunt and bare your teeth as you press with all your might, only to slip and go up to your waist in bear meat. The space inside the boxers opens up as Vances clawed hand enters the space.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh thank goodness...\" You say, preparing yourself for the fingers to pluck you out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You relief flipped to horror as the hand gripped the cocks length and began to rub it half heartedly. Vance had always been a heavy sleeper but this was over kill. The rubbing motion caused the dick to begin a convulsing motion and you were quickly pulled up to your chest into the cock. You pivoted and grasped at the fur of Vance's groin, but he kept it short down here and you couldn't find any purchase. Another clench and you were drawn up to your head, and before you could let another word out you were devoured. You slid past feverish walls, the sound of a distant heartbeat being heard all around you as you slipped down into your father. Your mind was still waking up, trying to comprehend what had just transpired. It was another minute before you slipped into a chamber with a splash, becoming submerged in a substance that you could only begin to imagine what it was. You thrashed to the surface, finding it waist deep as you wiped it from your eyes. Only touch, smell, and hearing were receiving anything as you felt around the slightly musky chamber, the walls smooth to the touch, pulsing with Vances distant heartbeat. You shuddered, this was somewhere you had never been before, at least with how memory serves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Vance, wake up you dummy.\" Vance let his eyes flutter open to find Marcus straddling him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? What?\" He felt at his chest for Kyle and found nothing. \"Where's Kyle?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In the bathroom or he stepped outside, I dunno, you think we can slip in a quick round?\" Marcus said letting his tongue lull out of his muzzle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If Kyle-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kyle knows what we do, did you bring a condom?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're asking me if I brought a condom to a family vacation?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll take that as a no, guess I'll just have to clean up real good once we're done.\" Marcus said slipping back and sitting on Vances groin, the horndog was already naked as the Vances boxerclad sheath slipped up between his mates cheeks. His dick began to slip out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine, but its gotta be quick, i'm not gonna hold out for you, if Kyle walks in-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I promise, I'm gonna finish fast, you might get something on your chest before you climax.\" Marcus said slipping backwards down the bed withoug breaking eye contact with his mate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dog hooked the Bears boxers and quickly pulled them down around his thighs before shoving his muzzle down and taking in a whiff of the bears musk, his warm breath dancing across the fine fur that coated Vance's balls. Marcus delivered some gentle nips to the balls skin before drawing out long licks across them, drawing out Vances length from its resting place in a few seconds. The german shepherd didn't hesitate as his tongue lapped around the rod, pulling it taut and finding it firm in an instant. In Vance's haze, he felt some movement in his scrotum despite Marcus moving on from it, but he forgot about it as Marcus had finished getting him hard and lubed up, pulling himself back on top of the bear, his large rear ready to take in his mate...</span></span></div></div>",

Marcus wriggled the bears tip between his large cheeks, the head finding the dogs hole with a practiced precision. Vance grunted as Marcus eased himself onto the bear, the dog panting as he took in the familiar length of his mate. He sank down to the point where his cheeks brushed Vances thighs, before sliding back up slowly and repeating the process, each stroke slightly faster than the last. Marcus sped up, and Vance acknowledged an unfamiliar weight in his balls as they bounced against his taint and slapped the cheeks of Marcus, but he soon gave it no thought as he became wrapped up in the moment with the love of his life. Vance threw his head back as Marcus went to town, the two them hadn't fucked in a few days, and it showed as Vance already neared his climax, he waited however, as despite the dogs claims, he was taking a bit longer, his own length wobbling over Vances belly and his balls bouncing in a mesmerizing fashion. They're eyes locked in the dim morning light, and on a cue that only they could recognized they both released...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were thrown about in an unorthodox fashion, there was no order as you splashed in random directions in the whirlpool of hot spunk. The walls were contracting, though you couldn't see it, as the space became tighter and tighter. What exactly was happening wasn't clear to you, but you hoped Vance had figured out your plight and was working to get you out. With a final convulsion, you were shot up into the tight confines of Vances shaft in what you hoped would be you immediate salvation... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vance covered his mouth as he moaned, releasing his payload into Marcus, and the dog did the same, spraying Vance's chest with his spunk, some painting the underside of his chin as they both arched their backs in their release. Marcus let out a long sigh before falling forward onto the bear, trying to plaster a kiss on the bears face, only for Vance to try and escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop! You've got dick breath!\" The bear protested as a tongue probed his lips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop fussing, its just me trying to kiss your other head, get over yourself.\" Marcus said then paused, clenching his ass on Vances length that was still inside him. \"You seemed to deliver...a heavier load this time...is it that time of the month?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vance scowled. \"Shut the fuck up, go take a shower before Kyle walks in on this, I'll join in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marcus smiled as he slid off of Vance, the bears dick making a wet pop as its semi hard length was pulled from the german shepherds ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You spat out Vance jizz, the atmosphere around you stale and humid as you clutched at a diagonal surface that pulsed and was hot to the touch, you had an idea where you had ended up, but you prayed it wasn't the case. The walls of Marcus's rectum clenched and rubbed against you, probing and exploring the foreign body that was you and probably Vance somewhere in the darkness. A wet squelch sound was made and retreated farther beneath you, leaving you with the distant sounds of your dads digestive system. The walls quivered and gravity made you slowly slip down the fleshy tunnel back towards Marcus's anus, only for the walls to close in around you as they reformed to their natural shape thanks to the absence of Vance's length. The walls made small spasms, trying to recover from the intrusion and shifting you around unceremoniously. The distant sound of a faucet turning could be heard and you figured you were about to be pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marcus rubbed his rear as he waited for the water to heat up, his flacid cock still hanging from his sheath and dribbling cum. His ass felt like it was carrying way more Vance seed than normal, and a sudden fear of becoming impregnated washed over him. He dismissed the thought, that happening was very unlikely, especially if the water would hurry up and get warm so he can clean himself. Finally the water got bearable and he stepped in, noting though that Kyle wasn't at the human facility that was on the counter, odd...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He fished a finger up his rear, his sphincter sore and convulsing from the recent breach in security as the dribble of sperm leaked out of him. He sighed as he drained himself, idly fingering himself and massaging his-<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What the hell is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Light came in from behind you and a heavy digit plastered onto your back before freezing, slowly pressing you into the rectal wall with careful pokes. The claw on the digit hooked you gently and pulled you through the fleshy ring and past the ample cheeks of your dog dad before pulling you out of the streams of water and into the view of a very perplexed Marcus. A moment of silence passed between you two before Marcus sputtered something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"K-Kyle! What the hell are you doing up my main street boy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I dunno! last thing I remember was trying to get warm before becoming a snack for Vances dick!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuuuuuck, you got dick munched? Vance will freak when he finds out e did that to you....he can't know it'll riddle him with stress Kyle.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that your concern? Not the fact that I ended up in his balls and then your ass.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pfft your alive and healthy, I need Vance to stay mentally healthy on this trip or he's going to ruin it for himself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks for your doting concern dad...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Keep up the sarcasm and I won't hesitate to put you back up there kid.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Noted, so what? We don't let him know about that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As far as he's concerned, you went on a walk, can't let him even see you with me right now as-\" Marcus didn't finish the sentence as the bathroom door opened and before you knew it he had shoveled you into his sheath.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You slid in next to his cock, your face pressed into his head as it bulged slightly at your intrusion. You could hear the muffled talking as Vance slid into the shower with his mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you talking to yourself again? Didn't you see a shrink about that?\" Vance said grabbing the soap and lathering up his chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uhh I can't help it, I argue with myself all the time and I typically lose.\" Marcus said shifting so Vance could have the direct torrent of water in the tiny shower.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vance eyed the human facilities on the counter. \"No Kyle huh? Where is he at?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marcus slipped a finger into his sheath and guided Kyle further in, having to fight a boner off. \"No clue, I'm done so I'll go look for him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vance didn't say anything as the dog grabbed a towel and slipped from the bathroom. He pulled you out as soon as he closed the door and sat you on the mattress, you staring at him with a look of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Never have I been so shamelessly handled...: You begin.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kyle, we all have one, get over yourself.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but you're not smaller than mine, its humiliating.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm your dad, its my job to humiliate you.\" Marcus said drying himself off before throwing the towel to the hamper and not bothering to get dressed as he started coffee. It seemed the nudity was more accepted now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You let the sheath stuffing slide and soon Vance came out of the bathroom rubbing the back of his head with a towel, his own birthday suit on full display. You tried your hardest not to look at the balls that held you captive for most of the night as the bounced between his large thighs. He paused when he realized you were on the bed and blushed, his gaze drifting to his naked mate and taking on an agitated expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can warn me to get dressed you know.\" He said at Marcus, who replied by scratching his nuts with an overexaggerated motion. You moved past the nudity and asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So whats on the menu for today?\" and Vance replied with</span></span></div></div>",

I feel going out and exploring some islands on it would be fun.\" Vance said tossing his balled up towel into the hamper.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He eyed the suitcase and then you, letting out a grunt telling you he didn't intend to get dressed either, a new level of intimacy established among your parents and you. You were too busy watching Vance that you failed to notice the shadow come over, and if your nerves weren't already at their ends Marcus would've had you between his cheeks again as his ass crashed into the mattress with a <i>womph</i>. You ended up behind him and still rolled into his crack a bit from the slope his weight created, where he clenched and rocked his hips, trying to pull you in before realizing you weren't directly under him. Vance spoke again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For the love of the ancestors Marcus, can we talk to him without him ending up in your ass?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? I missed!\" Marcus said as you pulled away and rounded the dog so that Vance could see you. You scowl at the dog, but don't say anything as he winks at you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marcus plucked you up as he rotated and laid back on the bed sipping his morning coffee, setting you down on his belly as he watched his naked mate move around the kitchen to make his own coffee. The placement on his belly wasn't lost on you as he had set you probably two or three inches from his upturned sheath, taunting you with it due to your recent adventure into it. You looked back at him and he shrugged, before noting something and going wide eyed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You frown at him before shivering and realizing your soaking wet still from the shower. In a panic you did the only available option and slipped back into Marcus's sheath up to your neck as Vance came stomping over with his coffee. He rose an eyebrow at you and then looked at Marcus quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umm....Kyle why are you in your dads sheath? I mean- no yeah why are you in his sheath?\" Marcus said, still not sitting down as he stares at you and the dog strangely. Marcus looks from him to you, trying to find an excuse but you made one up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's freaking cold, I know you like it but to me I can't stay warm, I'd go for a pocket or waistband but there seems to be none between the two of you at the moment. I had to improvise, I asked Marcus first of course.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vance looked at Marcus again who just winked and gave Vance a pearly white smile, making the bear scoff before walking around and shutting windows before coming back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Kyle, I forget you don't have fur to keep you warm.\" Vance said, not really looking at you as if doing so would offend you. The cold clothes you wore seemed to be felt by Marcus's walls, as they began to contract slightly, the muscles in the pocket tightening in slightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could tell by Marcus's expression your dampness was not very pleasant, so while Vance thought you didn't want him looking at you to not offend your dignity or something, you wriggled out of your clothes and tossed them out of the sheath. Marcus blinked in surprise at this, not anticipating you to do that for his comforts sake, but smiling as a deft finger scrapped your wet clothes off the dogs stomach and out of sight. The velvety skin within seemed to already relax, and actually felt really nice on your bare skin, small twitches within the groin could be felt as Marcus took a sip of his coffee, cherishing the awkwardness that Vance was emitting. It wasn't until the silence stretched for ten minutes that Marcus got bored of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, would you rather him snuggle up in yours? Are you jealous or something Vance?\" Marcus said and the bear looked at him with a scowl. You winced as you knew Marcus was teasing him about something that Vance was not aware of.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What- no, why would I be. If he's cold I don't care what he chooses to do, so long as he's warm. I do wonder why he <i>did</i> choose you as I'm waiting for you to do what you always do and push him in deeper or something.\" Vance said turning away and sipping his coffee.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were caught off guard as Marcus rolled his hips slowly, making you sway like you were on a boat, the dog was either messing with Vance or actually getting horny, and you were in no way gonna get caught up in more debauchery. Before you could slide out though you remembered Vance may ask why you were nude, and thought better of it, bracing yourself for whatever was coming. Marcus slowed however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah, he went in there willingly, I'm not gonna tease him for trying to stay warm, its hard to maintain body heat at that size after all.\" Marcus said stretching, before shifting to other topics. You found yourself drifting back to sleep, the stretching and contracting of Marcus's loins as they regulated temperature rubbing against you like a back rub. It wasn't until Marcus shook his sheath that you came too<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wakey wakey Kyle, we're going kayaking.\" The dog said standing up, the sheath pinching you as he kept you from falling into it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watched as he dug around in his suit case, his back to Vance as he fished out some trunks and a shirt for you, handing them to you and loosening his sheath so that you slipped into it so you could get dressed. You weren't gonna kid yourself that you were really cozy in Marcus's cock pocket, but you knew you had to leave so Vance wouldn't question you. You quickly pulled on the attire and crawled out of the she-. Your hands brushed nylon and as your head popped out of the sheath your world was painted in red light. You growl and bang against the lip of the sheath, annoyed that Marcus now decided to mess with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marcus giggled as he watched the tiny bulges and fists bang against the swimming thong material. Vance slipped his own swim thong on before putting on some board shorts, only to look up and see the stupid expression on his mate's face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You left him in there, didn't you? Damn it Marcus get him out...\" Vance said grabbing a tank top. Marcus ignored him as he slipped into some gym shorts and grabbed his own tank top.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmmm when we get the kayaks in the water....maybe.

The smugly grinning face of your Pine Marten friend was hovering over head as his vision settled on you. Those very same bright amber eyes of his scanned over to the side of where you were as he reached down and grabbed a pair of socks that had been folded up near you. \"Come on now, I know you like sleeping but you can't stay in there all day.\" Victor said in the smooth rumble that was his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Victor Cross was someone you had known for a great deal of your life already, despite the fact that you two came from different worlds in more ways than one. You met him in an university when you first got there during your first year and when he offered to show you around the place. Vic as you called him sometimes was pretty friendly even then and you had ended up rooming with him not long after. You didn't know until some time after meeting him that he had come from a wealthy family and even when he graduated well before you he had kept in touch. Even though you had your own place he would often invite you to stay the night over his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't take long to get ready how ever, you had an extra set of clothes tucked away under the human sized bed that Victor had gotten for you when you were staying with him. He had stood back up while you were busy, and he was still mostly 'nude' save for the boxer shorts he wore, ones that left little to the imagination. The big guy was unusual for a being of his species,normally where martens were on the skinny side your friend was rather burly with well worked muscle. The rich brown fur over most of his body was counter by the patch of creamy white fur down under his chin down the front of his neck and past his chest and stomach. The jokes you often made about him having a little wolverine in his bloodline were met with chuckles quite a few times over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know I'm handsome, bud but you stare any harder and your eyes are going to pop clean out of your head.\" He said, immediately catching your attention as you stutter for a few moments before turning away. A wry grin on his snout the entire time while he went through the other drawers and pulled out a shirt and some shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmph, yeah sure you big polecat, just making sure you didn't look like a wreck before going out today is all.\" You retort, he simply stifles a laugh..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, who said I was the only one going out if that was the case? Even if I was, I'd bring you along too, I could swear you were a good luck charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, no business meetings today?

He had adopted you when you were six and you've come to know him better than anyone else in your life. He was well fit for his age, being 48 but still his pecs swelled under his tank top and his exposed arms bulged with each movement. His mid section had gone pretty flabby due to all the late night games involving beer, but that's about where his dad bod ended. He wore a size too small pair of plaid pajama pants that hugged his thighs and ass, giving him a permanent wedgie and leaving little to the imagination of what his junk looks like. You looked back up at his face where green eyes glanced at you as he rounded the couch. His ears were cropped and his black and brown muzzle had flecks of white on it to signify his years. He slid past where you were, his stubby tail standing erect over his globular pajama clad rear as he began to sit down on the cushion next to you. It took some willpower not to jump over and get sat on by your godly dad, you had 'slipped' before just to get under him. He was usually lax when it came to instances like that, often laughing them off or play with you for a minute or two to 'teach you a lesson', but you enjoyed it too much and you desired more of it sometimes. When he got settled, you both didn't say anything as he continued watching some gameshow. After an hour or so passed, the front door opened and in walked your older brother Joseph walked in with a book bag slung over one shoulder, and you began to admire him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joe was 23 and in his fourth year of college, where he also was a member of the football(american) team, making your dad prideful and you a bit jealous. He was as tall as his father and had the same fur color and build, only difference was Joe was more fit and his fur was more vibrant than his dad's. He walked by behind the couch and went to his room, probably to change you assumed, you went back to your studying when a vibration shook your couch cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh dad gross.\" You say staring up at your dad, who glanced at you with one eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? Burritos never sit well with me. Besides no one told you to study right next to me.\" He said looking back at the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You told me, you won't let me do it in my room because you don't trust that I'd do it.\" You say giving him a irritated look. Your 'room' was really just a dresser drawer in your dad's room, with a ladder built in to help you in and out, though your dad usually carried you out. Your dad narrowed his eyes while smiling .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh right. Haha oh well.\" He said chuckling as he went back to watching TV. Joe slipped back in the room and took a second looking at something on his phone before taking a seat. You looked up at him, he had decided pajamas were overrated tonight and was just wearing a pair of neon green bikini briefs. His abs rippled with muscle and his pecs slowly heaved with each breath he took. His underwear simply covered the skin as the material was so thin every crease in your brothers sheath and balls could be seen through the fabric. His thighs and calves were huge and could easily crush a human house between them. He finally looked up to see his dad on the left seat and you in the middle so he took a seat on the right side of you before smiling and leaning down too you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heya Shrimp! Studying as usual I see, haha!\" He said as he took a finger and pressed your upper body into the couch firmly before rocking it back and forth over you a couple times. Your dad smacked his hand off you and you got up sputtering and scowled at him. He smiled back, obviously wanting to play with you more but your dad would interfere. Despite the rough greeting, you and Joe loved each other, and often he liked to play wrestle and pin you with different parts of him, his bulge, his butt, his chest, all the while taunting you and not letting up until you acknowledged how great the said area you were under was great and mock worship it a bit. You sometimes relented just to stay underneath him longer. You left your thought only for him to still be staring at you, waiting on you to make your retort at him. You didn't want to anger your dad so you went back to reading your textbook. After a few seconds you heard Joe huff before he threw a leg over his knee and began playing on his phone. The family trio sat in silence for awhile before.</span></div></div>",

Your dad looked at you before glancing at the clock to see it right on 8:30, the time he told you to study until. He grunted acknowledgment at you before glancing at Joseph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Jo Jo, do your old man a solid and fetch a beer for him, would ya?\" He said propping his feet up on the coffee table. Joseph stood up and walked towards the kitchen, you watched his huge rear as he left. Your dad hollered overhead. \"And find some pants while your in there boy, I'm seeing way too much of you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah.\" A simple reply came from the kitchen, causing your dad to chuckle and turn back to the TV, nudity around here wasn't that big of a deal, sharing your dad's room with him lead too countless times of seeing him naked, he even walked through the living room once when you had friends over naked, giving your friends a show, you had scolded him for it but only got a \"my house, my rules.\" remark. Joseph came back into the living room, tossing a beer at your dad who caught it without looking, before reclaiming his spot next to you. He spread his legs out so you were mere inches from his thighs on purpose to taunt you, before cracking open his beer and taking a swig. You sat up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey can I have some?\". You ask looking back and forth between the large dogs. Your dad looked at you and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Felix your 15, maybe on your birthday son, alright?\" He said looking down at you with a warm smile. Joseph however, being the big big brother he was, wet his finger with the beer, getting a drop on his padded finger and placed it down on the cushion near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on Shrimp, take a taste, rules are meant to be broken.\" Joseph said looking at his father with a smile, who returned the expression with a stern face but didn't say nothing. You climbed up on his finger, the flesh radiating heat and a feeling of security, as you reached down and sucked up the drop, expecting something amazing. Instead you were greeted with a taste of yeast and bitterness. You coughed and sputtered, much to the amusement to the two dogs watching you, who began to laugh and yip like a bunch of coyotes. You fell back and gagged, getting covered in the beer still left on your brother's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was awful! Dad how do you drink so much of that stuff?\" You say looking at the still laughing Dober.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's an acquired taste son, come here you're gonna catch a cold now being covered in that stuff.\" Your dad said, taking his shirt off in a quick motion and tossing on the cushion between him and Joseph, exposing his huge pecs and slight belly. He plucked you off Josephs digit and slid back a bit, getting in a slouched position, and depositing you between his pecs. You laid there awkwardly, feeling like a little kid, and not making eye contact with Joseph who was obviously finding your position funny. You glanced in his direction and froze when you saw what you could've swore was him rubbing his bulge between his thighs at the sight of you between dad's pecs, maybe he was just scratching an itch? Your father helped you along by stretching his shoulders, pulling his pec's apart, letting you slip between them further before relaxing and causing them to pinch you between them. You wiggle a bit to get comfy as the family settles and begins to watch whatever the TV was playing. You couldn't help but notice your fathers package in the bottom of your field of vision, the large plaid covered bulge nestled between his beefy thighs. Your father made small talk with you and Joseph as the night went on and would occasionally flex his pectorals to play with you. Finally he stood up, you still in between his pecs and turned, tossing the remote too Joseph, who caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm turning in for the night Joe. What about you Felix? You wanna stay up with Joseph or do you wanna go to bed with me? You look quite comfy so I see no problem having a little father-son sleep over huh?\". He said looking down at you. You thought for a second, you haven't slept in your dad's bed with him in awhile, so turning this down might be a missed opportunity. But Joseph was rarely home anymore, having ton's of friends and responsibilities with football and college, and with dad in bed you two could play around and you could get up close and personal with him maybe. Joseph was looking at you from the corner of his eye, waiting to see if you were sticking with him or pop's. You decide and say... </span></div></div>",

Joseph smiled slightly and wished you both goodnight, also adding that you should come to his room in the morning too play some video games with him or something.Your father walked into his room and threw back his covers, before glancing down, you thought he was looking at you but after a second you realized e was looking at his pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatcha think Felix? Should I take them off or keep them on?\". You blinked and looked at him, not only were you sharing his bed with him tonight, but he could be naked as well? He'd never done that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, your house, your rules dad. I know you get hot in those tight things but you do what you want.\". You say, hoping he does. And he did. Your Father hooked his thumbs into the waistband and shimmied the pajamas down to his ankles, the action bunching up his pecs and smothering you in their flesh and fur.When he stands back up he kicks the pants to a corner before turning off the light and jumping into the bed, not pulling up the covers yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"See ya in the morning son, stay on my chest though, don't wanna squish ya.\" He said closing his eyes. He was out in 10 minutes, snoring off the beer with a deep slumber. You wiggle out of his pecs and look around in the dim light. You only sources being a nightlight near the bathroom and light coming under the door to the living room, signifying Joseph was still in there. You climb on top of your dad's left Pectoral and surveyed his body. He never got around to pulling up the sheets so his privates were exposed to the cool air of the room. His large sheath hiding his member from view, and tan balls drawn up slightly but still loose between his thick thighs. You slide down his pec and begin your trek across his soft stomach, the flesh caving in and making it hard to stay upright and causing you to fall a few times. Soon you reached his soft but slightly firm pelvic area and were able to walk right up to the lips of the sheath. You reached up a shy hand and touched the skin of the sheath, scared to do too much or else you may wake him up and any chance of this happening again may not occur. After a moment you slowly stroked the flesh and put a little more pressure behind the touch. Your dad snored away, obviously unfazed by his small son touching his privates. You were too scared to try to get inside the sheath at the moment so you went around the side of it, keeping a hand on it as you slowly made your way to your dad's large fuzzy balls, each one many times bigger than you. You slowly got down onto your rear and slid out onto the loose skin between the orbs, the flesh out here reminding you of a water bet slightly. You settled here for a time, listening to the chorus beneath you and enjoying the heat, after a moment....</span></div></div>",

A musky smell hung in the air and as Joseph turned on the light you were greeted with the sight of clothes slung all around the place. Joseph deposited you in a rugged recliner in a corner of the room as he turned on the gaming system and grabbed his controller and a tiny box that contained your controller. You watched him as he moved around the room, his brief covered bulge swaying with each step he took and his huge bubble butt bounced as his hips swayed. You didn't notice him ever notice your observation, but he responded to it regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your definitely taking a good gander at me aren't ya shrimp?\" He said finally turning and looking at you after putting a fighting game in the system.

Joe's cheeks swallowing the material and being visible through the slightly translucent briefs. looking past the mounds your brother looked over his shoulder with a large smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I have grown Felix, thanks for the compliments, but I know exactly what you were doing, you're the age where all that goes through your mind is lust. We got all night so let's play some games.\" Your brother said sitting down, you dove forward as his butt slammed down where you were just sitting. You stared back at the large package now before you as Joseph chuckled, handing you the box and selecting play options. You sat up and got your controller, Joe took the box away and looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well get comfy bro, I need to beat you fair and square.\" He said, he himself shifting back and forth, his package sliding slightly across the cushion. You look up at him, and then look around trying to decide where to sit. \"Here let me help.\" He said, picking you up and setting you on top of his brief clad balls. You freeze, not sure what to do. The flesh beneath you giving as you sank into it, like a big bean bag chair. You look up again at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, this isn't uncomfortable for you?\". You say.

You decided to go with it, choosing your character and settling back into the damp fabric and enjoying the warmth of your bro's balls. You stayed there for some time, talking smack but ultimately losing most of the matches against Joe. You had gotten comfortable, constantly shifting around and patting the large sack you were on every time you won a round as a sort of mock consoling to your bro.

As he does so he slips off the tight briefs and lets them drop to the floor and you look away red in the face. \"Dude, okay what are you doing?\" You say as he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're not fooling me kid, I know you enjoy me, so lets get a little closer huh? and don't worry I'm well practiced at throwing my weight around so you'll be fine.\" he said leaning down and putting his hands on his knees, his colossal balls dropping down a little to cool from the recent confines of the tight briefs. \"Take off your clothes Felix, this'll be fun I promise.\" He says with a sly expression. Not wanting to kill his mood and also deep down wanting to be smothered by his alpha body you comply and take the same stance as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And...Begin!\" He says leaping across the room like a predator trying to grab you, in the past he always began like this so you instantly sprinted as fast as your one inch frame could go through the carpet to the right, just narrowly dodging the crashing bulk of canine which sent tremors through the house, that was new, and scary how much more he weighed. This game wasn't really wrestling, it was more 'Felix dodges Joseph until Joseph catches and does what he wants'. You wanted to be caught, but that was no fun to just let him have you, although now he wasn't clothed so it was more tempting to be caught. You were so caught up in thought you didn't see him quickly slide up and predict where you were heading and with an audible <i>plop</i> your world became warm and dim. A chuckle resounded from somewhere and suddenly, warm furry flesh pinned you to the floor...You were under Josephs...</span></div></div>",

You paled and finally realized where you were. Everytime you had wrestled Joseph had had some form of clothing on, but now that he was nude, you had no issue sliding into his ass crack. Another clench and he pulled you further in with such precision that you wondered if he had practiced for this moment. You laughed nervously and let him have his way for a minute before lifting your hand and tapping the fatty wall to let him know you give. The clenching stopped for a second but then continued, pulling you upward into his cheeks. You shout at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Joey! I give up! Get me out now!\" You yell as another clench, long and drawn out, squeezed you even further upward. A voice finally responded, sounding all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw c'mon Felix, don't surrender yet, you feel so good in there, besides there's someone in there I'd like you to meet.\" You don't reply as you were confused by the response when suddenly another clench pushed you up against a leathery surface which instantly clenched and sucked at your arrival and touch. You let out a scream and instantly start punching and kicking your brothers enormous sphincter, which in turn he just laughs at. The hole could easily swallow something twice or even three times your size, and the way it was pulsing you couldn't help but think you were on the menu. You shout out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Joseph I give! Just get me away from you asshole!\" You say trying not to touch the gray/black flesh. He laughs again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just kiss it and I'll let you out, but I mean really kiss it, get your face in there and everything! I won't tell anyone, promise!\" He says like he was on the edge of his seat. You groan, and with little dignity, lean in and plant your face as far as you can, but as you'repressing your face in, Joseph relaxed and your head went in with a soft pop. Before you could react, Joseph seized you and with a loud squelch, sucked you into him with one clench. You were dazed for a second, but the searing walls and abhorrent smell told you where you were, and instantly you began to freak out, punching and kicking at the walls around you in an attempt to break out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"JOSEPH, GET ME OUT NOW OR I'M TELLING DAD.\" You yell at the top of your lungs but no response came except for distant groans and squelches of the canines digestive track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck me, that was good.\" Joseph said standing up and rubbing his lower belly, his cock at full mast and dripping what was left of his orgasm. Felix was still banging away, and he knew he had to get him out before it gets to the point of where he tells dad and Joseph isn't allowed to ever even talk to his little human bro again. He couldn't help it though, at a Frat party there was a human that climbed into his ass and gave him the best orgasm Joseph had ever had, and he needed that experience again. Joseph cleaned up the mess he made as fast as possible and let his cock recede back into his sheath before climbing onto the bed and spreading his cheeks before pushing his brother out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The walls finally clench up and squeeze the life out of you before you slid back through the dark hole and fell a bit before landing on a soft surface. Looking up you saw the asshole winking before Joseph let go of his cheeks and they made an audible smack, sealing away the cursed hole. Joseph grabbed you and pulled you in front of him before sitting down, and you looked at him with the most hateful expression you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell was that Joseph? You just ate me with your ass! Do you think I enjoy that?\" You say to him, in which he glances down a bit and smiles. You blink and do the same and turn bright red at the erection you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I would say you did. So what do you wanna do now, its your turn to decide, I had last choice so its only fair you get to choose what we do next,\" He said happily. You rub your chin, looking around the room, and then back at Joseph, and then his chest, and then his colossal junk really close to you, you smile and say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyrannosaurus Rex. Your dads eyes were half closed, obviously exhausted from his day at the construction site. He wore nothing but a small tank top that didn't quite cover his belly, and a pair of grey compression boxer briefs. The rough skin of his belly was a cream color while his back, arms, head and limbs were marbled stripes of orange and brown. His whole body was covered in a layer of fat, but not enough to make him look squishy, if anything it made him look stronger and more formidable. His dulled eyes glanced down at you as he sat down on the cushion next to your right, his huge rear sending a shock wave through the couch as he made impact. He let out a huge sigh as his thick tail slid out from behind him and draped itself off the couch on his right. You glance at him as he begins to eat vigorously, obviously the day didn't go very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rough day dad?\". You say without looking up at him, the scraping of the plate slowed as he cleared his mouth of food before speaking. And when he finally did with accidental authority, being the foreman will do that to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"More than rough, some idiot decides to drop a bunch of steel today, it took out a good portion of the projects left wall, and that's gonna take a whole nother' week to fix.\". Your father said with renewed anger. You close your textbook and walk over to your dad, where he picked you up and placed you on his bare thigh without much thought before going back to eating. He had found you on a job site when you were four, when a bunch of his men had found you and were goofing around with you in a fun but rough way. From the way your dad told it, he made it sound like they were all but about to kill you, but you knew most of the guys and knew none of them would do anything like that. He had put out a child found statement with the police, but months went by and no one claimed you, so James, your new dad adopted you as his own. Now you sat on his naked thigh, rubbing it to try and calm your dad. Anthros always relish in the touch of humans, it's unknown why but the minute touch of a human seems to release chemicals in the brain that relax them a bit. As you rubbed at the soft flesh under his rough skin, you couldn't help but let you eyes drift to the large package that the compression boxers were hugging and keeping in place. The outline of your dads mammoth balls and monolithic sheath could easily be seen through the fabric. You weren't unfamiliar with the sight of his package, sometimes you and your dad even take showers together, and sometimes when he is dead asleep you venture down and touch his privates, but have never dared to climb on them or try to get in his sheath. Your massage didn't seem to be helping your father much, as he still looked quite pissed. You look at his bulge one more time and decide you were gonna risk it, at most he'll probably tell you not to do that and place you back to your books. You stand up and walk down his thigh towards his knee and halfway you drop onto your rear and slide down his inner thigh. Your father glance down, thinking you slipped and a hand appears but you wave it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine here dad.\" You say and begin to massage his inner thigh, the hand hovers a minute before he shrugs and goes back to eating and watching tv. As the night goes on you slowly drift up his beefy thighs, looking to your left you could see down the incline was what looked like a colossal grey boulder blocking the path in a ravine, as your fathers package was bulged outward and the spandex was pulled taut around it, disappearing and forming wedges between the bulge and his thighs. He didn't seem aware yet that you were very slowly making your way towards his crotch, but he was obviously enjoying your efforts down there as he seemed much more relaxed. Eventually, you were just mere human inches away from the package, which towered way over you, it had a ghostly blue color to it, due to the only light being the tv shining down the canyon of your dads legs, and it gave the bulge an ethereal glow. You could smell the musk coming off his left nut, which was many times bigger than you. You let one hand slowly work its way into the wedge between his balls and thighs, and as soon as the hand wormed its way in the whole thigh tensed at the sudden intrusion. Noise could be heard as your dad sat up slightly to look down at you. You look up to what you expect would be an angry face, but instead are greeted by a look of surprise. Your father stared at your location and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um whatcha doin' there Jamie?\". He asks with a sort of smile forming on one side of his face. You look him in the eye and then back at his bulge, and then back at him and say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I must've gotten to caught up in what I was doing to see I had gotten this far down dad, sorry, you want me to come back up?\" You say removing your hand, which was slightly damp, before stepping away for him to grab you. He didn't reach down for you however, instead he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm no you're fine right there son, in fact, if you could do papa a favor and give the boys there a quick rub, i'd really appreciate it, it's been a long day.\". He says in an almost pleading voice, you...</span></div></div>",

You reached out an experimental hand and pressed it to the crease that was the space between his balls and pushed, your hand easily sinking into the squishy flesh behind the boxer brief spandex. You began to gyrate the hand slowly putting a little more pressure and soon you put your other palm nearby and repeated the movement. Your father slouched back a little above you and let out a long breath, closing his eyes, and obviously enjoying the attention. After a minute you had started to put your entire body into the massage, pressing into the soft flesh with most of your weight and burying your face in the large bulbous scrotum. While you massaged, the boxer briefs became even tighter as a the top of your fathers sheath grew as something partially emerged from it. Your father cleared your books and put them on the table and retrieved you before shifting on the couch to where he lay on his back and placed you on his clothed pectoral and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thanks son, that helped a bit.\" And left it at that. you blinked and looked back down his body, passed where the shirt left his slightly pudgy belly exposed, and where the boxers became less taut as your fathers member slid back into his sheath, the elusive cock still never seen by you. You look back up towards his face where he was looking at the television, his face lit up in that ethereal blue white, years of stress and hard labor evident on his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can help down there some more dad, you just gotta ask, you were obviously enjoying it.\" You say looking up at him. He just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're not some human body servant, Jamie, you're my son, I have to show some decency and restraint with you. I shouldn't make or let you just play with my bits anyway, I already regret making you rub my nuts.\" He said still looking at the TV. Even though he was saying that as a dad thing and meant no disrespect or harm in the words, they still hurt you for some reason. You were immensely attracted to James, and here you were standing on his large chest, and he was essentially off limits to you, sure one day you could find an Anthro friend or Mate that would do all kinds of things with you and their body, but would they ever be the man that James was? A rare species that was built like a mountain and loved you. You sigh and sit down, the flesh under the cotton shirt sinking in at your weight, and you began to absently knead the flesh around you with your hands, your vision darting between the TV and the distant mountain that was your fathers crotch. After about twenty minutes your vision notice something under the tank top not far from you, one of your fathers nipples. You get a wicked smile and stand up and begin to walk, but not directly towards it, instead heading for a small hole in the tank top as if you were examining that. You felt your fathers gaze drift to you for a second but he obviously had little interest in what you were doing and you felt the gaze disappear as soon as it had begun. You walk past the hole and soon find yourself at the short cliff that was the edge of your dads right pectoral and hopped down onto the softer fatty surface that was the beginning of your fathers massive stomach. You turned and kneaded the edge of his pectoral, which twitched a bit at the touch and your father eyed you, the deep green of his eyes shining as he thought about telling you to stop rubbing him. After a moment he seemed to think nothing of it as his chest was probably one of the more sore spots he currently had and welcomed the treatment despite his earlier rant. You slowly worked towards his nipple, and after a few minutes your hands glided over it and you began to knead it like you had the rest of his chest, however at the furthest point of a palm pressing into it, you squeezed it slightly, and in no time you could tell it was getting flushed with blood. You only did the action a few times as-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jamie....\" You look up to see your father looking straight at you with a tired expression. \"I know what you're doing, is playing with my dong really that important to you? I didn't even know you had that kind of attraction to me son, but maybe we should talk about this thing you're trying before you try it, huh?\" You turn red at the words and how easily he figured you out, on the scheme and your sexual preference. You stammer something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'm sorry, it's just that you've been such a good dad and, I thought, if I could do something that made you happy and feel good, that I'd be able to pay you back for at least a little of what you've done...\" You say looking down. Your father rubbed the back of his head and waited a long moment before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Parenthood isn't about reward, it's about results son. I don't want you to give me anything, just your love, but I guess you're trying to give me that in a more concentrated dose at the moment.\" He chuckled. \"I guess since you're a senior in high school now and of age, I can indulge you a bit, just so you no longer have to wonder. I am after all, like you in the sexual preference department, tough I've been too busy to be in the game. Might as well let you have me as a first time so you know a good time from a bad time when you're on your own, just don't expect all of your encounters to be as good as me.\" He lets out a belly laugh, shaking your stunned form. You just nod your head wordlessly as your father scoops you up and carries you to his room. He places you on the bed as he strips of his shirt, and worms his way out of the tight boxers. His tail lashed lazily around above his enormous ass, the globular, fatty muscles painted brown and orange. He turned around to face you and put his hands on his hips, between his legs hung his large, gray cock that was the size of a bus to you, and that was with it flacid. His sheath was bunched up around its base and hanging below were his bulbous balls, each about the size of a human bedroom. He spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jamie, where should we begin?\" You answer him </span></div></div>",

Despite this 'purity' movement, humans were still accepted everywhere and could join any colony without discrimination. Sedimar was still colonized by all races as well as some of it's first colonies, but a majority of the anthro's found themselves on an alien world where only their own species was found, excluding humans. This of course led to some worlds having resources that another did not, and long, devastating faction wars rang out across the stars for said resources.

His slick black and white skin reflecting campfire and highlighting his toned muscles with great detail. He wore a brown leather loincloth that had designs of animals in a tribal fashion weaved into them. A knife hung from the belt of the loincloth, the lower part of it anchored by a strip of leather tied around his enormous right thigh. The Orca sniffed and snorted at the stale air. He glanced over at the jumble of furs that you resided within before slipping back out of the tent. You breathed a sigh of relief, only to inhale sharply as the Orca returned, tugging the carcass of a deer into his tent. Your nose and senses told you of recent death and your flight response wanted to kick in. You however gritted your teeth, knowing this may lead to a chance for a meal. The Orca dropped the deer on the dirt floor, his large tail sweeping behind him as he began to crouch down. His tail passed over you and his enormous rear crashed to the ground in front of the furs. Unlike the front of his loincloth, the back was only a thong in which the leather disappeared into his heavy cheeks. The sound of flint against stone, followed by light erupting to what was still visible past the giant figure told you he had started a fire. The Orca pulled his knife from its sheath and set to work carving the deer. You crouched back down and waited, hoping for an opportunity to grab some cooked meat. Your brief thought distracted you long enough for you to fail to notice the Orca reach behind himself and grabbing the fur above you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With a quick motion he ripped it off, exposing you to the room. You held still, but when your eyes darted to see him setting the fur out next to himself, you relaxed and quickly dove behind a wrinkle in the fur that was still beneath you. You waited for awhile, as the Orca cut up the carcass, placing the red meat onto the fur that had been above you. When he was finished the giant male rotated himself to where he was facing the meat pile. You watched his heavy rear slide, kicking up a storm of dust as he did so. His hands and mouth glistened red in the fire light, from working and tasting his kill it seemed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His knife moved with adept precision as he worked on the slabs of flesh, cutting away sinew and tossing it to the side. As he worked you couldn't help admire the Orcas chest and abs as he towered over your hiding spot. Eventually he finished and rotated back to the fire, beginning to cook the meat.

You and these other humans were recently captured and caged to be dealt with later, your uses being determined as they came up. Already one of you had been eaten, another grabbed by an anthro child for a toy, and another unceremoniously shoved into a passing anthros sheath. A sudden thud pulled you from your flashback as you look on to see a small chunk fall off a skewer and land in the dirt. You glance up at the hunters to see they didn't notice, as they were too busy laughing at one of their own making obscene gestures that imitated having sex. With starvation driving you, you squeezed through your bars and fell to the ground on the other side of them, only to spring up and dash for the meat on the ground. Another human yelled after you to come back but you ignored them. After a short while you pounce on your bounty and tear at the slightly cooked meat with hunger, not savoring any as you barely chewed.

You didn't respond to him, you were too paralyzed by his gaze to do anything about your predicament, and your life was literally in the hands of this demon. The lack of response made his smile waver slightly and it was obvious he had already grown bored of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You vermin, you <i>humans</i>, you act like we owe you something, when it's the other way around.

He said lowering you as he looked to his friends. With his eyes no longer meeting you, you were able to get a look at your captor. From you spot you stared at his stomach and chest, which were covered with short brown fur with thin black stripes here and there. Underneath the fur was a beautiful display of large pectorals and abs that rippled with every shift he made. Looking down you saw that this particular Hyena decided loincloths were overrated and instead had opted for nudity, as his large sheath and balls hung free over the edge of the tree stump he had as a seat. A knife was strapped to one of his thighs and that was the only article of wear he had. The hyena readdressing you pulled you out of your strange admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So runt, it's decided then, I think I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

Better than your other alternatives huh?\" The Hyena said smiling down at you. He lowered you onto his right thigh before leaning down and grabbing the chunk of meat you tried to ravage. He narrowed his eyes at you before letting them drift to the meat, where he took two fingers and tore off a small piece perfect for you. He gave it to you and you consumed it quickly before looking back up wearily at the Hyena, who let out their famous laugh before leaning back and holding a palm out toward you and looking at his two friends across the fire, who had been watching with dull curiosity the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gentlemen, I present to you Swift, my new companion, may he last longer than Golden Shower, who died living up to his name. No thanks to you Broke-Fang.\" The Hyena said, his eyes narrowing at the hyena closest to him. This hyena had a long loincloth that had many fangs and claws threaded into the cloth, with one fang in the center of the loins belt. The hyena being addressed sneered, exposing that one of his canine fangs was broken, and the one that was left looked just like the one that was the central display on the loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not my fault that rodent couldn't swim, he shouldn't have been standing where I was pointing my cock.\" Broke-Fang said crossing his arms like it wasn't his fault at all. \"Besides Free-Wind, If I recall, half of your 'pets' end up in you anyway, so don't act like the death of your toys is solely on everyone else.\" You gulp at that, this Free-Wind character may be your death yet. A hand gently wrapped around you and rolled you into it's palm, where the giant thumb began to rub your head gently. You froze in terror, knowing one quick jerk from the thumb could snap your neck. Free-Wind spoke to his accuser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not this one, I got a good feeling about this guy, he's a fighter, and I don't eat fighters.\" He says looking down at you with a morbid fascination. The other Hyena spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's shaking like a leaf right now, doesn't look much like a fighter to me.\". You look over at this hyena, who seemed to have an obsession with knives, as he probably had ten to his person, one on each upper arm, one on each thigh, two hanging on a belt around his waist, and four on a bandoleer that ran diagonally across his sculpted chest and belly. The belt also had a shredded loincloth hanging from it, but you could easily see bits of his crotch through the torn material. Free-Wind looked at him, then at you and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh whatever Many-Knives, he's got my blessing so both of you respect that please.\" He said as he moved his hand off his thigh and closer to his body, you looked back, curious to see what he was doing and gasped. The other side of Free-Wind's palm was pressed against the mouth of his sheath, the slit clenching vaguely as if waiting for a meal. You fell on your butt and scooted backwards, which caused Free-Wind to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, Swift, don't run, this is your new home, embrace it, its nice and warm on a cold desert night like this and cooler than the searing day, you'll love it.\" He said shaking his palm and tilting it causing you to begin sliding towards it. You weren't buying it, the musk alone was potent enough to almost knock you out, inside was probably ten times worse. Also you had heard tales of humans even being consumed by anthro cocks, and a few humans in this very camp claimed they had been to the depths of an Anthro's balls and made it back out. Either way you weren't keen to become a human that doesn't make it out. Your legs make contact with the soft sheath and instantly you could see the lips relax, swallowing your legs to their knees, causing you to make a frantic yelp. THis of course caused all the Hyenas to begin laughing. Free-Wind tilted his hand vertical and you descended up to your chest in the sheath before suddenly the lips contracted and kind of held you in place. You kick your legs but find them wedged in the oily leather walls below, making their movement slow, and they felt no presence of the canine cock who's residence was the sheath, it must be further below. Free-Wind let out a content sigh and put his hands on his hips, proud of his new catch. You tried to pull yourself free with your arms but the plump lips of the sheath gave way to easy to your pushing and the interior walls clamped down harder in response to your attempt of removal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"None of that now Swift, I give you food and a home and you try to leave? Humans, they want something and so you give them it and then they don't want it.\" Free-Wind said, his friends laughing with him. This went on for a few minutes but soon they grew tired of taunting you and went back to cooking and storytelling. You sigh and prop a hand under your chin and let your elbow dig into the sheath lips as hard as you could, to no avail as Free-Wind seems undisturbed. He probably has had so many humans in your spot that anything you do to try and hurt him or make him uncomfortable has been attempted before. So you just watch the giants talk around you and listen to the fire and sizzling of fat. You glance over the lip of the sheath to see how far down you'd drop if you managed to slip out, and confirmed that you wouldn't survive. your gaze drifted from the ground to the huge balls of Free-Wind, which could easily fit you and maybe half a dozen more humans inside comfortably, they swayed at every tap from your masters thighs and shift of his hips, lightly slapping the wood of the stump behind them. Satisfied with your observation, you found yourself quite tired, but hard to fall asleep with your upright position. You sigh and await Free-Wind to finish his dinner, hoping you can escape when he retires to his tent....</span></div></div>",

Your captor laughed and told hunting stories with his pals, slowly forgetting about the human hanging halfway out of his plump sheath. You sway slowly, realizing you were in for a long ride here. Some other Hyena walking by began talking to Free-Wind, making him turn around on his stump to speak better with the newcomer. As he turned your view from between his thighs changed, going from just looking at two Hyena's tearing off meat on a fire to a view of a good portion of the camp. The night was dotted with at least 40 more campfires like the one you now sat at now, or rather hung at. Hyena's danced and wrestled at these oasis's of light, sending shadows dancing all around in a eerie fashion. Their eyes caught the slightest of light, making them glow even if they weren't even close to a fire. You shiver at the sight of the malicious giants that ruled your kind and drifted your vision to where the cage of captured humans were, and your heart went into your throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cage was now empty, and a Hyena sat nearby with red warpaint on his arms and chest, as well as his thighs. He was in a relaxed prone state, licking his lips and rubbing his slightly chubby mid-section as if he just enjoyed a meal. You let out a loud gasp that caused the ears of Free-Wind and his friend to twitch and them to look at you. Free-Wind blinked, obviously just remembering you were there, and then he followed your gaze and letting out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha! Looks like Fights-Anyone deemed your friends delicious Swift, they no doubt fought valiantly against his tongue and inner workings.\" He said looking down at you, his companion eyeing you as well before rolling his eyes with a smile and walking off. Upon hearing his name, Fights-Anyone got up and walked over. You watch with new found fear as the obviously brawny Hyena approached. His muscles weren't as defined as Free-Wind, but rather they were covered in a layer of fat, giving him a larger, more imposing appearance. His belly rippled with each step he took and he wore a loin cloth that was stained with various blotches of brownish red spots and smears. Free-Wind smiled at the fellow Hyena, who gave him a clap on the shoulder in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I heard my name Free-Wind, do you want to Fight?\" He said in a dull deep voice, saying the statement in a way of greeting instead of a threat. Free-Wind stood up and embraced his friend, pressing their bodies in full body hug. Free-Wind's sheath was pressed into the fabric of Fights-Anyone's loincloth, his sheath smothering you from behind the fabric. Being so close to the loincloth let you deduce the stains were in fact blood stains, and if you remembered correctly, this particular Hyena gets in fight's constantly, and when he wins he dabs his loincloth onto a bloody nose or cut of his beaten opponent, taking it as a trophy. The reason they were hugging in such a passionate manner as well was due to them being blood-brothers or even mates possibly. As you still continued to be pressed into the loincloth, muffled cries could be heard from somewhere past the fabric. Before you call out however, they broke the embrace, and you watched the bulge behind the loincloth slide out of your range, and with it the cries for help. Free-Wind spoke high above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No need for that my Friend, no I was just explaining to my new pet here that you were a worthy adversary for his friends that I assume you just ate.\" Free-Wind stated, gesturing to you. Fights-Anyone looked down at you and blinked before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha ha ha as if! I'm pretty sure their battle cry was something like 'Please don't kill me!'. Truly brave, that. If it's any condolence, they aren't dead yet, I can feel them still kicking in here.\" He said slapping his belly. \"And of course there's the two I got marinating right now for a later snack.\" Fights-Anyone said, lifting up his loincloth and exposing his large sheath and balls. His other hand reached down and rubbed at the top of his balls and bottom of his sheath. \"They're too deep to see on the surface, but the two most squirmy earned the right to stay under my knot tonight, They will no doubt taste amazing in the morning.\" He said with a toothy grin, letting his loincloth cover up his crotch again. You gagged at the thought of how he treated your kind, like candy it seemed. Fights-Anyone dropped to one knee, his nose inches from your face as he inhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You smell sweet little guy, I bet you'd taste amazing.\" He said as his tongue went up underneath Free-Wind's balls and up his sheath before the large pink muscle plastered you in saliva. A quiver ran through Free-Wind as the tongue retreated, a strand of saliva connecting it with you as he stood back up to full height, severing it finally. \"You're good, but not ripe yet.\" He jested before pressing a fist to Free-Wind's chest and walking away, His enormous back and ass contorting and shifting with each of his foot falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He like's ya!\". Free-Wind said, as if that was a good thing. Free-Wind looked longingly after Fights-Anyone before reclaiming his spot on the stump and continuing his stories with Broken-Fang and Many-Knives. The saliva cooled quickly as did the night air, and you soon found yourself shivering uncontrollably, your upper half at least. You look down at the lips holding you, and grimace, thinking about the two poor souls at the bottom of Fights-Anyone's sheath. The cold was getting unbearable though and you needed shelter. With deep inhale, you attempt to wiggle deeper into the plump sheath of Free-Wind. He feels your struggle and relaxes his grip, letting you slide in with gravity alone all of a sudden. You are enveloped in darkness and musk as you...</span></div></div>",

He typically was known for his short temper and he quickly dealt with people who have wronged him, sometimes personally executing them on the spot. This cruel justice was not biased as human servants suffered the brunt of this. Being a figure of power, Remius delighted in playing with his human servants and slaves, and not really watching out for them as he went about his day. Half a dozen humans perish in the Royal Palace daily, and almost all of them were from Remius. He would crush them, eat them, shove them into his orifices, or call over an anthro slave or servant and have them do something with a human. You had been at the palace for a month now, and somehow had managed to survive despite being classified as one of the Emperors body slaves, which had the shortest longevity of any servant in the palace. You were respected by almost all the other servants in the palace, and even some of the royal guard had taken note of your resilience. Despite this, Emperor Remius still hadn't acknowledged you or was even aware he had a human body slave that has tended him for over a month and was still kicking...until one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You scrubbed as hard as you could muster on the wooden surface, the smell of Varnish burning your nostrils. You worked in silence with three other slaves nearby, working on the same task as you, which was maintenance on Remius's favorite balcony chair. You weren't exactly assigned this work by him, as you were all body slaves, but he had forgotten to bring you all with him as he got up and went elsewhere, and a passing guard assumed you were there to clean and maintain so he had fetched some varnish and given it to you. One slave threw down his rag and cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is pointless! Why are we even trying! We all know all of us will be dead within a week, might as well enjoy our time as long as we can.\" He said looking around at you and the other two slaves. No one spoke or made eye contact with him, as to get tied up with his treacherous act would mean death also, there were ears everywhere in the palace. The slave speaking out, as well as you and the others wore nothing but a subligaculum, a leather loincloth that wrapped around you to make a brief like cover. Most slaves walked around in one, but other inhabitants either wore flowing robes, armor, or nothing(Like Remius). The slave looked at the others and scoffed when suddenly all of you were cast in shadow. You all look up to see a Ram in a silver and gold breastplate looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Slaves, his majesty is looking for you and is quite displeased, come with me now.\" The Ram said in a professional manner, outstretching an open palm for you all to climb into. You and the other two go with no questions asked, but the outspoken one stood there with his arms crossed. He looked up at the Ram and spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm no slave, I'm a prisoner. And besides, his 'majesty' got up and left us on the arm rest here, knowing damn well we can't get down from here and follow, if he wants me he had to come back and get me.\" He says, not moving. You blink, watching this spectacle, this man had to be insane. The Ram tensed up beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You forget your place maggot, and if you weren't requested right now i would smash you to paste under my heel. But rather, I will let his majesty deal with you himself.\" The Ram said, grabbing the rebellious slave and yanking him up with his free hand, making him let out a painful cry. You were carried down a couple halls and past many open rooms before you were brought into one that had a large ottoman bed in the center where Remius lay propped up on one elbow, his sculpted nude body displayed to the room. Two Royal guard were at the back at the room, playing some kind of game with marbles, they could be distinguished from other guards by their gilded gold armor with emeralds inlaid in the breastplate and a forest green cape hanging from their shoulders. One of them was a White horse and the other was a Red Fox, Aegis and Maximus if you remembered correctly. A bull and wolf slave stood on the other end of the room with hands clasped waiting to be called upon. Remius paid no mind as the Ram soldier approached him, as he was caught up in a gladiator fight happening in front of him. A Rhino was swinging a spear wildly at a Tiger, who was using just a sword to parry the jabs, they were both only in subligaculum as well, and their muscles swelled with severe use, sweat gleamed off of them and the tiger had a gash that was bleeding a good amount underneath his right eye. The soldier gave them a wide berth and approached Remius, The Royal Guard paid no heed but you knew they were ready to pounce if he was an assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here are your Body Slaves your Holiness.\" The ram said bowing his head and placing you and the other two on the edge of the ottoman, while dropping the rebel on his butt closer to Remius. The Emperor didn't look over but waved the Soldier away, who left the room in an instant. You didn't hesitate as you walked past the rebel slave and dropped to a knee and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We are here at your call my lord, permission to service you?\" You say keeping your head bowed but eyes up to watch for a somatic response. Rather, Remius turned and looked at you with a peculiar smile and actually spoke directly to you, a rare thing for him to do to a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My my, someone knows exactly how I like it, rarely does a slave perform my required etiquette before engaging me. You must be well trained, unlike most of these captives that they bring to tend me. Tell me Slave, what market do you hail from so that I may request more of you?\" He says with a smile that warmed and chilled you at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The same market as all before my Lord, I just have been in your service for a month now and watched where others failed, I took my time to see what you preferred and what invited your wrath.\" You say keeping your head down still. A chuckle escaped Remius, a sound rarely heard as it made the Gladiators stop and the Royal guard to pause in their game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Truly? So this means you are a veteran at tending me?\" He said in a jestful way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No my Lord, not in the slightest, but if you give me the opportunity I may become one given time.\" You say. Remius propped himself up a little more, his chest swelling as his muscles contorted under his shining short coat of cream and tan fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So be it, this is quite an interesting development, I was not aware one had lived so long under the duty of tending me. I will be more cordial with you and name you head of the body slaves, first of the title. Don't mess up now...er do you have a name?\". He asked politely. You hesitated, fearing this was all a jest and he was just going to kill you at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The only thing I have is my slave number, which is K390.\" You say sorrowfully. Remius clicked his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...you'll be Kay from now on, relish in the pleasure of being named by Emperor Remius, Kay.\" The Buck said, actually holding a smile for once, which instantly faded when the rebel spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All of our slave numbers start with a letter, am I M now? You don't get to-\". The rebel was suddenly lifted high in the air and held in front of Remius, who frowned at the slave in between his thumb and index. He glanced at the gladiators who still stood there staring and they flinched under his gaze, instantly resuming their fight and filling the room with clatter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You deplorable insect, you misunderstand. Kay gets a name because he proved himself. You get nothing because you are nothing.\" As Remius speaks you notice his sheath relax and slide back as his pale, pink member erected itself over you and the other two body slaves. You whisper back to them, taking on your new role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lesson one, don't speak unless spoken to during work, only when introducing or moving to a tender location for confirmation. Breaking rules equals death.\". You say somberly. Remius continued releasing his cock, the member dwarfing all of you as he rolled onto his back and inserted the rebel up to his neck in his cock head. The rebel, who was indeed crazy spat insults at the Buck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You Royal Bastard, you killed my country! You won't kill me! I'll kill you! I will aven-!\". He was cut off as Remius placed his thumb on the rebels head and let his dick consume him, a bulge slowly drifted down the length of the cock, wriggling the whole way before disappearing into the folds of the sheath at its base. Remius rolled back on his side and continued watching the fight, after a couple seconds he moaned as one of his enormous balls showed signs of life inside them, muffled screams and curses barely reached your ears as Remius rubbed his balls almost lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fret not slave, for just as your country was absorbed into my empire, your body will be absorbed into mine. So enjoy the hallucinatory madness that envelops you as you are slowly digested by my balls over the next few weeks.\" He said before leaning back into his original position to continue watching his entertainment. A whimper escaped one of the slaves behind you, causing the Buck to look at you and them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Kay? Get to work, I feel the inside of my sheath may need tending, my feet are a tad sore, and my hole may require service.\" He said before looking back onto the fight. You blink before ordering the two slaves to tend to the other two regions as you tend to...</span></div></div>",

You had only been in his ass once and he seemed pleased enough to let you back out, a reward that others that ventured there rarely received. You turned to the remaining two slaves, one of which seemed to have soiled himself from Remius's display, which you really couldn't blame him. There was a common belief in this empires culture that a male anthro consuming a human with his member and digesting them led to strong offspring, so many medical shops sold live humans for that sole purpose, a terrible way to go, but one of many in this cruel world. Remius just did it for pleasure and the rush of power it gives. You point at the soiled one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You tend to the Great One's feet, you don't seem fit to tend his majesty's private regions, and you.\" You say now pointing at the other one who seemed nearly about to soil himself. \"You will climb into his supreme sheath and tend its walls, remember, the goal is not to cleanse but to please, body slaves seem to forget this and it leads to their demise. He is able to cleanse himself and takes insult if you assume you can to better.\" You say before turning and walking across the cotton sheaths towards the monolithic monarch laying on his side ahead, still watching the gladiators. After a few steps you didn't hear anything and turned around to see the other two still standing there, looking grim. You blink and then hiss through your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you doing? Loitering leads to death!\" You say taking another step back towards them. The one who was assigned to Remius's crotch spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It all leads to death, why are you even trying? We are literally deemed parasites, to cling to this buck until he grows tired of our scratching and rubbing and ends us in a uncaring fashion.\" He said glumly. They didn't seem to notice but you could feel cold green eyes on your back, Remius was watching to see how you handled this, or at least was wondering why he still wan't being tended. You cross you arms and ignore the beads of sweat forming on your skin and calmly respond to the gloomy man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Better to have a quick death by being crushed unknowingly rather than being digested in a pool of seed for weeks like rebel is going to suffer. It's bleak but it's life, die now or later, your choice.\" You say, knowing it was not the best morale booster, but it seemed to be enough to get them moving. Gloomy and Soiled looked at each other before trudging off for their respective positions. You take a deep breath and turn around to see Remius smirking at you with an eyebrow raised, before mouthing the words 'We'll talk later'. You bow before walking underneath the arm propping up his elbow and rounding to where his large back was to your right. Muscles contorted and flexed softly beneath his shining coat and you couldn't help but admire what a magnificent specimen he was. Looking down the length of his back, a docked bushy tail stood erect and pressed against his lower back, the underside faced outwards towards the two royal guards that were at a table a few meters from the ottoman bed. Past the tail was your destination, two enormous globes of flesh with a deep crack running between them. Remius's Left hand was resting on top of the upper cheek in a relaxed state as he continued to watch the gladiators fight, the hand slowly rubbing his fleshy mound obviously admiring one of his most famous features. His ass was usually accentuated in many statues and paintings, as well as his scrotum and pecs, having these three features in a large and refined state was a status symbol in the empire, and the Emperor was not lacking anywhere. You took another deep breath and slid down the slope that Remius's weight created on the cushions. When you bumped into the spongy flesh of his ass, the muscle under the fatty layer twitched and Remius looked back at you and smiled before sliding his left hand slide down and gripped his cheek, pulling it up and exposing more skin that his crack had obscured. You looked up into the abyss, still not seeing your destination, but Remius's eagerness to accept you into it will speed up the process. You place both hands on the steep incline of the lower cheek and crawl your way up and into the Buck's ass crack, when you were a good ways in, Remius let go of his grip and the cheek settled back into place with a muffled slapping sound. Now in total darkness you crawled towards your destination, the fur getting more thin the further you went. Remius was surprisingly being gentle with you, as if something was crawling in your ass, you'd have unconsciously clenched and restrained it. The air was filled with the stench of scented body oils and perfumes, hinting that Remius had recently bathed and cleaned himself up. But despite this the hint of his natural musk was in the back of your senses. Your observation was cut short as the your hands met a sudden steep incline filled with crevices that ran up until they met at a shallow uneven cavity that could no doubt be the Emperor's holy sphincter. The cheeks diveted near it, which made a small pocket that you could slide up onto your knees within. You take a deep breath and reached out in the darkness, your hands meeting the cavity and running their ways to either side of it. The walls shuddered in anticipation but the Emperor showed resolve and stayed relaxed. You leaned in and planted your face into the cavity, opening your mouth and working your tongue through its crevices, being the only being in the world that could bring an emperor to his knees and not be executed for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remius lifted a cheek to help Kay on his way to his hole, tantalizing at the thought of having him inside of his ass. He was already on a dominant streak, feeling the tiny rebel still thrashing blindly in his right nut, stimulating him and making him want to jerk him back out and consume him again. But no, He needed to perish and in the most humiliating way possible.The other two body slaves scurried to where Kay had ordered them, the one that seemed to have no hope scurried up onto Remius's inner right thigh and looked quizzically at the bundle of skin resting around the still exposed member of his Master, obviously trying to figure out some way not to become trapped in its depths. Remius watched him from the corner of his eye as the one he would call Gloom treaded uncomfortably across his groin, obviously unaware that his minuscule weight could still irritate his lord in his sensitive spots. Gloom halted and stared at the bulbous balls near him and seemed to watch in fear as the occasional bump from rebel could be seen, after a couple seconds his primate brain seemed to finally tell him that he shouldn't dally lest he end up there as well, and he proceeded to climb into the sheath lip against the towering member, disappearing from sight but not touch. Remius let out a soft groan as the human Gloom sank deeper into his cock pocket, squirming in a slightly panicked style to try to right himself. His enjoyment was halted when he caught the scent of fear piss on the air and looked to see the other human at about his knee, making his way for his lordly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\". Remius said quietly, as to not halt the gladiators who were taking to long to draw deep blood. The human whirled around and looked as if he heard the toll of death's bells. Remius continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are not in a worthy state to tend me, covered in your own excrement, Aortus!\". Remius said snapping his finger. The Grey wolf hurried over and bowed before him. Remius pointed at the one he decreed as Filth now.<br>\r\n\"Take him to the slave baths and clean him, then return him to me, quickly now.\" Remius said waving his hand. The wolf bowed deeper before plucking filth and taking him away, the stench following him. Remius huffed, and realized Kay was pretty far in and let go of his cheek, letting it drop with a satisfying weight to it. Just as he looked back at the gladiators the Tiger parried a Jab by the Rhino and slid his Gladius across his Thigh, cutting deep and dropping the Rhino to his knees. The Tiger spun his blade and brought it to his opponents throat before looking at the Emperor for judgement, his eyes going from Remius's face to his still exposed cock, to back to his face, swallowing. Remius smiled warmly, giving a thumbs up for the Tiger to spare his foe, who nodded before helping up the Rhino and leaving the room with him. Remius sighed, absently letting his left hand drift to his balls and rubbing them, causing more thrashing. A soft pressure deep between his cheeks made him gasp as Kay had finally found his mark. The human made a surprising impact on Remius's senses, and it took the Bucks full will not to begin jerking it outright. He panted lightly, wanting Kay to quit teasing and to get up inside him already, his hand drifted and let fingers graze his inner cheeks before...</span></div></div>",

The roar of a crowd sounded like distant thunder, and it crescendo-ed in what you assume was one of the performers executing the other. You tensed at the noise, wondering if it was your fellow cell mates demise that they cheered. You'd tended to half a dozen gladiators at this point, cleaning their wounds, keeping them company, and tending to other 'needs' as they requested, whatever kept them sane and happy. Human slaves sometimes found themselves in the job field of being gladiatorial caretakers, and it was honestly better than what other positions were out there. Besides the occasional caretaker being squashed or eaten, deaths in this field compared to other jobs were slim. doors opened and chains rattled as someone was being guided back to their cell, you sat up and scooted to the edge of the cot so you were visible. The cell door swung open and a wolf in roman style armor glanced at you before moving to the side to let the monstrous, muscular gladiator that was your current job lumber in. He was a good head taller than the wolf soldier, and only wore some armored greaves and a loincloth. He was a large...</span></div></div>",

Morum strutted into the room, undoing his belt and letting his loincloth drop to the floor, exposing his colossal junk to swing freely in the small space. The wolf soldier looked at it with huge eyes but kept a straight face. You noted the cut on Morums chest that was somewhat deep and still bleeding and his busted lip where he probably took the butt of a sword to the mouth. Morum was known for letting his opponent get a few hits to get his confidence up before Morum either gutted him with his horns or just broke them with his large hands. You got up and ran to the other end of the cot where a needle and thread were ready to go for you to sew him up. As you ran across the cot, Morums eye glanced at you and he let a smile grow across his face, before he turned and began talking to the wolf, continuing an apparent conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway Warrus, I took out his eye with my horn then uppercut him with my hammer before bringing it back down on his chest. Blood shot out of his mouth like a fountain, quite proud of myself.\" Morum said sitting down on the cot, his moon sized cheeks came close to landing on you, air ruffled your straw clothes as they made impact. You showed little reaction because you had been working with Morum for a year now, and he loved you messing with his butt and teasing you with it. He knew what he was doing though and purposefully missed, but also was indicating he'd want attention back there later. His tail lashed as he eased himself on his back, his hands finding his groin and he rubbed at it while groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to say though, that raccoon must've known I'm packing downstairs because he was quick to kick me there. Hey doc I may need you to go inside the boys later and check for damage.\" He said turning his head towards you, his breath washing over your small frame and dampening you as you prepared the needle by sterilizing it in a candle. You looked over your shoulder at the enormous face of the bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm I'm sure you're fine in there Morum, last time I went in you took me into the next match you had, if I recall me bouncing around in there got you a boner and that gazelle almost cut your dick off. So if I do, you better get me out asap.\" You say finishing the needle and climbing up his arm and hopping across to his enormous pec, the muscle was swollen from the trauma and use. Before Morum could retort you began lancing the needle over the wound, which was wide enough that if you weren't careful you could fit in the gash. Morum hissed as did his skin from the still hot needle, you made quick work and asked the guard to seal it for you and he obliged. After he helped, he left, locking the door behind him. Morum groaned, his fingers coming up to explore the wound but you slapped them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Morum, leave it alone. I don't need your dirty fingers rubbing all over it.\" You say standing over the cut defiantly, the hands hovered for a second before they drifted down and started groping his sheath and balls while moaning. Jeez these guys get so laced up on testosterone that murder and sex are the only things on their mind. Morum growled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc....I need you inside me, somehow please...I just killed a guy, I'm so pumped and I need a release.\" He said throwing his head back as his cock snaked its way out of his sheath. You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok, just be careful.\" You say, fingers grabbing you before you had finished speaking and pulled you towards his...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The sun was causing you to blister as you had been exposed to it for a good 8 hours. Most of the humans that were brought out to market with you had been sold. Some were taken into careful hands, others yanked skyward screaming, and some unlucky bastards just popped in some mouth without a second thought. You should probably be freaked out, but it was such a daily occurrence that you weren't fazed by it anymore. Other humans lounged around in the wooden barred crate as Your owner advertised you all with glee, he had made a killing today and was down to only four or five of you. You looked over the last few, some of them may have been half siblings, though you were unsure, family wasn't really a concept in this life, best not get attached to someone who had a 50/50 chance of even being around tomorrow. You glance back up at your master, who was some scrawny lizard that bred humans just to make a profit on them, there were probably three other breeders within spitting distance of his stall, but that didn't stop the huge demand that consumers(some in the literal sense) caused in their buy up of man flesh. A shadow passed over you and you let out a sigh of relief as you look up to see who was the blessing that blocked out the afternoon sun. Your gaze ran up a midnight black stomach and chest to see a Jackal that may as well be the god of death Anubis himself. Your mouth dropped open as the beings golden eyes expertly inspected the last half dozen humans in the crate with you before the gaze locked onto your form. He deftly snapped you up between two fingers and deposited you into his palm where he gently but firmly rolled you around, inspecting your nude form with deft precision, you'd had it done to you before but it always was degrading, but you're a slave so no one cares. His eyes left you and looked down on the smaller lizard who stammered out a welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-why noble Kairon, so nice to see you've deemed us worthy to be blessed with your presence today, I must apologize, if I had known you were coming down this evening I wouldn't have let my best stock walk off with the common rabble.\" The Lizard brown nosed. He was usually feisty and would've gone off on someone who had handled one of his humans without showing coin first, but from what little you've heard Kairon was head of the Anukmhet family, and they had a third of the city in their pocket. Kairon waved a dismissive hand at the compliments and turned you over again so that you were staring him in the eyes. His voice came out like Thunder that was made of silk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't intend to come, but there was business to attend to and recently I've felt a strange itch to get myself a little pocket friend.\" The Jackal said, your heart skipped a beat, being a pet to someone of this stature is one of the best positions a human could hope to achieve, it had its own dangers but at least it wasn't a fight pit or someones stomach. The lizard chuckled nervously and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...And that one...he suits you?\"He said cautiously, not wanting to offend, no matter how small it may be. The Jackal huffed, his thumb descending and stroking your head, you held still, a natural prey reflex as the eyes of a large predator were on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm unsure, he seem's....docile. I want one that will catch me off guard, stir up a life a little for me.\" The Jackal said, making you tense up. The lizard came to your defense unknowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pssh that one does everything I tell him NOT to do, if that's what you're looking for, that's the one you want my lord.\" The lizard said truthfully. A small smile appeared at the corner of Kairon's mouth as he brought the palm against his muscled stomach and quickly quizzed the Lizard on your health and then tossed a gold piece at him, which caused the Lizards eyes to light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-My lord! He's only twenty copper, you might as well take the rest of them and then some!\" The Lizard called out as Kairon turned away. The Jackal didn't look back at the Lizard as he responded his families motto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anukmhets only deal in gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... You stayed silent, as did Kairon as he ascended the steps to his villa, walking silently past servants and a couple other Jackals that were similar to him except for height and bulk. He eventually entered a wing that you assumed was his private bath house and sleeping quarters as a pool in the ground steamed with candles lit around it. He set you down at the lip of the pool and walked over to his wardrobe where he slipped out of the simple garb he was wearing and took a moment to let the cooling evening air dance on his short coat. He was well muscled, his back rippled with it, leading down to some defined, large glutes that thrummed with strength above thighs that could probably crush boulders. He turned and began to walk towards the tub, and you got to observe his front as well, starting with pecs the size of a small human village, and abs that were like a plain of ebony. Below he was well endowed with a fat sheath and bulbous balls that could probably repopulate the planet before running out of juice. His paws sent echoing plaps throughout the marble halls and soon enough he stepped over you and settled into the bath without a word. His head drifted back with his eyes closed and a long breath escaped him as if he had held it all day. One eye opened and settled on you, and he spoke directly at you for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I envy you in a way human, you don't need to deal with the daily image and renown that I have to uphold. You live day to day, with a sense of acceptance that it may be your last on Sedimar, and you are...ok with that. Me? I have to lead my family to greater heights, threaten some merchants, and stay on the good side of the other houses that rule this city. Life is hard.\" He said closing his eyes again. You frowned, that wasn't the way you saw the world, you wanted to live, the fact that he just wrote you off like if he just smooshed you right now you'd be okay with it bothered you immensely. So you did like the Lizard said you would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh boohoo I have lots of money and free will, but yeah the one inch tall tasty human that was marketed at only twenty copper and is now stuck here listening to that has it way easier.\" You say crossing your arms. Kairons eyes snapped open and rolled to look at you, his mouth forming an expression of surprise before it broke into a smile and he let out a belly laugh that resounded down the halls. A servant passing through looked at his lord mortified as if he had just heard his death sentence, The servant that was a goat glanced and noticed you next to the pool and blinked before running out of the room. After a few more seconds Kairon calmed and wiped some tears from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh dear that Lizard wasn't lying, you're perfect, I was not expecting that. Most bow their heads or agree with me, no one ever talks back, but a human that can die by me sitting on him has the nerve to say that to me, ME, a god in this city. Oh boy we are gonna have a time together Quip.\" He said sliding up and crossing his arms on the pool lip and resting his head on them to stare at you. You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Err...Quip? I guess that works since I don't have a name, I could've thought of something better but you're the boss-\" You begin to say only to be cut off by him laughing some more. His eyes locked onto you and you swore he was analyzing every speck of grime on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are quite the filthy little thing, get in here.\" And with a sudden flash you were in his hand and being lowered into the rose scented water and being scrubbed by gentle hands. as he did so the Jackal lifted himself out of the pool and sat on the lip as he bathed you to have better control. When he decided you were done he plopped you on his thigh and let out another sigh. \"I don't want to leave this room for the rest of the night Quip, I don't feel like putting on the mask, so instead I'm just gonna talk, and you're gonna listen.\" He said, a hand absently scratching his balls and letting them drop back to the stone with a meaty plop. You glanced at the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not like I have a choice anyway.\"You say looking up his muscular torso at his face, which gave off one of those genuine smiles again. And so he just talked and you gave your two cents on matters or what he was thinking and he valued your thoughts, the talk went through the evening and close to midnight before Kairon...</span></div></div>",

His purple eyes quickly observed progress on ongoing projects, some of them containing other humans. Eventually he reached you his gaze locking on to your own and a cold smile formed and he bared his fangs at you. He spoke, his voice icy. \"Well human, I'd say it's high time we begin shall we? Let me first introduce myself, I'm Veris, I'm the king's advisor and Sorcerer, I specialize in cryomancy and onomancy. And you-\" He said tapping the glass. \"Are going to be my new assistant. The rest of the lot I bought are guinea pigs. Fail to comply with me and you'll end up next to them.\" He said finally, you gulped visibly. The Wolf clasped his hands together, and you saw snowflakes fly out from the action. He cleared his throat a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now do you have any questions before we begin, this'll be the only time for the rest of the day I'll tolerate questions.\" Veris said continuing his cold grin. You glanced around nervously and said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Um, two for now. What are my duties as your assistant and...why are you naked?\" You say wincing expecting to get squished instantly. A warm chuckle filled the room and you glanced back at the wolf who answered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're expected to maintain the humans I keep, deliver messages to the other keeps residents at my discretion, and tend to my more...personal needs. To answer the second one....I'm a free spirit, and the cold around here is doesn't really get to me.\" He said opening your container and plucking you out and setting you on the counter. You yourself were wearing a cotton shirt and laced pants and nothing else. Your eyes looked straight ahead and noticed you were mere inches from the monolithic sheath and scrotum of your new master, you turned red. The Wolf chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No need to be so flustered student, you can admire me and appreciate me all you'd like, as long as it doesn't interfere your duties, although...\" He said turning around, His ass the size of the moon loomed around and smashed into the counter as he leaned on it, you fell on your buff and scooted back frantically, avoiding his globular cheeks that seemed all to eager to claim you. \"Your duties will involve my body the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You furrowed your brow that he said 'student' rather than 'servant'.

The wolf continued. \"You'll find bread crumbs and water thimbles over on the table near the door. Also don't talk to the ones you interact with, just give them what they need and move on, I don't need you to become a martyr on your first day.\" The wolf said walking over to a desk and dropping into it with grace, his tail waving absently, causing more snowflakes to occasionally drift from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh and walk to where Veris had been sitting on the table, and as soon as you reached the edge, translucent stairs sprung into existence leading to the floor. You blink and look back towards the wolf who didn't look bothered or seem to notice the sudden conjuration. You shyly put a foot out and found the staircase solid enough to hold your weight. You make your way down and as soon as you step off the last step the staircase dissipated. You blinked, then shook your head and continued towards the table near the door. When you neared it another staircase sprung into existence, and despite quite the climb you made it easily to the top where a basket around your size full of bread chunks and a anthro thimble modified into a human bucket waited for you. You tethered the basket to your back and picked up the bucket and looked for the first subject. You could see a human form hunched over in a similar container to the one you came from on the table on the other side of the door frame. Just as you thought a bridge would be nice, one sprang forth between your table and the next one, appearing as a swaying rope bridge. You made it across and peered at the human in the container and swallowed. The man was nude and thin, and he clutched an arm that was black with frostbite up to the elbow. His wild eyes shot up and locked on yours and all you could see the drive of prey deep within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you, you were in the human market with me...looks like you're free, get me out of here!\" He whispered frantically. You looked down and noticed two thin chutes worked in the glass, one with a bowl on the other side of it within the container. You knew this was a test by the sorcerer, he was most likely listening right now though he looked focused on the scroll at his desk. What you did now determined if you lived or became this man. Without hesitating you dropped a chunk of bread down one chute and poured water down the one with the bowl. The man looked down at the supplement and then back at you his eyes now sunken.\"I see...\" he said gravely and just sank to his knees sobbing. You winced and turned away. You repeated the scenario nine more times, with some screaming at you, while others just stared passed you, their spirit already dead. Finally you came upon your first corpse, it was a woman laying on her back, and where her heart was, an ice shard the color of blood shot out of her chest, her face locked into a face of anguish. You turned green and fell to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please don't spoil my work station human, you'll see many more gruesome sights then this being here I promise.\" You jump and turn to see Veris bent over at the hip, his hands clasped behind his back staring at the woman with cold eyes, his head above you and to the right slightly. His eye drifts down to you, and studies you with the same cold gaze. You just stared back, remembering the statement about questions only being answered in the beginning, and after a minute he broke into another cold smile and said. \"Good, you burn with questions, but you're tempered with restraint, these are good signs that you'll prosper as more than just an assistant here, human.\" He said straightening and walking back to his desk. You look up and see the container was open. You put down the basket and thimble and thought of a ladder and lo and behold one sprang into existence on the outside and inside of the container in the same translucent material. You climbed into the container and walked up to the woman, and bent down and closed her eyes. You next gripped the dark red ice and broke it off an inch from her sternum and slung her over your shoulder, she was terribly light. After getting her out of the container you looked around and saw in the corner of the room was a patch of dirt where no stone was. As you made your way there you grabbed a small mixing spoon and when you reached the dirt you dug a grave, before burying the woman and said a few words over her. As you did you were thrown in shadow and you looked up to see you master's nude form looming over you, one of his paws were mere inches from you and you hadn't even sensed it getting there. He spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You've done what you're told, you listen to what I say, and you respect those who others seem to ignore. Well done, student.\" You blink again, and the wolf plucked you up to eye level. \"When walking the market a few days ago, I sensed a string of magic emanating from some humans that you were a part of, I thought it wasn't possible that a human could have an affinity for magic but of course curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't pinpoint which human had the affinity and i was on a schedule so I bought a couple dozen humans, I needed test subjects anyway and unfortunately humans are the easiest and most responsive to my work. Needless to say I isolated you within a day, and am curious and eager to see what kind of magic you can handle.\" He said smiling, you stared in disbelief, if you had magic, and could learn it...then you could escape, and may be the only human in the world that could be a threat to Anthros everywhere. Veris's eyes studied you and his grin grew more feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahhhh, so the first thing you plan is vengeance on us? Careful pupil, your eyes are windows to your goal. I could bite your head off or freeze you now and not even bother with teaching and learning your skills. I may be playing with fire here but I'm willing to turn you into a tool of mine. Now-\" Veris said but was cut off as his lab door flung open and the wolf spun in a growl. He gripped you in a fist but was careful not to crush the life out of you. Standing in the door was a Bull, his form filling the doorway and his horns scrapping the top of the frame. he wore colors of forest green and gold, a blossoming tree was the sigil he wore on his surcoat. He furrowed his brow at Veris, taking in the sight of the naked wolf, and his vision drifted to you in his clutch. The bull cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Veris, the king requires your council, please be sure to dress yourself this time when you meet him, he has company, and don't give me the 'nudity is best when working with the arts' crap. Leave your plaything here as well, I might get hungry.\" The bull said licking his lips. Veris snarled but straightened back into his regal stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course, Tauric, but I warn you Bull, my test subjects are quite flushed with all manner of ailments, I can't promise that you won't be leaking blood from your ass after a few hours.\" The Wolf said walking to his desk and placing you down on it and grabbing a white robe nearby and nothing else, tying it closed and holding his arms out at the bull for his satisfaction, who still looked wary and weighing the risk of bleeding out of his ass. The bull shook his head and waited for Veris to walk out before shutting the door, leaving you alone except for the other subjects. This was another test you knew, he could've held you, but he was giving you the opportunity to try and escape, or stay and learn. You knew he'd find you, besides, being one of a kind as a human sorcerer could have a multitude of benefits. So you decide to....</span></div></div>",

So you looked around the desk to occupy yourself until Veris returned. Ironically, or planned, a book lay open on the table that discussed the channeling of magics through meditation and focus. It gave detailed descriptors on how to summon forth your reserves of the arcane power. You followed along, crossing your legs and focusing on your breathing. After a few minutes you began to feel something, you opened your eyes and seized the feeling, and suddenly you fell through the table, as if it wasn't even there in the first place. You scream as you tumbled towards the stone floor below, letting go of the feeling as you fell. Before you hit the ground however a force caught you, leaving you suspended in the air. You blink and turn to see Veris smiling widely in the door way before bending a finer in his outstretched hand and bringing you toward him with telekinesis. You stop about 2 feet from him at chest level and he takes off the robe he had donned for his audience with the King, exposing his sculpted snow white form to the dim room once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remarkable, not only are you flushed with magic, but you are a Transmuter as well!\" He said reaching out a palm and dropping you in it. \"This means you can learn the tricks of phasing, flying, and maybe even altering yourself as well as others.

He wore some Silver leggings that hugged his muscular legs, showing off their definition and size. Between his thighs rested a large bulge that shifted at his slightest move. He wore a jacket that screamed military aesthetic as it had ribbed golden thread going down his torso. His face was two toned, with the top of his head being cyan and his chin and neck being cloud white, his eyes were blue but with a purplish glint in his iris. He sighed, his chest heaving against the jacket he wore, threatening to pop the buttons with his bulk. You looked around to find a way to contact him and saw beyond the chair his heavy tail lay still, a perfect ramp leading up to him. You trudged passed his enormous feet and under the canopy of his throne, which let out occasional groans as it held the insurmountable weight of its owner. You reached his tail and noted how fine his hide was, it felt warm and smooth to the touch, and the scales blended together so well that the texture almost looked like human skin, but felt very different.

The dragon blinked and leaned forward squinting at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What...is it, some kind of homunculus? If so it definitely came from the sorcerer kingdom Verpima. Dispose of it for me Dante, thank you for your vigilance.\" The dragon said leaning back again in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\" You shout, obviously startling everyone at your sudden outburst. \"I'm not a homunculus! I'm a human!\" You say. Clourax looks stunned, before speaking softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A homunculus that talks? This is grave news, no telling what other advancements in magics Verpima has made, I must make a declaration of war at once! Shalor, my paper an ink!\" The dragon said waving at the steward, who you now saw to be some badger. The lion shifted uneasily, which brought the dragons gaze back on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who sent you little one? Was it Gaz of the Gloom court? Or maybe Corronit the mad Dragon? Tell me and I promise not to kill you.\" The Dragon said smugly and leaning back in to look at you. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm not a homunculus, I'm a human!\" You say again, getting frustrated. The dragon furrows his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, humans are myths, little forest creatures that come to your windows at night and raid your pantry. Nice try homunculus but you'll have to do better than that.\" The Dragon said as his steward returned with a small table that had parchment and ink on it. Your mere minute interaction with the king was about to start a war that would probably kill thousands, you had to think of something fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you got me I'm a homunculus, but I wasn't sent here to kill you my lord!\" You say quickly your eyes darting around looking for a reason for you being here. The Dragon halted his hand from grabbing the quill, and looked at you with a smug smile curling up his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, though any idiot could see what you are, so tell me construct, why are you here?\" He said propping his chin up with his hand. You look at him, and then down at his large bulge that twitched as if on cue to your observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sent from Gaz as a gift to be your personal body servant! To help satisfy any need that arises!\" You say quickly. The lion holding you shifted uncomfortably and the steward raised his eyebrows. Clourax just smiled bigger, before standing up. He was a good head taller than the lion soldier that held you. He held out his hand and the lion put you into it. You look up at the wicked expression the dragon held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll test that right now, and if you fail to impress, Verpima can expect an army at their door, and you can't expect all the ways I know how to kill, especially something of your size.\" Clourax said before whisking you off to his private quarters. He throws you onto his bed as he shuts the door, and you recover in time to see him peeling off the jacket. His chest heaved at freedom, much larger now that it was out of those confines. Next he hooked a thumb in the leggings and eased out of them, exposing his junk to the room. His flacid cock was probably the size of a small bus, and his testicles the size of a small building. He stretched, turning around and giving you a first time look at his massive rear. He turned back around and smiled at you before laying down beside you, his junk flopping a few feet away from you as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see what you can do...\" You begin with </span></div></div>",

Not only that, but also that the room you were in was very dimly lit and there were a lot of people standing around. Though these people seemed to be all giant male anthros in different types of clothing. You even saw some walking around with trays in speedos with drinks on them or they were dancing around on poles which meant that they were clearly male dancers. And by the looks of it all of them had heavily muscled or massively muscled bodies that bulged or flexed with the slightest of movements underneath their fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you blush a dark red as they moved around the floor or on the various poles with easy grace despite their size and muscle mass which you thought was pretty impressive.

However, from how far away the bouncers were you knew it'd be really tough to get to them without hiding in various places along the way. And trying to get one of the patreons attention might be tricky as well since not only were there so many, but quite a few of them might be pretty buzzed or flat out drunk. So that would be even more dangerous since you had no idea how they might act when seeing you after some many drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so with this idea in your head you moved back a bit closer to one of the smaller pole dancer areas to not only stay out of sight, but to not get stepped on as you look around for certain male anthros to ask for help from. One that came to mind right away was a passing massively muscled white furred mouse who was wearing a light green speedo while a tray was in one of his large hands with empty glasses on it. And by the looks of it, it looked like he was heading towards the bar area to set the tray down. That would give you a chance to get his attention if timed right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you soon saw a massively muscled anthro male cheetah in a red jockstrap walk up and onto the small stage that you were underneath.

So while you canned the giant club area with very loud music and changing neon lights two giant anthro male bouncers stood out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a giant massively muscled tan furred rat who was standing over by the bar. And by the way his arms were crossed over his massive pecs obviously meant that he was there to make sure no one got too drunk and caused a problem for either the other workers there or any of the other patreons at the club.

You had read they were the largest kangaroo around but this was kind of an overkill in the size department. The creature let out another snore and tossed suddenly throwing the comforter to the side along with you. Darkness enveloped you as you got trapped up in the bundled bed sheet. After a few minutes of struggle you emerged back on top of the bundle, now a couple feet away from the roo, and you took in a breath at the true revealed size of the beast. He was probably the size of Godzilla or the like, that much could be said. He still lay on his back, his chest and arms adorned with large muscles that boasted that they saw a lot of use. His stomach was rather large and jiggled slightly at the minute movements he made in his sleep, but you didn't doubt muscle lay underneath that thick layer of fat. You say 'He' due to the monstrous bulge right below the stomach, wrapped behind a layer of cotton and spandex of gray boxer brief material, the size of his junk was easily compared to a small house back in your world. A huge thick tail emerged from underneath him from what looked like above his glutes, and the whole limb lay still save for the tip which twitched absently. Your observation continued to his monstrous legs, his thighs carrying hundreds if not thousands of tons of fat and muscle underneath his short coat. His legs ended on enormous, beastial feet that looked like a mix of a humans and a kangaroo, each digit on them looking capable of crushing a bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy shit...\" You say to yourself, what were you looking at? And should you risk contacting this monster? Does he even speak your language? You take in a deep breath and begin marching for his tail, you imagined you could scale that with a bit of ease, and then try to grab the boxer-brief material to scale on top of him. How to get his attention without being crushed or eaten or whatever is next on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were right in your in the regard to scale the tail then the boxer briefs, as within 10 minutes of heading out you were looking at the mountain of stomach emerging from the waistband and stretching to the horizon.

You flew over the creamy expanse of the Roo's gut and chest and stopped a hundred or so feet from his enormous head. The head turned and sleepy...human like eyes opened to focus on you, they were a deep green. After a second the eyes shot open and the Roo let out a gasp, as if scared of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE SHIT?!\" He exclaims and drops you, he had pulled himself upwards to try and get away from you and you plummeted to what you thought was your death. A super pliable and soft surface caught you and you realized you had landed on his impressive belly. Upon landing there the Roo froze as if you'd kill him if he moved. You got to your knees and looked the fear stricken 'monster' in the eyes and upon realizing you were looking at him he began to mutter softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, oh shit. I hate bugs, I hate bugs.\" You were about to actually laugh, when an obvious thing became obvious to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak english?\" You ask loudly. The Kangaroo stops breathing and his large ears shoot up to radar in on your voice. His face went from fear to curiosity and he leaned in to get a better look at you.

He scratched at his head like it hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck, no more straight Everclear, I've gotta be hallucinating, yup this is all the hangover...\"He said groggily without taking his eyes off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everclear?

You shifted only to realize you were still standing on his gut, your feet sinking a good bit into the short haired flesh. It seemed uncomfortable to you, but the Roo seemed to not care, hell he was still just laying in his underwear and having a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...yeah I'm gonna have to say that I'm a bit useless to you buddy.

Sorry for bothering you Mr. Kangaroo.\" You say as you look around for the best way down off his belly. As you were doing that he threw his hands up to pacify your retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, slow down there lil' guy, you probably don't wanna do that. There's no telling what can happen to you out there, this town is pretty rough for people my size. You? You'll just be a stain on someones foot in no time. Just...stay here for a bit and I can fill you in on this place, this...world.\" He said passively. You stared back up at him, and beyond the glazed look of hangover, you saw a semblance of humanity in his green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...ok, I guess I'll take you up on that offer Mr. Kangaroo.\" You say, cheering up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The names Mason lil' guy, now how about we get some food? I'm pretty hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's your name? To be honest I like lil' guy better, pretty fitting if I have to say.\" The big Marsupial said. You thought it was a little demeaning but so far this guy was an ally, so whatever kept him on the good side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can call me that.\" You say cheerfully, and got a grunt in acknowledgement from the titanic mammal. You were standing on an island in the middle of his kitchen, watching him go about making some colossal sandwich. He deemed clothes not necessary, so he was still moving around in the tight boxer briefs, advertising his package and huge ass to his home. This man was confident in himself, or just lacked decency. You for one found the whole sight queer, watching him move on his large feet while his tail lashed lazily from side to side to adjust so he could keep balance. After a minute he opened the fridge across from you and bent over to grab something, and his rear came mere inches from your position, casting you in shadow and just hammering home how suddenly insignificant you were. Mason stood back up, cracking a beer he had pulled out and took a large swig, none the wiser that he just shoved his ass in your face. He picked up the sandwich and took a bite from it, then leaned on the counter while talking with his mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you come from 'Earth', well we call this rock 'Sedimar'. It sounds like humans are your only dominant species, well we have hundreds on here. Mammals , Reptiles, some Avians, it's a real shit show. You can imagine racism and stereotypes run rampant and believe me it does, but somehow we make it work these days, used to be real bad back in the dark ages.\" He said taking another bite of sandwich. You were about to ask about the other races when you noticed something about his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you eating meat? I thought kangaroos were Herbivores.\" You ask innocently. He made a sour face and scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, not here, I wanna say almost everyone on the planet are omnivores and carnivores, no one really is on the Vegetarian train around here. That's probably another reason to stay here for a time. Hell when I found out you weren't a bug a primal instinct wanted me to pop you in my mouth.\" He said taking another, more exaggerated bite. You turned green, not just from the thought that for a moment you could've been devoured by this monster, but because he just told you so carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see, and why didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're really small, and you're intelligent and honestly kinda cute. My consciousness would've haunted me if I ate you, so instead here you are talking to me and not playing roommate with this sandwich.\" He said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a straightforward guy Mason. Thanks for not eating me.\" You say, meaning for it to be sarcastic but it came out honest. \"So...is it normal for you to stay in your underwear when you have company over?\" You say. Mason blinked then looked down, as if noticing for the first time how under dressed he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest I thought I at least had sweats on, but at the same time I wasn't expecting company and it is MY apartment. Also everyone knows you're packing something under all the cloth, so why do we even bother hiding it?\" He said popping the rest of the sandwich in his mouth and looking at you with a rebellious expression. \"Anyway like I said, I don't think you should expose yourself to anyone, I'll see if I can find any news and such on your kind popping up or any kind of science stuff going on that may have brought you here. Until then you're gonna be stuck with me.\" He said casually. You grimaced but you didn't have a choice really, this guy kind of had control over you now. It could be way worse though. Despite your better judgement you were beginning to really like Mason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sounds good to me, so what do we do now?\" You ask, expecting you both to begin searching the streets for evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now? Now we spend my day off playing a game that just came out.\" He said polishing off his beer and pressing a hand to his belly, letting out a belch before plucking you off the counter and putting you on his shoulder. You scramble to grab his fur to hold on as he chuckles and pulls out another couple of beers from the fridge and retreats to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason! I wanna get home, no offense but I like when things are my size!\" You yell up at him, making him wince and to flick his ear that was facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill lil' guy, I can hear you just fine without the yelling. Like I said, I can't really do anything so just hang out with me and relax.\" he said sitting down onto an extremely worn futon that had seen many years of its owners ass on it. You grumbled and crossed your arms as Mason booted up the game and began to play. For thirty minutes  you sat watching him play some shooter game, feeling your hope drain again. It was when you looked down you saw a chance to do something. Mason's tail was looping around his rear and ran parallel with his leg down off the couch, pressed close to his body. Wedged between his tail and pressed against his right cheek was a smartphone that you hadn't noticed before, he must've picked it up the same time he grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason can I use your phone to look for news about my kind?\" You say looking back at him. He didn't look at you but grumbled a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just don't text or call anyone, and forewarning I have no idea what may be open on the browser right now so don't say I didn't tell you.\" After he said that he waited for him to move you and the phone off to the side, but he kept gaming like you were able to do it yourself. After a couple of seconds you huffed out a thanks and walked down his clavicle and judged your trajectory. You could slide down the center of his chest, squeezing by his pectorals, and try to land on top of his gut, but if you pick up too much speed you may crash right into his bulge...Screw it you'd do that. Better than falling off his shoulder and breaking a leg or something.  With a jump you began your descent sliding down the behemoth body of this laid back giant. He didn't move at all, either so he didn't affect you or just because he was to engrossed in his match. You squeeze between his pectorals, the fur brushing and tickling you as you passed by. His shoulders were drawn back and relaxed so you didn't get caught between the large muscle groups. As you came to where his chest meets his stomach you...</span></div></div>",

You just smile back at him and he shrugs and continues to game. As you are working your way to his side to slide down to the phone however, a ringtone emits from your destination. With a curse Mason reached down and picked up the cell, putting it to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up Boss man.....uh huh....uh huh, mmmh yeah I'll be there in like twenty.\" Mason said with annoyance before hanging up, letting out a sigh and glancing at you. \"Some college twerp is having a huge party for his 21st and is renting out basically the whole club with mommy and daddy's money so I gotta go in early to help get the place set up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want me to do? Come with you?\" You ask honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. You're gonna stay here lil' guy until I come back. I can't have you on my shoulder or pocket all night, It's gonna be rough tonight, lots of drunks being tossed out and I wont be surprised if I have to clobber some people. I'll ask around about any weird happenings for you ok?\" He said scooping you up and walking to his bed room. He dropped you on his bed before opening up his closet and throwing a pair of ray cargo pants and a plain black T-shirt on the bed nearby. He let out another grumble as he quickly slid on the tshirt before he grunted and tried to slide into the cargo pants,which were obviously a bit small on him as he bounced in place trying to get them to slide over his upper thighs and large ass. His ass and belly bounced with the hops until finally with hard tug the waist band got over the roos butt, but not without giving him a permanent wedgie. You weren't gonna lie, Mason was kind of hot and you'd be lying if said you weren't a little turned on right now. With a groan and a slightly pained face, Mason rubbed at his rear before turning towards you and speaking while zipping up his fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay here buddy, I'll be back around 3am and then we can look into your predicament. Until then just hang out and stay inside.\" He said tucking in his shirt and pulling out a Gray zip up jacket and throwing it on. As he turned to leave you...</span></div></div>",

The big Red didn't even seem to notice your presence as he continued to casually stroll through his home, unaware his guest was hanging onto his plump tail. He emerged into some tiled hallway that screamed old run down apartment complex and turned to lock his door. You climbed up his tail further to lessen the incline and to prevent getting tired as quickly as he strolled out onto the street that you had seen that reptile strolling down earlier. Now that you weren't in such a panicked state you looked around at the environment around you. Huge buildings, incomprehensible in size to you, stretched to the sky all around, the street teemed with vehicles driving past, all looking somewhat similar to what humans drive, with a few tweaks here and there to accommodate for it's drivers physiology. What surprised and fascinated you the most however, were the other people Mason passed.The first person to come in sight was some goat woman chatting on a phone striding past Mason as he exited his apartment. On a bench sat a pretty muscular tiger reading a newspaper. A jogger passed by and it was a German Shepherd in a track suit. The variety and color of species astounded you, to see a society manage to exist with such differences was a marvel of its own. After a few blocks and surprisingly no pedestrian honing in on your tiny form hanging onto the large kangaroo's tail, you pass an alley way and Mason halted and began conversing with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thomas, what's going on man, you get called in too?\" He asks with a meaty thump following the question, a pat on the back most likely. The creature named Thomas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, not to pleased either, was almost caught up on my show. Hope this kid knows he's already number one enemy in our sights. What's up with you Skip, I haven't had a shift with you in weeks.\" The voice said, it was musical and a little lighter in tone than Mason. You also assumed Skip was Mason's nickname around his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh well nothing new really, had something weird happen this afternoon...hey have you heard anything about-\" Mason began before someone clapped and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Catch up later gentleman, we have 30 minutes before we open and there is much to be done.\" An authoritative and obnoxious voice called out. You were pretty sure that was the manager, and also pretty sure Mason wanted to deck him as the Kangaroo's whole body tensed up, muscle rippling in his legs like he was about to pounce on the guy. With a grumble, Mason began making for the club entrance. You however...</span></div></div>",

You glanced over your shoulder to look at Mason one more time. He was walking into the building with a slim but muscular snow leopard who must've been Thomas. You feel a slight tinge of sadness, but shake it off, you knew the guy for like four hours, relax. The night got dark fast and you found yourself walking down a dark and filthy alleyway with cardboard boxes and dumpsters galore. You trudge on, street light and one light over a service door for the club being the only thing guiding you. After about two hours of walking around you were pretty sure no human was around, if one had come to this world about the same time as you, you'd be pretty sure they'd be long gone. You turned to make your way back to the street, but realized it was suddenly crowded with anthros waiting to get in the club, so you turned and began to walk the other way, not sure where you were going. As you passed one particular dumpster however something caught your eye that sent chills across every portion of your being. You neared the point of interest and it confirmed what you thought it was, a portion of a human skeleton that had been picked clean. You gagged and vomited up what little was in your stomach before inching closer. Whoever this had been didn't seem to have lasted long on this planet, and while the bones and scraps of meat left told you that this happened about a week ago, they also told you that something had gnawed on them. A squeak in the darkness confirmed you suspicions and fears and out from the abyss under the dumpster, a feral rat emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh shit\" You say under your breath. The mangy beast was probably ten times larger than you, and its beady eyes focused on you with a hungry avarice. Without missing a beat, you turned and began to run, the rat taking pursuit a second later. You didn't have long to think, so you made sure to begin running...</span></div></div>",

A toothpick among cigarette butts was the only feasible thing and you grabbed it as you passed. You whirled on the rodent who slowed instantly and eyed you warily, circling slowly and waiting for an opening to get at you. You held the tooth pick like a spear, the point facing the beast as you slowly backed up, only to find yourself pressed against one of the bags. The rat closed in slowly and you knew this was going to be it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" You shout at the slobbering rodent, who's eyes gleamed with a ferocity that was otherworldly. It prepared itself for a pounce and you readied to receive it, tooth pick in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason shut the service door behind him and lit the cigarette in his hand, bunching up his shoulders as he forgot his jacket inside but was to lazy to get it. Damn kid was making a mess of the place and Mason alone had thrown out three of the guys friends for starting fights. At least out here there was no drama-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A small yell came from Mason's right, causing his large ear to flick in the sounds direction, his head followed and the sight before him made him smile and get angry all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rat crouched down, it's victory was sure, there was no way you were gonna best it, it had overwhelming size on you and it knew it. You smiled slightly, how stupid was it that you were going to be eaten by an alien rat in some back alley on another planet. You look on as the rat springs towards you...only for something larger than it to crash down on it, dust kicks up and you cough and blink to try to see what happened. When the dust settled a second later you saw a giant padded foot had crashed on the rat, which was squeeling in pain and protest and trying to bite at the meaty digits that held it down. In response the toes and foot flexed, bringing to your ears the sound of bones snapping. A shrill scream came from the rodent and you looked up to see a familiar face in the darkness above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason!\" You yell happily, you were not expecting this! His face was cast in an orange light from a lit cigarette hanging in his mouth, from down here his true size made you finally realize just how small you really were. The Roo snarled and tightened his toes around the rat before quickly sliding the foot backwards, sending the rat flying off down the alley only for the sound of something hitting metal to sound. Mason took a drag from the cig and bent down on his heels, looking at you patronizingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I recall I told you to stay put, not use me as a ride to get out. It's been what, two hours since I left the house, and you were already almost eaten. You're lucky I haven't kept my new years resolution to quit smoking, otherwise you'd be rat droppings tomorrow.\" He said taking another pull before reaching down and crushing out near where you stood before continuing. \"So here's your choices lil' guy, because obviously you're not listening. I can leave you right here, or you come with me and do as I say, I want you to make it through this but you aren't capable of that on your own. Maybe you'd find someone who'll pause their entire life to help you, you won't get that from me, but I will help how I can. Make the call kid.\" He said grimly. You bow your head, he was right, you couldn't survive out here by yourself, but maybe you could find someone though. You look up and say...</span></div></div>",

You look at him with a exasperated look which he growled and continued. \"I gotta go back in to work and my pockets are too tight and full of crap for you not to get crushed. My natural pocket is pretty deep and the skin and fat and muscle will insulate you from the pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to go in there.\" You say like a spoiled brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't want you to leave the apartment but here we are, take 'em off.\" He said annoyed. You strip down, standing on top of your shoes as you slide out of them so you don't step barefoot on the gross ground. An appoving huff sounded from Mason and he gently plucked you up. In the dim light his sheath glowed with a supernatural shimmer, it was plump and loose looking, but besides a small indention on top it gave no outward signals about what waited within, you took a deep breath as Mason angled your feet into his sheaths mouth, and with almost no resistance you slipped inside. The inner walls were velvety and honestly quite comfortable. The fingers retreated and gravity did the rest, letting you sink deeper within before finally bumping in to the owner of this space. You got heated as soon as you made contact with the flacid cock, and you tried your best not to move too much so you didn't stir it. Mason felt your arrival at the bottom, as he began to move. The wall at your back gained a little more pressure but that was it as Mason pulled up the briefs and re-fastened his pants. With a distant grunt he stood up and began walking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason felt the alien weight of having a living being deep in his sheath, it felt good, real good. He pulled up his boxers and was buttoning his pants when Thomas opened the door calling his name, the Snow Leopard paused at the sight of his coworker zipping his pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you pissing out here or something?\" Thomas asked inquiringly. Mason shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta keep the rodents at bay somehow, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got some guys breaking shit at the bar, We need the big guys for them, so that's you and Vince.\" Thomas said. \"Go get your radio too, we were calling you on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit my bad man. Yeah lets go get these fuckers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason rounded the corner to see his targets, some fox and another kangaroo, he was a gray however and was a good foot shorter than Mason. The two were being extremely loud and harassing the bartender. Mason saw Vince, a Rhino of similar stature to his own come up the other side. Vince took the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, grab your stuff and get out, you're done here for the night.\" The Rhino said putting a hand on the Fox, who tensed and looked genuinely scared. The kangaroo however looked at Vince, and then at Mason and smiled before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on man, you can't kick us out. Especially you bro, you wouldn't kick a fellow Jack out because he was a bit rowdy, it's what we do.\" He said turning back to his beer. Mason reached down and grabbed the smaller roo by the base of his tail and lifted him upside down. The roo blinked in surprise as he was now being suspended by his taller cousin instead of finishing his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Boomer, I'm universal when it comes to kicking people out of here, cousin species or not.\" He said and looked at the fox with Vinces hand still on his shoulder. He decided to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours of similar scenarios, the club began to thin as it got later in the night and bouncers like Mason and Thomas who came in early got to go home. Mason walked through his door and emptied his pockets before stripping down to nudity and plopping into his bed. He rubbed his thighs and crotch, working out the aches that those tight cargo pants imposed on him. As he fondled himself however a little bump inside his sheath reminded him of his passenger. He was tired, real tired, so he asked simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay in there lil' guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The words were muffled but clear, and they stirred you from your snooze.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine, doing real fine in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay for you to stay the night in there, I'm real tired and I know you'll be safe down there.\" He said while yawning. You snuggled deeper into the wedge of loose skin you had claimed, its soft texture soothing you almost into a trance. You were tired too, and sleeping somewhere that made you feel safe was honestly welcoming. He must've been naked as some light made its way through the skin membrane of the sheath and cast a faint orangish gold light inside the pocket. His member was like a large central veiny pipe that dominated the space, but the loose inner skin made pockets like the one you were in available and just far enough away that the temperature was perfect. You had read once that kangaroos were masters of regulating body temperature, and the loose skin around you had a cooling touch. You imagined it would tighten up a bit now that it wasn't in the tight confines of those cargo pants, but not by much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be fine, I wasn't expecting it to be nice in here, no wonder you didn't want my clothes in here, you gotta keep it clean.\" You say yawning yourself. An amused grunt is all you get in response and the lights go out, and sleep soon finds you...</span></div></div>",

When you finally stirred, the pocket was cat in dim light, most of which seeped down from the entrance to this sanctuary. Muffled sound of the TV going made you realize that Mason was probably in the living room and you had even slept through him moving around. You rolled onto your knees and stretched the skin and fat of the sheath easily giving to your weight, and greatly hindering the speed of your movement. Seeing how you didn't really have a way out you looked up the flacid monolith that was Mason's cock. The large muscle was a dark gray color, the same as the skin underneath masons fur all over the rest of his body. Here at the bottom of the sheath, the skin didn't hug the phallus, but further above it   the sheath walls wrapped around it, securing it so that it didn't slump in the loose space. You hugged the member and began to shimmie up Masons member, causing a surprised grunt from your host. The flesh underneath you stirred a bit, but didn't expand as you climbed up the living tower before finding your self crouched on top of the dick. Above you the sheaths mouth winked a bit as Mason was detecting you right beneath it and reflexes wanted him to clench up. You stood up and squeezed your upper body through the soft mouth and into the blinding light and cold air of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well good morning, or afternoon I should say. I'm surprised honestly, I thought me waking up or me making lunch would've stirred you awake, but I guess it's just that cozy down there.\" You blink and look past the soft belly and large pecs at Mason's smirking face. You look down the valley of thighs and boulder like balls below the sheath you were sticking out of, before looking back up at your host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's embarrassing and costs a good bit of my dignity, but yes, it's amazingly comfortable in there. It's so soft, and roomy at the bottom. And when I'd expect it to get hot, you stay cool down there.\" You say absently petting the top of the sheath, not really realizing you were doing it. Mason chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm a kangaroo, we evolved in a barren, scorched land, and keeping ourselves cool became a must to survive out there. As for the soft and roomy part, I'd assume it derives from the females of my species and their pouches, and while I don't have one, some of their characteristics show up in the one biological pocket I do possess.\" He said scratching his chest. \"I didn't even feel agitated by your presence in there so if you wanna call that your sleeping quarters you're welcome to it.\" You place your hands on the sheath lips and pulled your self all the way out, the soft cartilage closing up behind you slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I appreciate it, so what are we doing today?\" You ask hopping over to the nearby thigh, almost missing and slipping into a wedge between it in the sheath but righting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm watching the news for anything about your kind, as well as scouring the internet. And besides for some old conspiracies of 'little hairless aliens', You aren't really trending lil' guy.\" He said somberly. \"But in a way that's good, it means no one from your world are trapped as well, and will fall to this more violent world. They wouldn't be as lucky as you to find a tolerable protector.\" He said reaching over to the table next to the couch he sat on and grabbed a lighter and a cigarette, pinching the cig in his lips before lighting the other end and relaxed back on the couch. You sat on his thigh, shifting uncomfortably, unsure what to do as Mason just lazily watched the TV with you on his naked upper thigh with no indication to remove you from your spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you aren't working today or going out?\" You ask, sitting down as you realize the Roo wasn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah, the club apparently got pretty wrecked from the party at it so some clean up is needed before its reopened. So time to spend the day getting wasted and hanging around commando. Oh err, hope you're fine with that, I'm a bit of a free spirit.\" He said as if he had modesty. You of course had no choice but to keep him happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's no problem, I did spend the night with you in a very intimate way, so seeing your goods on the outside doesn't bug me.\" You say, noticing you're stroking the short fur of the thigh you sat on, you really liked petting this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks bud, you can stay commando too, your clothes are on my night stand though if you want me to get them, I washed em' for ya so you don't have that alleyway stench on them. Excuse me a sec kiddo gotta get a drink.\" He said picking you up and placing you on the cushion next to him before standing up, You were cast in his shadow, his large tail unraveled and flew over you as he stretched. His enormous bulky ass flexing a bit before he released the stretch, making the slabs of muscle and fat to drop and jiggle a good bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn\" You whispered as the Roo walked to the kitchen that was only separated from the living room by a bar counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You want something to eat? I imagine you're hungry since you haven't eaten for something like 24 hours.\" Mason said opening the fridge and flicking an ear in the direction of the couch to listen out for your response. You agree and he comes back with a glass of some dark liquor and his other hand cupped. He bent down and lowered the hand to you, and within was some bits of what looked like feta cheese and clippings of some sandwich meat. Hunger gnawed at you suddenly and you climbed on the hand and retrieved the items, the hand stayed down for a second as if he had given you the choice to retreat back to the sofa but you stayed making Mason genuinely smile, a warm expression that made you feel the same as you woke up in his sheath, safe. He pulled the hand holding you inward and laid it on his thigh again while placing the drink down on the table and tapping the ash of the cig into a tray before grabbing the drink again and taking a swig before returning the cig to his lips. \"Don't feel rushed to leave kid, you're welcome to stay, I got soft spots for little guys in need, that's been most of my dating life.\" You look up at him with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! I had no idea you uh....swung that way. Thanks for the offer, it's a relief knowing you don't want me gone.\" You say finishing your snack before hopping out of his hand so he could make use of it again, landing on the fatty furry thigh once more. The hand rose a second later to retrieve the glass of alcohol and began to swirl it, Mason looked down at you, taking the cigarette from his lips before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah chicks are way too demanding for my taste, it takes a guy to really get a guy, and no problem, make use of my place and me as much as you want...within reason. Don't start selling my stuff like my roomate in college did, he's missing some teeth now.\" Mason said before turning his attention towards the TV and turning it to some horror movie. You sat quietly for a time and actually got into the movie, though horror films weren't really your thing. What enamored you were the actors and how different they were from one another. Some busty lab was running from this skeletal abomination, only for the hero, who was some antelope guy to step out from a tree and swing an axe at the thing, it caught it in a clawed hand and the antelope guy just stood there like all B rated horror victims do, only for him to get disemboweled by a swipe of the things other clawed hand. A Bear in a varsity jacket ran up from somewhere with a chainsaw and cut a hand off the thing only for it to turn on him and he ran off as the antelope dropped to his knees holding his intestines in his hands. Mason scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Always so damn predictable, never any good horror films anymore\" He said shifting, forgetting about you for a second and sending you tumbling down his inner thigh.

Don't take that the wrong way though, I don't intend to like, enslave you or anything lil' guy. But I couldn't ask you to get freaky with me, so please forgive my over exposure.\" He says looking around, showing a shy, vulnerable side of the Kangaroo Bouncer who had been so nonchalant and unfazed by everything before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you're fine Mason.

Your head shot up and Mason let out a half yell, half curse and soon your world went dark as Mason grabbed a nearby pillow and placed it over his crotch. You were pressed into the velvety fur with such force that the flesh and fat of the balls enveloped you almost entirely. You gasped for breath and thrashed, which caused Mason to apply more pressure to subdue your response. You stilled and he let off a bit on the pressure and you listened out for whatever was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yo Mason what's up! check this out dude I got that new game we talked about...\" An overly excited wallaby said, walking in the door as if he owned the place. Mason growled at the smaller male. Wyatt was a red-necked wallaby, and Mason's neighbor. The guy was only 19 and living with his friend that was some scrawny lizard. Mason suspected Wyatt had an affinity for the larger red kangaroo, as he would try his best to touch Mason or rub up against him. Wyatt gawked at his neighbor naked on the couch. \"O-Oh!!! I'm sorry Mason! I really need to knock!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn right you do kid! I don't know what backwater place you come from where everyone walks in on people, but you're liable to get shot in the city doing that!\" Mason said, genuinely angry. The wallaby was in no way his friend, and no matter what Mason did aside from physical force he could not get the message across that Wyatt wasn't welcome here. Mason slipped a finger under the pillow and began scooting the lil' guy up his scrotum until he reached the folds of his sheath, the human got the message quickly and began to wiggle his way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah I know...ANYWAY check this out!\" The annoying wallaby said closing the door behind him and seating himself right next to Mason despite there being three other seats in the living room. Mason turned red in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wyatt...when did I infer that I wanted you right next to me, and when did I invite you in.\" Mason said, his arms tensing with frustration. Wyatt shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I figure at our point in the friendship, I can let myself in. You're welcome at my place anytime after all.\" Wyatt said confidently, this guy.... A tug at the bottom of his cock pocket told him that the lil' guy had dropped to the bottom, and he himself had also retreated completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I give up.\" Mason said throwing off the pillow and standing up. Wyatt turned beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...I thought you were just in your underwear, but now I see the problem here...um ok I'll just...\" Wyatt mumbled standing up as well, coming up only to the chest of Mason. He hurriedly tried to squeeze by Mason and 'accidentally' brushed the back of his hand across Masons junk. The action squished lil' guy up into his cock, and Wyatt froze. \"Wait what is that? Some kind of growth?\" The wallaby said turning around and reaching a hand back towards Mason. In a split second he was flipped around and placed in an armlock in a way that the larger male just had to twist his arm a little more and it would break.<br>\r\nThe wallaby yelped and Mason leaned down and muttered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wyatt, would you please LEAVE MY HOUSE.\" He said throwing the wallaby forward towards the door. Wyatt ran out into the apartment hall but turned around before the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason, you should really get that looked at, it could be cancerous!\" Wyatt said in a terrified tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The only cancer here is you Wyatt, get out!\" Mason said walking up and slamming the door on the wide eyed wallaby that was focused on his bouncing junk. Mason let out a long sigh and walked back to his room, throwing on a tank top and some gray sweat shorts. Both fit him rather snug, riding up his rump and plastering to his chest and belly, but it would suffice. He went back to the door and opened it, and Wyatt scurried back in. Mason rubbed his temples and looked the Wallaby up and down. He was skinny, the complete opposite of the beefy Mason, but he moved quickly, meant more for running than fighting. Mason intimidated him but for some reason the guy just felt safe around him, perhaps he had an aura about him that made small things flock to him for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let me guess Wyatt, Darv is dealing again and you don't wanna be associated or familiarized by the addicts so you came here?\" Wyatt said shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...all I need is for them to think I always have a needle on me and they get me on the street.\" Wyatt said not making eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that's a start on being street wise but they'd also know if they attack you Darv may not sell to them anymore, I know he wouldn't but they don't. Anyway put in the game, lets take a look.\"....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in the skin cradle you settled down, listening to a musical voice yabber on about some game.

Wyatt took it as an invitation to use the muscled appendage as an arm rest however, his arm an inch from Masons thigh, Mason didn\u2019t scold him, he just let the kid fantasize. Wyatts head kept turning slightly as he peeked glances at Masons bulge, causing the kangaroo to finally say something however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDamnit Wyatt would you stop thinking about my crotch? You want me to whip the bits out right now?\u201d Mason said putting a hand down his pants and cupping himself, lil guy squirmed a bit within the sheath at the sudden pressure. Wyatt shot a look at the action then swallowed before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Um you\u2019re not helping Mason, it\u2019s not my choice I crush on you hard.

Sorry that I unconsciously taunt you all the time. I had a crush when I was your age too. He was big and strong and confident, but it couldn\u2019t happen. Now you\u2019re in luck because unlike that guy I tend to prefer the same sex like you, but if I do anything with you it\u2019s gonna make it worse for you.\u201d Mason said scratching his chin. Watching Wyatt go from somber, to shock, to misery. Kind of tugged at Mason\u2019s heart strings. With a sigh he lifted his tail and plopped it behind the wallaby, wrapping it around him And pulling him against Mason\u2019s side. The Wallaby made a small gasp as his face pressed against the side of Masons fatty pec, and he dropped the controller letting it clatter to the floor. Mason wrapped an arm around Wyatt and continued. \u201cScrew what I just said, if I can give you something my crush didn\u2019t, it never hurts anyone to dream.\u201d Wyatt sighed deeply and let his hand fall on Masons thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThank you Mason, thank you...\u201d Wyatt said closing his eyes, enjoying the feeling of protection and warmth that Mason emitted. He asked a question while his eyes were closed. \u201cMason what did I feel when I brushed against you...I\u2019m being honest when I say it worried me...\u201d The wallaby said, his hand sliding  over Masons inner thigh. Mason sighed and looked up at the ceiling, before standing up and dropping his shorts. Wyatt gasped as Mason retook his seat, his ass brushing Wyatt on the way down, making the Wallaby look like he was about to cream his pants. Wyatt focused on the sheath and bulbous balls like a kid in the candy shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNow what you\u2019re about to see is not to be mentioned outside this apartment alright?\u201d Mason said as he lowered a hand and stroked himself a little. \u201cCmon out lil guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear the entire exchange and feel the heat rise within the sheath.

Upon opening it a lizard ran through in a black hoodie and jeans, leaping at the wallaby on the sofa. If it wasn't for Mason dealing with surprises like that every night at his job, the lizard would've already been on top of Wyatt.

His shirt said \"BCPD\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No worries guys, I'm not a narc.\" He said walking into the kitchen where Darv was counting bills, he had a handgun within reach and Mason noted his hand near it twitch when he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"God Mason, tell me when you're coming, don't just power walk in like that.\" The lizard hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You gotta find another hobby Darv, this one is too high risk.\" He said slamming the brick on the counter, making Darv blink and hiss again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thieving wallaby, he comes through that door again, and he won't be walking back out once but several times in black bags.\" Darv tossed Mason a 100, and Mason shrugged and took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm gonna grab his stuff if that is alright with you.\" Mason said turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As long as you don't get sticky fingers, sure, thanks Mason, if you ever need money being MY bouncer, hit me up.\" Darv said turning back to his counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason walked past the gawking smaller anthros and down the hall to where a nearly empty room save for a cot and a microwave sat.

One guy finally asked Mason a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bruh, you're like....really big ya know? Like I got a friend that's a Red, but you got like a foot on the dude...are you a hybrid?\" Mason halted at the words, and that got everyone else's attention. Slowly he turned and looked at the goat that said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's none of your business is it?\" Mason said, flashing the goat a toothy smile, sharp predator teeth glistened in the dim room. Some sucked in breath at the sight and whispers began as Mason shut the door walking back down the hallway....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fingers came into the sheath and you latched onto one, and Mason pulled you out into the cool air of his bedroom. He looked tired despite the fact that he had laid around today for the most part. He sat naked in a cushy chair that he had in the corner of the room. A glass of booze reflecting a street lamp's light that shone from the alley you began in sat on the end table beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tough day huh?\" You ask carefully, he was rubbing his temples with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"More of I have a roommate that I didn't want, and I have no idea when he's leaving.\" He said somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You mean me?\" You ask incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?...No I mean the wallaby Wyatt....His other roommate almost killed him. And I had a guy bring up my heritage.\" He said reaching for his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How is that bad? You're like all kangaroo right?\" You ask innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In response he opened his mouth and before you were nothing but incisors, each about the size of you, how you never noticed them before bothered you but something mystical hung about them. Your skin crawled at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What....what else are you?\" You ask, a horrid curiosity bubbling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My grandad on my mom's side was a dragon.\" He said lamely, not looking at anything really. You waited for him to continue but he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...And that's bad or shameful because....?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Keep forgetting you're new on the block. Dragons are somewhat controversial. They are extremely vain, and live a good bit longer than any other race. It's like an unspoken rule that they are natural leaders, and a lot of the time they end up in seats of power. Due to their vanity and greed, they never liked producing more dragons, and as the ages have gone by, fewer and fewer exist. Right now they are marked as critically endangered, with fewer than 2000 left in the world. Despite that they are still not producing at a rate that counters their deaths, and they keep taking positions at the top of countries and crime syndicates, jobs that have high mortality rates.\" He said taking a sip of his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then shouldn't you be proud to have some of their blood in you? Sounds like they are your worlds leaders, and in some regard that makes you something like that as well.\" You respond encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hybrids are rare, and a Half dragon is the most rare of hybrids, but dragon or not, my grandfather never even met his bastard child, and my mother grew up in the slums. She was bullied constantly, as she sported horns and a barbed tail on top of her kangaroo coat and ears. She fell into drugs, and my dad screwed her on a dare. She died not long after giving birth to me, complications with drugs and whatnot.\" He said finishing his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...I'm sorry, no wonder it's a soft topic. Any idea who your Grandfather was?\" You ask tediously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not was, is. He's the current elected official running the country, Ferrovax is his name, and he doesn't even know I exist. I've written a few emails and letters, but the cocksucker probably has a couple bastard children and grandchildren, I don't want anything but to be acknowledged, but after so long I don't care even for that anymore...\" Mason said lighting a cigarette and taking a draw..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sat silently for a moment before jumping down onto his thigh. He looked down at you droopy eyed. You look up at him and smile, knowing you needed to cheer him up. He looked out of it and pretty buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Going to bed so soon?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually I have another idea...\"</span></span></div></div>",

His breathing was slow and heavy as you began leaning far forward and massaging the lips of the sheath. The skin flexed in response and a satiated sigh slipped from Mason's lips. It took only a few strokes for his semi flaccid length to ease out, you swapped to massaging its length as it emerged, each stroke causing it to grow even bigger and wider. Mason took another swig of his drink, some drops missing his lips and splashing onto your back. The Icy cold made you arch your back, and your chest and stomach slid up the greyish black member and causing Mason to take in a sharp breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"God that feels good...\" He said placing his free hand around the top of his cock and massaging his glans with his thumb, the whole member pulsing as he clenched up in rhythm with your rubbing. You continued putting your whole body into it, your own exposed member smooshing into the dark flesh of your much larger partner, the sheer heat and pulsing of his blood enough to almost send you over. You wanted to more though, you needed to get even more intimate with Mason.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gripped his girth, barely able to get a grip on the fat cock, and shimmied your way slowly up his length. Mason shifted his hand and gripped the base of his shaft beneath you, slowly stroking upward and helping you reach his head. You pivoted so you were looking towards him, then gingerly inserted your own cock into his slit, your hips sinking into the spongy flesh of the glans. It was a little loose, as it seemed if you tried you could slip in your whole body. However Mason was biting his lip and was clenching hard, which was enough to give you stimulation. You thrusted hard as Mason pumped, his eyes half closed as he set down his drink and picked up his cigarette, taking a long draw from it, and exhaling the smoke downward as he got closer to finishing, leaving you in a fog that made you buzzed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...!\" He let out, a serious clench wrapping around your member, making you climax just before a gout of jizz came erupting from Mason. You were drenched in his seed as he came, coating every inch of you as you dug your fingers into the engorged glans to keep from being blasted off. Mason groaned as you gripped him, tossing his head back slightly and letting another torrent out before it receded into a dribble. Both of you sat there panting for a minute before he looked down at you, his tongue panting slightly between his draconic teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...was not...expecting you to be able to make me do that.\" He said downing the rest of his drink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Honestly....me neither.\" You confessed, the dick you clung to still twitching from Mason milking the last bit out as it dribbled out from underneath you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck I ruined my chair.\" He said looking at the piles of cum coating his balls, thighs and chair between them. \"I'm so glad I found you yesterday.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I thought I was mostly an inconvenience, but I'm glad you're glad.\" You say panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He plucks you off his receding member and plants a kiss on you before his tongue slips through the fuzzy muzzle and begins to lick you clean. You laugh at the affection and apply your own kiss to his upper lip as the tongue pulls you into his mouth up to your chest, sucking on you slightly. Despite what just transpired, you get hard again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A moment of fear flashes in your mind as you remember that your body is posed between those vicious teeth at the moment, but you let the thought drift by as you continue planting kisses on your big Roo's lip. He chuckles slightly as he eases you back into his palm gently, letting you give him a few more pecks before standing up and walking into the bathroom and starting a shower. He places you on the counter as he grabs a wash cloth and walks back out and begins to wipe down the chair, you watch him go and don't take your eyes off his strong back or large ass for the entire time. He picks up his cigarette and takes one long pull before snuffing it out in the ash tray and walking back in, his member flopping around still outside the sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you can just let yourself hang like that?\" You ask gesturing at his caked member. He shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, don't wanna get spunk in my sheath, its a bitch to clean in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If only you had a helper.\" You said giving him a sly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Technically that's your room, I wanna avoid making a mess in their out of respect for you.\" He said winking.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He plucked you back up and stepped into the shower, the hot water a shock to your cold skin from your previous tongue bath. Mason held you under the water for a minute to let you get clean, then he set you on the soap dish and scrubbed down his hips and thighs. He occasionally teased you by smashing his rear into the dish, the flesh folding and forming around it easily and getting close enough for you to slap, which gave him another chuckle. He eventually turned off the shower and spent a good while drying off, which made sense seeing how he was covered in hair. He finally slipped his member back into his sheath and set about brushing his teeth and getting read for bed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You two tease each other as he falls onto his bed gently, cupping you to his chest where you twisted his nipple slightly, making him yelp before smashing you into it with a finger while laughing. When he released the hold you ran up his large beefy chest and planted a kiss on his lowered chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason I'm glad I've met you, this was nice.\" You say pressing your hands and face into the fur of his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Likewise, kind of a shame we need to get you home really.\" He said jokingly, but it made you sad for a second. You released your embrace and walked back down the cleft of his pecs, squeezing through the soft fur, your destination being the sheath in the distance, but you paused before going much further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think I'll sleep here tonight....if you don't mind?\" You say looking back at him. He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course not, You can sleep anywhere on me.\" He said laughing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded, snuggling down in his cleft, and before you know it you were out like a light...</span></span></div></div>",

It was a noise beyond the beyond the constant quaking of Mason that had woken you up however, as your head shot up from the slight creak of a door opening. You squinted in the darkness, not moving from your spot between Mason's pecs as a silhouette danced silently around the bed in the darkness. It wasn't until the figure passed by the window where the street lamp poured through that you saw it was an anthro that had a similar shape to Mason, but was much smaller than him by height and mass. The figure leaned over the bed and you held extremely still, not making a sound as the marsupial spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Mason?\" The voice said in a whisper shout, obviously testing the slumber that Mason was in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You assumed this was that new roommate that Mason was talking about, he seemed young but you weren't sure. The roommate climbed onto the bed and seemed to take a moment to admire Mason in the dim orange light given by the streetlight outside. He began to run a tender hand across Mason's shoulder, which Mason responded to with a sputtering snort before taking in another snoring breath.  The hand slid down Masons chest with a good bit of pressure, as when it glided over one of the pecs it caused the space you were in to smoosh together, enveloping you in fur and muscle. The hand stroked Mason lovingly, not daring to drift to Mason's exposed groin however. After a minute the figure laid down on the bed and sighed, stretching his arm over Mason...or at least attempting to as he caressed the big roo's chest. The fingers explored the wide pectorals before descending into the cleft between them...and grabbing you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You froze, as did the hand, and all that could be heard was Mason snoring peacefully. Pressure built on your foot as fingers much more thin than your protectors lifted you out of the cleft, leaving you dangling from the clawed digits. In the dim light you could make out a wallaby's face, one with fear on it. Before you could say anything you were hurled across the room and out the door as the Wallaby shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK??!?\" He said, and the sound of Mason gasping out of his sleep at the disturbance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You tumble out of the room, expecting this to be how you go. You were proven wrong as you crash into something and tumble down it onto the carpeted floor of the apartment. You looked up to see it had been a pair of boxer briefs hanging from a door knob, thank goodness for Mason not keeping a clean house. You got on your feet and began to look for a place to hide as the footsteps of the wallaby began to sound from the room, Mason's angry voice rang out behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wyatt?!? What the hell are you doing in here?...Why are you freaking out?\" Mason said, his voice hoarse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There was a bug on you! Hang on I'm gonna kill it!\" Wyatt said as he came into view, stomping down the hallway towards you and flicking on the lights. He wore some black boxers and nothing else on his thin athletic build.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bug....?\" Masons brain tried to catch up before you heard him struggling to get his feet under him and out of bed. \"SHIT! FUCK! Wyatt wait stop!\".<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could see the silhouette of Mason crash onto the floor, shaking the apartment before you turned and began to run from the wallaby towards the sofa in the living room. A quiver ran through the floor, and you turn to look to see Wyatt in the air with one of his large feet/paws falling towards you. You curse yourself as you stop in your tracks and run back the way you were coming. Wyatt didn't expect you to be intelligent, so he flew over you, not thinking his landing over much as the inertia carried him over the sofa in the living room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wyatt yelped but recovered, leaping back over the couch and standing over you, lifting a foot and casting you in shadow. Your life flashed before your eyes, was this the way you were to die then? A stain on the bottom of some alien marsupials foot?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason saved the day again, just as the foot began its quick descent, A large shadow passed over the wallaby as Masons foot crashed down inches from you, actually making you bounce into the air a couple inches. The wallaby's foot crashed down onto Masons, creating a small pocket underneath the foot where you sat, breathing heavily. Mason apparently shoved Wyatt back, as the foot lifted and the wallaby bumped into the couch, staring quizzically at Mason. Mason let out a huff of air, staring Wyatt down with a bloodshot gaze before bending down and picking you up carefully.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you okay lil' guy? Are you hurt?\" He said looking you over and rolling you in his palm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wanted to say you were fine, but two near death encounters caught up with you and you entered a slight state of shock. Mason took that as you were not fine, and his other hand was around Wyatt's throat in an instant. The wallaby's eyes bulged and he gasped.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha-What? Is that a pet or something?\" He managed to slur out as Mason lifted him off his feet. You recovered slightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason, I'm fine, just a little shakin' up is all.\" You say, and your Roo let Wyatt drop back down, the wallaby gasping.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-it talks?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Get out of my apartment.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"LEAVE!!\" Mason yelled, bearing his fangs and putting his muzzle within a foot of Wyatts face. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The smaller male shrank even more and grabbed his duffel bag and loose things, not even bothering to get dressed, and ran out the door. Mason sighed, walking around and taking a seat on the couch. He rotated his palm and placed you to his chest, his heart beating fast behind the fur and muscle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I thought that kid had killed you for a minute...\" He said somberly. \"The emotions I felt are something I never wanna feel again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's okay, you moved quick enough to stop him\" You say pressing your face deep into the short fur, your own fear slowly melting away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happens when I'm not quick enough, thats going to be the problem, if we don't get you home, that fate is what most likely awaits you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're a ray of sunshine.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm a realist kid.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You both sat there for a moment before Mason sighed, taking you both back to bed, this time putting you in his sheath. You squirmed your way to the bottom of the cock pocket, the velvety skin cool and warm at the same time as you fall asleep rather quickly after such an ordeal....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You awake to the sound of distant traffic. And from the slight swaying of your near dark chamber, Mason was walking somewhere. You sit up and slide past his flacid cock, the organ twitching at your touch as shimmied your way up to the mouth of the sheath. With a squeeze you slide into the dim light of what appeared to be a pair of jeans. The traffic and voices of people talking and walking became slightly clearer. Mason didn't say anything, but the lips of the sheath clenched, not forcing you back in, but encouraging you to do so. You oblige him, and retreat back to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason walked down the street, his breath fogging up in front of him. Lil' guy had woken up and had thought about slipping out, but luckily he got the message without Mason needing to address him in the middle of the sidewalk. He'd rather not start rubbing his crotch with so many others around. The jeans he wore were a size too small, and rode up his ass and thighs uncomfortably, but sweatpants weren't what you wore to go meet with Big Bo'. He wore a dress shirt and a  jacket to stave off the cold. He rounded a corner and made his way into an alley. Halfway down it was a single door with a blue light shining. Above the door simply read 'Bo Alley'. Outside the door stood a bull, but he wasn't really a bull. He had horns but he had more lupine features, with a wolfish muzzle and ears. His coat was a blackish silver and really short. The Wolfbull looked up with an expression of pure happiness.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason! Haven't seen you in like two years! How ya been?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Morning Barnes, I've been okay, is Bo' in today?\" Mason asked shuffling a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure is, he's interrogating some Narc down in the freezer.\" Barnes said, his Bovine tail swishing. \"Go on ahead, and bring me out a drink if you come out again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason ignored the 'if you come out again' and opened the door. Bo was a gangster, but his requirement for you to join him was to be a hybrid by at least a quarter. Hybrids were typically shunned, but Bo' knew their value. Hybrids were typically stronger than both their parent species, and more resilient as well. Mason made it to the freezer and opened it up casually as if walking into his own house. The sight before him was one he had helped orchestrate many a time. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A Rottweiler cop hung from the ceiling upside down, bound at the ankles by rope. Circling him was one of the only people in the city that made Mason feel small. Bo' turned to look at the person intruding, and broke into a smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason! My Boy! How have you been! I thought you'd be back eventually.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bo' was an Orca, an Orca like Mason, being a quarter dragon. He stood a good head taller than Mason, with bulging muscles and a powerful fluked tail. He set the Iron comb that he had been holding in his hand down on a chair and embraced Mason, who returned the gesture. Mason's old ways returned for a second as he eyed the cop hanging upside down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Need some help?\"... </span></span></div></div>",

Jarvis caught wind he was a Narc, and here we are..\" Bo' said outstretching his arms. \"I just need to know all he knows, and I told him I'd let him go.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason scoffed and turned to the dog. \"Look man, lemme tell ya, if he was gonna let you go, he would've blindfolded you so you didn't see his face. I'll ask for your sake to tell him what you know and he won't torture you, he'll make it quick.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"MASON!!!\" Bo' said launching up and staring him down. \"You walk off on me almost two years ago...and in the twenty seconds you're back you fuck up my deal here? Really?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason adjusted his jeans, damn these were tight on his ass. \"Pretty much, you know I always cut to the chase. Gimme the damn comb.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bo' blinked as Mason snatched it from his grip, walking up to the naked Rottie, who began to chuckle. Mason kicked him in the mouth, causing him to make a sputtering sound. When the Rottie recovered he spoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is that supposed to do? Comb my ass fur? Help yourself Red, I'll enjoy every stroke.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I highly doubt that.\" Mason said as he glided the comb through the Rotties fur on his left thigh. The dogs chuckling began as he was being groomed, but he soon sensed something off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason began angling the comb to where the iron prongs were more perpendicular to the skin and fur. The dog began to grunt and wince through teeth as fur began to be torn from the flesh, and not long after skin and flesh began to follow. The Rottweiler started to shout in agony as his thigh was whittled away by a grooming instrument. Mason let off and looked down at the whimpering dog.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was just a taste Skip, the real grooming I always start with the balls, so if you wanna die intact, tell us what you know.\" Mason said. The dog just continued whimpering so he placed the bloodied prongs on the exposed underbelly of the Rotties scrotum.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"BR-BROKER STREET.\" The dog shouted. \"WE KNOW ABOUT THE BROKER STREET DEAL TOMORROW.\" He said before dying back down to a whimper.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason held up his hands in a Ta Da fashion. And Bo' just sighed, drawing a pistol and putting a round in the whimpering dogs head. Bo' whistled and two more members of the gang came in and began clean up. The Orca beckoned Mason to follow as they walked to his office. The entire way lil' guy squirmed vigorously, obviously wondering what all the screaming and the gunshot was. Bo' opened a dark wood door and walked in, Mason closing the door behind himself and taking a seat at the Mob boss's desk. Bo' handed him a glass of Scotch and took a seat in his overly plush chair. Bo' picked up a phone and dialed a number.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jarvis, cancel Broker.\" Is all he said before hanging up and looking expectantly at Mason. \"Well my fellow dragon, what brings you crawling back.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason set his glass down and unzipped his pants, and Bo' blinked as Mason's thick sheath came through the zipper. He was about to say something smart but Mason cut him off, as his fingers slipped into his sheath. In the gang business, Vaginas and sheaths, along with anal cavities were a common way to smuggle contraband, so this wasn't COMPLETELY bizarre to Bo'. Mason got a grip on his lover, and yanked him out gently and placed him on the desk... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason's meaty digits pulled you out into a cold room and placed you on a colder desk. You blink, your eyes adjusting to the light before you gasped at the being before you. Something akin to an Orca stared down at you with his brows raised, his leathery black and white skin shined from the light above. His muscles bulged, threatening to tear the fabric of the dress shirt and tie he wore. His eyes were...different, not quite fitting the rest of him, like the Fangs Mason had didn't belong with his body.  They were deep blue, with the pupils being slits unlike Masons round pupils. The eyes darted up to your protector.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason....you know what this thing is right?\" The voice was deep, almost like crashing waves. Mason spoke while zipping his pants back up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"HE is a human, and he doesn't know how he got here. I need help getting him back where he came from.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Orca looked back down at you, then back at Mason. \"I'm gonna have to say right now that what you just asked is impossible.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You swirl your gaze to the Orca who sat back in his chair slowly. You turn to see Mason staring at him, and you thought he was going to question why, but whoever this guy was it seemed Mason trusted that opinion and didn't feel the need to do so. So you did.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why can't I get home?\" You ask defiantly. The Orca blinked then glanced at you sighing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In the most simple way to put it....You are home.\" He said clasping his hands across his belly. \"Humans originate from this world.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nooo, we come from Earth, no one has ever heard of this place there.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that what your government tells you? Or doesn't rather? Humans were sent from this plane of reality so they couldn't be used as weapons.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You and Mason blinked, and you thought real hard on that. Mason picked up the questioning now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How would lil guy be a weapon? That makes no sense at all, he literally was almost a stain on my floor from one of the most cowardly people I know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bo' sighed. \"I don't know the details, as my access to top security files is very limited, but somehow humans disappeared thousands of years ago, and were shunted to another reality. Every now and then, one slips back into this world, but is usually killed by a careless foot or eaten by a feral. The few that make it someone like you are soon taken by some sort of secret organization, so keep him to yourself Mason.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look at Mason, who smiles at you sadly. He takes a deep breath and sighs. \"Well, look's like you're stuck with me....Sorry.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't be sorry, at least I'm with you, and that's enough for me.\" You say smiling at him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Awwww Mason, you got yourself something that tugs on this Dolphin Dragons heart strings...\" The Big Orca said putting a hand on his heart while laughing. \"Anyway...are you interested in rejoining the Hybrids? If you have to protect the human, might as well have a group that'll keep an eye out for you. I miss having you with us, come back and make that six figure salary you once did.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason grimaced, looking at you before sighing deeply again...</span></span></div></div>",

Bo' smiled fondly at him and nodded, pulling out some paperwork for Mason to begin filling out. This of course made Mason raise an eyebrow. Bo' elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your previous departure...damaged quite a few deals, the only reason I didn't take action against you was because that would be a waste, you're too efficient and reliant...most of the time to get rid of. The crew thought it was because you share dragon blood with me, and that is partially true, but mainly because you're so damn good at your job. One of these forms require a blood pact.\" Bo' finished, leading to Mason cursing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A blood pact?? That enslaves me essentially! I-\" Mason began before looking at you and closing his eyes, sighing. \"Fine, you'll have my oath in blood that I won't desert this time, as long as you do everything in your power to get me as much as you can on humans.\" He said flipping to the blood pact spot and reading over the document cursing again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Minimum of four years? Are you shitting me Bo'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"These are my terms, I want to at least get a longer term out of you before you walk again.\" He turned to you and smiled more broadly, a terrifying expression on the cetaceans face. \"How about you little guy? Care to become a member of the Hybrids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uhhh maybe, are you guys like a government agency or something?\" You said, and before Bo' could answer Mason scoffed and spoke without looking up from the contract he was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Government agency....heh, no lil' guy, It's a gang to put it in simple terms. A widely distributed crime syndicate in a more accurate sense. They run this city and a couple of neighboring ones. Leave him alone Bo' he's not a hybrid, and even if he was I wouldn't let you have him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bo' clutched his chest as if he was hurt by Mason. \"I'd be foolish to limit recruitment to Hybrids only when it comes to those that are obviously valuable. Take the Rend Brothers, two monsters of T-rex's would be wasted in that steel mill I found them at. Then there's Grover, that mink that is amazing with my books and numbers. Hybrid is the standard when nothing else is exceptional about you, that's what I thought about you at first Mason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason glared at him, and Bo' continued. \"Besides, you don't own Lil' Guy here, he's his own....human. If he wants to join I will not refuse someone that can easily spy and scout on heist jobs.\" The Orca spoke as he slid a similar form towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then...it's your call Lil' Guy, you might as well since we will be spending a lot of time here. But he stays with me, Bo', if you need him for a job, I go on that job.\" Mason said, trying to keep charge here for you. Bo' nodded and with that Mason grabbed a letter opener and drew it across a finger before stamping the contract with it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bo' mirrored him and stamped the box next to the one mason had before taking the contract back and turning to you and holding the letter opener blade near you. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what'll it be 'lil' guy'? You in?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You thought for a second, perhaps this could be fun, you always liked gangster movies....<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure what the hell\" You said, sliding your palm across the blade and pressing it in the middle of the box. Bo' stamped his thumb, the print bigger than your whole body. Mason groaned audibly as you did so, and Bo' laughed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh shut up you son of a bitch, this is great, you're back as my right hand man and have your own little helper. I don't discriminate lil' guy, rules are simple. Do the job I give ya, make some cash. Since you seem to be reliant on Mason, I'll just pool your earnings into his. Just uhhh, don't fuck up, or snitch, and we will get along famously.\" He said smiling at you again. You kept your cool, but those eyes and teeth told you this bubbly boss had a cold, ruthless side.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason coughed. \"Alright, where do you want us?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"4289 Rovers landing, Warehouse on the docks, there's a deal that Karter is heading and I told him I'd send some more muscle, we can give Lil' Guy here-...sorry I'm gonna have to refer to him as Little from now on Mason, I can't keep a straight face. -a wire and put him up on a rafter or something to keep an eye out for fishy business. You remember Karter right? That guy has missed you something fierce-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah yeah I remember Karter, we...screwed around a good bit. I'll get over there, you got a gun and Vest for me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still in the armory lounge.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cool\" Mason said plucking you up in his palm and walking out without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat awkwardly as Mason slid on a Kevlar vest before zipping up a jacket over it. Bo' wasn't joking when he said it was an armory lounge, Guns of all shapes and sizes were racked between couches and bars. Two other anthros; a Tiger lion and a horse deer, sat nearby smoking. They had simply ducked their heads when Mason had entered the room, though one of them kept taking glances at you. Mason slid some handgun into a holster on his thigh before adjusting his too tight jeans.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck my balls hurt...\" The roo said. \"Remind me to stop at the department store on the way home to get some pairs that don't threaten to make me infertile.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um will do, is there a reason those guys over there won't look at you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh?\" Mason said, is mouth hanging open slightly as he blatantly looked over at the other Hybrids, before snorting and looking back at you. \"That's a basic rule around here, members that are lower than your rank aren't supposed to look at ya, not in the eyes anyway, that would be a challenge. I'm a second in command, or 'Mob Boss'. I'm not the most popular here but I am respected.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why's that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I killed for my position, Bo' made me kill the Mob Boss that held this position before I did, some Badger wolf. There's only three Mob Bosses, and the fact I'm so young by gang standards makes me a target. I've had to kill a lot of would be assassins, and it's painted me as a force to not fuck with.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what about me? where am I on this power totem?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're directly under me, so in a sense you're like a 3rd in command, or on equal footing as this Karter guy we're going to meet, technically you're called a \"Job Boss\", meaning you lead jobs, but you won't have too since you're sticking with me. To put it simply there's five ranks, and everyone figures out quickly where they are in the system, through beatings and treatment. You got Bo', the Big Boss. Then ya have the Mob bosses that distribute the Jobs down to the Job Bosses, and then you got the Head Grunts that have a dozen or so Grunts under them. Pretty simple, best way to climb is to wait for an opportunity to shine, and make yourself stand out. Killing is punishable by death, unless Bo' tells you to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-huh...so am I still gonna get some grunts under me?\" You ask trying to process the mob politics that were just dropped on you. Mason looked up at you, obviously getting a little annoyed by your questioning, and falling into this gang persona he had rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Noooo...Like I said, you carry the rank, but more than likely all it will get you is keeping the grunts from buggin' you, if you're caught without me the other Job bosses are gonna make it clear where you fall in their caste, aka making sure you know you're the lowest of the Job Bosses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's ranks within the ranks?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason looked up at the ceiling and bit his lip, the two hybrids nearby got up and scurried out of the room, obviously catching something in the air that you couldn't. Mason turned an eye on you, and there was frustration there. You put up your hands to show passivity. \"Hey I'm trying to figure out how all this works...you're the one who just pulled me into the world of alien anthro hybrid gangsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason sighed, closing his eyes. \"Sorry, you're right, I'm slipping back into my hot headed self way faster than I thought I would. Yes, there are unofficial ranks in the ranks, and usually its determined by your effectiveness. I know I'm asking a lot, but I'll need you to try your hardest. Since you're obviously dear to me, the other Mob bosses are gonna try and get to you, so they can get at me. Mob bosses don't vocally state our pecking order, as we gotta keep a professional image, but <i>I</i> am the top of the Mobs, though the other two might need to be reminded of that since I've been gone.\" He finished with cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason plucked you up and grabbed two ear pieces, tuning them so that they were on the same channel. He settled you into the hood of the jacket he wore so that you were near his ear but out of sight from others. He poured a glass of booze and walked out of the establishment, passing the drink to the Wolfbull Barnes. The Hybrid blinked in surprise, before breaking into a smile and averting his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good to have you back with us Ma-...Boss.\" You peeked from the hood as Mason walked away from the Bouncer, who happily sipped the drink.</span></span></div></div>",

He walked up to a rusted door, giving it a hard kick and snapping one of its hinges with the blow. On the other side was an interesting individual that made you peek out at in curiosity like that wolf bull. The guy whirled around with a gun drawn in an instant, his slightly pointed ears pressed flat against his head, a ridge of fur standing up on his head and running down his neck. His teeth were bared, and a powerful tail lashed behind him as he stared down Mason. He reminded you of an otter, but his features screamed canine as well. He was a similar build to Mason, and was wearing a tank top and what seemed like runners compression shorts that didn't really hide what he was packing up front. His fur was dark brown, but his from his chin going down the front of his body was white. The Hybrids snarl turned into a genuine grin as he ran up and embraced Mason, sliding his chin up on the Roos shoulder and almost taking you out. The otter dog spoke with genuine happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason! Good to have you back bro! I heard in one of the chats that a previous Mob had walked into the alley! Guess that means you took back your old position? Guess that also means I'm demoted?\" The Otter dog said pulling Mason back and holding him at arms length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good to see ya Karter, if by that you mean you took Mob position after I left, then yeah I guess so. It would explain why I'm your 'muscle', Bo' sent me to let you know in person.\" Mason said hugging the Otter canine again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This time an eye of Karter focused on you in the hood/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh Mason, what is that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? Oh!\" Mason stated, breaking the embrace and plucking you into a palm. \"This is Lil' guy, or as Bo' is stating, he goes by Little, he's under me so that makes him and you equal I guess.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Karter looked at you and frowned, an expression telling you that you two were NOT equal, and you nodded at him in acknowledgement and adjusted your gaze so you weren't looking in his eyes, which made the corner of his mouth twitch up into a smile. Mason continued.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lil' Guy this is Karter, his Hyena dad had a thing for otter women and somehow made this abomination.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Har Har, coming from the dragon bastards bastard.\" Karter said setting his gun to the side. \"What is he Mason, I shit bigger than him on the daily.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm a human, I come from this world apparently, despite coming from another world.\" You say, keeping your cool. It was obvious Karter was getting a feel with how far he could push you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cuz that makes sense.\" Karter snorted and shrugged. \"Whatever, welcome to the Hybrids. There's stranger looking things in this crew. So what is he supposed to help us with today Mason? Give me a colonoscopy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He kept referring to Mason rather than speaking to you, and you could tell that he was literally dismissing you as beneath him, Mason wasn't coming to your aid as you weren't in physical danger and that would show a sign of weakness. You were about to answer, when Mason retorted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll give you something for your ass later, and he knows his part to play so don't worry about it. Why are you dressed like you were on a run? If bullets start flying, compressions aren't gonna help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They bantered back and forth, and swapped to business talk about the deal and how its to proceed. You tried to keep up with everything, but you couldn't help but start to drift in thought.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"LITTLE!\" You jumped out of your skin and found the Hotter...? Was that what he would be called? Looking at you angrily. Mason had his head turned in your direction and looking down at you expectantly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" You said dumbly. Karter looked at Mason and scoffed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mason, this guy is better being my butt plug today than overwatch to make sure they don't pull anything.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey I'm right here, talk to me, not Mason.\" You say crossing your arms.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah I tried that you little shit, and you were day dreaming. We're putting you up on that rafter, you'll have an earpiece that's going to to be connected to mine and Mason's, if anything looks off don't hesitate to mention it. Please for the love of the ancients, don't daydream, I know I'm charming but damn.\" He said before turning back and going over the exact choreography they were supposed to follow with Mason. You were bristling for a moment but you soon realized Karter had a point. This wasn't a game, you were actually dealing in narcotics, and a slip up could be life or death. What the hell have you gotten yourself into? If you were caught would you go to anthro jail, or would you get taken by that agency Bo' mentioned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"-for the love of-, LITTLE!!!\" You came back to see Karter about to pop a blood vessel in his eye and Mason beginning to laugh.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What??\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I give up, Mason. I know he's green but this guy is gonna get us killed. Why can't Bo' just shoot us instead of setting us up with an extradimensional dumbass.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um actually it was a package deal, Karter. Lil' is with me, I agreed to come back if Bo' helped me with learning more about humans and their appearances here.\" Mason said rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>You?? Helping someone else?</i> You were always in it for yourself, is this turd really that special as to change your whole personality?\" Karter said throwing a hand out in your direction as he called you 'turd'.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah I know, but I promise he can do something as simple as overwatch. Now quit your bitching and do your job.\" Mason did a 180 with the last statement, as did Karter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Hotter instantly averted his gaze, sensing Mason had swapped from friend to boss. Mason turned and climbed up a bunch of warehouse shelves before reaching out and placing you and an earpiece on an aluminum rail that overhung the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If anyone changes stance, or moves out of our line of sight, tell us what they're doing, apparently this is a shady deal, and the buyer is bringing more people than was originally agreed upon.\" Mason said, his face placid and devoid of any emotion. You already weren't a fan of Gang Mason.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So you're a Mob boss, huh?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, jobs that are this high risk are handled by the Mobs and Jobs.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You said the Kangaroo Bouncer jokes got old. But isn't a group of kangaroos called a Mob? so in a sense...\" You began to say, and Mason's mouth twitched with the phantom of a smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He dropped from his perch to the floor below, a good twenty feet by his size standards but he walked it off like it was nothing. You watched him and Karter prep the goods for the trade off, both working without speaking and showing signs that they had done this rodeo dozens of times.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It wasn't much longer until a white van pulled into the warehouse, all of its doors opening up as a bunch of Dogs leaped out of differing species, there was probably eight in total. Mason walked up slowly clasping his hands together in front of himself, making the dogs jump, they were skittish. From up here you could see that on average, Hybrids seemed to be larger than purebred species, Mason and Karter had about a foot on the tallest dog. That or they were just all short, you weren't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gentlemen, you must be the representatives of the Strays, welcome to our territory-\" Mason began but a Doberman cut him off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah Yeah Red, we get it, Lets cut the pleasantries, we all hate each other here, lets just make the swap and hope to never see each other again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason closed his mouth and nodded, motioning for the Dogs to follow. One of the dogs, a pitbull, looked right at you, but wasn't looking for an inch tall human apparently, as he just huffed and fell in behind his fellow members. Karter stepped to the side, as did Mason, while the dogs perused the goods, checking their quality. While they did this Karter eyed your location and spoke in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Little, any other vans outside or dogs in the van we just left?\" He says and you smile as you had done your job and made sure of it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nope, this deal is golden.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure is.\" Karter replied as he and Mason pulled their guns and opened fire.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look on in shock as they gun down all the dogs in a series of seconds, the quick ones only having time to look up before a bullet caught their head or chest. The silence that followed was sickening as smoke drifted from the barrels of Karter and Mason's guns. You spoke quickly through the headpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha-What happened? Did someone go for their gun? Did I miss something?\" You say as you looked around at the bodies, all of their visible guns still in belts or holsters.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kid, if you had been listening instead of dreaming about life as my butt plug, you'd know this was gang war staging, not a deal.\" Karter said putting his gun back down and walking over to a closet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason began scaling up to retrieve you as you watched Karter pull out two other bodies. Positioning them in a way that looks like they were shot from the same direction as the Dogs. The bodies looked like some more Hybrids. Mason reached you and you threw your hands up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You just murdered those guys! What the hell is up with that?\" You say and Mason blinked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, Bo' wanted us to fake a deal and make it look like we were blown away with the Stray's by another gang in this city. We get to keep the goods, the cash, AND now the strays will want war with the guys that we already have been purging, small timers that are trying to muscle in on the big boys.\" Mason said plucking you up with the hand that pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sat in silence as Mason and Karter loaded up the van with the goods and cash, also collecting all the guns from the Strays, when done, Karter spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not a bad pull, lets go get some drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason...</span></span></div></div>",

Karter grabbed a duffel bag that was leaning against the wall and opened it, pulling out a bundled article of clothing before throwing the duffel in the back of the van and climbing into the driver seat. He tossed the small bundle to mason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just another pair of gym compression shorts, they'll definitely be more breathable than those Jeans you're wearing.\" Karter said starting the ignition and backing out as Mason undid his button and zipper, awkwardly sliding out of the pants while in a seated position. His jerking movements threatened to topple you from your perch on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You forgot he was wearing no underwear and looked at Karter to see if he had noticed, which the Hotter had but acted like it was an everyday sight for him. Mason slid the tight spandex shorts on, and then handed you to Karter, setting you on the his beefy thigh as he drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hold him, I gotta get out of this vest and monkey suit.\" Mason said, his voice muffled as he lifted the jacket but was having trouble as it caught on the vest straps underneath.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You froze and didn't move, fearing that Karter would do something to you. But after a second or two, you peek a look and see the Hotter was looking straight ahead and bored. Whoever this guy was, he seemed very close to Mason, and your protector seemed confident in dumping you in his lap while he tangled himself up in clothes. Karter broke the ice, not looking down as he posed a question at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So Little, have you like, done anything remotely similar to the work you'll be doing with us. Because I gotta say, that kindergarten response when we killed those guys tells me you have not.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you Karter, he's with me. And in order to get him home we signed him up under me so Bo' is alright with me keeping him on jobs and not seeing him as a complete liability.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay but I was talking to him this time Mason, I wanna hear what he thinks.\" The Hotter said looking down with blue eyes, you averted your gaze slightly and he huffed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look guy, you don't have to keep looking away.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But the ranks say-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah yeah but you know I could kick your ass so look at me when you're talking.\" Karter said and you met his gaze, has he even once checked the road?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't think joining would make me see something so cold blooded and calculated so soon...I thought of bank heists and sacks of money with dollar signs, not....that.\" You say shuffling your feet against the compression material.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I see why Mason likes you, he's always had a thing for small innocent guys, and I think you're the smallest, most innocent thing I've seen to date. He always like playing big bad protector.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason snarled, his arms and head stuck in the vest. \"If I had a hand free and you weren't driving you'd be collecting your teeth off the dashboard.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So that's it? I'm the small, innocent human that the dragon roo thinks is cute and thats enough to hate me?\" You ask incredulously.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Karter jerked at the accusation. \"I don't hate you Little, but you are a liability, when push comes to shove, and someone gets you to get at Mason, he's going to do some very rash things. And I'm worried for both of you...and myself as I am also under Mason...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason got the vest off and essentially ripped the dress shirt off, leaving him in a white cotton tanktop that was a little short and his belly up to half his navel was exposed. The roo slouched in the seat and reclaimed you, setting you on his own thigh. \"The thing is they have to get him first, and I won't let them Karter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few minutes you pulled up into the Alley garage, and your two cohorts left the van to be unpacked by grunts. Karter and Mason entered a bar labeled the Job bar, and as they entered it became clear it was limited to higher members of the Hybrids. The only other person in the room was a Fox that looked like he was also mixed with another Canine, he was seated at the bar and Mason ambled up to him and sat right by him with you on the shoulder on the Foxs side. The contrast between Mason in compressions and a too small tank top while the fox was in a three piece suit was obvious. The Fox canine sighed and looked at Mason, lowering his ears as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I heard you were back Mason, I see your sense in etiquette and style haven't wavered in the slightest.\" The voice had a English undertone, despite you knowing there probably was no England in this world.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Constantine, my dear opposite, how have you been?\" Mason said clapping a hand on the Fox Hybrid.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I <i>was</i> fine until you and that bumbling psychopath Karter walked in.\" Constantine said, his eyes drifting from Mason to you. \"This must be 'Agent Little' as everyone is taking to calling him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason and you frowned. \"Why are they calling him that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because it's in everyone's head that he's going to end up under me, as he would be more beneficial in my line of jobs rather than your scorched earth operations.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well the deal was that he stays with me, sorry.\" Mason said as Karter rounded the Bar and began making drinks for himself and Mason.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know, I already inquired about that, but I may ask of him Mason from time to time, it'd be a waste not to get him into our more...refined approaches in the city.\" Constantine said looking at you and holding out a finger. \"I'm Constantine, Little. I'm the Mob Boss in charge of dealings with government and business investments. I'm a Foyote, pretty clear what those species are.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I prefer calling him a Cox.\" Mason said with Karter snickering, though the Hotter wasn't looking in Constantine's direction. Constantine ignored them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you get tired of the dirty work these destructive cretins do, ask Bo' about transferring under me, Mason signed on the agreement that he had to go on every assignment you went on, but I imagine he'd make an exception for it being my jobs.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh no, I won't Con.\" Mason said, his jovial expression dying. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Foyote shrugged and stood up, and without another word walked out of the Bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't take long for Karter and Mason to be slurring their words and goofing off, they had retreated from the Bar with a bottle and were leaning against one another in a recess with a booth, laughing about past jobs. You had a little of booze from Mason's glass and you found it hard to keep a smile off your warming face. You were on the table in front of the drunk anthros, and suddenly Karter shifted the conversation to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...I'm warning ya Mason, he's gonna get ya killed.\" Karter said jabbing a finger into the Roo's face. \"Remember when I was captured by the Greyswine's during one of our swings? You got captured too after shooting up two of their meth labs. I'm surprised they didn't castrate ya before Donnie got us out.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pfffft Donnie, is he still the other Mob Boss? I think I still owe him a favor for that ordeal?\" Mason said taking another swig.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're missing the point here. You get attached to somethin', and then almost die because of it. I was a simple token to get some of their guys back, and then you turn it into a full blown gang war.\" Karter said. \"If I did something to this cute little toy, you'd do something you wouldn't do normally-\" Karter paused and got a malicious smile. You already were backing away and Mason's face went blank.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Karter...what are you-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You blink, your buzzed mind not comprehending the speed in which Karter took you into his grasp and was already on his feet on the other side of the table. Mason slowly stood, his face blank of emotion as he spoke in a cooled voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Karter....I'm ordering you to give me my Lil' guy back..\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look up at Karter, who winked at you before using his other hand to pull down his compressions, his dick flopping out already semi erect and out of his sheath. Unceremoniously he shoved you into his piss slit and quickly worked himself, guiding you easily down his length. Your mind couldn't comprehend the turn of events, searing walls convulsing and clutching you greedily as you were towed to destinations unknown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason sobered slightly as he watched the lump that was Lil' guy slide down his friend's cock towards his plump balls that overhung the compression waistband.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come and get him big boy.\" Karter said pulling up the shorts and taking off and out of the Bar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mason cursed and stumbled, sliding awkwardly between the table and booth, and ignoring the growing tent in the front of his own compressions. His large legs easily took him out of the Bar, and he barreled past many grunts who diverted their gaze from the dragon roo as he pursued Karter through the dark corridors of the Alley hangout. He didn't run in a frenzied fashion however, he knew exactly where Karter was going and what he wanted....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You slid into a dark chamber with a splash, and were quickly tossed around as the chamber shifted back and forth as if in motion. Your buzzed mind had a good idea where you were, and braced yourself against the fleshy walls of the Hotters scrotum.

Earth? Afraid I've never heard of those things before. But regardless of that it's nice to meet you Tim. My name's Brock.\" The raccoon replied with a big smile on his face.

Over the ringing in your ears, the sound of gunfire could be heard and your head slowly cleared. You began to work out husky male voices speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sector 5 cleared, two scientists terminated. Finishing sweep then returning to the pod.\" A voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You peeked out of the cubicle you were in and saw three...humanoids standing over the body of what appeared to be a fox mixed with a man. Beneath you was the body of something akin to a ocelot and a man. The humanoids were wearing futuristic combat suits that hugged their bodies leaving little of their musculature to the imagination, with olive green plating on their chest, thighs, and shins. A utility belt went around their waist, and futuristic pistols were strapped to their thigh armor. Their helmets were all shaped strangely, and you assumed they were different species of creature. One of the soldiers reached up and clicked the side of his helmet, and the visor telescoped, the helmet folding back behind the head. You gawk at the head and face that was not unlike a pure white great dane, with cropped ears and droopy jowls, that somehow held the most smug expression you've ever seen. He was the tallest out of the three and the beefiest by far, you noticed as well his thin short haired tail sticking over some large glutes. He spoke calmly, his voice so deep it reverberated in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good shooting boys. If these eggheads played with quantum teleportation any longer we'd have black hole right here in planetary orbit.\" He said holstering a smoking pistol on his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another one of the soldiers holstered a shotgun on his back, it clicking into place on the chest piece, before clicking his helmet and revealing a black panther underneath it. He smiled at his taller sergeant and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You'd think they'd learn after the first few times that any kind of matter teleportation is punishable by death in imperial space.\" He said squatting down and snagging an ID badge off the fox, looking at it for a second before tossing it back on the body unceremoniously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Great Dane walked around the room, his boots echoing around the lab ominously, causing you to hunker down. Your small movement caught his eye and his head swiveled and he had his gun drawn in an instant. he walked slowly to where you were as the other two soldiers unholstered their weapons and waited on their leaders call. He moved where his body blocked their line of sight of your alcove. He leaned down and his pale Gray eyes locked onto you and twinkled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What in hell's name are you?\" He murmurs to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is it Colonel?\" The other anthro who hadn't removed his visor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Dane held his gaze on you a moment before turning around and saying. \"Nothing, getting jittery is all, lets get back to the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Dane backed up slightly as he spoke, and a hand lazily made its way and scratched at one of his large ass cheeks unceremoniously, the muscle group jiggling and bouncing in the tight combat tights he wore under the armor plates. You were mesmerized by the muscular dog ass, but as the hand slid back to the front of him, his thumb flipped open one of the tactical pouches on his belt above the cheek. You were sure he was telling you to get in. You judged the distance and leaped, however it was obvious quick that you had overestimated and crashed into his lower back, sinking into the rubbery mesh of his suit and bouncing off him. Something crashed into your back and sent you tumbling into the hard plastic that was the pouch, and it took you a moment that he had used his tail to bat you inside. The top of the pouch clicked shut and a blue white light activated, and the temperature dropped substantially. Luckily it was cold today on earth, and you were in a hoodie and jeans so it didn't bother you to much. Muffled voices could be heard outside and you awaited to see where this takes you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale thought hard on what he just found, scratching under his chin as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did you hear me Colonel?\" Cadik said slapping the Bale's ass, the private was always getting a handful of the large dog's rear. Bale didn't mind, he loved the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? Sorry Cadik was thinking about...taking some leave when we get back.\" He said glancing back at the panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said when we get planetside, we need to check out that bar, go push around the staff and get some free drinks, you know the routine.\" The cat said, a smile curling across his face. Bale rolled his eyes and stopped in the hallway they were currently walking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No Cadik, I don\u2019t care to bully the civilians.\u201d  Bale answered before beginning the walk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, forgot you\u2019re a good Boy Scout that sets an image for all to follow.\u201d Cadik said, turning to the other member of their squad. \u201cWhat about you Viktor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I don\u2019t drink, you know that.\u201d Viktor said in a monotone voice, still hidden behind his helmet. Cadik stared skeptically at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah okay, I shouldn't have asked.\" Cadik said. \"Anyway Bale, I've been meaning to ask why sometimes you get assignments that send you out by yourself.\" The panther asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dummy, Colonel is an imperial bounty hunter, he isn\u2019t authorized to share any of that with you.\" Viktor said holstering his rifle, they had made it to the hangar, their ship waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This assignment had been on a station orbiting Sedimar, it had been abandoned about a decade ago, but the scientist were part of an extremist group looking to weaponize matter displacement. Their ship waited them and they climbed up the drop bridge into its hull. A small craft, it only had four seats in the cockpit and a quarter behind that with a few bunks and a latrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"An imperial bounty hunter...no wonder your combat skills are sublime.\" Cadik said taking a seat in one of the pilot chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah yeah, Viktor take us home, I gotta take a dump.\" Bale said walking over and shutting the door to the room in the back of the ship. He unfastened his  belt and placed it on one of the cots, and took off his ballistic armor, leaving himself in the grey spandex bodysuit. He sat down on the cot next to his utility belt and opened it up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hiss erupted from the lip of your lit room and warmer air spilled in as did fluorescent light, followed by a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahhhh shit I didn't mean to put 'em in the cryo pouch.\" Fuzzy, calloused fingers felt around and you let them find you, for some reason you felt safe with this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fingers wrapped around you and gently lifted you out to the face of the jowled Great Dane, his ears tuned in as he inspected your queer form. You stared into his eyes as he did yours and after a moment he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't show any fear of me, yet I seem to be way more powerful than you, I could kill you right now before you could react, why? Do you even understand me?\" He says slowly, rolling you in his palm. You were about to speak when the Danes ear twitched and he looked up before looking back at you and putting a finger to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He set you down on the cot and drew a knife from the discarded belt, its blade glowing with what looked like hot plasma. He stood up, and you watched him stalk silently over to a crate in the corner of the room, just as what sounded like an engine starting up. The box lid slowly opened and the Dog froze, knife held backwards. A boar wearing a lab coat rose out of the box, only to freeze when he saw the Great Dane staring him down. They stood there for a second, but when the boar reached for something in his coat the Great Danes arm became a blur and as the plasma knife slid across the boars throat. After another second the Boar slumped back into the box and the Great Dane reached in and chuckled, pulling out a cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Poor bastard was reaching for this, I woulda' spared him if he told me that's all it was.\" He said putting it in his mouth and cutting the end, holding the blade to it until it lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He made his way back to you and stood above you, taking a pull before puffing the smoke out, showering you in the cloud and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, who's side are you on lil' guy, and what should Papa Bale do with ya?\" He said taking another pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You HAD felt safe, but now you're wondering if you were making the that opinion only because the guy was attractive...</span></span></div></div>",

The dog was interrogating you, not striking up simple conversation, and if you weren't careful he may do to you what he did to that boar guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Guns blazing....interesting phrase.

That much checks out, not to mention you aren't a species I've seen before, not even mentioning how small you are....\" He said taking another draw from the cigar and grabbing a chair before taking a seat, slouching with his knees apart out towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While seated he pulled down some two way screen from the ceiling that seemed to show neighboring star systems, each with names and listing settled worlds in the systems. He put his fingers on the screen and splayed them out, zooming the map out until a galaxy that looked like the milky way. You sat up a bit and he glanced at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know what this is Rookie?\" He asked raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course, it's the milky way galaxy. Its the galaxy earth is in.\" You say excitedly, being able to express that you know something at least. He smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You do realize you just informed a larger, more advanced race to the whereabouts of your home world, right?\" He said with an amazed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pale and slouch a bit, you hadn't even made the assumption that saying such a blatant fact could have just doomed humanity. He chuckled a bit and shifted in his seat, grumbling and scratching at his tight suit. Before you eyes the suit seemed to dissolve, it started with his gloved hands and went up his arm and stopped past his shoulder like a tank top. Then the neck readjusted where it was originally just underneath his jaw, it faded down and turned into a V neck, exposing the top of his impressive chest. The material still hugged his skin, but it looked like it became more thin as well and less constraining. His legs went from having pads on his thighs to where you could make out his muscle groups. The biggest thing you noted that made you turn red was what originally was a rotund, all around smooth bulge, sagged and outlined a sheath and plump balls. You stare with your jaw slightly open and he blinked at you before realizing what your expression was from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah! That's right, you wouldn't know what nanomesh is. I got a chip installed in my spine that lets me control this layer of robotic fibers that cover my skin. I can control where I'm covered as well as density and hardness. It can be as thin as paper or as thick as a board, as long as it's attached to my fur or skin. Most imperial agents and soldiers have it, the stuff is also good at blocking plasma and energy projectiles, and is some way resistant to kinetic ones, but only when we make it thicker.\" He said as he zoomed into one arm of the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's cool, but....can you take it off?\" You ask, trying to get the conversation off of earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh...not really, taking off the stuff would require me to have to re-calibrate the fiber hive to my chip. The best I can do without having to go back under the knife is to make the fibers into a ring or ankle bracelet or something like that. Which I do often, but most of the time I wear it like this or into something like boxers or briefs. Anyway I'm interrogating you here Rookie, what are some neighboring systems.\" He says all that without tearing his eyes away from the screen. Maybe you could mislead him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umm I'm unsure, humans have a lot to figure out on our first planet, we haven't really been looking too hard beyond earth.\" You say, not quite lying. A growling noise came to your ears and you thought it as Bale growling at you, but it turned out to be his stomach, he eyed you and a chill ran over you from the glare in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Surely you've got something for me kid, if not I might just eat you.\" He said chuckling slightly, but the tone he said the threat made it very much a promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uhhh...our system has two stars-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"-And don't lie to me either, you're not gonna fool me I've heard it all.\" He said lookin away from the screen, not getting anywhere looking at the trillions of systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then...we are a single system, our star is oranish-yellow. And I think we have a binary system...like 4 or 5 light years from out planet.\" You say, crestfallen. Bale types the information in and seemed to get a couple hundred results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is earth like? Is it desert, tropical, frozen, or maybe all of that?\" He said looking at you more softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It has a bit of everything, continental with like 70% covered by water.\" You say, and once again he types that in, and the results shrink to a dozen or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You have four rocky planets and four gas giants, with an asteroid belt in between the two groups.\" He says quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Yes.....\" You say, beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale whistles amazed, and turns the screen to show you two corresponding points in the milky way. One point was labeled Sol C, and the other was labeled Sedi D. They were on almost parallel sides of the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rookie, you're a long way from home. Those eggheads pulled you from space that is more than double the furthest point that our explorations have taken us in the three centuries of space travel. And in my haste to get the job done I think you're stuck here now.\" He says sliding the screen back into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So then what happens now?\" You ask folding your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Two choices\" He said picking his cigar back up. \"I turn you over to the Empire, and you become a media and scientific sensation. We have yet to meet another species capable of communication, so you're something of a game changer. Or....you stick with me and I keep lil' ol' earth under wraps.\" He finished while taking a draw from his cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stare at the big Dane and sigh. \"I guess we should...\"</span></span></div></div>",

Not to mention it's covered in small, primitive lifeforms that are easily exploited.\" He said taking another drag of the cigar before standing up putting the chair back where he got it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what happens now?\" You ask skeptically, why was this guy inclined to keep you a secret from his civilization?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now I take a nap because as soon as we land I'm back to work.\" He said tapping the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The nanomesh began to recede until it only covered his pelvic region in the form of some briefs. He made a scooting motion with his hand and your eyes widened as he turned and his large rump came looming towards you. You jump out of the way just as the ass crashed into the bed. He clenched his cheeks once and turned to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not bad, you're quicker than you look.\" He said before taking a long pull from the cigar before flicking it into a box labeled 'TRASH VAC'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He rotated on the bed and sighed, closing his eyes and using his feet to kick his gun and utility belt off the bed and to the floor along with the armor plating he had been wearing. You were near his hip, and in a move of anger, used his fur to climb up onto his belly. His stomach was covered in small scars and spots where no fur grew, pink skin exposed. The entire abdomen flowed with raw muscle, meeting up to his chest having large pectoral groups. Beyond his large package behind you was strong legs that could easily crush a human house between them. You shook your head, getting out of your reverence for this gut and yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So if you're just gonna sleep, what the hell should I do??\" You say up to his large head in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're gonna shut the hell up or be my next snack. Just keep quiet and stay near me, don't go wandering up front, Cadek is bad news and Viktor will just step on ya'.\" He said scratching his thigh. You stood there pouting but figured you wouldn't get anywhere trying to strongarm a being larger than anything from your world, so you sat down and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And waited....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And waited...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an hour, you realized this guy was serious and you slid off of his stomach. It didn't take long however to realize the only way off the cot was to jump, which at your size would prove fatal to you. Without moving or any other sign that he was awake, Bale spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Figured out why I let you walk free finally huh?\" Bale said without opening his eyes or turning his head. You glared at him and were about to talk back but a speaker cut on and a younger voice came over the comms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Colonel, we'll be landing in 5, be ready they got us on a tight rotation.\" The comm said before clicking off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The nanomesh spread down Bale's legs and began to stack on itself as it made boots on the bottom of his feet. The fine details faded on his crotch as it returned to more of a rotund cup like feature, something like a jockstrap cup. He sat up as it formed a tank top and formed a ring around the base of his neck. Prongs materialized on certain parts of the mesh suit as he slid off the bed and used them to clip his armor onto the suit. Last was his belt that he clipped on and his pistol that clicked onto a piece of the thigh armor. He looked down at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Back to it then Rookie, get used to living dangerously and-\" As he was talking the door to the room flew open and faster than you could react, Bale had picked you up and lobbed you into his mouth. You blinked as your hoodie and jeans soaked up the saliva resting on his tongue. He must've still been hungry, since as soon as you entered, the chamber slowly became more and more moist. His tongue lashed lazily and moved you further back, causing you to panic as you approached the undulating back of his throat....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale shifted the human to the rear of his mouth so that he could talk to Cadek if he must. The panther noticed him pop something into his mouth and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eating anything good? I was hoping to catch you nude back here.\" Cadek said laughing. Bale just rolled his eyes at the perverted cat. But the Panther didn't change his resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't normally snack outside that strict schedule of yours Colonel, so if you're hiding contraband I need you to spit it out right now.\" The Private said holding a smile that could kill. Bale turned to slowly look at the cat, he may seem dense but he could tell Bale had picked up on something simply by keeping up with his routine, impressive and highly creepy at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just a piece of candy Cadek, pull your tail out of your ass.\" He said reaching down to pick up his duffel bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Swallow it then.\" Cadek pressed. Bale stood back up and turned so the shorter male could see his throat, and then swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could hear the conversation over the dribbling squelching that was the internal chorus of Bale, and quickly paled at that last comment by this Cadek fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bale wouldn't eat m-\" The tongue arched up and squeezed you into the back of his throat, making you tumble down the muscled tube that was the Great Danes throat. The muscles eagerly smashed you back and forth, tenderizing you for quick digestion down the line. You sputtered as you made your descent into the acrid hell that awaited you....</span></span></div></div>",

Cadek huffed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not gonna lie you did scare me there Col-\" Bale slugged the panther across the cheek, making Cadek drop onto his hands as his blood fell to the metal floor. Bale put a boot on the back of the Panthers head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Doubt your officer again and I'll show you what your liver looks like kid!\" Bale spat in anger before looking through the doorway at Viktor, the Corporal still having his helmet on.\"Viktor get us down asap, or I won't wait until a next time to kill the cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Viktor grunted an acknowledgement and turned back to the controls, the ship shaking as they entered Sedimars atmosphere. Bale needed to hurry and get somewhere private to retrieve the human, or the first contact with another sentient species was going to be dog shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You suddenly broke free from the crushing embrace that was Bale's esophagus, tumbling a short way before hitting a knotted surface that was covered with mucus. It was hard to see anything, but you knew you were in the Dane's stomach. Detecting a morsel, the stomach began to gyrate as the digestion process began. What made matters worse was that there was nothing currently in the stomach, meaning any acid that produced will not be diluted, and your end will be a quick and painful one. You stood up, the knees of your jeans already discolored and walked to the orifice that led further down the digestive track, sighing at the prospect of taking that way out, attempts to squeeze through it proved fruitless. You sat down with your head in your hands, accepting the fate of just being added to the waistline of an alien dog man....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale walked off the ship, staying ahead of the men assigned to him for the mission, keeping a brisk pace but not enough to go against his usual relaxed demeanor. He reached the terminal and turned around to face his charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viktor feel free to enlist under my command on missions to come. Cadek, don't show your mug on my applicant list again.\" He said turning and walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He rounded a corner and made his way into a bathroom, locking a stall and beginning to retch, his stomach turning in pain at the action. As he did so, someone from the stall next to him spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"First time flying pal? It get's easier dude I promise.\" He said and the sound of a magazine page flipping could be heard. Bale rolled his eyes and tried again, feeling something coming up his throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stomach convulsed and threw you around, struggling to hold onto you before finally relenting and shooting you back up the dogs gullet. With a final retch, you fell free from the hot mouth Bale and into a pool of cool water, when you surfaced, you sputtered and quickly deduced you were in a toilet bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bale, what the he-\" He grimaced and quickly grabbed you out of the water. And someone spoke nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You talkin' to yourself dude? that ain't healthy.\" The voice said before grunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale grabbed some toilet paper and dried you off before opening a front pouch on his belt and dropping you in without saying a word. You fell in as the case clicked shut, sealing you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale sighed and made his way into a mess hall that the terminal had, grabbing himself a plate of food and settling down to eat. Not more than a moment later however a Monitor lizard in military dress uniform sat down across from him, sliding a folder across the counter. Bale flipped it open while he ate. A tall smiling tiger in a suit had his arms around two smaller females as he walked into a club named 'Le Chat Noir\". Bale eyed the Monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what's this guys deal?\"  Bale said stuffing a roll into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's an arms dealer, the lab you just got back from was funded by him, his name is Fahred Styr and he his wanted by our Dread Sovereign dead, deadline is 72 hours, other inquisitors are on the move, first one to get his head gets 50 million credits.\" The monitor said standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's a lot of money for one itsy bitsy tiger.\" Bale said through chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Our lord doesn't want this planet to be eaten by a black hole.\" The monitor said leaving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale huffed, dropping a piece of roll into the case with the human and hurried off to find this 'Fahred'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After awhile he top of the case clicked back open and you were plucked out and tossed onto a ratty bed in a ratty apartment, holes in the ceiling and water stains on the walls. A kitchenette was in one corner, and a door to a bath and toiled in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where are we? You ask, looking around incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Home sweet home\" Bale said sarcastically. Taking his belt off once again and hanging it on a clothing rack. His armor pieces came next as he placed them in a metallic case that hissed shut and sealed when he was done. Next his nanomesh retreated, but you averted your eyes as the suit retreated into the form of a ring on his left hand. Bale stretched and grabbed a folder that was near you and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Human, you don't have to be so modest, I'm okay if you look at my junk, you've already been inside me after all. And besides, it sounds like you're spending the rest of your life with me, so get used to it.\" He said sipping from a coffee cup and adjusting the blinds of the one window in the room, opening it up and showing you a world of metal and concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Outside was a place that reminded you of some dystopian future, flying vehicles soared in invisible lanes around grungy buildings that scraped the sky, many times taller than anything man has made. Bale sat down on the bed opening the folder and reading its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is that?\" You ask walking over to him, he glanced at you then back at the folder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My next job, the guy who was funding the lab we just got back from. 50 million is on his head, but I might just leave it to the other guys, I'd like some time off honestly and these are really my only chances to get it.\" He said closing the folder and throwing it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But if he funded the lab that brought me here, he may be the answer for me getting home.\" You say, getting excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Should've left you in my gut, that way you at least would fit the persona of the annoying little turd you are.\" He said laying back and closing his eyes, letting out a breath of ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bale please, I wanna go home, no offense but this world is terrifying for me, you're terrifying to me.\" You say honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks, you're really winning me over.\" He said propping his head up as he turned on his side, his hefty sack slid down his thigh as he rested his other hand down the length of his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And with 50 million you could maybe get a house with two bedrooms.\" You added, trying to not look at his crotch. He chuckled a little at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't be able to enjoy the money, I'll just be on another mission as soon as this one is up.\" He said grabbing an unlabeled bottle from the night stand and popping it, drinking what was probably booze out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then why did you offer to let me stay with you if you aren't gonna help me?\" You say crossing your arms and shivering, your clothes still retained the toilet water, Bale picked up on the weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno, you're cute? I'd like a pet? I can't say why Rookie.\" He said taking another swig, his other hand pressing his belly, resulting in a loud belch from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And why do you call me that? My name is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No offense Rookie, using your name makes you a person, and I'm a dog that gets easily attached, Rookie is a fill in that fits because you keep making Rookie mistakes like giving yourself away. If I call you by your name, I'll get attached, and tomorrow morning when I step on you, or swallow you without realizing it, I'll mourn you, and in my line of work that gets people killed. So you're Rookie, and you are my pet, welcome to your new life.\" He said gesturing around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're lying to yourself, why'd you save me twice already? And why'd you give me a concerned look when I shivered a second ago? You don't want to admit that you're already attached to me.\" You say, keeping a facade of confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah sure whatever helps you sleep at night kid.\" He said breaking eye contact and grimacing, you had him but didn't press it....</span></span></div></div>",

You turned beet red in an instant and looked at the ceiling, trying to ignore the tug you felt in your jeans from the glance you got. Bale chuckled and laid on his back, using his other hand to pluck you up by your hoodie and drop you on his belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C'mon Rook, help me out here, I seldom get to take it easy these days, every chance is a small blessing.

You noted the small holes and discoloring the garment now held due to the stomach acids from earlier. Sighing and recognizing the potential dangers interacting with the godly dog brings, you made your way onto his pubic region, the flesh giving under your feet and the soft, short firm coat tickled your feet. His hand lazily pumped, smashing into the folds that were the sheath around the base and sending a ripple through the region with every hit. <i>plap..plap..plap</i>. Not knowing what to do you got on your hands and knees and rubbed at his skin where on a human a forest of pubic hair would've been, the layer of fat giving way to your weight as you awkwardly massaged it. The stroking slowed and Bale chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell are ya doin'? Why don't you massage right HERE...\" He said tapping his thumb on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You relented and stood up, making your way to his member. The organ radiated heat, and when you put a cool hand on it, you could feel the blood pumping beneath your fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Get whatever those pants are off, their ruggedness will rub me the wrong way.\" Bale said looking down at you, his snout pointed at the ceiling still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took them off, leaving yourself in boxers, and tossed the jeans where your hoodie lay back on his lower stomach. You turned back and pressed your body awkwardly against the motley flesh of the cock, rubbing your hands in circles and sliding your body up and down slowly, timing yourself to go the opposite direction that Bales hand traveled. He moaned and began to pant, and he quickened his beating. You also began to get into it, and even let him take you with his palm and pull you along his length. As he beat himself with you in his clutches, he made his strokes longer. Your chest grazed his glans, which excited him more. He slid his palm over his head and left you on top of it, while his hand continued its motions. Not sure what to do here either, you slipped a foot into his slit, and the opening clenched and pulled a little bit more of you into the cock, Bale nearly howled. His eyes were closed and his back arched as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Wh-Whatever you're doing, gimme more, more human!\" He said panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not really wanting to kill his buzz, you slipped your other leg in and put both up to your knees in Bales cock. The walls clenched and undulated  as Bale bucked his hips lightly, obviously craving more of you in him. You on the other hand weren't keen on being inside this guy again. Bale seemed to not care as his other hand easily grabbed your grappled form and began to feed you down into his length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"B-Bale! I don't wanna go all the way in!\" You say in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale didn't listen, or didn't care as he pressed you down up to your chest, catching your arms in the member. Deeper within the muscles were much stronger, and you could feel yourself slowly sliding in. Pre cum began to flow past you, acting as lube and accelerating you descent. You squirmed and wriggled trying to escape, but it only caused more pre and your consumption to escalate. You were up to your neck when Bale finally opened his eyes, only to laugh at you and pressed a finger on your hear, sliding you in completely with a small pop. His rhythmic pumping dragged you further down, darkness enveloping you as you got further and further from the winking slit of light above. A gurgling noise came from below and you only had a sensation at your feet to prepare for the gushing deluge that was Bales jizz as it rocketed past you. Instead going with it, the walls around you relaxed and you found yourself going down a slip-n-slide of horror as you were devoured by Bales groin. With a tumble, you were shot into freefall before crashing into a fleshy chamber that was seizing and convulsing, increasing its convulsions as you crash into it. A distant howl rings out and that is all that your senses recieve save from the sound of your own breath, the wet spongy floor that assaulted your touch, and the stale air you breathed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale creamed himself, he couldn't help it. His spunk plastered his chest and belly, coating the queer discarded clothing of the human in the white stuff and gluing it to his body. He panted for a second as he felt the human slide deep within him, knowing he should be worried about that (More so for his health and not the human.) But decided to bathe in the afterglow instead. That is until a sharp pain that was the worst and best thing he ever felt tugged in his right testicle. He let out a mournful howl that got a bang on the wall from nearly all his neighbors. He sat up and stared at his family jewels, and took a morbid fascination as tiny bulges and bumps would momentarily pervert the smooth roundness of his nut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fascinating, he fell straight in rather than flowing around through my prostate and vas deferen...didn't know that was even possible.\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had expected the human just to be wedged in his dick, or end up near his bladder. This was something entirely alien. His cock retreated back into his plump sheath and he rubbed his nuts lovingly as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rook can you hear me?\" He said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The human began to speak, his surgically enhanced ears picked up on it, but he couldn't make out the exact words. Bale stood up, and when he did the Rookie tumbled in his sack and almost brought him to his knees. Bale had been kicked in the balls more times than he cared to count, but this was something else, not pain but ecstasy threatened to conquer him. He gasped and grabbed the bed. Despite being spent his cock head poked back out of the sheath at the sheer volume of pleasure he received. He hobbled slowly to a kitchen cabinet and pulled out his medical bag and retrieved a wireless stethoscope from it. He put the earpiece in and attached the adhesive diaphragm to his right nut. He repeated his earlier question, and winced as he got a full scream from Rook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"YES I CAN HEAR YOU, CAN YOU FINALLY HEAR ME?\" He said, and Bale's ears were ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now I can, not so loud. Do you have an idea of where you are right now?\" He asked stifling a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno, your bladder? Hurry and piss me out Bale, drink some water and get the with the flow.\" Rook said, obviously not joking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmmmm not quite, your in my right testicle. Tell me all about it please.\" He said laughing, but also curious what his insides look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dark and stale, get me the hell out NOW.\" He shouts. This guy is no fun at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I would but as you probably know I'm dried up, gimme an hour and you should be good to go. This does give me some ideas however when it comes to my bounty...you could actually be of use...\" He said rubbing his chin and rubbing his sore nuts with the other. Rook was obviously less than pleased with that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"An hour?? How old are you? I know some people who are ready to go again in 10 minutes. You're asking me to stay in an alien ballsack for a goddamn hour!\" He said, raising his voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't get much say in the matter Rook, with that attitude I should leave you overnight and paint the wall with whats left of ya in the morning. And besides, I have an alien in my balls, YOU'RE the one from elsewhere.\" he said jostling the orbs and feeling the human roll around, it felt heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sperm isn't acidic....unless yours is...\" He said unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Only one way to find out, tell me how you feel in an hour...\" Bale said sliding back onto the bed and flicking on the TV hanging over the kitchenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an hour, Bales balls are looking more plump, he had maintained a conversation with Rook throughout the hour. Rook deduced what Bale already knew, his jizz wasn't acid. After a good laugh at the humans expense he decides to...</span></span></div></div>",

Rook seemed to detect it had been way past an hour, because his passive aggressive chit chat had devolved into insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bale, I'm up to my chest in a jizz jacuzzi, and besides the tingling I get from what I assume is sperm, I need you to get me out.\" The human cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale rubbed his balls lazily, basking in his capture still. His thighs rolled his jewels back and forth, and he could feel the human sloshing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmmmm I don't think I will now Rook, I got something a present for you that I'm gonna work on, and can't have you peeking. Also this adhesive patch I'm using to hear ya I\u2019m is irritating me, so I'm just gonna take it back off.\" He said gripping a corner of the diaphragm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bale you motherfu-\" Rook began but Bale ripped the patch off, wincing as he pulled a couple of the fine hairs that covered his orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stretching, he stood up and made it over to his workbench in the corner of the studio apartment. As he walked he could feel Rook sliding about, but the pleasure was a little less acute, must've been because the spunk kept Rook from rolling as much. He plopped down at the bench, moving his gun and belt out of his way, and pulled out a strand of fabric and some electronics....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some time passed, how much though you were unsure. Bale had gone awhile before moving about again, his body making a chorus of noise has he was active.. The spunk levels were no longer growing, and it seemed content to leave you enough room to breath. Your skin crawled in the stuff, and at first you had thought you were being digested but it seemed to be the microscopic sperm cells making contact with your skin, being so small let you actually detect them. The prison dropped slightly and the contents within began to slosh along with you, Bane had been sitting and had just stood up. The room began to bounce and a grunt could be heard, he was getting you out!. After a few minutes of the rhythmic bouncing you found yourself squeezed up a tight tube that closed up behind your feet. How you came out this time and and not when you were in the process of going down was beyond you as you launched out onto the bed. You sputtered and turned a glare on the panting dog. He stood there with his tongue hanging out, his enormous chest heaving. One arm was propped on his hip as the other still held his drooping and dripping cock in a relaxed grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you have any idea what it's like in-\" You only got so much out before deft fingers plucked you by a leg and tossed you into his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fear over came you as you thought he had finally decided to just eat you and be done with you. This absolved as instead he seemed to be cleaning you, his tongue overlapping your body like a blanket and sucking on you like a piece of candy. His tasting and cleaning was so intense that it ripped your emaciated boxers off you, sending them flying into the gaping throat beyond. He spat you back out after about two minutes, he himself apparently had been cleaning up the mess he made on the bed. You shook yourself off and looked at him with clear malice. He just smiled his innocent expression as he walked your now naked form over to his workbench. He put his hand down and you climbed onto the table, where something akin to a wetsuit lay, except that it was your size. You blink then look back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Put it on, I need to see if I got the measurements and everything right.\" He said an you proceeded to slip it on, it fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The suit was a light grey color, and covered your hands and feet as well, Bale made a gesture for you to imitate, where you tap your jawline twice. You jumped as a visor folded out of the suit collar, just like it did with the ones Bale wore on his mission. The helmet clicked into place, and a holographic reading popped up in the bottom right corner, stating outside temperature as well as a suit status diagram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is cool Bale, but why did you make me a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Test run time!\" Bale shouted ecstatically, plucking you up again and holding you over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watch in primal horror as his maw opens, strands of saliva stringing between his fangs as he tongue rolls out over his bottom lip. His throat beyond his mouth opened up, pulsing as it awaited its meal. Bale closed his eyes, and somehow you tore your own away from the gaping throat and saw that Bal's cock had slid back out of its sheath, the bastard was enjoying being so domineering and in control. You thought it was a joke, and then you quickly realize you were assuming too much of how Bale is a good guy as he let go of you. You plummet while hollering, past his pearled fangs and long tongue, easily down his throat a good foot by his standards before the muscles caught you, guiding you once again to the pit of his stomach. With a squelch you were deposited into the dark moving chamber of Bales gut. Your breath fogged up the visor and would quickly recede as you glanced around. Bale's voice in your ear scared the shit out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come in Rook, you still alive in there?\" He said with humor in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale? You big stupid bitch! Stop eating me!\" You say screaming. Bales laughter over the comm wasn't helping the helpless frustration that permeated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Rook, I enjoy it too much. As you can hear the suit has a comm, click the right side of the helmet before we continue.\" He said and you did, A beam of light came from it and illuminated the knotted, muscular walls of the stomach wherever your head turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you ate me to show off a headlight and a radio?\" You say incredulously. Bale had to stifle a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No I ate you because the suit should protect you from becoming fat on my ass. I want you to make your way through my GI tract and test it's durability. I cleaned myself out farther down so you shouldn't encounter any excrement, but you better hurry. As you probably can see my gut is empty and I'm making food as we speak, mainly to get the gut at its full lethality, but also because I'm hungry and you're not staying.\" He said with that stupid smile in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This still isn't making any sense, did you just make this suit so we can revisit a kink of yours instead of losing me on the first time?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, this is for the bounty mission, you're gonna be my leverage against the target. The document says he goes either way with sex partners, I go with men. You're gonna be in my nuts when we begin, and in his guts when I'm done. The suit makes sure you stay alive during the ordeal.\" he said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't agree to that.\" You say in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No but you do want to get more info on those labs. This guy knows he has a bounty, but he also has a club and image to keep, I won't be able to get anywhere near him with weapons, so ejecting you into him with poison at your disposal should be enough to get him talking. We get what we need, I shoot him, we go. Simple Right? Now get moving, my pyloric sphincter should be nearby, I'm about to get digging into this spaghetti.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You follow his advice and quickly find a puckered orifice. Luckily Bale's body didn't evolve to keep something alive from going further in, and after a few seconds you squeezed through and slid down one of the most bizarre slides ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBale sat on the bed again watching TV, his fingers thrumming across his muscled gut as he eyed it occasionally. He had expected to feel the human crawling his way through him, but was slightly disappointed that no such sensation occurred. It had been well over 30 minutes now, how long did it take a one inch critter to clamour its way through his intestines? Worried slightly that the suit compromised, he clicked his earpiece on and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking so long Rook?\" He asked, taking on his commanding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I think I'm nearing the end here...\" He said followed by him grunting, and the feeling of something rolling came from Bales lower belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think you are, lemme lift the legs and spread the cheeks for your arrival.\" He said chuckling, doing just as he said he would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You tumble down the last stretch of large intestine, shaking yourself and standing up. the walls narrowed and stretched, leading up to a puckered sphincter that was no doubt Bale's backside. With a farewell to the last of your dignity you got on your hands and knees as the walls closed in, and Bale became alert to your presence. The walls tensed and squished you, trying to pull you back up into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bale I'm almost out, quit it.\" You said through clenched teeth. He responded with a panting tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Rook, I can't help it, you feel sooooo good in there.\" He said as another clench threatened to pull you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You weren't sure if he was actually messing with you our just caught up in primal impulse, but needless to say you were having none of it as you quickly and roughly crawled up to the sphincter and shoved a hand into it. This was a dumb idea as your burst of speed and sudden intrusion almost caused the sphincter to cut off your arm. Bale moaned over the comm, and again you were dragged backwards as he clenched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Change of plans Rook, I'm assigning you to guard the rear entrance while I go on break.\" He said in a commanding tone, but was obviously smiling as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You fucking mutt.\" You say as you were tossed about, his rectum having its way with you as he did who knows what outside...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you're gonna end up this guys mainstreet or get shot into the back of his throat.\" He said over the radio as he clenched even harder, your ribs screaming as your visor pressed into the folds of the inside of Bales anus. A tiny bit of light seeped through a wedge, only to close up as you were pulled back up into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale arched his back and flipped over onto his stomach, idly grinding his groin on his bed and pumping his large cheeks as his new friend/pet squirmed deep within. He sighed and slowed himself, smiling and pressing his face into his pillow until he held still. He put a hand on his right cheek and rubbed the large muscle group before giving it a slap and making another content sigh. Rook struggled within like a worm on a hook, writhing against Bales superior guts and not understanding how utterly useless it was. His ear piece buzzed with his grunts and curses, and Bale relished in the domination he was inflicting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A knock on the door interrupted his joy and pleasure, and Bale instantly went into his work mode. His face lost emotion as he hopped off the bed and grabbed his gun from the holster on his bench. As he did he pulled his cock back into its sheath and clenched up to completely immobilize Rook. The human didn't give up so as Bale made his way to the door he clenched in a series aof strong movements, pulling the human away from his anus and holding him deeper in his rectum, far enough where he didn't need to stay clenched. He made it to the door and looked out only to curse, putting the gun on a small table  and flinging open the door on a black panther about a good foot and a half shorter than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cadek the private blinked in surprise at his naked former squad leader, glancing at Bale's groin then back at the annoyed expression that the Great Dane held for him. Cadek was wearing fatigues still but no armor, his nanomesh concentrated into an armband on his wrist. He broke into a fake smile as he met the eyes of Bale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Colonel, I came to apologize for my rash and unruly behavior that I showed you back on the ship.\" He said looking away, making Bale squint warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Apology accepted, now get the hell out of here before i teach you how to rip someones throat out with just your fingers.\" Bale said, then noticed something about the posture of the cat. \"Show me your hands Cadek...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cat did, in a lightning fast response where he pulled a handgun on Bale. The dog cursed as he tilted his head and gripped Cadeks wrists as he pulled the trigger, a bullet passing by Bale's eye by an inch. Bale quickly overpowered Cadek and pushed him against the wall across the hallway from his apartment door. He slammed the cats hands with the gun above his head and held Cadek there while growling deeply inches from the cats face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fear momentarily flashed across the Cat's face, but he controlled himself, bringing a knee up onto Bales exposed balls, and if Bale wasn't taller than the cat, he was sure he would've been neutered just then. Still the pain was horrendous and was enough to make his hold waver. Cadek broke free and tackled Bale in the gut, pushing him back into his apartment all the way onto his bed. Bale grunted as he was thrown prone on his bed, and momentarily caught something being said in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"BALE? WHAT\"S HAPPENING OUT THERE? I-\" Bale stopped focusing on Rook as Cadek put one hand on Bales throat and pointed the gun at his eye with the other.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale gripped the gun wrist again and pulled it towards him while moving to the side from its aim, catching Cadek off guard as he unloaded rounds into the mattress where Bale's head had been a moment ago. Bale pivoted and wrapped his legs around Cadek and pulled the smaller male against his body and rolled. They tumbled to the floor with Bale on top, and Bale straddled Cadek, planting his knees on the cats biceps, quickly taking the gun from the stunned cat and planting the smoking barrel on his temple, sizzling the fur there. The room went deathly quiet besides the panting of the two males and voices outside who were investigating the gun shots. Bale gripped Cadeks jaw and twisted his head so he looked the Colonel in the eye, and the smell of fear piss was filling the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So Cadek, anything you'd like to explain? Because even though you're petty, you wouldn't try to kill an officer simply because I humiliated you. If you tell me you MIGHT save yourself a bullet.\" Bale said pushing the gun harder against Cadeks temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I was approached by a guy who informed me there was a bounty on your head for 200 million. Almost everyone in the lower districts know it Bale. I knew where you lived so I thought-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That you could beat everyone to it; and in the process you led everyone to it.\" Bale said looking up cursing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry Bale, I need the money, my parents-\" Cadek began but just took the butt of the gun across the temple as Bale stood up, knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale threw the gun on his bed, his nanomesh spreading from his ring and forming its typical full body battlesuit. He made it form plates on his chest and along his stomach, it wouldn't stop a direct bullet but it could deflect one. The suit stopped at the base of his neck, and formed boot treads on the bottom of his feet. He clicked the earpiece and relaxed his bowels to take pressure off the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Rook, I was attacked, I gotta leave you in for awhile until I get to one of my safehouses.\" He said as he rubbed his bulge, his nuts still aching from the blow Cadek delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I think after that, the suit is good, though me not so much, your ass is ruthless Bale.\" Rook said sounding exhausted. \"Who attacked you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One of my privates, the guy we're after is placing bounties on the renowned hunters to even the odds and chase them off. Me being 'Bale the Pale' is working against me on this one.\" Bale said grabbing his belt and clipping it on, before grabbing his gun from the table near the door and holstering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rook didn't reply as Bale threw on a hoodie to cover his nanomesh, and sliding up a pair of athletic pants. His belt was kind of obvious, but in a crowd they won't be able to see it. He threw up his hood and walked out of his apartment. People were whispering in the hallway and trying to deduce where the gunshots had come from. He slipped into the nearby stairwell before anyone noted him and walked down two floors before slipping onto it to catch an elevator....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The walls moved and played with you, but unconsciously. During the apparent scuffle, you had been squeezed and thrown about, your whole body ached and it wouldn't surprised surprise you if you had a broken rib or three. Whenever Bale stopped moving, the walls would pulse and almost prod you, checking on you and you'd wriggle slightly in response. Despite the dog's earlier statements, he seemed to be growing fond of you, and despite the hell you just went through, you still found all of this kind of hot. Badass alien dog bounty hunter and all....</span></span></div></div>",

A few looked away from their commute to note the gun on open display at Bales hip, but no one challenged him as he made it the few blocks to a small storage facility that he owned a unit within. He punched in the code and slipped into the building, going down an aisle until he came upon his unit. He slid a keycard and the door opened to a furnished room of concrete. It was decorated with a cot, a chair, camping supplies and perishables, as well as medical supplies and some weapons. He closed the door behind him and sighed, stripping out of the clothes and instantly filling up his belt with magazines and clips of ammunition before removing an SMG that hung on the wall. A wriggle in his lower intestine reminded him of the Rook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hang on kid, papa Bale needs to make sure he wasn't followed before I take the time to get you out of me...\" He said in his earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale turned on a monitor that was linked to the surrounding surveillance systems on the block, and after a moment he sighed and sat down on the cot with his head in his hands.

As he took off the sweats and hoodie however, the monitor beeped a warning as a proximity alarm went off. He shot his head up to see three heavily armored soldiers walking cautiously up to his storage unit. With a curse he dove off the cot and and grabbed the SMG he had taken off the wall. A charge went off and Bale rolled behind the monitor desk as gunfire tore through the safe house. Ballistics and lasers shredded his stockpile in seconds. After a second the shooting stopped and Bale heard a click of a grenade being pulled. He popped up to see a soldier pulling his arm back to lob it into the room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale aimed down the sights of the smg and shot the soldier in the elbow where his armor was weakest, causing the soldier to lurch a bit and drop the grenade at the feet of his allies.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"FUCK\" One of the soldiers shouted as they all scrambled away from the explosive seconds before it went off. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale grabbed a HUD visor from the monitor desk. The headpiece was a glass visor that stretched in front of his eyes and displayed holographic information. It pulsed and Bale could see the heartbeats of the soldiers on either side of the entrance of the room through the walls. He smiled, his nanomesh reinforcing his chest a bit more as well as his thighs and he leaped out of the room, lighting up the two soldiers that dove to the right of the room. Their armor was too thick to penetrate with the weapons caliber, but it stunned them long enough for him to turn and knock the Assault Rifle from the surprised Anthro's arm. He looked like some sort of Rabbit underneath the Shock Helmet, Bale didn't really care as he pulled his plasma knife out and plunged it up into the helmet, the knife searing through the rabbits own nanomesh and into his brain. Bale withdrew the knife and picked up the assault rifle, turning and taking aim at the others as they were just getting their bearings.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good Fight.\" Bale said as he pumped one round into the closest soldiers neck, dropping him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Second soldier fired before he at sighted on Bale, and his bullet punched into the Dane's thigh, making him grunt in agony. He put the next round through the helmet of the last soldier before falling to a knee.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bale grimaced as he hefted himself back into the destroyed safehouse and grabbed a medkit. The bullet was still in his leg, and he couldn't touch the wound without cursing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rook...\" He said weakly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-Yeah?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm getting you out, I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Light shined through your suit helmet as you slipped out of Bale's anus and fell a short way to some charred cot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Move...\" Was the only warning you got before Bales rear began to descend toward you, his large cheeks threatening to engulf you once again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You dove out behind him, where he didn't attempt to grab you/<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Get out of the suit and scale my right thigh, I need you to tie some nylon onto a bullet, and its all I need is that suit to make the wound septic.\" He said in a low, rough voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You strip down to your boxers, leaving the suit where it was and rounded to the right thigh. Bale was naked except for his nanomesh forming a tourniquet near where his thigh met the hip. You scaled his short fur, and came on top to see the sight of his ghost white fur being tarnished red with his blood, a hole a little wider than you sat in the middle of his thigh, and the muscle spasmed beneath you. Bale handed you a loop of nylon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You want me...to go <i>inside</i> the wound?\" You ask incredulously.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please...I have the stuff to make my leg good as new, I just need the bullet out, I usually have someone on standby to help me in these situations, but they've probably heard about the bounty too, I can't trust anyone.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you want to trust the guy you held captive with your rectum?\" You ask annoyed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You scoff. \"What's in it for me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I won't eat you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\".....Fair Enough.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You walk to the wound, Bale wincing from the minute pressure you caused. You spread your arms and slip into the pooling blood that rested into the wound. You took a deep breath and dove down, the wound about six feet deep to you before your hands found the bullet. WIth a deftness you didn't know you had, you looped the nylon around the bullet and tugged the line. Bale yanked the bullet out with you, and you went arching out with a stream of blood and landed on Bales upper thigh, just as the Big Dog passed out from pain....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBale came around after about 2 minutes. You had stayed on his thigh, knowing you wouldn't have gotten far without him. He winced and sat up, pulling an item out of the medical bag nearby that scanned the wound before a syringe pumped into it a substance that quickly filled the hole. You literally watched as it replicated tissue and skin before sprouting the white fur of Bale. Leaving an almost round spot on the thigh that was clean and surrounded by his dried blood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did....Did that just replicate your skin?\" You said in disbelief.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, its a synthetic tissue that copies DNA and pastes it essentially, my body will slowly dissolve the synthetic flesh, replacing it with my real muscle and skin, while I'm able to walk around like nothing is missing.\" He said as his Nanomesh began to take on its usual full body covering.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's incredible...\" You say as he plucks you up and tosses you behind him, near your suit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Put it on we gotta move, I've been stationary and more fight is definitely coming.\" He said standing up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not going back up you ass am I?\" You ask. He smiled at you before saying.</span></span></div></div>",
