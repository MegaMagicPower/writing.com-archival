Providing warmth and love all in the same moment... from your seat you have a view of her underside, from her chin to her tailtip. You could see her for all she was, Her sex, as you knew, was inflamed with heat, and it was dripping. She was waiting to be mated, but she had to wait for the one she chose to get comfortable with the relationship... but how long will her patients last...<br>\r\nYou shook your head and laid out next to her belly using her leg that was near you as a pillow... and as a side note... her scales were soft... but very durable and able to protect her should she need it.</span></div></div>",

You realize that it might not be dark as the dragoness had you surrounded and covered for the night, and well she could just be blocking the light. You smile and relax just waiting for her to wake up. She does take her time as her calm breaths continue for what seems like hours. But she slowly wakes up. She purrs and yawns then her eyes, which are seemingly visible in the darkness under her wing look at you. <br>\r\nYou chuckle a little, \"Yeah, I am awake, so could I get up now and stretch, girl?\" She purrs and moves, her wing shuffles and lifts letting in the light that got in the cave, she stood and stretched as you got up and stretched yourself... looking at her now she was a bit bigger than a shire horse... you saw a few on the ranch not too far away and they looked big and tall, and well she was at least as tall if not a bit taller and wider than one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that you wanted to build on what could be, and not just a sex night and she was done with you.<br>\r\nYou pet her side, and think of something that the two of you could do that would be fun... well there was walking, but the dragoness loved the sky, that is what you got from her flying here. Then there was flying which she would perhaps enjoy sharing her ability with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask her, \"Would you like to go on a flight?\" <br>\r\nShe purred and you felt her shift, and she ducked her front down and pitched her rear high. You know what she is asking. \"Uh, girl I can't fly, you see these arms? They only hold and help me climb. I can't do that, besides we just met yesterday.\" You say<br>\r\nShe snorts, you pat her side to calm her down, \"Look could I ride on you, we could do that once I feel better about it,\"<br>\r\nShe sighs, but gives a purr as she puts her chest to the ground offering you her back. You climb on and wrap your legs as far around her neck as you could. Next was your arms just so that you were ready to hold onto her. She took it easy for the first bit as she walked out of her cave and into the day. She purred and her wings spread. You knew that what was next was going to be the tough part. She jumped and her wings gave a mighty downward thrust making her take off into the sky. The first minute was full of turbulence as she gained altitude. But after that first bit it was smooth. You took up your courage as you sat up and looked around. It was... amazing, there was no other words to describe it as you saw the clouds near you, you saw the lay of the land, you saw the town and the city. It was wonderful seeing it all before you... It just made you wonder how no one else had seen this before... then again no one else had a dragon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you felt a prick... not an uncomfortable one, but a prick and a sense of feeling... you felt happy and content. It wasn't your own joy and contentment, but it was the one of another... you pet the dragoness and she purred, the feeling changed to love for a second then back to what it was before... You could sense her feelings. You smiled and patted the sides of her neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hours later as She glided back to her cave and landed... You waited as she stretched then crouched for you to get off. You took that chance and well fell down as your legs were tired from holding onto the dragoness...<br>\r\nYou had to name her... You smile and look her over... her green color had given you an idea for a name..<br>\r\n\"If I could name you I would call you Emerald...\" You say, that got her attention as she purred and nuzzled you.<br>\r\n\"Would you like that to be your name?\" You ask she purred and nuzzled you more. She then walked into her cave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScore, a name for her and maybe you would feel aright with doing her... that is if it doesn't require flight to get anywhere with it... then again if it does then perhaps you could rig up something that would work...</span></div></div>",

It seemed odd, but you see her drink from it, she doesn't raise her tail any but you can still see that she is needy for some mating, sex... You had been rejected any time you asked a girl for some, but this dragoness. Emerald, she was offering it to you, all she wanted was mating, and with what you felt from her she would be willing to stay with you. You walked on up behind her and lightly touched her tail. She didn't move it or anything as you felt down her tail. She seemed oblivious to what you were doing, even the feeling connection you had with her was blank, she was happy that was all she didn't know what was about to take place... she was drinking water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her sex, in the dim light you saw she had her tailhole and sex... well someone is lucky it is like this, you don't know if you would have even gone any further if her sex was combined with her anus. Well you gently touch near her sex, she didn't raise her head or tail. You gently rubbed her soft scaly flesh near her sex... it was much softer here than on her belly or chest. Like the dragons had been created with defense in mind. However, their sacred areas were softer than the rest of them, as it would make sense as the male wouldn't want a ruff area when he pushed his cock into the female... or perhaps she was born specifically for you. You started touching her sex. That got her attention as you saw her head raise from the water and her tail slightly, ever so slightly, raised. She was now focusing on you, she welcomed you. But you felt from the slight connection from her, her eagerness and joy, she was waiting for you to push into her... Not your body, but your cock into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and press a finger into her sex, exploring it for now, she purred as you did so her joy bursting through the connection and to you. She was happy and she was having her content fill to the brim as her want was being answered finally. You felt her clit it was in the top her sex, burried a little inside... Perhaps a protective measure to keep it from being triggered during a fight should she have to face her belly to an opponent. You felt a little more, pushing another finger into her... her sex wasn't even stretched with just those two, but she felt tight... perhaps it was the heat that made it tight, or perhaps she was waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue exploring, feeling testing... As you pushed more fingers in she was getting more and more aroused... her tail was now being held high, but not as high as it could go. One more finger and your hand was in her sex... her sex felt like it could expand... as if it was simply at this small size that you see, just so that you could help her in her heat... At this point she was panting, she really liked your curiosity. She didn't mind... You smile and ask, \"Well would you like to take this to that last step you want?\"<br>\r\nHer response was a loud trill, yes, she was ready for it.<br>\r\n\"I can't reach your sex with mine unless you lay on your back, Emerald.\" You tell her. She sighed but purred... it was like she wanted something else... You almost slap your forehead. She wanted to be mated in the sky... well you had no way of holding onto her belly in flight, much less have sex with her in the sky... that would require a harness of some sort as you would fall to your death should you lose your grip on her... and that was a chance you didn't want to take. So for now she would have to deal with sex on the ground. She pulled from you so your head left her lips with a wet slurp, she walked to where she slept for the night and laid down rolling to her back... she looked to you waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and undress and approach her... You decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Why make it fast? You wanted to enjoy the experience, and by extension you wanted her to love it too. So you started by walking to her head and reaching out to her... she purred and put her head in your hand... or rather leaned her head to you and rested her jaw in your hand as her head was nearly as big as your torso. At any rate you gently kissed her muzzle, right on her lips. She purred and licked at you... You caught her tongue and licked at it with your own. She purred and drew your head into her mouth... so that you and her were giving each other deep kisses... her mouth parted to let you kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her kissed like this for seemingly minutes before you let her go and pulled back she purred and nuzzled you. You smiled and nuzzled her back as you started petting her jaws before going down her neck, kissing her every so often. You scratched at her chest as you walked down to her belly. You rubbed her belly back to her rear legs. There you made your way to her tail and climbed up. Once you were seated on her tail you had a clear view of her tailhole and sex. She purred looking at you wanting what was to come... You smile, and pet her belly and run your hand down to her sex. You feel her pleasure jump when you did that... she must be very sensitive to any touch down here at this time... You smile and gently press a finger into her... then again it could be that she is aroused and any touch down here would make it spike. You rub her lips up and down and even touched her clit again... her clit was at the same spot as before... in a spot your cock would rub against once you started...<br>\r\nShe started panting as she felt this shivering as each wave of pleasure hit her... and those waves of pleasure traveled across your link with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to broaden a bit as her voice started being heard... but for now you couldn't make sense of what she was saying. You rubbed her lips till she gave a whine from the pleasure and lack of mating... That is exactly what her emotions said, she wanted it now. You started collecting all of her arousal and juices and slicked them over your cock as you moved on up and lined your cock with her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you plunged your cock into her, it was like a glass window shattering as the connection that you had with her broadened to a full on rider and dragon link... You pant as her pleasure was shared with you. You moan with her as your cock rubs her clit making more pleasure blow through her and you. And the pumping brought it to another level...<br>\r\n'Oh yes, I have been waiting for you my rider.' She moaned... Or that is who you thought it was, she happened to be the only one there besides yourself, and well she was the only other one in pleasure. So it made sense that she was the one talking to you in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pumped into her making her moan, You moan too... you moan her name, \"Emerald... you feel so good!\" and that was not a lie, she was nice and tight for you, yet so soft it felt like heaven decided to wrap your cock in warm silk... Add to that the massage you were feeling and that is how it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pumped into her a few more times before hilting into her as the final wave of pleasure made you collapse on her belly... She too had hit her climax as she laid back purring enjoying the fulfillment of her desire...<br>\r\nYou pant as your energy takes its time recovering. She was happy and you could feel her, not just her emotions but her being was now connected to you... not her sex., but her mind was linked to you because you are her rider, and mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took hours for either of you to recover... though once you did you just remained in her sex as she raised her head and looked at you, 'All that is missing now is the mating flight, my loving rider.' She said.<br>\r\n\"Well I can't do that as you can tell I can barely reach you unless you crouch or lay down. But for now I would like to sleep like this... could we sleep like this?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n'Of course you can my loving rider. I will put my wings over you and sleep we shall.' She said as she yawned then her wings came up and laid over you and her rear legs.</span></div></div>",

You rubbed her belly and looked down her chest at what you could see. Her head was hidden from view as her wings covered her chest, belly and rear legs down her tail a bit. But her head was left outside of her wings. So you had no view of her head. But that didn't matter as you were comfortable, and you would much rather wait on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you laid there napping and kissing her as she was still asleep... it made you wonder how life will be since you have her... this also means that you would need to figure out how to live as you still needed a job to be in the real world, you had to figure out how to either move in with her, or get her to move in with you... the former was the more likely choice to happen. But she was the one that you would spend your love life with, there was no other. It also limited what you could do when you went out as you had your big sexy dragoness, and her soft, warm lips for you to put your cock into. There was also the fact she was in your head. So it was like a few books you read about dragons and humans. Though none of them talked of becoming a dragon's mate and well having to figure out how to live with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before she stirred, her wings shifted a bit as you heard her yawn, 'Good morning my loving rider.' You heard her say.<br>\r\n\"Good morning Emerald, my loving dragoness.\" you say, she purred...<br>\r\n'You know why I liked that name? It is because in another tongue that name it mine. I will not tell you as there is no need for you to know.' She said<br>\r\n'But isn't that improper?\" You ask.<br>\r\n'Not to me, it is fine. I love you because of it, besides you are my mate and you can call me your love, or whatever name you wish for me to have. As such my loving rider, I am Emerald.' She said as she lifted the front of her wings to look at you. She purred and her sex flexed around yours, 'And I can see you like being in me.' She said<br>\r\nYou nod and gently pull out of her wincing as your cock became cold...<br>\r\nShe purred, 'Do not worry my loving rider. We will enjoy that as offten as you would like.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and get off her tail. She opened her wings fully as you got off her wing as soon as possible. After that she stood and stretched, she yawned then licked the spot that you walked on her wing at. <br>\r\n\"Sorry I walked on your wing.\" You apologize <br>\r\n'There is no need, It feels fine,' She said as she must have felt discomfort for the moment you were on her wing and walking on it. You made note of that and would avoid it if possible.<br>\r\n'Oh, yeah that feels so much better.' She said as she waved her tail.<br>\r\nYou wonder what she meant. She must have seen that question and she made sure to answer it. 'My vagina feels so much better since you had sex with me last night. All that is needed is for us to go on a mating flight, and that will make it go away, Then you...' She nuzzled you, 'Will be a father to the young that will grow in me.'<br>\r\n\"But wouldn't I be that already?\" You ask<br>\r\n'Well... yes, but a mating flight opens up all the eggs so that they are all ready for young to form in then. At this time I am certain that you got a few of them, but a lot of them are not fertile and thus will not hatch...; She said as she sighed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think of what you could do... Well you had leather gallor at you house and you were skilled with crafting it into creation, from the needy cosplayer needing leather armor, to making saddles you could do it. All you would need is a few measurements and well Emerald seemed like she was a full grown adult dragon so if you made a saddle... and some straps you could help her on along with her need to breed.<br>\r\nEven though you had only seen it in a image, you figure that you could use straps that you would dub the 'mating straps' to mate with her. It would be odd as she would have to do the flying. She would enjoy it though as she would get her mating flight... unless he needed to be flying for it too. But that was unlikely as you had no wings nor the ability to make a jet pack, nor the skill to mimic a male dragon in flight... um, how would one do that anyways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you look to her and walk to her side and pet her, she purred as she turned her head to look at you.<br>\r\n\"Well... um, There is perhaps a way we could go on a mating flight.\" You say, she perked up at that.<br>\r\n\"I would need to make somethings back at my home in the town that would make it possible.\".<br>\r\nShe purred and nuzzled you, 'What are we waiting on my loving rider? Let us go so that we may fully mate as I want to.' She said as she offered her back to you once more, knowing you needed her to crouch to get on easily..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of the cave as you held on. She took off and flew, it was as long as the flight to her cave, but you didn't mind as she landed in your back yard once more... You slap your forehead as you know that your back door was unlocked the entire time... Well you hoped that no one broke in, You got off her back and walked into your house... You looked around and found nothing out of place... You shake your head surprised at that. Well you walked to your leather work room... There you grabbed a measuring tape roll and went out to Emerald with a note pad as you took measurements of her neck, chest, belly and tail..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that you planned out your saddle and mating straps.. After all that was done you went inside and started work on the saddle first as it would let you hold on with less fear... Not wanting to make a horse saddle you do not make a horn for it but rather a holding spot on the front so you could lay down and hold on should you want or need to. You include straps that would go around your legs and more hand holds were your hands would reach straight down. You hear a massive yawn outside... Emerald was getting bored, but she seemed to know that you couldn't do much more besides work as hard as you could on her saddle. On a side note she was getting hungry, perhaps she only ate before she got you, However this hunger was in a word minimal. So she wouldn't go hunting today, possibly not tomorrow, but if you couldn't get this all done and ready in next two days she would be off for a bit to hunt... Well you did have the saddle mostly finished... Now came the test fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waled outside with the saddle and put it on her. The straps needed to be longer. It took a few minutes to take it off her and go back inside to quickly make these longer straps... and yes you made rings that went around her front legs and a few straps to rib around her chest to keep the saddle steady. You test fitted it one more time and found that it was perfect... After that you took it off her. You saw it was night time and well time to sleep. You smile and go back inside and grabbed your blankets and pillows. You went back to her, She purred as she saw you with the plans to sleep with her this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spread your blankets out next to her, she purred and rolled on her side, curling around you and covering you with her wing. You smile and pet her belly a bit as you snuggle up against her. You closed your eyes passing on to sleep for the night</span></div></div>",

Oh that is why, Emerald.<br>\r\nYou smile and pet her belly and wait for her to wake. She seemed to be getting your get up time down as she woke not to long after you did. She purred and nuzzled you before she got up. She was happy, 'So will you finish what is need for a mating flight today?' She asked... Well you would have to as you had work tomorrow.<br>\r\n\"I will have to girl, because this is the last day of the weekend that I have before I have to go into work...\" You tell her.<br>\r\n'Oh... will that mean you will be away from me?' She asked<br>\r\n\"Sorry to say girl, yes it does... but don't fear it will only be for eight hours a day, for the next five day.\" You say as that was your work week, unless something happens. But nothing bad should happen so you could spend the night with her, or most of the night as you would need to go home to have your alarm... Just like... tonight. You sigh not happy that you wouldn't be able to spend any nights with her until next weekend... But this could work, besides she could hang out at the house when you were there. Just like a guest for the night. Even though in her eyes the two of you would be married...<br>\r\n\"Well it is how life works girl. I have to work for a living, but with my weekends with you, I will be save money like no ones business as I will be able to lock up the house and leave for the weekend... Oh that is something else I will have to make.\" You say thinking of saddle bags to carry needed clothes and some snacks to eat while you stayed in her cave with her. You would only have to keep track of the days as you would only have Friday and Saturday with her. As Sunday would be the day before the work week. Until such a time as you were rich you wouldn't be able to live your days with her as you needed money to buy food that wouldn't make you sick... yeah she might be able to go hunt for the both of you, but it wouldn't be enough for you to stay healthy. So you needed a job to pay for all that you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just the hobby of leatherwork. You walked into your house to your workshop and started working on the mating straps... It was simple to make them as you made a few straps... One to go around her belly one to attach to the rear of the saddle and another to go around her tail... from that were loops that you could secure around yourself to hand under her so that she could have her mating flight... and if the two you wished more fun in the area of sex...<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to finish so you set that aside and worked on the saddle bags... You made a good secure system for it to attach to the saddle, Then you made the bag itself... It was about as big as a large brief case. But you had straps to tie it shut. After that you brought those pieces to the livingroom, You gathered food and water, and stuck them into the bag,... and you thought about how you would leave... would you give her her mating flight back to her cave... or ride her there and then have the mating flight...</span></div></div>",

But before we decide that I guess that the bag is meant to attach to the saddle... and those straps?' She looked at the straps you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the mating straps I talked about.\" You say to her, answering her curiosity. She purred and stood.<br>\r\n\"Well first the saddle and the bags, then to adjust this on you and well... we can get on with it.\" You say as you put down the straps and the bags. You grab the saddle and pull it over to her. She crouched and let you put the saddle on her. As the last strap was tightened on, you grabbed your bags and lashed them to the saddle in a reasonable spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that it was time for the part she would perhaps enjoy a lot. You took the straps and set them near her rear legs. She wondered how it would fit so she looked at you with it. You took the straps and moved them under her hindquarters wraping the front strap over her back and belly. You cinched it down, then attached the two straps to the saddle ribbing, You had to get on her back for the top one. After that you took the tail strap and wrapped it around her tail behind her tailhole. on there were your leg loops, and on the one on her belly was your chest one, along with a hammock set up that stretched to her tail strap to hold you and keep you from getting in and awkward position. Though it was made so that the hammock and the loops could be tightened down so that they were not usable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now they would be as you made sure all the straps and hammocks were ready. Once they were you asked her, \"Could you lay on your side so I may get in?\"<br>\r\nShe purred and complied laying on her side keeping her rear legs spread ready for you to get in that spot. You climbed into your, sex hammock and tightened the loops on your legs and chest. Once that was done you rubbed her belly as you felt her slip at your cock. though it took a bit of stretching to reach you could feel her slit. You smile and finger her a bit as her slit dribbled her heat upon your crouch. That surprisingly aroused you making your cock slip into her...<br>\r\nYou had been fingering her as she stood so she was purring, Once your cock slipped into her she moaned and panted, her tail raising along with her head as she got to enjoy sex while standing... It was more natural for her to stand for sex... even if her partner was to be on her back not under her belly for the sex... But now she could enjoy a mating flight with her love... She panted more before taking a few steps her rear legs spread because of pleasure and relief. She spread her wings and took off. It was amazing to her as she flew higher to the height that the mating flight was to take place... however instead of locking claws she moaned as her muscles worked on her mate's cock. The sucking of her vagina made you moan, the pleasure dripping between you and her. You felt it as if it was your own... and the Link... it was now much wider and stronger now than it had been before. She was happy as she took her time before she felt it peak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peaked with her her lips let a torrent out even as you sprayed your load into her... She murmured in contentment...<br>\r\nWith that done she purred and took you to her cave... She landed and stood in her pleasured position... That is what you called it as she had her tail raised and her head high panting as she felt your cock in her depths. She loved it and wouldn't mind if you stayed there... She looked around her cave then looked down at you...<br>\r\n'My love, would you like to leave all this world behind and live with me in mine?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends... it depends on how your world is...\"</span></div></div>",

Treatment later.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'leaving the shiny. But it kept the food. Does it know?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leave the meat within reach.<br>\r\nI went with raw in case new smells bothered it.<br>\r\nAnd with a closer look I try to assess the damage.<br>\r\n*massive, that's for sure, as big as a horse trailer.<br>\r\nScales, it'll be rough on wraps, have to go with pads.<br>\r\nAnd w...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe folds on it's back flex outward reflexively.<br>\r\nThe lightly singed meat exciting it's taste buds as the scent of cooking meat reaches me.<br>\r\n*That was-*<br>\r\nThe smell of cooking, the sudden heat and small plume of light highlighting my cheeks, the muscled folds on it's back and the glinting bone-white protrusions all make themselves known to me about the same time.<br>\r\n*Ohhhh... No way.*<br>\r\nYup, dragon.<br>\r\nCatch on quick don't I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So cold for food, but how? And ripped so smooth, no clumps missing.<br>\r\nIt must be a shiny's doing.<br>\r\nOne broke my scales, they must be strong.<br>\r\nDangerous.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought as she was, he was able to gather himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Shock later.

I'm gonna die.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Back again.<br>\r\nStill no shiny but I heard it.<br>\r\nThis smells weird, but it sounds different.<br>\r\nAAGH!'<br>\r\nShe flinched with a suspicious look when he pressed the medicated gauze to her eye, and he fell back in fright at her action.<br>\r\nShe hissed at him for touching, until she realized she could no longer feel the sting of the cool night air on her exposed skin.<br>\r\nHer natural warmth speeding her recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It... Covered the hole.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expected pain and harm not received, he looked up to her eye.<br>\r\nClear surprise coming from both him and her.<br>\r\nAnd it was here that she realized he smelled almost nothing like Them.<br>\r\nAnd he realized her intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later she is fully bound, where needed, and the dogs are fast asleep cuddled up beside her.<br>\r\nDuring his examination watched intently by the \"patient\", he discovered the vent scales beneath her tail and belly, given access by her to patch a chipped scale on her inner thigh, revealing to him her (suspected) gender.<br>\r\nExhausted, nervous as sin, but otherworldly fascinated, he finally decided to go inside and try to sleep.<br>\r\nShe having proven greatly her trustworthiness and trust in him.</span></div></div>",

Being a morning person who loves nature and getting outside always made that kind of activity one of your favorites of all time, despite the fact that you never shared it with anyone. As a matter of fact, you never shared any of your time with another human being. Most people would hate this kind of solitude, but you didn't mind it. You were used to it, more or less, because this is how you had lived ever since your home was built. But that was besides the point. You were still focusing on your walk. This morning walk was quite different than your other morning walks. You weren't sure why. It was just a feeling. An accurate feeling, at that, because a strange occurrence happened during that walk. You were just regularly strolling along, when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><i><b>WHOOSH</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...a huge shadow passed over you, making you flinch and look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you stop for a second, a little nervous, and a little confused. You had many questions. Firstly, what could possibly make such a large shadow? An alien spaceship? An airplane flying too low? A really big bird? Secondly, where was whatever made that sh-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><i><b>WHOOSH</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt passed over you again, and this time, you caught a glimpse of it in the sky. This answered your two questions partly. You could definitely rule out airplanes and alien spacecraft based on its shape, but you still weren't entirely sure what it could be. You didn't really know what to think of something huge flying over your head. Well, it wasn't that, but that it wouldn't have been weird if it weren't for the fact that it made that shadow, and that whooshing sound, meaning it was really close to you. Thirty seconds passed before you decided to start walking again. After all, it wasn't like you were going to find out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>WHUMP</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge dragon landed in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt startled you like a jumpscare in a horror movie, making you almost faint right then and there. You weren't sure if that was the dragon's intention, but that didn't matter. All that you could see now was that the huge lizard was staring expressionlessly.

It was fully black with some dark blue markings on its face and wings, and (in your opinion) looked extremely threatening and terrifying. Its stare was a lot more shy-looking than you would have expected from a large predatory beast, but that could have just been your perception, and not the reality of its appearance.

Your eyes widened noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh... sorry, I just saw you walking and I thought you looked lonely... I, uh, I didn't mean to startle you,\" she said, looking a bit worried for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were enough to give you the confidence to reply. You took a deep breath, and said, \"It's okay, I just didn't expect to see a dragon on my walk today, and you just landed so quickly, and made such a large sound, that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words were interrupted by her. \"Please don't make excuses... if you find me scary, that's not really your fault...\" Her words were accompanied by some sad eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, you know, at first I was scared, but now I can see that you're nice, so I have nothing to worry about now,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon sighed, sounding content with your words, and closed her eyes. \"Well, now that we've met and all, even though it was... you know.... a little awkward... human, I gotta ask...\"</span></div></div>",

He saw a shadow headed for him and he looked up to see a blue dragon-shaped creature flying in the sky. It was flying relatively lazily, so James assumed it wasn\u2019t in immediate danger. But he wondered, briefly, if it was the creature who continually kept trying to set the forest afire lately\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he looked up at the dragon and wondered what it would be like to fly.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, flying really would be something.\u201d He said aloud accidentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon tilted its head at James and the human could have sworn, whole-heartedly, that the dragon was looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute\u2019s pause, the dragon kept flying.<br>\r\nThen James started walking again, thinking about how weird that was.<br>\r\nHe ran the trail around his house in the forest about six more times, until the evening had turned to a dark dusk.<br>\r\nJames loved being out at night, however dangerous it could be. He loved the way the crickets chirped, how the birds were sleeping, and a lot of the non-nocturnal creatures of Yikchu Forest fell into sleep.

He\u2019d never hear a dragon talk. Granted; he\u2019d never really had the chance; most dragons and related species and subspecies tried to bite humans\u2019 heads off. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon tilted its head at James and said; \u201cAre you okay? You seemed confused about something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was snapped out of his momentary brain lapse and he replied; \u201cUh, yeah, not to be rude, mister dragon, but I don\u2019t know-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by a giggling sound from the dragon.<br>\r\n\u201cSilly! I\u2019m not a male, I\u2019m a female!\u201d<br>\r\nJames blushed. <i>Great. Not only is it a dragon, it\u2019s a</i> she <i>dragon. Both things I\u2019d never really dealt with greatly in one package. My luck\u2026 </i>James thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, uh, may I inquire as to what your name would be, miss?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\nHe\u2019d never talked to a dragon, but he figured he\u2019d start with some manners and small talk. Hopefully, it would save him from becoming her evening meal if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness giggled again; \u201cMy name is Elilah. E-l-i-l-a-h.\u201d she spelled it out for him. (Ee-lie-luh)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames replied; \u201cElilah. That\u2019s a pretty name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElilah replied; \u201cThank you. my parents thought so too. Now, it\u2019s rude to inquire somebody\u2019s name before stating your own, mister human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mocked him jokingly.<br>\r\n<i>Who does she think she is??? She acts as if we\u2019ve known each other for our entire lives. We\u2019ve been here only two minutes!!!</i> James thought to himself, hoping the dragoness couldn\u2019t do something bullshit like read his mind or anything. Otherwise, he\u2019d be in some deep Japanese noodles.<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2026 it\u2019s James. Now, pardon me, uh, madam, but why are you out here so late at night? Isn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElilah laughed heartily and said; \u201cA human worried about the welfare of a dragoness when he is the one who is in trouble? HA! That is one for the books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, so she has a sense of humor.</i> That\u2019s good, I suppose. James noted to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was trying to be polite. Is it Allright if I go to my house?\u201d he asked the dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness, Elilah, replied; \u201cIt\u2019s your house, why are you asking me to go to something that belongs to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames replied politely, trying to keep the edge of irritation out of his voice; \u201cBecause you said that I am in trouble of some sort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElilah replied; \u201cOh, yes, sorry. You are in a bit of a situation. And so am i. I need a place to stay. May I stay at your house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt like he\u2019d been slapped. She was right, that was a bit of a problem and trouble. A rule in the city (not that he lived in it anyway) was not to let creatures into your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed. He\u2019d really like to know more about the dragoness, but would it be worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, James replied;  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure maybe i can just walk.\" James turned to start walking.<br>\r\nElilah had other plans, James heard a woosh from her wings and then suddenly he felt himself jerk forward as the dragoness grabbed him with her claw. James screamed for a second a the ground moved away from him. Elilah moved James on to her neck and seated him where her neck and body meet, James held on for dear life as they flew. Five minutes later James heard the dragon say,\" well now thats a nice little cabin there.\" James saw his cabin come into view, the cabin was not small but in fact a deceant size house with a garage connected to it and paved drive way that connected to a dirt road that winded its way through the forest. Elilah landed and let James off her back, James touched ground and never more has he had joy touch the ground with his two feet. Elilah looked at the front door and said,\" i don't think i will be able to fit through your door.\" <br>\r\nJames thought about how this would work and he couldn't think of anything so he put his hands in his pockets and he felt his keys attached to the automatic garage door opener and he got an idea. James looked at Elilah and said,\" i got an idea, please move off the drive way.\" Elilah did not understanding what the drive way and her getting into his house has to do with anything so she did as she was told and got off the drive way. James opened up the garage door and started his car and backed it out onto the drive way and then got out and said,\" well i guess if you are all right with sleeping on the cement floor you can stay in my garage.\" Elilah moved into the garage and layed down and said,\" it's nice, thank you.\" James then said,\" im going to close the door so the wind won't bother you.\" James closed the garage door as the dragoness made herself comfortable in there. James went through the front door and after getting into some clean clothes, because his hicking ones where smelly from sweat, he went to see how the dragon was doing. James was hungery and he made himself a sandwich and as he was eating it he thought of Elilah and if she was hungry or thirsty. James opened up the fridge and found a left over turkey mostly intacted so he warmed that up for her and brought it out on a tray. As he opened the door to the garage and he found Elilah looking at some of his equipement and tools interested in the look of them and how they work. James made a slight cough and Elilah turned and saw the turkey and said,\" is that for me, thank you.\" James flinched as she quickly snapped up the turkey in on bite, he watched Elilah chewed up the turkey and swallowed it. James put the tray back and said,\" is there anything else i can get you?\" Elilah yawned and said,\" no thanks, but how am i going to get out in the morning?\" James looked at the garage door opener and saw the doors metal pole was connected to by a hook connected to a chain in the garage door. He then thought to open the door manually he just needs to disconnect the hook, he looked at Elilah and said,\" here let me stand on your head so i can unhook the door so you can open it with your claws.\" The dragoness layed her head down and James got on her and used her horns to balence himself. Elilah slowly lifted her head up until James could reach the garage hook, after unhooking the garage Elilah put James back down,\" there you go, im going to bed now so good night.\" said James. What happened next really shock James, Elilah moved her head close to James and licked his check with her smooth tongue. James just stood there for what looked like forever and Elilah giggled and said,\" thanks for everything you have done for me.\" James turned red in the checks and smiled as he walked back inside and went to bed.

So lost in thought he hardly noticed anything around him, simply treading one of his many paths.  A loud hiss shocked him into attention, and he hurriedly brought his rifle up to an alduren urchin.  The approximately foot long spider like creature with a long tail ending in stinger continued its leisurely crawl across his trail.

A single aduren urchin wasn\u2019t a problem, but with the constant threat of trolls or nagas one can not afford a lapis in attention in the wilderness, although the possibility of him actually encountering something that dangerous was low, since he lived in the territory of a dragoness.  With the right precautions it was actually rather safe, and she kept away the harder to avoid predators.<br>\r\n\tAfter spending the  entire day traversing the country side, staying under the trees to hid from the dragoness despite there having been no sign of her all day, Frazone has meandering his way home, when though the trees he spotted a doe.  Frazone always took every opportunity he could, so with a single shot he fell the doe on the spot.  <br>\r\n\tWasting no time Frazone carelessly strode out into the open to gut his prey.  Hardly did he set knife to flesh when there was a whoosh of air from behind and the ground shook.  Knowing only one thing it could be Frazone spun around and looked upon the face of the bleu dragoness.  Her form was elegant yet powerful, every scale shone in the evening light with dark blue cooler unraveled by any gem, her claws, horns, and sharp carnivores teeth white has ivory, and her eyes a golden orb more radiant then the sun.<br>\r\n\tTruly a sight to behold, and Frazone would of enjoyed the view if those lovely with teeth where not bared and him, and those eyes not gleamed with anger.

Soon he was well within the trees, and since the dragon had made no advance he know he was safe.  Before walking away he gave one last look, and saw the legs of the doe sink into her gullet.  Although he would have stayed and watched the dragon, it was too close to dark.  Most people would have been mad or resentful, Frazone was ecstatic.  Not only had he survived his first encounter with the dragoness he had lived under for years, but she didn\u2019t attack him.  She had accepted him into her territory, and there was nothing that could make him happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe walk home was short, and Frazone arrived gest before it got too dark.  His home mas made from logs and mostly sunk into the ground for security, the roof was covered in moss for insulation and camouflage.

She'd only moved in a week ago and was still getting used to the area. This did mean having a compass and map with her as phone service out here was abominable. True, gps was still here, but her phone repeatedly messed up and she really couldn't rely on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy didn't care. A life in a fairly large town had left her longing for green, and as long as she could remember she'd been planning a trip here out west, up beyond the mountains of her town. It had taken her till she was twenty to do it, but finally she was here, a nice little cabin, with at least good road access (if long winded and isolated) to the rest of civilization. There was a decent small town with a general store about seventy miles away, though only with a population under two hundred. Beyond that she was on her own. Especially with the lack of landline phone around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crested the top of a hill and the path was straight enough ahead that she could see out across the hills nearby, down the valley, giving the dawn sun a gorgeous frame of green on either side. Squinting and shading her eyes she peered out, hoping that she'd get used to the views here-abouts (though not TOO used to them) as she got adjusted. After a few moments she sighed and headed down the path. From the maps it looks like this old mining path veered south up ahead before circling back near home. Thankfully there hadn't been any logging around here and the area was still beautiful and green, with a lot of very old trees hidden the depths of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hitched the straps on her small backpack and stretched she stopped. That had been an odd sound. Like scratching or something? She put one foot up on a log by the side of the road and glanced around. There was always the thought in the back of her head about wild animals. Bears, cougars, heck on the news she'd read that last year someone reported a wolf! She chuckled at that. It had probably been an escapee from some private zoo or something. I mean, the chances of anything like that around here was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FWOOMPH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy froze, suddenly gasping for breath as something obscure the sunlight in front of her, a gust of wind blowing her black hair backwards for a second. Whatever it was had landed in front of her, barely ten feet from her. Vague shapes of a tail, a long curling.... tentacle? No, neck. It unfurled and an outline of a reptilian head could be seen against the morning sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh shhhhhhhh.....\" She began, then stopped as she felt more than heard a bone deep thrum. She shivered, taking a step back involuntarily, and stopped as that outline of a head snapped across to look at her... but there was something off. The outline, the shape... it was shivering. She blinked, catching outlines of silvery white where the sun caught the edges. An albino lizard? It was big but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly the head collapsed to the ground, and shortly afterwards the body did too, temporarily blinding her as the sun was uncovered once more. Blinking she stepped forwards, getting glimpses of silvery white wings twitching on the ground.</span></div></div>",

Well, not hugely so anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning she crept closer, and as the sunlight was more lighting it than shadowing it from her point of view she could see it's eyes. They weren't reptilian. No slit like lizard irises, but large dark and deep eyes, and they looked in pain. It stared into her soul she felt like, and she gulped. Then down it's sides she saw the marks, red and ragged, like it had torn through razor wire or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... A... are you alright?\" She said, her fear of it warring with her instinctual need to help a wounded animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head moved, and it took her a few seconds to realize it had nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y.. you can speak? I mean, understand me?\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muzzle of the dragon shifted, and she found that though it looked lizard like it was far more mobile. That was a smile if ever she saw one, but the head shook it's head, then stopped and nodded. The look in it's eyes was one of pain and annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... you can't speak but you understand me?\" She guessed. Something like a chuckle vibrated from the being. \"Oh... uh.... OK.\" She said, her voice slightly cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep longing pinned her in place. This thing looked so powerful, it's muscled body glistening in the sunlight, but now was so vulnerable. Something caught in her heart as she stared down at it. With a gulp she knelt down by the head and rested a nervous hand on it's cheek. She glanced up and down it's body, and gulped. OK, 'his' head. Definitely. She wasn't an animal person in general, pets or farm animals or whatever, but she knew the look of a sheath when she saw it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm about half a mile from my place. Do you think you can get there? I might be able to help.\" She said, looking down at the scarred cuts on the creature's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stared at her for a few seconds, took a deep breath, and shook it's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK. Can you wait? I... um, maybe I can bring stuff in the truck.\" She paused looking down into those deep, dark eyes. She felt like she was falling. \"Uh... yeah.... truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the head nodded and she managed a weak smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon. I promise.\" she said, then stopped. It's silvery white scales glinting in the sunlight. \"Don't worry, I'll return Silver.\" She added, then started running back the way she'd come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had she named it? It might have it's own name, but she just needed something, a tag to label it in her head. Him. Him not it! She remembered those deep eyes. Definitely Him. A little shiver went down her spine, a rather pleasant one as she ran home, a smile spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rescuing a dragon!</span></div></div>",

Well, she could boil water to help sterilize fabric to use as bandages, right? That was what you did wasn't it? But for that it'd have to be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, well, looks like he'd fit on the flatbed. Thank god I got an open truck! It would have been hell to fit him in a hatchback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy spent the time to think of everything she needed so managed to load on a loading ramp to slide him up, a lot of rope, and the electric winch. There was no way she could lift him, and she wasn't convinced she could pull him up onto the flatbed on her own. She wasn't exactly wonder woman. She chuckled looking down at her arms and feeling the muscle there. Yeah, that wasn't going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little while to get everything together and she worried. What if Silver flew off while she was messing around here? Or maybe the government arrived to cart him off to area 51 or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf if she got there and found no trace. She'd just die if this was all some kind of hallucination or something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later her truck was bouncing along the road and skidding to a stop in front of Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast her eyes upward and muttered a \"Thank you!\", so glad he was still real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the truck around she backed up close enough, but not too close. Had to be room for the ramp. As she got out and headed round the back she saw Silver... shivering, staring at the truck in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... it's OK. It's just a vehicle. Um... horseless cart?\" hiseyes snapped back and forth from her to the truck, and slowly he seemed to relax. \"OK, so you don't know machines. No cars where you come from I guess. Don't worry, I'll do what I can. But I have to get you up on the back. I brought some rope and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped back as the dragon slowly got to his feet, wavering a little, then stepped forward. She blinked, seeing the obvious pain in his eyes as he laid a front paw up on the truck and pulled himself in. The truck settled a little as Silver unsteadily climbed up, but not as much as she'd expected. He obviously wasn't that heavy. Then the truck bounced as Silver practically dropped like a sack of potatoes to the bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, careful!\" Mandy said, coming to the side, hearing ragged breath from Silver in there. \"Don't hurt yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jerked as shadow covered her and she looked up as a wing had unfurled over her. The forward joint of the wing came down and she saw there were three little fingers there. They rested gently on her cheek and stroked, her eyes sliding back to look to his, those deep dark pools of... She shook her head, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'll get you back to my place.... So you can get better I mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought she saw confusion on it's face before she jumped in the driver's seat and hit the gas. Yeah, this was so weird! It felt like her heart was beating out through her chest, and... this was a dragon! How could she... I mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head she headed back, checking on Silver every now and then in the rear view mirror. He seemed nervous of the truck but otherwise OK. Better than OK, he looked gorgeous! Blushing again she focused on the driving.</span></div></div>",

I can help you heal. Tend your...\" She glanced down as he shifted, his muscles rippling under those scales. \"Yeah... inside. Let me help you in.\" She managed, still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still a little tentative, but more looked up at things like the porch light and satellite dish than the building. At least he merely seemed curious about them rather than his nervousness about the truck. Letting the back down on the truck she gently reached forward and awkwardly tried to wrap an arm around his shoulders to help him up. That purr vibrated through her again as he tried to go with it and stood up on all fours. The heat from his body permeated her through her clothes, despite the thick material. It was February, and rather cool here so she'd dressed accordingly this morning. She tried to calm her heart, but the nearness, the heat and faint musk like smell coming from Silver was starting to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helped him carefully off the truck and leaned over as she helped him stagger inside, furling his wings so they didn't catch the door. With a sigh he collapsed on the floor abruptly and Mandy gasped, loosing her balance as she was still helping him.  She fell down on him, landing on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.. sorry. I...\" she stopped as his head leaned in and nuzzled her cheek. She turned to stare at Silver's face, those loving eyes peering deeply into her, and the muzzle brushed up against her lips and a long sinuous tongue slid into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze, feeling his lips twist against her own, kissing awkwardly. He pulled back, seeing her freeze like that, his tongue slipping free of her mouth with a wet 'plop!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I.... I'll get the door.\" She said, stumbling to her feet and closing it with a thump. Already she could feel the heater warming the air now the door wasn't venting it outside, and she looked down, seeing Silver close his eyes and sigh, his muzzle pointing up to the vent in the ceiling where the heat was coming from. \"Oh, you like that? Maybe you come from a warmer climate? Let me turn it up a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small house and the heater raised the temp fairly quickly. It was already rising by the time she got back from the thermostat. Then she blinked. Hadn't there been more cuts on Silver's back than that? She stepped closer and her eyes got large. She actually saw some cuts slowly closing up as he sighed, eyes still closed, reveling in the heat it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK. Guess I could raise it some more.\" She said, turning back to the thermostat in the hallway. As she raised it she shook her head. \"What, healing power or something? Only in heat? He didn't heal outside. Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it was rather warm for her, especially in her winter clothes. As she headed back to the living room she pulled her backpack off and hung it on a hook, then pulled her sweater off and did the same, smoothing down her T-shirt... and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver was staring at her, very obviously staring at her chest. She felt her face heat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. So... you like girls? I mean human... girls.\" She said lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes rose up to hers and slowly he nodded, a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Of course you do. Naturally a large scaly reptile wants to be with a woman. Makes total sense.\" She said gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still she was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let me change, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously she went in to take off her thick trousers and instead slid on some light shorts. She stopped, staring at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you girl?\" She whispered to herself. \"It's a bloody big lizard! It's not boyfriend material!\" But she didn't believe it. Something was making her heart run rampant and she was breathing hard, just from that gaze Silver had given her when she'd pulled her jersey off.</span></div></div>",

Ironic, given she'd been trying to get away from people the last four years! Now she was here, in the middle of nowhere, NOW she wanted someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was a dragon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god girl, get a grip!\" But her eyes fastened on that slinky red negligee she'd bought when she'd had those few dates with Kyle. That hadn't lasted long, the jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her heart hammering even harder as she thought about the nightie and Silver back there, and it <i>was</i> hot in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking she found herself pulling her clothes off, tossing them all on the bed, then drawing the nightie down over her body. She gave one last look in the mirror, then turned and went back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd saw Silver standing, staring up at a clock curiously. Most of the cuts were now discolored welts. Still painful looking, but as she watched they looked to be fading further. Then he turned to look as she closed the door to the bedroom, and the look on his face was priceless. His mouth actually drooped open as his wide eyes traced her body up and down. Managing a smile, and trying not to cover her body with her arms, she stepped forward, still blushing like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came up close to him he sat back on his haunches, his long neck bringing his head up level with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H.. hi.\" She said, then saw his right wing pull up, those deft little fingers stroking across her cheek once more. \"Do you like it?\" He blinked, a confused look on his face. \"The negligee I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes slipped down to look at her nightdress and her curves accentuated by it. The grin on his face as he looked back up into her eyes was enough, but he nodded enthusiastically anyway, still gently stroking her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad, I wanted.. *Oof!*\" she managed as he leaned forwards and his forelegs wrapped around her middle, hugging her tightly, his long neck pressing between her breasts as his head leaned gently on her shoulder. For a moment she felt awkward, her arms out to the sides, then she smiled and wrapped her arms around his neck and shoulders as low as they were. This felt awkward, he was basically sitting on the ground, hugging her like a child would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she blinked.</span></div></div>",

Oh god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rubbed a few times against her calves, between her legs, and Silver's shorter forelegs squeezed her surprisingly gently. Slowly his neck pulled back, giving her a jerk as her breasts bounced together from it's absence, and his eyes looked down into hers once more, the need smoldering there. But still he didn't do anything, just stared. Held her tight, but just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.. Oh.... We're so... uh... different. I don't... Would this...

The motion pulled her nightie up from the contact with his chest, and she felt that hot shaft slide up between her legs insistently as his forearms gently walked up under her arms, keeping him upright. The swollen head pressed up against her inner thighs, the heat soaking into her as it got closer. She couldn't resist the need, and spread her legs as he lifted up, his eyes half lidded from the soft sensation of brushing across her skin down there.</span></div></div>",

Si.. silver?\" She felt it rub back again and moaned once more. \"Uh, this might no... OOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp she felt a prod, and the slick pressure from his shaft push in! She gulped, but the pressure stopped as her butt clenched on the intruder, then it pushed again, gaining a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... wait a ... maybe... Oooh!\" She gasped, then felt a little jerk, and suddenly the head plopped in, her butt clenching then relaxing, and her eyes shut tight, her legs pressed together from the long smooth thrust as it slid inside. It felt like it was lubricated or something the way it just pushed in. Oh god, that was so, so far in! She twisted her hips, feeling that solid mass inside her, the heat glorious, flooding out from her groin. \"Please... gently.\" She managed, looking up at his face. He paused, nodding softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forearms around her back pressed tightly, Silver's wing fingers reaching down and cupping her behind gently, then, slowly, he backed off. She felt that odd pressure, the sliding as that mass oozed out, then gasped as it thrust back in. Damn, that felt like it was huge, but it can't have been. His body wasn't that big (so 'that' down there couldn't have been too big, right?), and she wasn't that... loose down there. He pulled back and thrust once more, his face leaning in and that long tongue licking across her cheek as she gasped. It definitely felt long though, from the motions of his legs against her it was damn long thrust each time. It was entirely possible that thing was too long for her to fit him in normally. This might be the only way he could get all the way in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy moaned, trying to help support him as he began to pump into her body. She felt breath on her neck, and looked down in time to see his head push down into the wide neck of her dress! She giggled as he wormed his way in, his breath hot on her chest before his tongue began to caress her nipples. In time with his pumping into her butt she felt his breath wash over her breasts, then gently teeth grated across a nipple, then lightly nipped and tugged. Oh god! He was being very gentle, but very insistent! And... faster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking her legs leaped up and wrapped around his body as he pounded into her, and she felt him nearly topple, but one wing shot to the ground to balance him, then he leaned over, her body hanging under his, pressed tight to him as his hips flexed hard against hers. She cried out as her eyes shut tight, now with a deathgrip on his hot body, pulling herself as tight as she could to him. That liquid pressure in her behind just sent waves of pleasure pouring up through her body and she felt her self clenching in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to set up off, and suddenly his grip tightened, one wing and his forelegs hugging her tightly to him, his whole body arching in spasm as he came jerking and flooding her. The tightness tipped her over the edge and she joined him moments later, her body jerking against him and her cry echoing through the small cabin. A roar joined her cry as Silver bellowed his pleasure to the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlearily Mandy came to her senses, opening her eyes, a glorious feeling still pervading her and... she blinked, feeling that solid mass down there, slowly shrinking inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced down, Silver collapsed on top of her, his neck curled into her dress, his head around and pressed muzzle first up between her breasts, his breath hot and quick, but slowing. She could feel his heartbeat against her as it too began to slow from the mad pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" She muttered, feeling Silver snuggle into her clothes a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was turning into a very weird, but wonderful day.

They liked that I didn't bother them, that I lived far away, and out of town. But it was lonely. I'd lived alone so long, I didn't remember how to connect with people anymore. Walking in the woods each evening had become a habit for me, a way to unwind, and soothe my lonesome depression. I didn't feel so alone when I could hear the birds, smell the grass,  or feel the breeze in my hair. I felt free. I felt at home. Normally it was quiet, the birds sang,  the shade of the trees a soothing balm to the hot summer days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quickly approaching dusk assured my privacy, assured my ability to walk unhindered by the social awkwardness I sometimes felt with others around. I liked the forest, the soft trickling brook that ran through it, only a mile from my house, the thick vegetation that offered a lush atmosphere. I loved it. Recently I'd discovered a small clearing surrounded by Ivy and pines that made for a beautiful spot. I'd loved it so much, I'd gone so far as to drag a plastic lawn chair, and a matching table into it's midst. I'd decorated it with a potted plant, and a stone bird bath. A lone tree stood in the center, and I'd managed to hang a rope swing from one thick branch. It was my sanctuary, my own little haven from the lonely world I resided. It was quiet, like my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Except today there was a noise, a distant roar, almost like thunder, but there hadn't been a forecast of rain. I watched each morning, to make sure I could have my daily walks, but the sound was there all the same. I frowned, sipped my bottled water, and leaned back in the chair, letting the breeze lift my auburn tresses. There it was again, louder this time, almost as if it were getting closer. I sat up, and starred up at the sky, but there wasn't a single cloud in site. Nothing but the shade of the tree darkening my little corner of the world. A loud thud sounded, the ground vibrated and I shot to my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Searching the forest, I thought of construction workers taking over the beautiful landscape, there was nothing else that could be so loud, that could move the ground. Honestly it didn't sound like a  bulldozer though. It sounded...I screamed, as a creature far larger than anything I'd ever seen catapulted into the clearing, landing just short of the lone tree. It was twice the size of a mac truck, and four times as long as it was wide. Eyes the color of honey reflected my frozen posture, and teeth as sharp as cutlery glistened in the dropping sun. I couldn't move, couldn't breath. I felt paralyzed, like a mouse watching a snake slither towards it. It meant my doom, I was sure, but I was so curious, so awe struck, I had no will to move, to react. I blink, swallow, and stumble to make sense, to form conscious thought.</span></div></div>",

In all the years you've lived outside of civilization, you haven't been bored with the scenery yet. However, it's late, and you are getting tired. You've been retracing your path back to your house, but you're still about 15 minutes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you start to hear sounds above the treetops. You can't place it, but they sound similar to wingbeats. But that's crazy, there's nothing that large in the region, let alone anything that flies. But now you're curious and look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, there are too many branches in the way for you to see through. But soon, you see something shimmering above the treetops. And it starts to decend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slips between the high boughs, shifting it's wings and acing it's course at just the right angles to where almost nothing touches it on it's way down. Soon it breaks into the path in front of you and dives down. As it approaches the ground it folds up it's wings to land gracefully a few meters in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am pleased to finally reach you.</i> A femenine voice says, though you can't tell exactly how it is being produced. But by now you've figued out what you've just met: a silver Dragon.</span></div></div>",

However, you live a very nice life, even though you have not had in-person contact with others since your house was built(though you have been an anonymous tipster about forest fires to the fire department) (this makes it so nobody's life gets mixed up if you go live with the dragon(ess) in his/her cave).<br>\r\nThe story starts when the dragon lands either in your backyard or while you are taking a walk in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO DEATHS!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wish, you can make a chapter where a male characters get a dragoness pregnant(but only after a serious relationship develops and either keep it fairly tame, also this is men only, since a human woman would never survive intercourse with a male dragon, not to mention laying an entire clutch of eggs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will do checks for grammar and spelling on all new chapters, and the button is there, so please use spell check<br>\r\nTry to leave more than one choice, continue can be the only choice if you are trying for dramatic effect or if it is too long to fit on one page(as long as it is not uneventful)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTES:<br>\r\n~If you have a mishap(I once accidentally submitted a story chapter before I was finished typing it) please email me so we can correct it<br>\r\n~~If you have the mishap I noted above, please also include the full chapter with the edit request so I can simply copy-paste the rest of the chapter into the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Remember this is mainly intended to be a romance interactive, so no having the dragon(ess) intentionally scare the main character shitless upon the first meeting.</td>",
