Lockheart especially liked his beard; it reminded him of the little happy sheep that infested his dreams nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockheart tipped his head sideways, his smile hanging indolently out of the corner of his mouth. \"Hmmm, do I recognize you from somewhere?\" Lockheart said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus Dumbledore walked to Lockheart's bedide and pulled up a chair. He kept his expression stony and silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gilderoy, do you now see what happens if you relied too much on your specialized art to gain false advantage?\" he said testily. Lockheart made a strange undulating noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously not\" he answered for him. Lockheart twisted his neck in a complete circle, before dropping it straight toward the bedhseets. He rolled his eyes upward and opened his mouth, a droplet of saliva falling from it's left corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously what?\" he sputtered, throwing his arms around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore adjusted his eye glasses and tilted Lockheart's chin upwards so as to meet the Headmaster's gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you do not truly hear me Gilderoy, I have come bearing the news that you are now incapable of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and you are terminated from your job.\" Dumbledore said with a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLockheart felt something in his head freeze. Even though he had no idea what that strange old man had said, he sure didn't like that sad feeling those words created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Job?\" Lockheart sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDUmbledore nodded, \"Yes, I shall have to start looking for a replacement\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there were strange footsteps that came down the hall.

Gilderoy still had the same appearance from his teaching and novelist days that she was able to recognize him.  Hermione was lost between her feelings wanting to run upto Lockhart and give him a hug and the loyalty to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brief encounter was the first time that Hermione had saw Gilderoy since she was restored back from being petrified by the basilisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was the second to appear in the doorway.  Although Harry was there the day that Gilderoy lost his memory and knew the circumstances surrounding why they were placed in the depths of the Secret Chamber, Harry still felt a little sad for his fallen teacher.  He had spent some time wondering, worrying about who'd replace Professor Lockhart as the Dark Arts teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-headed second to youngest Weasley crowded into the door frame with his broken wand in his right hand.  Ron feared that Gilderoy would recognize him and try for retribution, until Ron got a good look at this professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilderoy had a blank stare in his eyes but still continued to flash his award winning smile.  His blonde hair was not as neat as his former students remembered.  His clothes were more wrinkled then any one could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of the things that Gilderoy lied to them about, the three; Hermione, Harry and Ron felt a twinge of guilt that their teacher was in St. Mungo's.</span></div></div>",

Those creatures, fascinating little buggers until they smell you, then they hunt you down like an insulted hippogriff\u201d answered Hagrid, \u201cthere is only two ways to get rid of them and since Hogwarts forbids me to use magic I had to get a little creative.  Enough of that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione and Harry weren\u2019t buying into his explanation, since Hermione did some of her light reading of \u201cMagical Insects: Cursed Crawlers to Zigzagging Zephyrs volume 4\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHagrid\u201d Harry and Hermione shouted in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyways Professor Dumbledore wanted me to check on Professor Lockhart to see if they\u2019ve returned any of his memory.  Dumbledore thinks that Lockhart might hold a key to something back at the school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you that.

Hagrid squirms out of divulging any more secret Hogwart\u2019s business by saying good-bye to his young friends and students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d started Ron, \u201cwhat secret ol\u2019 professor Lockhart can actually have?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
