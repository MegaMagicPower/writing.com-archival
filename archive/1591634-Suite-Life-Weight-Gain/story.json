I\u2019ve noticed lately that you\u2019ve been gorging on all that junk food.\u201d Carey looked back over at Zack\u2019s place at the table, which was now empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had wandered over to the refrigerator, and was digging through it. Zack reappeared from inside of it, and said, \u201cWhat are you talking about, mom?\u201d Then, opened the can of pop, he was holding and took a long swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExhibit A,\u201d Carey pointed to her son, as he sat back down at the table. \u201cWhat kids drink pop for dinner?\u201d She asked, more of a question for Cody than Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat boobs\u201d Cody replied, happily, prodding one of Zack's slight man boobs, that were developing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shot his brother one of those I-can\u2019t-believe-you\u2019re-on-her-side looks. \u201cWhat do you know, Cody? Other than, \u2018cranberry juice is good for your urinary track\u2019!\u201d He said, mimicking the way his twin had said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust leave your brother alone, Zack. Not only does he know how to eat healthy, unlike you, he also cares deeply about proper bodily functions,\u201d Carey explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!\u201d Cody reminded Zack, who just slapped his hand to his forehead, embarrassed of his dork of a brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey shoved the bowl of broccoli across the table to Zack. \u201cHere, have some broccoli,\u201d She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody sat upright in his seat, and grinned. \u201cBroccoli is good for your bowels!\u201d He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack smirked. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re having this conversation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Later that day]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was practically passed out on the couch, in front of the TV, empty snack containers, and bags of chips strewn across him and the couch. His eyelids were beginning to feel heavy, and the weight of all that food he had just stuffed himself with was pinning him down to the couch. Zack knew that if he tried to move, his full stomach would ache even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe weakly reached over and grabbed the chip bag. Bringing it up to his face, he emptied the remaining contents into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door to the suite opened, and in strolled Cody, his usual smile plastered to his face, until he saw the mess in the living room and scowled. \u201cZack, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBinging on junk food,\u201d Zack mumbled, as if the answer were obvious, which it was, considering the mess he had left of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked shocked. \u201cWhy, Zack? There has to be something you can do to stop these horrid eating habits. It\u2019s an awful waste of energy and free time!\u201d He shouted, bringing out a giant garbage bag, and hurrying over to Zack\u2019s mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sat up with a groan, as his stomach ache settled in. \u201cWell, excuse me you cranberry juice and broccoli lover, math whiz, sweater vest-wearing, doofus!\u201d He said, taking a long breath after saying of all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody frowned. \u201cWell I\u2019m not the one cleaning up the mess you made!\u201d He glanced down, and realized that he had started tossing the empty junk food container and chip bags into the trash bag he was holding. He dropped it, and looked over at Zack. \u201cHere you do it! It\u2019s your mess to clean up!\u201d And with that, he headed back into the kitchen, and dumped the contents of his backpack onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked over at his brother sympathetically. \u201cCody, what\u2019s wrong? You always do homework when you\u2019re upset.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody opened his notebook and sighed. \u201cWell, I could ask you the same question. You overeat when you\u2019re upset, even though you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re doing it,\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u201d Zack questioned, quizzically. \u201cI don\u2019t feel upset.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may not feel upset, but obviously something is bothering you, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been doing this for the last few days. Now tell me, what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Cody asked, calmly folding and resting his hands on the table in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked at his brother oddly. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever understand how his crazy mind worked. \u201cYou sound like my psychiatrist,\u201d He told Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody grinned, and sat up straighter in the chair. \u201cYou see one, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shook his head, sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody frowned and shrunk back into his chair. \u201cN - Not the point,\u201d He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then what is the point, Cody? \u2018Cause, you lost me here!\u201d Zack said from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t too often that Zack felt he had to look after his brother, but then again, Cody always seemed to be lost, and not getting anywhere without Zack\u2019s help. Even though Cody was the smart and sensitive twin, Zack was still the older and in his eyes, cooler. Zack found nothing cool about being nice all the time and wearing those goofy sweater vests that Cody always wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, man \u2013 it\u2019s not too often that I would say something like this, but here it goes -.\u201d Zack jumped up from his seat on the couch, and pointed at his brother. \u201cGet some help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked over at Zack. \u201cI\u2019m not the one that has to fill up on sweets and junk food just to relieve stress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m relieving stress?\u201d Zack screamed. \u201cLet me tell you this, little brother \u2013 eating does not relieve stress at all! If anything, it adds even more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why do you do it?\u201d Cody shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack didn\u2019t answer that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack, for crying out loud, look at you!\u201d Cody stood up, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one\u2019s crying out loud!\u201d Zack huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are!\u201d Cody fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack threw himself back down on the couch, and crossed him arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was already starting to calm down a bit. \u201cLook, Zack, my point is \u2013 as your brother, I only want you to start eating a little healthier, okay? I\u2019m not asking for you to change those habits all at once, but can\u2019t you at least cut back on the snacks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack brought a cookie he had picked up from the couch, up to his mouth, and stopped as he heard those words. \u201cOkay, starting with this cookie!\u201d He angrily shoved it into the garbage bag at his feet, and dusted his hands off, as if he had just finished dirty work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody smiled over at his brother. \u201cThere we go. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking!\u201d He looked back down at his homework, and prepared to start it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was still seated on the couch, next to a plastic tray of mini doughnuts. He silently eased his hand over to the sweets, and poked his index finger through the hole in one of the doughnuts, and quietly brought it up to his face. He just couldn\u2019t resist junk foods. But, of course since his brother was so harsh about things like that, he had to be certain that Cody didn\u2019t see him eating more junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he didn\u2019t look up from his homework, Cody still shook his head. \u201cI saw that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let out a long wail of defeat, and let the doughnut fall from his hands. \u201cCome on, man. I didn\u2019t think you were serious! I just can\u2019t give up junk food! I mean \u2013 it\u2019s everywhere!\u201d He looked to his left on the couch, and grabbed the doughnut tray. Within half a second, Zack had stuffed most of the doughnuts into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody just glared at him, disgusted. \u201cYour loss\u201d He warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Who's version of the story do you want to see?

Hopefully that may be settled in the next day, but Cody had some nightmares to overcome at first hand.  He was dreaming on how his brother, Zack would become if he ignore his advice and keeps on eating as he would please.  That concerns him more when he had to wake himself up to get out of this dream and had a thought by looking at his twin brother who is currently falling asleep.  Then, he had some flashbacks from earlier on from what had Zack told him and with his honesty, Zack could be right from his point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to think of it, but I think he's right.\"  Cody thoughts of himself before continuing on.  \"It's not his stress that getting him eating junk food, it's mine!  I've just too worried for his sake and I'd just want him to change.  But by the looks of his reaction, he didn't seemed to stressed it out when he's eating this way.  Maybe if this would help to make me get out of this stress, and I know it's a unhealthy thing to do, but I have to give this a go and see if that feels any difference from me.  If it does, then I'll continue the way Zack would do.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a brave decision from Cody, but he needed to get out of his stress and treat the same thing what his brother, Zack had been eating.

His pyjama top didn't cover his gut any more, it had become tighter and less well fitting. His pants were the same, and he also had stretch marks when he took them off.

Guess breakfast has to do the rest!\" Once Zack walked into the living room, to his breakfast, his mother noticed his ripped PJ's. \"Zack honey, are you putting on weight?\" his mother asked worried. \"No mom it's just puberty i'll lose it eventually.\" Zack then proceeded to eat his breakfast, wich was made of: 10 Sandwiches, 2 eggs, 3 bottles of milk, 12 sausages and a gainer shake. Then Cody walked into the room. \"So Zack i noticed you've been packing on the pounds lately.\" Cody said, while looking at his ripped PJ's. \"No i'm not it's just puberty!\" Zack and Cody then both ate their breakfast. When Zack &amp; Cody got ready for school Cody noticed that his brother had trouble getting dressed. After 2 moths of stuffing and weight gain Zack's clothes were now straining against the pressure of his still growing body.  \"Hhhh....hnnnggghh\" he groaned. \"They're too small...gotta try again\" Zack pulled them up, hard. His gut began to wobble, and an even big ring of fat was stopping him from pulling up the pants. He began to jump up and down, but this made his larger waist even more obtrusive. \u201cI\u2019ll just get another\u201d Zack whispered angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[later at school, during lunch]<br>\r\nZack tucked into to his second fast food meal, burgers, chips, chicken and pizza. Cody was just finishing his macaroni. \"All of this as your lunch?\" said Cody. \"Zack, you're overeating.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that Cody? I\u2019ve been gaining weight on purpose!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy!?\u201d Cody shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cCause I like the feeling of being fat! It feels so good!\u201d<br>\r\n\"You should not be doing this, you know, this is bad for your health\"<br>\r\n\"No it ain't, I haven't felt a thing\" said Zack.<br>\r\nYou won't fit in anything if you keep going your way!\" retorted Cody. \"Those jeans were brand new, you couldn't even fit into them\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the scales in the mall, after school\" said Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[ At the mall]<br>\r\nHe and Cody then got to the mall to weigh themselves<br>\r\n\"When did i last weigh myself?\" said Zack. <br>\r\n\"Earlier this morning\" said Cody. \"You were 154 pounds\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm sure I\u2019ve gained a little but not that much\" Said Zack<br>\r\nHe then stepped on. The scales shot to a result instantly - 156 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Well, well... 2 pounds with one lunch, man, check what the scale says!\"<br>\r\nThe words OVERWEIGHT were in bright letters above Zack's reading.<br>\r\nHey, I\u2019ve gained 2 pounds, so what!\" snorted Zack. <br>\r\n\"Well if your not careful, you might get bigger!\" Cody said.<br>\r\n\u201cZack you already told me you enjoy you\u2019re bigger size, but how big do you plan to get?<br>\r\n\u201cWell if all goes well perhaps 200, 250?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!! Are you insane Zack, you could get diabetes, a hear\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know I could get some really bad things so what, that\u2019s not going to happen till I\u2019m 20\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cZack I won\u2019t say it anymore but if you\u2019ll die, it\u2019s your own fault.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Instead, it was Zack who managed to find the energy to get up first. Zack wandered over to the mirror and groaned when he found his new pyjamas had also begun to stretch. His pyjamas pants, although XL size, still had a ring of fat covering the rim. His butt had gotten bigger, and his cheeks looked a little more chubby. He had put more weight on.<br>\r\n\"Cody...\" he groaned. \"Wake up\"<br>\r\nCody remained under his bed covers, tired.<br>\r\nZack began to shake his bed.

He grabbed some of his new underpants and put them on. Although they were slightly larger, Zack found they were quite a tight squeeze. They were snug in places, but the rim he had chosen didn't show his muffin top. Satisfied, he grabbed a t-shirt and some shorts.<br>\r\nCody rolled out of bed, and landed with an unusually loud THUD. He rolled from his back onto his small belly, then grabbed some underwear and slipped it under his feet. <br>\r\n\"Hnnnghh....hhhhnnhh\" mumbled Cody, pulling hard. He stood up and got them up to his thighs, but they wouldn't go further.<br>\r\n\"No way!\" said Cody, who pulled as hard as he could. He jumped up and down, his thighs and his tiny stomach wobbled. There was no way they were going to fit him, but on the last pull, he finally got them to his waist. Cody found them incredibly tight, they were cutting into his waist. He grabbed the zipper and pulled. He rubbed his butt and tried again. It wasn't working. <br>\r\nZack stared at his brother in disbelief. Cody had ballooned in weight, he had reached his target weight of 155 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Cody...\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Look at you.

Please have a seat.\"<br>\r\nZack and Cody both took a seat which was easy because the chairs were much bigger. Cody's butt spread across the seat like an ocean of fat, while Zack's belly was hanging low in his lap.<br>\r\nSuddenly when tony put some Ice cream on the chairs desk, the robot arm moved and began to feed the twins, while the others massaged their guts to allow them to continue.<br>\r\nMinutes passed and the chairs had already fed the twins like 30 bowls and showed no signs of slowing down<br>\r\n\"Tony maybe we should stop thi-\" Zack was cut off as the robot arm fed him<br>\r\n\"I won't stop Zack, only if I run out of Ice cream!\"<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Before Cody could finish he too was fed more ice cream<br>\r\n\"These chairs are connected to my fridge the only stop when my fridge is empty<br>\r\nBoth twins looked worried at each other. How much were these chairs going to feed them?<br>\r\n2 Hours passed before an electronic voice said: \"OUT OF ICE CREAM, PLEASE REFILL FRIDGE\"<br>\r\nBoth twins looked at their larger bodies. What little clothes that fit them had been ripped to shreads all they were wearing were their boxers that amazingly, still fitted. Zack's belly was pushing against the chairs desk and his man boobs were almost as long as his arms. Cody's butt had grown so much it was too much for the char to contain, it was saging down the sides of the chair.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Zack! Look how fat we've gotten!\"<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do!\" Zack screamed to his brother<br>\r\nTony helped the twins get out of their chairs. Both twins breathed heavily.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can help you out, my brother works at a fat camp. He recently send me some clothes for immoble children here take these\" Tony handed the twins the clothes, amazingly they fitted the twins.<br>\r\n\"It might be best if you don't come here again, for your own safety.\"<br>\r\nAlthough the twins really liked all that free Ice cream they had to admit it was safer to resign.<br>\r\n\"Just come back here when you've lost some weight.\" Tony suggested<br>\r\nThe twins shook hands and waddled to the mall scales<br>\r\n\"Look at me Cody! My belly's almost touching the ground!\"<br>\r\n\"You! My butt is so big, these pants must be the only ones on the world large enough for me!\" Cody complained<br>\r\nBoth twins stepped on the mall scales which creaked under their weight.<br>\r\nZack and Cody both weighed 506 pounds and were giant balls of fat.<br>\r\nSuddenly</span></div></div>",

Even though they supplied their new clothes from Tony containing black sweatpants to support the weight without any pain at all &amp; a XXXL size t-shirts which fit them very easy not very tight at all, they still able to get on their feet which they didn't know how long does it stays with all their weight they eating already. Suddenly, the twins get hungry when they saw something that people grow fatter like of Zack &amp; Cody of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: *mmm* Man that McDonalds makes me hungry don't you?<br>\r\nCody: Yeah! Me too!<br>\r\nZack: Well what do we waiting for? Let's go &amp; eat this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins starts waddled out from the mall towards McDonalds which is only 2 buildings from the mall that make them very easy without traveling too far. about half minutes later at McDonald's near you (whatever you come from anyway), everyone eat with their favourite food they wouldn't care what the health people (including Michelle Obama) has to say about that stupid healthy stuff. People just kept wondering where can you see any human being fatter like 500lbs eating at the fast food restaurant? Well that answer is now as they finally saw two 506lb twins waddled through those doors with everyone looked shocked at the size of these two right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then reach the counter staff to have their order for their meal. Both of them have each ordered 25 large fries, Big Macs, double cheeseburger, McFlurries &amp; Large drinks of Coca-Cola. They payed their order &amp; tries to find a place to sit down to eat. They looked everywhere to find a table when it was all busy on a Saturday. But Zack finally found a table when he spotted 15 year old nerd eating healthy meals like apple bags, carrots sticks &amp; etc. And more surprisely, Zack remembers this nerd very well &amp; he hates him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name is Andrew Joseph Clark. A 15 year old brown hair with goofy sweetshirt, tie &amp; glasses is currntly the best student of the entire school when he had all staright A's like Cody does but missed out a few years ago. He's been treating Zack like a puppy dog when he tells him you can't do this, you can't do that, you got your sums wrong &amp; etc &amp; Zack deemed to get revenge on that nerd. Until now! Cody follows Zack to the table where Andrew sits in just now with two chairs empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Hey nerd! How's it goin! Mind do we sit down with you?<br>\r\nAndrew: Err no! I got somebody with me!<br>\r\nZack: Some who? Well where is he then?<br>\r\nAndrew: On the chair right now!<br>\r\nZack: On the chair? I don't see somebody in fact, you haven't got anyone with you!<br>\r\nAndrew: Err...well...<br>\r\nZack: See! You haven't got any in fact we all hate you. You been treated me like I was your dog telling me I can't do this, I can't do that, I got me sums wrong &amp; etc &amp; I getting sick of this. And that's why I'm back for revenge on you!<br>\r\nAndrew: Revenge? For what? And by the way, both of you need to loose weight because it's bad for your...<br>\r\nZack: Shut up! We like our fat &amp; we keeping this way. I do got revenge on you. But sadly I'm not gonna do it.<br>\r\nAndrew: Well if you not doing it, then who's gonna beat me?<br>\r\nZack: Well I got my fat twin brother Cody with me &amp; he'll be sitting on your knee while you gonna watch us eat.<br>\r\nCody: What? Me? I can't sit on Andrew just because he's too thin.<br>\r\nZack: That's exactly the point! We weigh 506lbs which means we fatter than any thin person around &amp; can easily squash them. Your butt's bigger than anyone else so that's why I want you to sit on this nerd's knee just to get my revenge on him.<br>\r\nCody: My big butt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked around his big butt to give a shake when he looked at his fat brother Zack with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: Yeah! Your right Zack! I do got my big juicy butt in fact, I'm gonna sit on this goof's knee right now.<br>\r\nZack: That's a spirit! Now go &amp; sit on this lunatec big boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zack ordered his brother what to do, Cody with a huge grin on his fat face waddles towards Andrew to be sit on for Zack's revenge. In Andrew's point of view however saw Cody's butt is absolutely huge as it was a size like two beach balls in his black sweatpants as he shows Andrew by slapping his left buttcheek &amp; was ready to go. Andrew thought he's gonna trapped here &amp; thought to be get squashed by Cody's massive butt. But the question I asking you, is Cody gonna sit on Andrew's knee on time?</span></div></div>",

But he then noticed that from his calculations, thin people are a lot faster than fat people. Cody slowly gets to sit on Andrew's knee but got backfired as Andrew quicky moves out from his seat &amp; was thought of getting out of here by keep staring at fat Cody. But from out of nowhere, he gets run over by Zack's huge stomach &amp; was complety knocked out cold laying on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Oops! Sorry about that nerd! My big belly was out of my way. But don't worry, I'll make sure you get yourself better with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs by words, Zack took someting out from his pocket &amp; it was like the shape of the gun but with two different colours. He then points towards the knocked out Andrew &amp; starts to shoot at him with a green beam that begins to surround Andrew's body. But he looked different than he was few minutes ago as Andrew's body thought to be shrink down &amp; he is shrinking with a shock of Cody's face when looking down what his fat twin brother has done to 'now little' Andrew the goof All the way until he is 5 inches tall &amp; still out cold as Zack then picks him with two hands which both he &amp; Cody tried not to luagh before Andrew could woke himself up anytime soon. So to avoid waking himself up, Zack then puts him to his left pocket of black sweatpants while he put the gun on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: What was that you got there?<br>\r\nZack: It's a shrink ray! And...?   <br>\r\nCody: And where did you get the gun from?<br>\r\nZack: Arwin gave me one after he was shrunk for 5 minutes. But I think you wasn't here when I dropped by 2 months ago. <br>\r\nCody: Well you better grew him back to normal size &amp; let him go right now before anyone see's us what we done to him.<br>\r\nZack: Relax! Nobody's gonna see us when he's in my pocket right now. But besides, you never got your chance to sit on his knee anyway.<br>\r\nCody: Yeah! I was so close to get right onto him. But I wish I was gonna make it on time.<br>\r\nZack: You will! In fact we're gonna take care of him while we're at our suite.<br>\r\nCody: You know what? I think that's a great idea! But what will mom know about this?<br>\r\nZack: Our mom! She's still on her world tour remember?<br>\r\nCody: Oh yeah! I forgot about about that! But Yeah let's do it! But can we eat our meal first before that?<br>\r\nZack: Yeah I think I will too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the 506lbs fat twins sat on the chair &amp; starts eating their meals at McDonald's while Andrew who got shrunk earlier already placed in Zack's pocket was still out cold from the bump of Zack's big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later while the twins got back to their suite, Andrew finally woke up when he looked around their room as he of thought someting looked bigger than expected when he's been placed on the giant wooden chair. He didn't knew what was going on when he thought it was a dream. But it didn't when he heard loud footsteps coming towards Zack &amp; Cody's room where he's currently at right now. Andrew's felt nervously when the door handle began to twist itself. And when the door finally opened, it was fat Zack &amp; Cody who came to their room speaking gossips &amp; all that until Zack then spotted the newly woke up tiny Andrew as both of them came close with Andrew tried to step back away from them but nowhere to run! Nowhere to hide from the two (his point of view) Gigantic fat twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Hey Cody look! Andrew's waking up like a tiny baby!<br>\r\nCody: Yeah! He does look tiny when we gonna make a good care on this goof.<br>\r\nAndrew: Goof? Well hold on the minute! I don't know what you two did to me because if you do, then get me back to my normal size now!<br>\r\nZack: Sorry! No can do!<br>\r\nAndrew: Why not!<br>\r\nZack: Because we like to spend time with you for 24 hours. So HA!<br>\r\nAndrew: How dare you! You have no respect to me what's so ever. And I demand you turn me back right now this instant!<br>\r\nZack: Sorry! Still no! Your 24 hours with us begins now! And In think it's time we start off by sitting on you since you got out with a lucky escape.<br>\r\nAndrew: By who?<br>\r\nZack: Well! We know we can't sit on you at the same time. That might be stupid by the two of us wearing black sweatpants. So to make us fair, we thought me &amp; Cody can have a coin toss to find out who's gonna sit on you first. And we make a turn after that. So you just sit here &amp; don't move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo both fat twins move away from Andrew for the moment when he's stands put on the giant wooden chair as they been given a coin toss. Cody took out a quarter out from his pocket when he choses to be tails while Zack choses to be heads. Cody flick a coin &amp; was revealed with their expressions from their fat faces when they came back towards tiny Andrew for their verdict of who's get to sit on Andrew first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew: Well!

Cody then stepped forward and headed towards a chair where Andrew looks up in awe seeing a young fat twin towering over him with a big grin on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned around leaving Andrew to look at the size of Cody's butt that is two times bigger from Andrew's point of view when he's now so tiny and that can cause major problems for him.

Bombs away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Cody began to lower his butt down slowly as it cast its shadow over a feared Andrew who stood there worrying as Cody's ginourmous butt's getting closer and Zack watching with his big smile to his face.  It gets closer and closer till Andrew put his hands out and hold on Cody's butt, hoping to prevent from happening but Cody's too strong for his size and sits on him flattened on a chair and the twins giggled of what just happened when Cody turned his head towards a chair he sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: \"Wow!  I didn't expect to sit on him with that size, but this is awesome.\"<br>\r\nZack: \"You see, my plan did work, after all we are big anyway.\"<br>\r\nCody: \"Yeah, but I wonder how he's getting on with my butt size experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody asked as you can choose their point of view would you like to follow.

I've just weighed at 350lbs.  Isn't this awesome?<br>\r\nCody: Yeah it sure is!  Good thing our Mom isn't here right now.

What dream did you think of?<br>\r\nZack: I Haven't made my thoughts yet.  Do you?<br>\r\nCody: Same!  But we're think about it tonight and then we get to meet Arwin first thing in the morning.<br>\r\nZack: Sounds like a plan to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fat twins shook hands in agreement and continued to play Xbox all the way until bedtime in about four hours later.  As they lie on their beds even though Zack's bed creeking a lot because of his massive weight,  The twins began to dream about their own weight and what could happen when they will meet Arwin tommorrow morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning has been approached as the twins woke themse... I mean roll themselves up which shook the whole room itself.  Zack was first to get up on the floor before Cody followed in and after they had a huge breakfast an hour later, the fat twins made their way to Awrin's office which appears not to be here at the moment but twins wouldn't mind if they could use this for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: Hello?...Arwin are you here?<br>\r\nZack: Nah!  Who needs him?  We could use this from ourselves. Well there it is!

It's fantastic!\" said Zack.<br>\r\nTony came back with a trolley filled with small bowls. In each of these bowls were five scoops of ice cream.<br>\r\n\"This are my new test flavours!\" said Tony. \"I come up with about a dozen more every day, they're easy to make. All's you have to do is eat fifteen bowls a day and then write your thoughts down. I'll pay you seven bucks an hour, plus a fifty cents pay rise every two weeks you work here\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" said Zack. \"I'm all up for it!\"<br>\r\n\"Fifteen bowls!\" said Cody, gobsmacked. \"We can't eat all that each!\"<br>\r\n\"I can\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"But, you've got your health to worry about\"<br>\r\n\"I'll let you worry about my helath and yours while I eat this ice cream\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"But, you could get fat!\" said Cody.<br>\r\n\"Hey, so could you Mr Healthy! Come on, as long as we walk from our suite to Tony's and back, our figures will be fine!\"<br>\r\n\"I guess it's ok then...this is ordinary ice cream, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...not quite\" said Tony. \"I've added extra flavour but their may be a few side effects\"<br>\r\n\"Oh all right, I give in\" said Cody. \"Sign me up too!\"<br>\r\nTony put the fifteen bowls of ice cream in front of them. Zack dug in, and soon after, fifteen bowls were gone. He'd eaten more than he could take, but still wanted more.<br>\r\n\"You don't look so great\" said Cody, who was on his eleventh bowl.<br>\r\n\"Neither do you\" said Zack \"Heck, you look stuffed\"<br>\r\nCody burped loudly and rubbed his thin waist.<br>\r\n\"I feel bloated\" said Cody. \"But I think I can take a little more\"<br>\r\nTony came back through with a camera and began snapping photos.<br>\r\n\"What are the photos for?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Advertisements, blogs...that sort of thing. I need more customers to boost my business, and you look like great mascots. Hey, I'll even stick the pictures on the wall so people can see you enjoying yourselves when they come in\"<br>\r\nTony took out the first two pictures and wrote \"Week 1\" on a noticeboard. He then pinned the seperate pictures of Zack and Cody eating ice cream on and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Are you guys done?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm finished\" said Zack, pushing away the fifteenth bowl.<br>\r\n\"I can't take anymore\" moaned Cody, belching over his half finished thirteenth portion.<br>\r\n\"That's ok\" Just write your thoughts down on the noticeboard over there\"<br>\r\nCody groaned and got off his seat. He and Zack walked over to the noticeboard and put mainly positive comments. They then collected fourteen dollars each, <br>\r\n\"So what did you think?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"I think I have indegestion\" groaned Cody, clutching his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby, come on lets go buy a hot-dog\"<br>\r\nThey each bought one, and Cody slowly nibbled his way through his. It warmed up his taste buds a little.<br>\r\n\"That;s better\" he said. \"What did Tony do with the ice cream I didn't finish\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I ate it\"<br>\r\n\"You did? Man, your stomach must be huge\"<br>\r\nThey got back into their room and slouched on the couch, exhausted. <br>\r\n\"So your coming back tomorrow?\" <br>\r\n\"I'll try\" said Cody. \"I'd better take the stairs next time, I don't wanna let that stuff get to my hips\"<br>\r\n\"Who cares, it's only ice cream\" said Zack. \"Our summer break is fourteen weeks, we can pack in the job by then and spend the money\"<br>\r\nThey watched Tv for a few hours, before ordering large lunches and dinners from room service.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One morning, 4 weeks later the alarm clock went off, Cody raised his legs and got out of bed, yawning. He brushed his long blonde hair out of his eyes and took some underpants from the dresser. Then, he took his pyjamas off and rubbed his waist. It was lined with red stretch marks, and he'd been having trouble sleeping all through the night because they had become uncomfortable. He scratched his gut a little and burped.<br>\r\nZack groaned and rolled straight off his bed, taking the duvet with him. He rolled onto the floor and slowly got up again.<br>\r\n\"Hey\" said Cody. \"You'd better get changed, we're going shopping today\"<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too, but we've got to hurry. There's a sale at Gradudats\"<br>\r\n\"Gradu-whats?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"It's a big clothing store and I wanna spend some of this cash\"<br>\r\nThe twins had made nearly two hundred bucks, and had recieved two pay rises each. Zack had now extended his ice cream rota to twenty bowls a day, and was nearing twenty five. Cody could not match this, but had soon found he could muster more than just fifteen bowls now. Twenty was now his new target. Tony provided more and more interesting flavours, and both twins thought they were delicious. However, they tended to eat so much that they gave themselves stomach ache, and instead of walking the two mile journey and taking the stairs, they had resorted to using cabs and lifts before slouching on the couch lazily. They always felt too sluggish after a big quota at Tony's.<br>\r\nCody found his underpants and slipped them under his feet. They went up over his legs and he pulled them up to his waist. He then pulled the elastic waistband and let go. It snapped against his stomach, painfully, and it wobbled a little.<br>\r\n\"Ow\" yelled Cody, who rubbed his sore gut. He then walked over to the dresser to get his pants and sweater vest.<br>\r\n\"Whoah\" said Cody. \"This is sorta tight!\"<br>\r\nHe ran a finger over his waistline and snorted.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...they must have shrunk\" he said. He went to the mirror and looked at the underpants. <br>\r\n\"Ooof\" he groaned, as he felt a pang of tightness. \"It's worse than I thought!\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" said Zack, his head still in the duvet.<br>\r\n\"My pants must have shrunk in the washer yesterday\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,ok\"<br>\r\nCody nervously ran a finger over his waistline. A ring of fat was slowly wobbling over the rim of his underwear, it went all the way around his waist and was nearly touching the button at the front. He stroked his gut and walked back over to the bed. By now, Zack had also gotten up.<br>\r\nCody chuckled as his brother drowsily grabbed some underwear and looked in the mirror. Zack had gained weight. His pyjama top didn't cover his gut any more, it had become tighter and less well fitting. His pants were the same, and he also had stretch marks when he took them off. He grabbed the underwear and tried to put them on.<br>\r\n\"Hhhh....hnnnggghh\" he groaned. \"They're too small...gotta try again\"<br>\r\nZack pulled them up, hard. His gut began to wobble, and an even bigger ring of fat was stopping him from pulling up the pants. He began to jump up and down, but this made his larger waist even more obtrusive. He was beginning to tire. Cody stared at him strangely. How had Zack gotten so fat?<br>\r\nHis attenttion turned over to his own underwear. He hadn't done the zipper yet. Cody turned around and pulled the zipper up, but it slipped out of his hands. He tried again, but it only went up so far before his gut began to jiggle and they felt too tight. He then breathed in and sucked his stomach up. The fat bulging over the underwear disappeared. Cody smiled, zipped up the zipper and exhaled again. But as he did so, the layer of fat suddenly fell onto the pants again, the zipper unzipped and his gut bulged forward.<br>\r\n\"These pants don't fit!\" shouted Zack. \"How come?\"<br>\r\n\"Your pants must have shrunk yours in the wash too!\" said Cody. \"We need new pants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody put on a sweater vest and some pants and Zack had found some elasticated shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, they were at a nearby mall and...?</span></div></div>",

I think they were a pretty tight squeeze on you too, Mr Still-Skinny\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Your fattening both of us up here. All that ice-cream, all that junk food, it hasn't done you any good. And unfortunately, a little of what you do is starting to show on me\"<br>\r\nCody lifted his sweater vest to show Zack the unsightly roll of fat he had tried to conceal underneath his baggiest T-shirt. His whole body had plumped up a level, he looked fatter and more sluggish<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault you're bigger. You took that job, you should fear the consequences\"<br>\r\n\"So should you, chubby\" said Cody, who took a bite out of his second burger. \"I should go on a diet\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, eating a burger...what a great way to start\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"The best way is by weighing myself first, I'll slow down gradually on the junk. Then I'll go on a diet...after a bowl of ice cream....or some fries...mmmmm...I'm sure I can eat in moderation\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go to those scales\" said Zack.<br>\r\nHe threw the rubbish in the bin and took out a few dollars. He inserted it into the machine.<br>\r\n\"When did we last weigh ourselves?\" said Zack. <br>\r\n\"We were at the doctors two months ago\" said Cody. \"I was one hundred and twenty eight pounds, you were one hundred and thirty six\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm sure I'll be ok now\"<br>\r\nZack inserted the number sixteen into the machine for his age, followed by his previous weight on 136 pounds. The machine read <i>HEALTHY WEIGHT</i>. He then stepped on. The scales shot to a result instantly - 157 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Well, well...twenty one pounds in two months, you probably gained one and a half stone when you started working at Tony's four weeks ago. Man, check what the scale says!\"<br>\r\nThe words <i>ALMOST OVERWEIGHT </i>were in bright red letters above Zack's reading.<br>\r\n\"So what, my extra pounds are part of me now.It'll be gone next cemester. Your turn, Mr Skinny...\" <br>\r\nChuckling, Cody inserted his money and got on the scale. He typed his age, and then his old weight of 128 pounds. The scale read <i>ALMOST UNDERWEIGHT</i>. <br>\r\n\"See, I needed to gain a little anyway\" smiled Cody, rubbing his gut. The scale went up to....- 143 pounds. Cody gulped nervously and waited for the machine reading. It came as <i>BEYOND HEALTHY WEIGHT</i>.<br>\r\n\"Oh...errmmm....I must have taken it a little too far\" groaned Cody, stepping off. He raised his shirt again and looked at his gut, concerned. His flat stomach wasn't there anymore, it had become bigger and more noticeable. But while Cody's sweater vest only revealed a trace of his overeating, Zack's T-shirt was under strain. It didn't quite cover him and it showed every pound of his weight gain.<br>\r\n\"Not exactly super-fit are you?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up. My extra fifteen pounds are a little more spread out than your whopping twenty one\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, we've both gained more than a stone\" snorted Zack. \"If your not careful, you might get bigger!\"<br>\r\n\"That's never gonna happen. I'm not even gonna try and diet, being beyond healthy weight isn't that bad. I'll be in perfect shape for the swim tryouts for the races the city is having, the grand prize money is $1000\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.

But, it was not only the prices worrying him; it was the waistbands of the clothes. They were not that stretchy, and Zack was larger than ever, so to see him pulling clothes off of the hangers and disappearing into the changing rooms with a waddle, worried Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling some of the clothes off of the hangers, he disappeared into the other changing room; striping down to his boxers - which clung tightly to him - he stood sideways in front of the full length mirror. His hair was longer than it was when he had taken the job at Tony's. It hung down the side of his chubby cheeked face in two blond curtains and a small double chin was making itself known on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo round, plump manboobs were beginning to push their way forward from his chest and a large belly - at least eight inches larger than before - curved forward from below them and met at his pelvis which led to two thick thighs. He could just see his feet; five thick fat filled toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he pulled the trousers off of the hanger and slipped his feet into them; pulling them up his thighs, he took a deep breath and then let it out, before pulling the trousers over his bottom. Surprisingly, there was more stretch in them than he though there was and they fastened easily around his belly. To his immense happiness, the shirt was a little baggy and hid his rounding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up seven of the same outfits, he headed out, bought them and then returned to Zack's changing room. A pile of trousers - some with ripped seams and some with burst buttons - was piled up outside in a basker that had a sign reading <i>Too Small </i>above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zack, listen. I'm done. I've got my clothes. I'll see you at home, ok? Mum's making her fifteen cheese full fat lasagne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, see you at dinner!\" Grunted Zack. He heard Cody's heavy footfalls disappear as Cody left the shop. He pulled off the trousers, put on his own clothes, threw the trousers <br>\r\ninto the basket and stalked out of the shop, annoyed at not being able to fit into clothes that Cody could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed a shop, his belly rumbled; a sign in the window read \"Taste Tester Wanted\"; after talking with Henry, the boss, and admitting his situation - that he already had a job at Tony's and after explaining what hours he worked there - it was decided that after he had finished at Tony's he would come here to taste the Brownies that this shop made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you want to start now?\" Inquired Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's belly gave a very audible rumble and, salivating and noddng, he took a seat and dug in as soon as Henry put a bowl of brownies in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSixteen bowls of brownies later, Zack reclined in the chair, both hands on his belly and his face covered in chocolate brownie remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god! You can eat!\" Exclaimed Henry, shocked. \"I think I did good in hiring you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Burped Zack. \"C-Can I have another brownie for the journey home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Henry handed him a brownie, helped him up, growning slightly under Zack's heavy glutted form. Watching him go, Henry smiled happily; if this kept up he'd make millions from that gluttonous pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-xXx-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack burped as he washed his face after returning to the suite; surprisingly, Cody wasn't there. The door slammed; Zack stuck his head out of the bathroom. Cody, his face caked in ice cream, was washing his face with the flannel in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been back to Tony's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; I had a snack before coming home. You didn't spend all day in Gradudats, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not.\" Replied Zack, crossing his arms over his chest, which made his still stuffed belly look bigger than ever and gave him time to think up a lie \"I had a couple of hotdogs and went to the Arcade. I didn't win, naturally, but I had fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack didn't think that now was the time to tell Cody that he had a second job and decided to save it for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-xXx-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating seven helpings of lasagne each, Zack and Cody crawled into bed; Cody's creaked underneath him, but Zack's groaned alarmingly as he rolled onto his back, his big belly bulging into the air. While Cody had stuffed his belly full with 7,000 calories - enough for two fully grown men - Zack had stuffed his face with 14,000 calories.<br>\r\nBellies bubbling to digest all the food they had stuffed into it, the two ever expanding twins fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the twins awoke four weeks later, it was a Sunday and officially two weeks until the swim meet, and neither twin was in peak condition. In fact, both twins were fatter than ever. Zack, who had done nothing to crub his appetite, snored as Cody was the first to climb out of bed.<br>\r\nCody had remember his weight reading of <i>BEYOND HEALTHY WEIGHT</i> and had taken it to mean that he was in the Healthy Weight category, so while continuing his job at Tony's he had begun snacking on the side too. Yawning, stretching and scratching his belly, he gave a small burp - which was the remains of the five tiered chocolate cake he had scoffed before going to bed the previous night - and headed off to the bathroom. As he closed the door, it clunked slightly, causing Zack to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stepped onto the scales; Carey, on a diet, had brought herself and the boys a talking scale that recorded each previous weight and said whether you were healthy weight, overweight or obese. Pressing the buttom that said <i>CODY</i> and typing in his previous weight of 143 pounds - which is what he had weight four weeks ago when he had last used the scales - he input his height of five foot five. The words <i>\"BEYOND HEALTHY WEIGHT\"</i> came from the scales. Cody pressed the button that said PROCEED and watched the numbers tick as the scale determined his weight. He watched the numbers rise <i>130...135...140... 145... 150... 155... 160...161...162...163...164</i>. He stepped off, confused and the scales said <i>\"OVERWEIGHT\"</i>; how was it possible that he had gained twenty ones pounds in a month? From behind him, he heard Zack snort; stood in the doorway, Zack's larger-than-ever-frame gently thumped against the sides of the door. Working two jobs and snacking on the side had swelled Zack to his largest ever size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, fatty, <i>YOU</i> get on.\" Said Cody, putting both hands on his hips, which made his love handles look bigger than ever. \"You've been eating enough at Tony's to feed <i>three hippos</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will. I can't be more than 170 at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stepped forward and onto the scales. He pressed the button that said ZACK and typed in his height of five foot four and his former weight of 157 pounds. The scale said <i>\"ALMOST OVERWEIGHT\"</i>. Like Cody, Zack pressed the button that said <i>PROCEED</i> and watched the numbers rise. <i>140...145...150..155...160...165...170...175...180...185....186...187...</i>&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the scales stopped and said <i>\"OBESE\"</i>; Cody snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for one seventy. Come on, let's get dressed. We've got to start training for the swim competition. You really need it.\" With that, Cody led his infinitely fatter twin out of the room. \"We'll get a hamburger or two before we begin your diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My diet? You're overweight too! You need one just as much as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a bit chubby, that's all. The weight'll be gone before the swim meet; I won't even have to work for it. You, on the other hand, will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? I bet you, Cody, that you're <i>at least</i> 185 by the time of the swim meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if! Alright, I'll take that bet! If I'm not 185, you diet, alright? If I am, which I won't be, then I'll cut back a bit. Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody burped and shook his brother's hand. The two got dressed, stuffed their faces with ten helpings of breakfast, and waddled off to Tony's. As Cody headed home from Tony's, Zack headed to Henry's Brownie Barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, both bloated teenagers, after a day of stuffing, fell to sleep very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He watched the numbers rise 180...185...190... 206... 210. He stepped off, confused and the scales said \"OBESE\"; the same as it said 4 weeks ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he realised: He hadn't yet tried on his swimming trunks! He quickly waddled over to the dresser and grabbed his trunks. He checked the size, it was anX L<br>\r\n\"Let's hope this fits...\" Zack whispered to himself<br>\r\nAfter stripping down to his underwear, he looked at himself in the bathroom mirror. His face was a lot fatter than 4 weeks ago. His double chin almost swallowed his neck, his manboobs were bigger than his closed fists. Zack grabbed one, it felt jiggly and warm. He then moved his chubby fingers down to his belly, which hung over his underwear. He then played a little bit with his belly button and finally, proceeded to try on his trunks. He could get him past his thighs, but his belly was a 'bigger' problem. his midsection was never going to be contained by an XL size swimming trunk. However, rather amazingly, Zack managed to get it to fit. He turned towards the mirror. The seams looked like they were ready to rip, and the trunks really made his overhang stand out more.<br>\r\n\"Well, It'll have to do, once I have enough money I can get a bigger one...\"<br>\r\nZack waddled over to his bedroom and was about to wake Cody up, wanting him to also try on his swimming trunks, it was the day of the swim meet after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",
