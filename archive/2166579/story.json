During the first day, a symbol will appear on the child's hand, indicating which god they are the child of, the exception is the children of the great Zodiac, the symbol will appear on the part of the body that god represents (For what each of those are, go here <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/each-zodiac-sign-has-a-body-part-that-goes-with-their-sign-this-is-yours-8693442\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.elitedaily.com/p/each-zodiac...</a>) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the child has been chosen they may choose a cabin to enter. There are twelve cabins at camp, the children of the Zodiac must sleep in their parent's respective cabin but the children of minor gods may choose the cabin they enter. The cabins are located in a square, with three cabins on each side, all facing a central courtyard. Behind the Aries, Taurus and Gemini cabins are the training grounds, with areas for sword fighting, agility and endurance training and combat training, along with the dining hall and bathrooms. Across the square, behind the Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius cabins is a large forest stocked with monsters that can be hunted at any time. Behind the Pisces cabin is a large lake for swimming, canoeing or any other water activities as well as the opportunity to fight aquatic monsters. And finally, being the Leo building is the staff office and headquarters and entrance to the camp, which campers are not allowed to cross unless they are given permission to do so. Permission could come in the form of authorised excursions or granted quests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome things to note about the Constellations in question. Virgo does not have any children, considering she is the sign of the virgin. Even among the other Zodiac, besides Scorpio perhaps, there won't be too many children, as these children are quite powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of this, the children are allowed to have powers based on their parent, this can range from basic manipulation of the element their parent represents to more unusual abilities, like the child of Pisces being able to spiritually, or literally, tie themselves to someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what cabin will your character be in?</span></div></div>",

There are activities to help everyone stay safe from monsters, as well as activities to just have a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey Everyone! This interactive is obviously a parody of the Percy Jackson book series. Only instead of the Greek gods, our characters will be the children of the Zodiacs, who are the replacement for the gods in this story. More about the camp itself and how the interactive will work are on the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the rules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a 13+ story: I'm sure you can read up on the specifics of what that means but essentially make it appropriate for young teens and older to be reading. (Note that most of the characters are probably teens as well so they shouldn't really get involved with all that stuff anyway)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the monsters are concerned, though the Zodiacs are technically Latin, you're free to refer to them by their Greek names, I'm sure most people would be more familiar with the Greek counterpart as opposed to the Roman one. But if a story starts with Roman monsters try to stick to them being Roman, unless you give a reason as to why the characters are suddenly using the Greek equivalent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice long chapters! No one likes one-liners, they waste chapters, there's no point asking people if they want the character to be called Fred or Mike, just pick the name you like and if someone doesn't like the name, they can always make a different storyline with their own characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllow multiple characters: When starting a story, make sure to leave an option for someone to create a different character, not everyone wants to play the same character as you do, and hey, with more characters being made you could even have them appear in another character's story as friends or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo Wild! As long as you stick to the 13+ get a crazy as you want with the stories, these are your stories and you can shape them in any way you want. You want your character to have a 50-foot One eye one horn flying purple people eater? then go right ahead (Though maybe teach it to eat pork instead) I'm not going to delete chapters for being too crazy, as long as the other rules are followed you have free reign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, if any of you were wondering what the Greek God to Zodiac conversion would be, here are my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAries - Ares<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaurus - Hera<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGemini - Artemis and Apollo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCancer - Demeter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo - Zeus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgo - Hestia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibra - Nemesis (Or Hermes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScorpio - Aphrodite<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSagittarius - Hephestus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCapricorn - Hades (Or Dionysus) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquarius - Athena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPisces - Poseidon</td>",
