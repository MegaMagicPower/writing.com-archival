A female voice comes over the intercom \"Yes?\u201d Jenny Replies \"This is Jenny from LJ Hooker Real-Estate Agency\". The gates begins to open, she notices the Australian flag waving brazenly above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGates now open she drives her Jeep Cherokee (quite possibly her first mistake in this adventure) up a steep dirt path. On the incline she remembers how her manager said she'll be fired if this house isn't sold. \"Like of course the whole recession and all doesn't factor in\" Jenny mutters to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParking close to the house she checks herself in the rear view mirror. Her pale complexion and neatly tied long natural blonde hair is clearly visible. With a slight grin she looks left, grabs her camcorder and tripod from the passenger seat then exists the vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Jenny presses a lock button on her security remote, a rapid succession beep is heard then she begins approaching the house. Although some may even call it a miniature mansion due the entrance and privacy. The house stands nicely at the hill top surrounded by bush containing knee high grass with steep inclines, also it's good fifteen minutes drive from the nearest town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can knock the door swings open! \"G'day little Sheila! Ya ere to take more picture of me house?\" Shouts Shawn the house's owner\". She holds up her camcorder and says \"Yes Sir, however this time I'm going to try video footage!\" Shawn nods while saying \"Yeah right girl, come right in... we'll be leaving real soon... should be back in three hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenny enters she hears a child's voice ask \"Why is she dressed like a waitress on TV Mum?\" Jenny looks down at her white buttoned business top with the LJ Hooker logo embedded on the top left above her medium sized breasts. Jenny also wore a black skirt down to her knees with low sensible heels. The look complements her small frame and five foot eight stature perfectly. Jenny hears a female reply \"Tis because she's from the city, that what they all look like love\". Jenny still can't understand why they hired a city Real-Estate Agency in the first place, it's a little odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family is now in Jenny's view consisting of; seven year old twin boys, Shawn wife's Tracy and their eldest sixteen year old Goth daughter. Unfortunately Jenny doesn't know the children's names as she has never met them before. Before Jenny can react Shawn yells out to the group \"everybody to the car we're outta of here!\" on command everyone exists swiftly, except the Goth girl who drags slightly slower behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny finds herself alone in the house's living room with camcorder in hand she begins filming. Her plan is to make a video package with commentary even filming herself showing liveability, anything to attract at least one buyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny completes her rounds in no time which included a wondrous view from the second floor master bedroom's balcony. Deciding to start filming outside, She heads for the kitchen and attempts existing. While trying to turn the door knob she lets out a massive yell \"Ouch fuck my hand!\" She looks at her hand which is covered in blood with four thumb tacts sticking out. \"Those little shits!\" Jenny curses at the obvious offenders then places her camcorder and tripod gently down on the kitchen bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wincing in pain from pulling out tacts She dashes to the kitchen sink and starts washing blood off. However, it doesn't appear to be stopping. \"Fuck my life! why did this have to happen!\" Jenny screams. She grabs some paper towels and tries to rub off the blood to no avail. </span></div></div>",

On the opposite side are floor to ceiling one-way mirrored glass right across including a sliding door leading directly outside. Lastly on the only solid wall is a washbasin, medical kit and mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the medical kit. The cuts on her hand aren't all that bad, it's just persistent bleeding. In the kit she finds a box of Waterproof Gum Leaf shaped sticky plasters. She takes the box and notices a orange thin fabric incline easy chair. Deciding she'll sit down while applying the sticky paster to her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flops down hastily and let's out another loud yell \"Fuck!\" Leaping instantly She manages to smear blood on her shirt and hair, a rip sound is also heard. She turns around and can see about fifteen centimetres of her shirt attached to the chair. On closer inspection she can see what appears to be more tacts. \"This can't be happening, what is wrong with these kids, can't they play less painful pranks?\" exclaims Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unbuttons what's left of her bloody shirt exposing her black bra, reaching the last button she pulls her arms through and lets go. Facing her back to the mirror she inspects the damage, she sees three scratch marks on her upper back only bleeding slightly and five thump tacts stuck on her bum.Jenny wondered why her bum was hurting, she easily manages to pull out the remaining tacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to retrieve the sticky plasters which went flying earlier, she notices the inviting shower which gives her an idea for liveability footage. She picks up the sticky plasters then proceeds to apply the plasters to her back and hand. Now standing there in her bra, skirt and heels Jenny ponders what do to next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's either this or fired thinks Jenny in disbelief, nevertheless she finds comfort that her roommate has censorship software at least no one will see her nude. With the camcorder positioned and on record she removes her heels. She then unhooks her bra exposing her wonderful breasts placing it on the floor. Next she begins to unzip her skirt and sides it down revealing her pink panties. Before putting her skirt down she inspects for holes letting out a sigh of relief with none visible. Lastly the panties, she pulls them straight off exposing her trimmed blonde pussy. Looking backwards at the mirror she notices no blood or cuts. \"Thank god\" Jenny whispers. She can't believe she's standing naked in a stranger's house, thankfully there is a good two more hours before the family returns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntying her hair she heads into the shower, turns it on and steps under. With her entire body under the water excess blood washes from head to drain. She cleans herself for a good ten minutes rubbing gently, using the shower gel and shampoo already inside. After turning off the taps and opening the shower screen door she pauses for a second catching a view of outside. This gives her another idea, what better way to prove privacy if you can step outside completely naked without a care in the world.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe grabs a towel and begins to carefully dry her wet body so not to knock off any sticky plasters.</span></div></div>",

She slides the door, however not completely. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe heads out, without noticing the door slowly closing. The sliding door works on a catch system which did not engage, furthermore it will not open from outside. Now outside she sets down the tripod a few meters away, it has a nifty feature which allows timer panning. She presses the relevant buttons and sets it to start panning one-hundred-eighty degrees in thirty seconds. Rushing back to the door she notices it\u2019s closed, which does not worry her as she is convinced it isn't locked. Steadily she walks through the garden in time with the camera. Her naked body seems to radiate in the sun as she struts, with her moderately wet long blonde hair stays in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce reaching a good point she halts and stretches out in an upwards to outwards motion. Satisfied this will look fantastic she heads back to the bathroom door to collect her car keys and clothes. Her gym bag is on the back seat so a change of shirt won't be a problem. She reaches for the door in an attempt to open and tugs. A loud thud sound is heard, she tries again and the same occurs. \"What! How can it be locked?!\" Jenny exclaims.

Sweating from the 'workout' she slumps with shovel in hand. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nWhile she is catching her breath the alarm final stops.

The glass smashes instantly the force almost knocks her over but she manages to stay on her feet. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe gym bag sitting just out of reach will make retrieving it problematic. She is also prevented from just unlocking the car while it's in lockdown. She looks at the shovel and has an idea to use it as a hook.

Her feet touch a concreate surface and the door closes behind her. Still gripping the shovel she makes her way along the wall hoping to reach another door. Jenny feet hit a wooden object, she bobs down and feels something like stairs. Jenny slowly accessed the stairs which don't go very high and reaches yet another door. Her heart pounding incredibly fast, anything could be on the other side she wonders in fear.

Firstly she puts back on her pink panties, followed by her skirt, bra and heels. She then picks up her torn shirt, throwing it into the nearby bin. \"Don't really have much use for a torn shirt\" mutters Jenny as she heads back outside for her camera. Picking up her camera and tripod she heads back to her car, grabbing her keys from her skirt pocket she opens the back door and throws everything inside.

She then unzips her skirt placing it in the bag, whilst still sitting in the driver's seat. Jenny then puts on her tight black gym shorts. Into the bag again she grabs her purple sports shoes and white ankle socks, slipping them all on with ease. She grabs her phone, strapping it to her arm and exists the car, inserting her headphones into her ear and pressing play. Jenny grabs her car keys and places them inside her phone wallet and her towel over her shoulder. With a stretch and a small on the spot jog she heads down towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive lake sprawls around a almost beach like sand, Jenny decides she can do about four laps before running out of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fair bit of time passes as she collapses at the start point after the forth lap. Jenny huffs and wheezes with her knees in the ground, sweating up a storm. She checks her phone, no messages. \"Guess they haven't turned up yet, I need a shower I'm sweating so much\" complains Jenny. Jenny looks over to the lake \"Oh, this places is secluded enough, maybe I'll take a quick swim to cool down, at least this time my clothes will be in reach\" Jenny says with confidence. She lays her towel on the ground and starts taking he shoes and socks off. She then starts peeling off her top, revealing her black bra, dropping it into the towel. Next she pulls down her shorts and panties in one go, her neatly trimmed bush on display for the wildness. Lastly, she unhooks her bra, releasing her breasts places this also in the towel. Now completely naked she rolls her clothes, socks and shoes into the towel. \"Just in case I'll keep in altogether, don't want anything blowing away!\" Jenny says with a smile and a nod to herself. Jenny doesn't feel to afraid being naked willing this time, not in the comfort she can't exactly get locked outside whilst already outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny walks into the lake, it's luke warm, thank gosh, so glad it's not freezing thinks Jenny. It's deeper than she expected as she wades out into the centre, putting her head under. Jenny actually laughs and enjoys this moment, fuck this day she thinks. A long time passes as she floats in the middle looking up into the sky. There is a still a bit of light left, she figures at this point she better head back before it's too dark to see. In that moment she looks over and catches a group of dingos, one of which has her towel filled clothes in it's month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Shrieks Jenny in horror of the sight of these dogs. </span></div></div>",

Jenny shakes her head, wanting to cry she can't believe her luck today. \"What did I do wrong\" she whispers. Suddenly, a text message tone starts playing loudly, she left her phone beside the towel, knowing it didn't need weight to prevent blowing away, none of the dingos had touched the contraption. The sounds alerts the dingos, they yelp and start bolting away into the bush. Jenny quickly rushes over to where they were standing, now dripping wet onto the sand. \"FUCK!\" she screams and then covers her mouth. \"The little shit took off with everything\" Cries Jenny with her hand still over her mouth. She picks up her phone and reads the text message, it's from RACQ, it reads that they can't make it until morning. A defeated, dripping wet and naked Jenny starts to walk back to her car, it's pretty dark now she takes her time reaching the road, so not to trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the safety of her car she open the door, she grabs the shammy from the glove box and uses it to dry herself, this takes a little while.

Jenny then finally takes a moment to sigh for relief as she closes the back door, opens the driver's door and heads inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the ignition her car starts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's it I'm getting out of this place!\" yells Jenny as she starts to turn the car around to drive back down the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny reaches the gate and it opens automatically, she drives through with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is driving down the road back to the nearest town where she is staying for the night she looks down, forgetting she's a little under dressed. Better than driving naked she wonders, although her gym clothes are still in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst driving Jenny sees a large lake off, she drifts off for a moment and wonders what it would be like to swim in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time passing the lake suddenly the car starts to slow down all acceleration ceasing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh what now!\" screams a frustrated Jenny as she thumps her steeling wheel. Her glides her car to the side of the road and tries to turn the ignition over and over to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jenny reaches into her skirt pocket and grabs her phone calling RACQ, after a robot call, she is advised the wait will be a few hours... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jenny moans at her predicament, annoyed she'll miss out on going to the gym in town tonight, she missed too many sessions recently. She looks to her left and can see a beautiful lake surrounded by bush land. The sun hasn't gone down yet, but isn't too far from going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices an old cottage not to far from the roadside.</span></div></div>",

Jenny first lays down on the couch, for a good fifteen minutes she relaxes, it's so comfy especially in her state of undress. However, she does remind herself she wanted to watch some TV not just relax, although she needed the rest for stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the remote took a few minutes she points and clicks. Everything goes black, at first she thought maybe she turned it off but nothing works.

Taking it she turns on the torch function. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny points it towards the fuse box. Walking over she can see it blinking a red light. Opening the fuse box took little effort. Right away Jenny spots the problem, one of the leavers was held on by a elastic band. The band had broken beyond use. \"Lovely\" says Jenny, slumping in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny needs to find a replacement but doesn't want to waste to much more time.

She notices her hand has a sticky plaster now, in the shape of a tree. Then she looks down still having trouble focusing. She notices she in a blanket which has slipped off her top half. Not believing her eyes at first she discovers she topless, her bra and shirt missing. Still a bit sluggish she pulls the blanket slowly up covering her exposed breasts. Looking around she sees she's still in the kids bedroom but on the floor. Someone must have dragged me but couldn't lift me on the bed she wonders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she hears giggles, shocked Jenny turns and looks behind her. Her exposed back top half on display to the twins. Jenny gasps. \"Hey, what have you kids done with my top and bra?\" She says in a slow confused tone. The twin boys turn around look at her and laugh \"that's not all\" they say. Jenny squints then lifts up and looks under the cover, she's completely naked! Jenny puts the blanket down hastily. These shits have seen me totally naked! She screams in her head. \"Okay funs over, give me my clothes back now!\" She raises her voice but realises the parents or someone else might hear her. \"That's not how the game works!\" They both say. Jenny glares and says \"what game? Just give me my clothes back\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both look at each other and reply \"The rules. We give you a hint to a room of one of ya clothes. In five we come and collect it if you can't find AND you forever lose that bit. You come back here for next hint. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gulps taking in what they mean. She doesn't have a lot of time, she'll only have time to search one room. Guess the wrong one and she forfeits that piece for a supposed forever. How do they expect me to do this naked?

Here goes nothing gulps Jenny. She takes each step one at a time, holding onto the handrail. Almost reaching the bottom the kitchen is in view, she pauses as she sees Tracy working in the kitchen, she's at the sink not facing towards Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny takes the last step and takes a lower stance moving towards the front door.

Hey Tracy I found the real estate lady!\" Jenny freaks at the shout, and wonders why he hasn't pointed out her nudity.

Tracy bobs down to their level and says \"you're right I'm sorry, there is plenty of time before dinner for her to finish.

She checks the washing basket, inside the shower and a box left on the ground. All of which turns up nothing. She then figures out that the boys couldn't have come here otherwise they would've found the note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shit! Not again thinks Jenny.

Says Tracy. The twins look at each other and shout \"well she gives up her remaining clothes!\" \"That's fair I think\" nods Tracy looking back at Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny is horrified, \"how is that fair! Can I at least get my phone and keys back?\" Jenny replied. One of the twins responds \"ummm after dinner.\" While the other nods. Jenny thinks for fuck sake, why won't the parents help me, this is stupid. Jenny holds herself tighter in the frustration, watching Tracy and Shawn look at her to accept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever\" accepts Jenny. The boys then bolt away up the stairs. \"Dinner will be served in about an hour, please make yourself comfortable darling.\" Says Tracy as she walks back into the kitchen and Shawn back to the TV.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake myself comfortable? Really? Thinks Jenny. Still shocked at what had just transpired she wonders if she should have kept playing as opposed to waiting an hour for dinner and her keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny decides to watch TV in the lounge. It's going to be incredibly awkward, but so is the dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heads into the lounge and sits down on a single leather chair. The leather is cold on her naked body. She crosses her legs and folds her arms over her chest. Trying to avoid eye contact with Shawn. He doesn't seem to care much. Jenny fidgets in her chair, not about to get over her humiliation anytime soon. They watch The Lady of the Bush for the next hour, ironically about a naked woman living in the Australian outback.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny hears the call for dinner and Shawn springs out of the couch into the Kitchen. She watches as the goth girl and twins head down taking their place. Jenny gets up slowly, covering herself she heads over to the table. She take her place next to the goth girl and one twin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crosses her legs under the table and watches the goth girl look over and laugh. \"You could help me you know\" whispers Jenny. The girl just replies, \"wish I could help you, but my parents and those kids are cray cray\". Jenny looks at her food, trying not to cry, I need to stay strong thinks Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up her fork, keeping one arm over her breasts and struggles to eat without her knife. \"You know it's rude not to use your knife\" says Tracy sternly. Jenny looks at her and realises arguing won't help. She drops her arm and picks up the knife. Exposing her breasts to the whole table. She goes red, trying to block out what she's doing. None of the table reacts to her nudity in display. She looks at the twins and can see they are not happy with Jenny for bailing on the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny finishes her meal last, probably due to the embarrassment. Looks up and sees Tracy serving desert. She at least can cover herself again and eat one handed with a spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith desert done, the twins race off. Gosh they better not forget to bring my stuff back. Everyone has left the table now the goth girl disappears up the steps, Shawn to the lounge while Tracy does the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sits and waits for the kids to return. After a while to do, holding her phone and keys. Jenny stands up rushes over, and one twin hands them over. \"What about my clothes?\" She asks. \"We burned them, you gave up and lost!\" They shout. Jenny's heart sinks, how did they burn them, oh wait the incinerator in the basement. \"Even my heels?\" She asks with a choke in her voice. \"Nah we played throwing them from the window and lost them\". Jenny cries inside. Jenny doesn't say a word, with her stuff in hand she heads to the front door. The household downstairs says bye in their own ways with Jenny replying much the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow outside she heads to her car, unlocking it. She jumps in the driver's seat and grabs her bag from the back. She opens it and pulls out her black tight gym shorts, which she quickly puts on. Then she grabs her pink gym top, which shows a lot of skin and her belly. Relieved to clothed again she grabs her shocks and gyms shoes, putting them on before turning the ignition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car fails to start, Jenny tries three times before giving up. Seriously! I just want out of this place! She screams internally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny steps out of her car, back to the front door and knocks. Shawn opens the door. \"You're back, found some clothes I see haha.\" Jenny think guess he forgot I said I have clothes in my car. \"My car won't start\" says Jenny sadly. \"Ah I can fix that for you, but it won't be until morning, too dark and I'm tired, please stay the night, we have a spare bed in the study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny doesn't really want to stay, but at least they being helpful now. Jenny agrees and thanks Shawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes back to her car and grabs her bag, slinging it over her shoulder. Then hands her keys to Shawn as she enters the house of horrors again, she takes off her sneakers leaving them at the door. Jenny says hello to Tracy who is already in the loop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny heads upstairs figuring she'll take a shower and head to the bed laid out for her early. It's been a long day and she's very tied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sees the twins as she enters the guest bathroom, they still look pissed at her. Whatever, she thinks they've put her through enough today. In the bathroom Jenny pulls out her towel laying it across the chair where she has placed her bag. She takes off her socks first, placing them on the seat. She then pulls off her shorts, revealing her trimmed bush once more, followed by her gym top, exposing her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny steps into the shower, turning on the taps. She grabs the shower gel, rubbing it all over her body and shampoos her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are your dirty clothes? We do washing at this time, we can do yours too?\" Jenny doesn't hear properly what is said. Jenny shouts back \"sorry I can't hear you.\" the voice repeats the same but Jenny can't hear it, once again replying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah never mind then, I can't keep looking\"<br>\r\nThe voice says that Jenny can't make out. Jenny doesn't reply this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny finishes her shower and steps out. She goes to the chair, dripping wet for her towel and finds nothing even the bag a missing! Oh you've got to be kidding! Again! Really! She yells internally. It was probably the kids again, I should've locked the door! Must have been the voices I heard too, unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny opens the bathroom door and storms out, naked and dripping wet, forgetting to cover herself. She storms into the twins room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked smug, knowing she would come. She's completely exposed to them once more. \"Seriously, enough! Return my clothes!\" She says loudly but not enough to attract attention. The twins laugh. \"We can't, you didn't finish last time, this time you will! Your clothes are hidden outside!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god, they work fast these two, and how can I be back here again, her jaws drops! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you will play all the way!\" The twins say. Jenny suddenly remembers she's not coving and corrects it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Follow us!\" The twins says they open the window and head out on the roof. Jenny freaks and follows through, her naked wet body now on the roof. The twins get to the edge and push down an emergency ladder. They rush down, Jenny follows reluctantly as she can't cover going down the ladder. She almost slips with her wet feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, game is one of us is lying\" they both say quietly. Jenny just nods, wanting this to be over quick. \"Get anything wrong and you'll never see it again like before, this time you can't get out of it.\" One twin says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes are in the shed\" one twin says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes are hanging in that tree\"<br>\r\nThe other twin says pointing at a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny quivers, fifty/fifty chance... At least they are better odds than before. </span></div></div>",

Feeling more confident having won the first round Jenny speeds up, but still a carefully, covering her crotch. She reaches the stairs once more, looking down, almost on her stomach the stairway and below seems clear. Holding her crotch she makes her way down the stairs, keeping her free hand on the railing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bottom step she has a clear view of the kitchen, it's empty what luck! She looks around, left to right but can't see Tracey anywhere. Jenny keeps low and passes through the kitchen, catching her half naked reflection in the glass. She shudders at the state she is in, how did I let it get to this she wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches the downstairs bathroom door past the kitchen and opens it slowly, luck is on her side as no one is on the other side. She hastily jumps in closing the door behind her. Jenny figures she doesn't have much time before Tracey returns to the kitchen, she rushes around opening cupboards and the washing basket finding nothing. She then opens the shower door and notices a black bra hanging from the shower head. \"That's my bra!\" she accidently says out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny pulls her bra down, wishing it was her panties on skirt, but at least it's something. Jenny takes her shirt off, revealing her breasts once again and then fastens her bra over them. She wastes no time putting her shirt back on buttoning it up. She then heads back to the door, coving her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, she expected to see Tracey, the kitchen is however, empty. Jenny heads out in a fast pace towards the stairs before it's too late. She heads up them, holding one hand to her crotch, the other on the hand rail pulling her up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs, Jenny heads towards the kids room, half way there she hears the master bedroom door open. She makes a dash to the kids room, opening the door and running in. Forgetting to cover her crotch the kids get a full view, before Jenny realises and covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! She won again!\" One twins say. Jenny can't help but smile that's she's pulling this off. Although not one part of herself is finding this enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Next place is dark and scary\" says both the twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dark and scary, this feels impossible, Jenny almost concedes. Okay their Sister is a goth, maybe her room is scary? The basement might be scary too? Lastly the attic, makes perfect sense, plenty of scary movies and kids shows involve a attic.

She can't see anyone in the hallway, therefore thinking it's safe slips out the door, closing it behind her. She's chosen the garage as her searching point. Jenny creeps through the hallway, trying to keep any noise level down. She reaches the stairs with no incident. She bobs down and tries to look down the stairs, the view isn't great. Here goes nothing gulps Jenny. She takes each step one at a time, holding onto the handrail. Almost reaching the bottom the kitchen is in view, she pauses as she sees Tracy working in the kitchen, she's at the sink not facing towards Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny takes the last step and takes a lower stance moving towards the garage, which is has its doorway towards the front and next to the basement entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny ducks down keeping a lower profile and quietly walks towards the door. Her heart feels like it will explode at any moment. She reaches the door, looks around and it seems clear. She opens it up slowly peaking inside. She can't see a thing. So not to alert anyone she steps in closing the door behind her. It's pitch black, Jenny fingers the doorframe and finds the light switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with light Jenny can see the Garage and family car. First she tries the car doors, all of which are locked. She then frantically runs around checking all the boxes lined up along the way all. She doesn't worry about covering and let's her arms fly around as she runs. However, she finds nothing. A cupboard stands alone, Jenny runs up to it opening the door. A cockroach runs out almost causing Jenny to yelp, but stops herself in time. The cupboard is just filled with tools, no clothes whatsoever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chose the wrong room, Jenny sighs and slumps. Knowing there isn't enough time to try somewhere else she picks herself up and heads back to the door. I need to get back to those kids I guess and try again. First Jenny turns off the light sending her back into darkness, then she slowing opens the door. She looks out sees it's clear to exit. She leaves the garage closing the door behind her. Jenny's feet are black from the garage, nothing she can do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny once again lowers her stance and sneaks back to the stairs. Spotting that Tracey is still facing away cutting food with a knife. She reaches the stairs and climbs each one slowly so not to make a noise. Reaching the top she increases her pace to get back to the kids room. Once there she opens the door with haste and leaps inside. Forgetting to cover the twins get a full view of her naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny suddenly remembers and covers up going a bit red in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guess wrong, no clothes for you!\" Shouts one of the twins.  \"Awesome...\" Says Jenny sarcastically. The next one better be easier she hopes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay next place has water\" they both say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's easy, has to be a bathroom? Reveals Jenny. The twins just smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay well I'm sure it's a bathroom but which one? Don't want to mess up this time, or half my clothes will be gone for good. </span></div></div>",

Opening the door, she peaks out still the coast is clear, she hears the twins giggle as she leaves closing the door behind her. She's chosen the guest bathroom, it's close by thankfully. Not feeling too confident having lost the first round she still heads around slowly. The bathroom door is open already when she reaches it. She looks in and sees no one. Rushing in and closing the door behind her, to feel a little more safe she begins her search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny opens the bathroom cabinet and finds a note which reads. \"Nice try with the powder you little shits, better luck next time!\" Jenny realises this is another prank which obviously failed on their sister. She checks the washing basket, inside the shower and a box left on the ground. All of which turns up nothing. She then figures out that the boys couldn't have come here otherwise they would've found the note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! Not again thinks Jenny. Knowing she now has to return again empty handed and completely naked. She heads back outside the bathroom leaving the door open, walking back feeling sick. She wants to just die, as she's now forfeited half her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the door, keeps her head down and covers her chest. Then once inside with the door closed she puts her hand over her bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You lost again!\" Both twins say.

She's chosen the downstairs bathroom, it's a fair distance away, hopefully Tracey won't be in the way as I'll need to pass through the kitchen she thinks. Feeling less confident having lost the first round Jenny keeps a slow pace, covering her crotch with one hand and her arm over her breasts. She reaches the stairs once more, looking down, almost on her stomach the stairway and below seems clear. Holding her herself she makes her way down the stairs, slowly as not to trip with no free hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the bottom step she has a clear view of the kitchen, it's empty what luck! She looks around, left to right but can't see Tracey anywhere. Jenny keeps low and passes through the kitchen, catching her naked reflection in the glass. She shudders at the state she is in, how did I let it get to this she wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She reaches the downstairs bathroom door past the kitchen and opens it slowly, luck is on her side as no one is on the other side. She hastily jumps in closing the door behind her. Jenny figures she doesn't have much time before Tracey returns to the kitchen, she rushes around opening cupboards and the washing basket finding nothing. She then opens the shower door and notices a black bra hanging from the shower head. \"That's my bra!\" she accidently says out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jenny pulls her bra down, glad to have a piece of clothing. Jenny fastens her bra with haste, a little annoyed a her state of undress, but still pleased she now has a free hand. She then heads back to the door, coving her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Opening the door, she expected to see Tracey, the kitchen is however, empty. Jenny heads out in a fast pace towards the stairs before it's too late. She heads up them, holding one hand to her crotch, the other on the hand rail pulling her up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the top of the stairs, Jenny heads towards the kids room, half way there she hears the master bedroom door open. She makes a dash to the kids room, opening the door and running in. Forgetting to cover her crotch the kids get a full view, before Jenny realises and covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow! She won this time!\" One twins say. Jenny can't help but smile that's she's had a win. Although not one part of herself is finding this enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Next place is dark and scary\" says both the twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dark and scary, this feels impossible, Jenny almost concedes. Okay their Sister is a goth, maybe her room is scary? The basement might be scary too? Then again the attic could look awfully scary to a child. I'm half naked, I've got my bra, I have no idea what piece of clothing is lost forever, she prays the next part at least covers her bottom half!</span></div></div>",

She sees Tracy is in the kitchen. Tracy looks like she's about to turn around and Jenny freezes and ducks. Lucky for her it was a false alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Picking herself up she sneaks toward the basement door and sees Trevor watching TV on the couch. He's facing away for now. Jenny on reaching the basement door uses her only free hand to open the door, slipping through, seen as how the light isn't on it seemed safe to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Inside she tumbles around until she finally finds the light. The laundry is silently empty. Then on the washing line she spots her pink panties! Jenny feels her luck might be changing, grabbing them off the line and pulling them on. Jenny is now fully clad in her underwear. She strides back to the exit, switching off the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She still remains quiet whilst sneaking out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Everyone is still in their positions, Jenny creeps up the stairs, with both her hands free to help her crawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back at the kids room she creeps through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh you figured it out again\" one of the twins say at her more covered state, somewhat disappointed.

Opening the door with haste a large canister falls directly on Jenny's head spilling it's contents all over her. \"What the fuck!\" screams Jenny as she looks down a sees she covered in red paint. Covered head to toe with paint dripping on the floor Jenny stands there in shock for a moment before snapping out of it. She's made a huge mess which needs cleaning up, plus she's now covered in paint. \"I'm so fired...\" sobs Jenny almost forgetting about her hand bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny has little choice on how to proceed she can't move much without making a further mess and she needs to clean up this mess the best she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny decides to remove her clothes making it less of a problem with dripping. First she slips off her heels, which did manage to get paint on them. She then takes off her red stained shirt, revealing her black bra, throwing it into the now empty bucket. She then unzips her skirt, revealing her pink panties placing it into the bucket also. She looks down, her bra managed to get paint on it leaking from her head down her shirt and her panties are now getting paint on them from the drip heading down. She unhooks her bra revealing her medium sized breasts, again throwing it in the bucket. Lastly she removes her panties doing the same as her other clothes. Her neatly trimmed blonde pussy on display. She bends over and throws her heels in too. Jenny looks at herself in disbelief she is now naked in a clients house, lucky they won't be home for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny spots paper towels in the cupboard, first she grabs them and starts whipping her naked body of excess paint. The red paint smears over her body, but at least the dripping has stopped. She throws these into an empty waste bin inside the cupboard. Next she grabs more paper towers in an attempt to clean the carpet, most of which comes off however, leaves a stain, she'll need water and cleaning products to do any better. Jenny considers it's a lot better than when she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still need to get a plaster for my hand thinks Jenny as she considers what to do next.</span></div></div>",

She opens the back places the house keys and car keys down on the seat. Leaning over she grabs her bag. She rummages though the clothes and finds bandages. It doesn't take Jenny long to bind up her hand however, she fails to notice the spider which has jumped on her back and is crawling up her shoulder. Jenny suddenly notices the monster while it's reached her chest! \"holy fuck!\" she screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment Jenny manages to shut the car door, which strangely triggers the lock probably from the force the car beeps. Jenny is to scared to notice. The spider flies down her shirt and Jenny remains motionless. She doesn't want to risk hitting the damn thing while it's under her shirt a good flick will get rid of it she thinks. She starts to slowly unbutton her shirt <br>\r\nrevealing her black bra and she slides it off slowly. The spider remains still just above her breast. Jenny moves her hand towards it ready to flick but it moves and she jerks. \"crap\" she whispers. The spider now runs down her legs and up her skirt. \"You little bastard\" Jenny mutters. She slowly now unzips her skirt sliding it down slowly revealing her pink panties. the spider now sits right below her belly button. Once again Jenny motions down to flick it but the spider catches on quickly and runs down her panties. \"Oh my god are you serious?\" exclaims Jenny. She now slowly pulls down her panties letting them drop to the ground. \"This is it you little bugger!\" Jenny shouts as she flicks the spider clean off into the distance. She now standing there naked but her heels and bra. \"I can't believe I'm standing here naked because of a stupid spider\" she grumbles to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down and notices that her clothes have fallen in mud. She didn't even consider this when dropping her clothes so carelessly. \"God dammit, having rotten luck today\" says Jenny out loud. She tries to open her car door but finds it locked. \"Really?\" she exclaims. She needs clean clothes yet has little options, she grabs her mobile from her skirt and ponders her next move.  </span></div></div>",
