            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   It was a nice June evening when Sam was driving down the highway in his rig.  He was carrying produce for a grocery store and had to make it to the store the next morning. He wasn't too far away so he stopped off to get some dinner. 2 Double cheeseburgers, a supersized Coke, and supersized fries.  The usual. Sam finished off the last of his second burger, gulped down the coke, and belched. The highway seemed awfully deserted, save a few other trucks and SUV's. He flipped on the radio and began to hum along to the song.  He never really wanted this job, but when you're fresh out of college and need some extra cash you might as well drive around the country. Plus it gave him some time to beef up a bit like he had always wanted. The song finished and Sam snapped back to reality. He saw a sign on the side of the road that read, \"All Trucks Stop at Scales: 4-6 pm.\"<br>\r\n   \"Ugh...Well it's 5 so I might as well.\"<br>\r\n   He pulled off the main road and into the scales, other trucks just drove by. Sam shrugged and slowed to a stop. He waited for a while, but when he saw there was no attendent and that there was a sign in the window of the office saying that the scales were being repaired he grumbled and began to drive back out onto the main road. As he did a bright flash of light filled the cab of the rig.<br>\r\n   \"What the hell is that?!\"<br>\r\n   He closed his eyes and ducked down as the light flashed brighter and brighter. In seconds it was over and Sam slowly rose back up. He peered out the windshield and was shocked. The rig was parked outside a large building that had \"Town Hall\" across a large piece of marble out front.<br>\r\n   \"Umm...yeah...\"<br>\r\n   He got out of the rig and walked around. Off past the building was a city full of huge skyscrapers with windows that gleamed in the bright sunlight. Sam wandered into the building his rig was parked infront of, still shocked. He walked up to the receptionists desk where a very chubby man of about 25 sat typing. The man looked up and smiled at Sam.<br>\r\n  \"Hi. Name?\"<br>\r\n  He had an awfully obvious \"gay lisp\" and Sam had to smile. He was gay, but didn't have one so he found other guy's voices humorous.<br>\r\n  \"Uh...Sam Trumen.\"<br>\r\n  \"Oh yes! Go right through this right corridor and make a left. The Mayor's office is right there.\"<br>\r\n  \"Thanks,\" said Sam as he slowly walked down the corridor, still staring at the recptionist. \"Man this is weird.\"<br>\r\n  He followed the chubby guy's instructions and found the office. Before him was a large wooden door with a gold nameplate. <br>\r\n  \"Mayor Tomas Conner\"<br>\r\n  Sam knocked on the door and heard someone inside say something, he couldn't make out what was said but he slowly opened the door to peer inside.<br>\r\n  He slowly entered and closed the door behind him. He turned around and, was again, in shock. Before him was a massive man of about 28 or 30. He had dirty blond hair, a very cute, boyish face, and quite possible the biggest body Sam had ever seen. The guy had to weigh over 500 pounds! Not only that he was clad only in a huge pair of briefs.<br>\r\n  \"Uhh...I'm Sam...\"<br>\r\n  \"Sam Trumen. Yeah. Nice to see ya buddy. Take a seat.\"<br>\r\n   Sam sat down in a plush, red velvet chair that dwarfed him. He looked like a little kid in it.<br>\r\n  \"Welcome to Testosterton Sam! We know about er...your preferences and we thought you'd be happy here. All the fat gay men you could ever want.\"<br>\r\n  \"Umm...\"<br>\r\n  \"Yes it is a little shocking,\" the Mayor chuckled, \"but it is a very nice place. Now we have all of your possessions in your new home all set up and ready for you.\"<br>\r\n  \"New home?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yes. You'll be living here.\" <br>\r\n  \"Whoa now. What do you mean? I barely know where I am.\"<br>\r\n  \"Hmm...Yes. This is very sudden...Uhh...Well how about I tell you about our fine city?\"<br>\r\n  \"Well, alright,\" said Tom easing into the massive chair.<br>\r\n  \"Alright! We, that is myself and some friends, decided that we all needed a place to ourselves. We also wanted to share that place with others like us so we set this little place up here. We brought in many fat, gay men and things were nice. However, soon many other guys started coming in on their own and we had to develop an all new city. We even have celebrities. Uhh...The Mixon Brothers, Big Pun, Fat Joe, Ralphie May, and Ethan Suplee to name a few.\"<br>\r\n  \"Wait. Big Pun? Isn't he dead?\"<br>\r\n  \"No just hiding out here.\"<br>\r\n  \"Oh...\"<br>\r\n  \"We also began allowing muscle men and skinny guys in because some of our larger men enjoy that body type as well. Seems superficial yes, but after being shunned out of regular society why not make paradise? It's definitly hard, but hard work never really killed anyone intentionally now did it?\"<br>\r\n  \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n  \"Now. We know you want to be big. Very big. But we need to take baby steps. Follow me,\" said the Mayor heaving himself up from the massive leather office chair he was in.<br>\r\n  Sam smiled as he watched the massive guy get up and followed the giant, jiggling backside of the mayor like he was told to.<br>\r\n  \"You have a choice on how you'd like to be fattened. A choice on how to get started.\"<br>\r\n  They stopped at a door that had a simple lable of \"Lab\" on it.  You can...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out of the five choices, Sam was most intrigued by the reverse liposuction. There was a white plastic table with thick metal rods holding it up. The table was covered in a kind of blue leather. On one side of the table was a massive clear glass tank, with white plastic on top and bottom, and out of the bottom came a long tube, about three inches wide, that looped up and around and hung on the side of the tank. It looked rather like a gas pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was led over to the table. A brilliant white light shone upon it, but, beautiful though it was, there was no way to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I...uh...\" Sam said, gesturing. The mayor pulled a switch. From beneath the table came a little set of steps, rather like an elongated stepladder, along the side of the table. He quickly stepped up these and lay down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" the mayor said, buckling Sam down, \"we are going to apply a rather special kind of anaesthetic.\" He put a pad over Sam's face. \"Breathe deeply...deeply...deeply...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor's voice faded, and the bright spotlight was replaced by a deep red light that shot dazzling little sparks. The light split into four little circles, and the circles spun around and around, faster and faster, shooting green and red and yellow and blue and pink and orange and heliotrope and bright white sparks that changed color as soon as they departed the wheels and kept changing colors until they left his field of vision. There was a loud screaming noise, louder and louder, until it filled his little dark world, and a kind of long screech that changed notes, and suddenly there was an explosion and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirds chirped. There was a cool breeze in the warm mediterranian air. The air smelled of warm cookies, fresh from the oven. Sam moved his arms towards his face, and bumped into his nose. That hurt. He felt around his eyes, and realised that there were bandages around them. He tugged on them, but they stayed firmly attached to his head. He felt around his head for a knot or something, and realised that there was now a roll of fat over the back of his neck. He moved his hands up and found another, smaller, roll of fat. He wondered where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought, \"Well, maybe I can feel around...bedsheets...rail...tv remote...ah, that's not a tv remote...maybe if I sit up...[the bed rose, pushing him into a sitting position]...now...bandages...whoops, what's this? It's all squishy, and warm, and...ohhh...wow...[squishy squish squish. Squish jiggle squish]...they really overdid it...now, maybe if I can get these stupid bandages off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled with the bandages, rocking back and forth as he tugged on the cloth, resulting in his apparently huge belly sloshing back and forth over his lap. When he finally undid the bandages and took them off, he was greeteed by an awesome sight- a huge trellis roof that had a hole in the centre. Sunlight poured through this gap. The trellis itself was covered with extraordinary green vines. Some of the vines were simply steel tubes painted green. He scanned down the walls- big square orange and grey tiles- to the floor, which was twenty-something feet below. There was a fountain in the direct centre of the huge room, a big concrete thing in the shape of a wedding cake. Clustered around the fountain were dozens of tables, surrounded by steel chairs. Sam had the faint feeling he'd missed something. He scanned the walls again and realised that at ten foot intervals there were thirty foot tall towers of tile jutting out of the wall. The last ten feet of tile looked strangely glossy, like a two-way mirror, except the mirror side looked like tile. Looking to the left, he saw, ten feet away, another tower. And to the right. He looked around- his bed took up quite a lot of the square room. There were bookshelves and a TV and a few posters. He looked down, and realised he was immensely fat, probably around 700 pounds. There was a wide, tall mirror in the corner- he got out of bed and looked himself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was extraordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd gained weight in all the right places and just how he liked it- a big round gut that wasn't too hard but wasn't too soft, and that hung about a foot. He had big soft breasts that folded around to his back, where there were three nice rolls of flab, the middle one fading under his arms. He played with his belly for a few minutes, noting his thick, muscly legs and soft, but strong arms. Suddenly there was an enormous roar, and his belly vibrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god! I'm hungry!\" he shouted, for he had forgotten that at his size he would have to eat a meal an hour, if not more. He strode [with his long, thick legs] over to the wardrobe and pulled the top drawer open- just as he suspected, it was filled with enormous shirts and pants. The shirts were all button-ups and t-shirts. He pulled on a pair of trousers first. They wouldn't fit round his belly, but rather nicely underneath, so a foot of flab hung over. He then put a t-shirt on- too small, it just only exposed his belly button, and the rest of the flab hung out- and a button-up shirt. One arm, two. And then he tried to button it up- it wouldn't. He pulled it up round his neck, and then buttoned it there. He noticed the shirt was extra long as he did up the twelve buttons. He then pulled the back down as far as possible, and pulled the front down, sucking in his huge belly. The shirt went down to his belly button, and so he pulled on the back. It went down to his pants, so he pulled the front down and miraculously it went down all the way. There was no hope of tucking it in, and the shirt was far too tight- he felt like a sausage. There was a kind of metal square in the corner. He stood on it, and it beeped. Two buttons appeared. One was lit, one wasn't. The lit one pointed down. There was also a digital readout. It flashed suddenly, and numbers flickered. It stopped on 712. Little letters appeared as well- lbs. 712lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven hundred twelve pounds!?\" Sam shouted. His belly smacked the down button and two plastic walls appeared out of the walls themselves, sealing Sam in the square, which started to descend. Sam yelped, not ready for this, and his chest expanded and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\npop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop! Each and every button on the shirt flung itself off, and his belly suddenly bounced free, banging against the wall. He mashed the up button, and the lift stopped its progress and shot upwards, coming to a stop, the walls receding into slots. He strode back over to the wardrobe as his belly roared yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I'm going to get you food.\" He slammed a drawer open and shoved another shirt on, and strode back over to the lift and mashed the down button. It went down. There were a few moments of silence, as the lift slowed. His belly roared again, louder this time, and the doors opened. He quickly walked out, stomach bouncing against his thighs, over to a desk that was in front of a fancy doorway. He slammed his hand down on the little bell- it was now inserted into the wood. Another door opened, seemingly out of the wall, and a huge fat man came out clad in a kind of black cape that attached around his neck. It was rather like draping a towel, long-wise, over your shoulders, and sticking the front corners through the front belt loops, and then connecting the bit on the shoulders with a kind of fancy cord, with a kind of long pad against the neck. His hands came out from under the sides, lifting the back. The black towel-like cape-shirt thing [Sam couldn't decide what to call it] framed his big belly perfectly. It was even larger than Sam's, and hung to the man's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the man said.<br>\r\n\"Do I need a reservation?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you have an apartment?\" [he gestured to the walls]<br>\r\n\"Yes. The third one to the right, although it's more like a room.\" [he pointed directly at it]<br>\r\n\"Ah, number twenty-two.\"<br>\r\n\"Does this cost much? I don't have a lot of money-\"<br>\r\n\"This is Testosterton. Nothing costs anything! Now, come with me.\"<br>\r\nSam followed the man over to a table, where a heavy-looking wheelie steel chair was pulled out. Sam sat in it.<br>\r\n\"Now, I reccomend the assortment, you get a little of everything...\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, that sounds good.\"<br>\r\n\"Decided already? I knew you w-\" [Sam's belly gave a huge roar] \"-ould. Okay, I'll go get your order...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked around the place, high overhead, and around, and almost fell out of his chair when there was a big man sitting across from him. The man extended a fat hand, and said, \"I'm Thomas, and I'll be your...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>roommate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was in awe of the huge mass of flesh before his eyes. At 712 pounds, Sam thought he was a big boy, but he was nothing compared to this behemoth. This mountain of man sat shirtless, his huge, distended belly dominating his figure, stretching farther in front of him than he could reach. This man was all gut! Judging by the numbers of empty plates stacked around him, Sam could tell he had been there for quite a while. But Sam couldn\u2019t help but wonder -- just how big was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026er. Hi. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Sam,\u201d shaking the eighth wonder of the world\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n\u201cDan here. Looks like we\u2019ll be living together, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026I suppose\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam trailed off wondering what structure could possibly contain these two heavyweights. Dan wasn\u2019t too bad looking of a guy, once you got past the initial shock of his size. He was pretty boyish looking, relatively hairless, perhaps 25 or so, with nice features (dirty blond hair and ice blue eyes, a big plus in Sam\u2019s book!) and pretty soft-spoken for a guy bigger than a woolly mammoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan put a chubby hand on his belly and rubbed it back and forth. Sam was mesmerized by the ripples of flesh that ebbed and flowed with each motion, a sea of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying back in his chair, smiling and content, Dan said, \u201cWell, I suppose you better eat up, little guy. You\u2019re going to need to get a hell of a lot bigger if you\u2019re going to have any chance in Friday\u2019s competition.\u201d<br>\r\nSam was perplexed. \u201cCompetition?\u201d<br>\r\nDan flashed Sam a thousand kilowatt smile, \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got acquainted with Testosterton\u2019s favorite sport \u2013 sumo wrestling.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSumo wrestling?! But\u2026.I\u2026..\u201d Sam trailed off. Sumo wrestling? Like most people, he had watched it and few times on late-night television, more or less for the spectacle of watching 500-pound elephants crash into each other. Never in his life would he have dreamed that he himself would be one of those guys.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we adopted it from the Japanese. Took a lot of the ceremonial aspect out of it, but that\u2019s cultural exchange for you!\u201d<br>\r\nThe images of mawashi-clad men grappling one another kept flashing before him. Could he pull it off? Him? In a mawashi? \u201cI\u2026.I\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\nDan looked into Sam\u2019s eyes and smiled, causing Sam to completely melt on the inside. \u201cThe mayor thought you had potential, so he put me in charge of training you to be a prize-winning yokozuna\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I don\u2019t know anything about the sport!\u201d<br>\r\nDan let forth a laugh. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been around here long, I see. You\u2019re looking at the biggest, baddest sumo wrestler ever to grace Testosterton\u2019s soil. I\u2019ve been the undisputed yokozuna for quite some time now. If anyone can show you the ropes, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\nSam stared at him. He could see how he was the biggest\u2026. He cheekily interjected, \u201cWow. I\u2019m in the presence of a walking god then, aren\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\nDan chuckled, \u201cYou could say that.\u201d He gave his weather-balloon sized belly a huge slap, sending an ocean current of flesh in motion. \u201cIsn\u2019t this thing huge enough to prove myself? Last time I checked, I was over 1050 pounds. That was before this light snack here,\u201d said Dan, gesturing to the destruction before him. He gave Sam a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least 1050 pounds. Sam\u2019s eyes widened at the immensity of the number, and of Dan\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to start sumo training,\u201d Sam said.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, what are you? 650? 700? You\u2019re already bigger than most guys who have been at it for years. Besides, where else can you get paid to consume the food and beer you could ever want, nap as a part of your training routine, and grapple with the biggest guys in the land?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that you put it that way\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the food came. It seemed like the \u201csnack\u201d that Dan had previously alluded to really was indeed a snack! To the groans of delight from his huge stomach came platter upon platter of food! Every sort of dish he could imagine was there. It was a parade of waiters, each bringing more plates than the previous. The final touch was one rolling out a keg of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Sam\u2019s delight and surprise, Dan chimed in with, \u201cGet used to it. After a hard round of training in the morning, you\u2019ll be able to polish this off in no time. I myself have gone through many rounds during one sitting. The beer? Feel free to drink as much as you can. You need a solid belly for when you get into the ring. Pretty soon, your gut will look like mine!\u201d With that, he gave his huge belly a few slaps to show off his size. \u201cCome on, eat up, I\u2019ll explain everything there is you need to know about Testosterton\u2019s version of sumo. Afterwards, we\u2019ll go out for some pizza\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can do it,\" said Dan taking the spoon from Sam and feeding the last bit of soup to him.<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...thanks...BURRRRRRRRRRRPPP!!...Dan,\" moaned Sam as he closed his eyes and sat back in his chair.<br>\r\nAll the buttons on his shirt had burst off with a lot of force during the course of the meal.  His pants' seams had given into the powerful thighs and giant ass that kept growing and growing.  All Dan could do was smile.<br>\r\n\"You did well Sammy,\" he said standing up and waddling over to Sam.<br>\r\nHe slapped Sam's back hard and the slap helped release another belch.  Sam continued to moan and rub his very bloated stomach.  If this was how things were going to be for him from now on, he liked it.  The feeling of outgrowing a whole outfit turned him on.  The feeling of having a belly so packed with food he felt like he would burst turned him on.  Another thing that turned him on was the constant cheering and support from his roommate Dan.  Now Sam was beginning to think that dating his sensei and the biggest sumo in town would be something he'd really like.<br>\r\n\"Dan...,\" groaned Sam.<br>\r\n\"Yeah buddy?\"<br>\r\n\"I...\"</span></div></div>",

Thomas, evidently gay, lighted tapped Sam on the belly, and watched his flesh ripple through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like that?\"  Thomas asked.  \"I mean if we feed each other and gained together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's jaw dropped.  The chunky handsome young buck standing in front of him was gorgeous.  He was big, but not yet quite as big as Sam.  He was about 300 some pounds, with a pearly white smile and a little gotie.  His chubby cheeks had to little dimples on either side, and his deep brown eyes were dreamy enough to get lost in.  Sam nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas smiled.  \"Call me Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled.  \"Alright . . . Tom.  Seems to me you're not new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shook his head.  \"Nope.  I've been here awhile.  When I first got here I was actually very skinny.  I thought of myself as just a Fat Admirer, never brave enough to be a gainer, and I've really gained alot of weight over the last 6 months.  About 130 poinds so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled.  \"But seems to me you're the one who needs the gaining more than anything right now.  Not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded.  He began staring at Sam's belly as they walked to their room, watching it go up down.  Obviously envious of his glorious body, Tom seemed eager to be with Sam.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always held respect for men like you who can gain so well!  How'd you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugged.  \"Let's just say I 'let myself go.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom opened up the door to the dorm.  Sam was amazed!  The room was enourmous, ten times the size of any college dorm.  The first thing that struck him as amazing, was that everything was so large.  The doorway was large enough for any fat man, even himself, to enter through quite comfortably.  The couch was a massive bed-like structure, able to hold 3 or 4 men his size.  And the T.V. was a large plasma screen T.V. and the kitchen seemed to be a whole new house itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom smiled as Sam stood there in awe.  \"Come on in to the bedroom, I'll show you were we will be sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\"  Sam gasped.  This was a dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're not comfortable with that, we can always seperate the two beds, simply flicking this switch.\"  Tom entered the bedroom, turned on the light, and Sam was dumbstruck.  There laid the biggest bed he had ever seen in his entire life!!  Literally streching  about 20 feet across, and 10 feet tall, he saw the two halves slowly coming apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll sleep this way untill you think we're ready.\"  Tom winked.  \"I don't want to rush anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam waddled back over to the enourmous couch, and sat down.  He began gasping for breath.  It was difficult for him to walk with his enourmous size, what with his but cheeks and thighs always constantly rubbing together, walking was presenting itself to be a challenge!  But no matter, he loved his new body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom smiled at his, and patted his gut.  \"I bet that thing slows you down a bit, hun?  Well I'm jealous of it, I must say, I really am.  But enough about me. What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam thought about it.</span></div></div>",

Now tell me you didn't just ask that question!\"  Tom chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled.  \"Well then.  How would YOU like to gain a bit more weight.\"  Sam playfully grabbed Tom's paunch and patted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed.  \"Yes!! Of course you know I would love that!\"  He laid out on the couch.  \"Feed me Sammy boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled with excitement.  He waddled over to the kicthen and grabbed as much food as he could carry.  He sat down next to Tom, and bent over him, his large fleshy arms hanging in Tom's Face.  He gently carressed Tom and pushed the food into his Mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's soft breasts were rubbing up against Tom's body, as he leaned against him to feed him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing you're not clastrophobic or anything Tom.\"  Sam smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom moaned as Sam pushed the last piece of food into his mouth.  Tom's belly was ditended way above his chest, and all Tom could do was moan.  Sam smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved Tom already.  As the fatter of the two, generally Tom would be the one who was going to have to help Tom.  But Sam wanted to be able to have power over Tom.  He wanted to be Tom's Knight in Shinning Armour so to speak.  After Tom had gorged himself was the only time Tom would actually be dependent on Sam.  And Sam loved the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked at Sam, with his deep dreamy brown eyes.  \"I can't get up.  I must say you are an excellent feeder though, you kept it pleasent throughout the whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded.  \"Need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded.  \"Can't get up.  Here, help me.\"  Tom streched out a hand, and Sam helped him sit up, his bloated beach-ball belly stuck out and Sam carressed his tummy with his chubby hands.  Tom moaned again.</span></div></div>",

Sam struggled into bed (as it was difficult for him to get his large stomach onto the matress), and feel right asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning.  Sam awoke to the smell of bacon and eggs in the kicthen.  He waddled in and noticed a huge plate of pancakes at his place, along with enourmous sides of bacon and eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam dug in.  He decided to strike up a coversation with Tom-after all, he was a handsome nice gay man-and his roomate.  He wanted their relationship to grow . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make all this for me Tom?\"  Sam asked thoughtfully between chews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  Actually well I ate about two times your serving about 2 hours ago, and I decided to make some for you as well.\"  Tom said with great satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 times this serving?  How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno Sam . . . when I woke up this morning I was just so hungry-which almost doesn't make since after my huge meal, my I was.  So I pushed myself to eat alot-I mean I want to be as big as you someday, right?\"  He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded.  \"Tom-how big do you want to get?  400?500?  600?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shurgged.  \"As big as I can go without losing my immobility I suppose.\"  He laughed.  \"As big as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam scoffed.  \"Well I'm on the fringes of immobility right now actually I think.

He contiuned eating untill he had finished every last bite.  \"Mmmmmmmm . . \" Sam moaned.  The food was so good, and yet he was so uncomfortably full!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam decided to stay seated untill he had digested his food a bit more.  Tom mentioned that he was going to make a run to the grocery store, and that he'd be back.  Tom hugged him goodbye, patted his ever-growing rump, and was out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched his chunky ass walk out the door, and stood up.  He decided to check the pantry for anything interesting, when he came across a very odd little box, full of powder.  He read the label:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extreme Weight Gain Powder.  Made in Testosterton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe contiuned reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Directions: Add a pinch to a cup of water and drink.  one pinch= about 30 pounds.  A little goes a long way.   Do not overdose.  Works instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked unopened.

Most importantly- it looked fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  I'll do it,\" Sam said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomas smiled back, \"Good, good.  The address is there for you.  The building isn't too far away so you shouldn't have any problems getting there.  Ask for Mitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded, thanked the mayor and walked out of the office.  He went down to the lobby, waving to the rather preppy, yet enormous receptionist who gave him a wink as he exited the building.  It was wonderfully sunny out and the streets were nice and clean.  Cars and trucks went by, people were walking- waddling- down the street.  This place really wasn't so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Sam made it to the wrestling headquarters.  It was in a tall skyscraper that housed various other companies.  The directory had the logos for restaurant chain headquarters, clothing store executive offices, and a myriad of other businesses.  Sam found the floor the wrestling federation was on and went to the elevator lobby.  He pushed an up button and watched the various numbers light up above the doors to see which elevator would come down first when someone else walked up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to give a friendly smile when he saw how big the man was.  The guy was enormous!  He had to be at least 6'6\" and was as wide as a barn.  His gut was wide and hung down over his thighs, barely contained by the biggest tank top Sam had ever seen.  The guys legs were big enough to crush cars and his backside was comprised of two, colliding planets trapped in a pair of jersey shorts.  Sam's eyes traveled up to the man's face.  His cheeks were puffy and pushed his thick lips together, chin bloated and soft.  His eyes, though, were a light blue that were almost calming.  His hair was golden and like a lion's mane- flowing and long, but not too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the elevator opened and the guy looked down at Sam, holding a huge hand out in front of him, \"I believe you were here first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh... yeah, right,\" Sam said as he went into the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth followed Sam into the elevator that looked like it could hold a couple of elephants.

What was the mayor thinking now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got the height, and you do have a good build. But you're gonna have to put on a lot of weight though. Our guys here are simply massive, especially the linemen - big guts, thighs like oak trees, butts the size of buses... You'll need a lot more weight and muscle. Of course, here in Testosterton we can help you achieve the right gains - get you that power butt, the super-sprint thighs, the massive arms and the big anchoring belly. I'd say, as a minimum, you should count on doubling your weight - more if you want to be a lineman. But football is a lot of fun - grappling all those other big guys, the team spirit, the team meals. Up to you of course,\" Mayor Tomas said, opening a drawer in his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at the mayor as things were described to him. That certainly was sounding appealing... He'd get to be big and powerful. Possibly famous if he played his cards right.

For Sam's part, two years in a truck cab had done a number on his cardio, not to mention all the weight he'd packed on, and he swore to himself to hit a gym or join a team or something if he got a job here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly minutes later, they walked into an office block and took an escalator up a flight.

So nearly all of us want to stay mobile while we get big, and sports or going to the gym with friends makes that easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the meatheads in the gym?

He looked up at the mayor just as he let a huge, deep fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...s-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Sammy! It's just the food reacting with you!\"</span></div></div>",

To Sam\u2019s surprise, the Mayo is actually cuddling him. \u201cU-Uhhh\u2026 Mr. Mayor?\u201d He asks to the dazed politician busily nuzzling his head between his massive moobs.  He seemed like he was in some kind of trance. The Mayor suddenly came to his senses and backed away, chuckling awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, just can\u2019t help myself around a man.... of your\u2026 size\u2026\u201d He stared at him longingly, and got distracted again as he trailed off, a dumb grin and trail of drool starting to trickle down his face. Sam was concerned. He snapped his fingers a few time in front of his face, which roused him once more from his lust-induced trance. \u201cSorry\u2026 What were we talking about? Oh-yes! The parade!\u201d He nods again, \u201cHenry, please make arrangements for the event, alright?\u201d The fat man nods at his boss before leaving. \u201cAnd you, Sam, will be the star of course. Feel free to give us any input.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was feeling a mix of awkward, and nervous. The Mayor was acting weirdly towards him, and now wanted him to be in a parade. He hadn\u2019t done anything like this before! And he wasn\u2019t sure if he liked the idea of being so fat, in front of all those guys\u2026 And almost naked. \u201cU-Umm\u2026 Well, maybe I could get some new clothes? I\u2019m honestly not really sure about this thing though\u2026\u201d The Mayor suddenly showed him a look of concern. \u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m pretty fat now. I like it, but I\u2019m not sure if I really want people\u2026 a lot of people, looking at me like this\u2026\u201d He gestured towards himself. He was huge! He was a big, fat, roly-poly blob of a man. He couldn\u2019t even walk a few steps without feeling winded. He liked the idea of being fat\u2026 But for some reason now felt a little nervous. After he saw the disappointed expression in the Mayor\u2019s face however, Sam was quick to come up with an excuse, \u201cUhh\u2026 M-Maybe it\u2019s just stage fright, I\u2019ve always been a little nervous in front of crowds\u2026\u201d The Mayor\u2019s expression turned to a soft, relieved grin, \u201cOh, is that all?\u201d He laughed, shaking his huge, bouncy belly as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy boy, there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed or worried about, you\u2019ll do fine! I remember when I was your age; I was actually a bit nervous about becoming a blob. I used to lift weights you know? Won quite a few competitions too. Can you imagine? Me being one of those roided, muscular jock bodybuilders? Those days are long over though. I was young and impetuous back then, but here I am now, a big, blubbery, beast of a man! And I\u2019ve never been happier!\u201d He chuckled, apparently amused at the notion. Sam had trouble imagining the fat man in front of him was ever a professional bodybuilder, but shrugged. For some reason, the Mayor\u2019s general attitude had a calming effect on him. He didn\u2019t know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is, you\u2019ll be happier the fatter you are! I used to be pretty gloomy myself, but learned to love my body, and my newfound habits.\u201d He grinned as he shifted his weight, and a long, loud, low fart rippled from his ass. Sam\u2019s eyes widened, and he gagged on the stench as it assaulted him. \u201cJesus!\u201d He yelped, plugging his nose. The Mayor gave a hearty laugh, \u201cBetter out than in, I always say! You\u2019re probably pretty stuffed yourself from all that eating. Go ahead boy! Show me what you got. I think You\u2019ll feel better if you do.\u201d Sam was grossed out by this, but oddly attracted too. And for some reason the Mayor\u2019s encouragement made him feel better. He didn\u2019t even realize what he was doing until he took in a breath, and relaxed a bit, and a huge, thunderous fart bubbled out of his own ass, going on for several seconds, until the gas flow ended with a few splutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam started breathing again after it was done. He hadn\u2019t realized that he had been holding his breath. The Mayor smiled, \u201cNot bad, for a beginner. Sounded like you\u2019d been holding it in for a while too. Bet ya feel better now, huh?\u201d Sam realized he actually did feel better. He hadn\u2019t realized just how badly he had to fart, and the pressure release definitely helped his stomach to feel less crowded. As gross as it was, the stink that overcame him after his own bad fart actually calmed him a little. It was at least familiar to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right dad, I kinda do feel better\u2026In fact\u2026\u201d He then proceeded to rip another giant fart, shorter than the last, but much more pungent, and sighed, \u201cDamn that felt good.\u201d He smiled as he inhaled the odor. He was shortly broken out of his daze by the Mayor\u2019s laughter, \u201c\u2019Dad\u2019?\u201d Sam blushed, realizing he had accidentally called him that, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s what you like boy, I\u2019ll be your papa.\u201d Sam didn\u2019t know how to respond. What was getting into him? At least the Mayor took it well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both regained their composure, and the Mayor went on, \u201cNow then boy, if you\u2019re still feeling a little nervous after \u2018letting loose\u2019 like that, I could get you in with a guy in town. He\u2019s technically a therapist, but he acts like a motivational speaker. If you got any anxieties, he\u2019ll help you fer sure! He\u2019s who I went to when I stopped my old career. Otherwise, Let\u2019s get started with parade preparations!\u201d Sam realized there was no way he could get out of the parade now, and would have to be gawked at by other fat, gay men for his size. The thought appealed to him somehow... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mayor continued, \u201cYa said you wanted new clothes, huh? Well, I think you look great the way you are now.\u201d He gestured to Sam\u2019s fat body, tattered clothes barely hanging onto the large frame, \u201cBut there\u2019s a local tailor who can help ya get what you\u2019re looking for. He's great. I\u2019ll even send Henry with ya to get ideas for the parade.\u201d Sam nodded. \u201cSo boy, which do you want?\u201d Sam considered his options, either he could go see the motivational speaker guy first, or go ahead and go to the tailor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think Testosterton should see their newest resident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiles happily and is seated on a sturdy couch as the TV crew is called.  This place was amazing!  He had eaten his way to a half ton in no time at all.  It was something he could only have dreamed about, but here it was happening before his eyes.  Plus it was getting him on TV.  Maybe he could become some kind of local celebrity or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes a TV crew made up of portly men was standing in the room.  The lights on the camera went on and a young, pudgy reporter in a bluish-gray suit stepped toward him with a microphone with Channel 6 on the sides of it.  He smiled to Sam and talked quietly to him as the few other people were setting up the lights and other things that made TV magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing, Sam.  You've certainly got the spirit of this place.  I think you'll be the poster boy in no time,\" the reporter chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... thanks!\" said Sam, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe producer of the segment started to count down and the reporter looked into the camera with a big smile.  Once the countdown got to one, the reporter held up his mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doug Harrison here for Channel 6 Evening News.  Everyday Testosterton is stumbled upon by many fat enthusiasts, but none have been so successful as Sam Truman.  He's only been here a short while, but he's already up to a solid 1000 pounds.  Tell us, Sam, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled to Doug and leaned into the mic like most people, \"Fine.  Really good to tell the truth.  I love feeling this big and I love being in a place that lets me get as big as I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good.  So Sam, 1000 pounds.  Any plans on getting bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I hadn't really thought about it... 1000 pounds is already huge,\" said Sam, thinking.  \"But... I suppose I could go for a ton.  Maybe take it a bit slower now.  It could happen right?\" asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course.  We'll be sure to follow Sam's journey to reach a ton.  Stay tuned to Channel 6 for more information.  Doug Harrison, Channel 6 Evening News.  Back to you in the studio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights went off and Doug put a pudgy hand on Sam's shoulder.  \"So you think we could check in on you every so often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stammered as he tried to comprehend what he had just done.  Had he really said a whole ton?  Were they really going to follow him?  He gulped and looked to Doug who was handing him a business card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... well... I'll let you know,\" Sam said, taking the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good.  Catch you later big guy,\" said Doug as the crew headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He liked that idea, to see what the inventors had in mind when they created the machine, he would be the first to feel the fattening power of the gainer shakes.<br>\r\nSam sat down and was asked 'What flavour shake would you like?'<br>\r\nHe chose chocolate as he had a sweet tooth.<br>\r\n'Get comfortable, look up and open wide.'<br>\r\nSam started to feel excited as his long time dreams were about to be made flesh. He looked up and saw the tube coming nearer and nearer to his open mouth. The tube entered his mouth and worked its way down his throat. It felt soft and warm so Sam didn't feel sick.

You'll gain pretty quickly so when you want to stop just press that button next to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed simple enough, so Sam relaxed and began to enjoy the feeling of the shake rushing into his growing belly.  Soon he felt his pants and shirt get tight, within moments the button popped off his jeans and his shirt rode up his gut.  He wondered how this was happening so fast, but as for his huge gain, he didn't mind at all.  His clothes completely bit the dust after he reached 400 pounds.  His belly was really big and rolled onto his lap, his arms and legs were definately fatter.  To top it off he was developing big man-boobs.  Sam looked at himself wanted to be a little bigger.  Time passed and Sam in a literal sense ballooned with fat.  His weight shot to 500, then 600, then 700!  His body was becoming very fat, so Sam figured that he would stop at 750.  He reached over to the button and pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?</span></div></div>",

His weight climed to 730, 750, 780. He groaned in both fear and excitement as he continued to grow fatter.<br>\r\n\"You okay in,\" the Mayor stopped short when he saw Sam wriggling about under his own weight. The Mayor rushed over to Sam and hit the button to stop the flow, but the tube kept draining into Sam.<br>\r\n800, 830, 850, 890. The shake continued to pour into Sam, but it slowed down until it finally ran dry. Sam spit the tube out of his mouth and groaned.<br>\r\n\"How...much....UURRPPPPP!...do I URRP weigh,\" asked Sam in between massive belches.<br>\r\nThe Mayor looked at the screen on the tank of shake and it read 960 pounds.<br>\r\n\"960 Sammy. Looks like you did some serious gaining there. Sorry about the mix up with the buttons.\"<br>\r\n\"Oof...It's okay...URRRP,\" said Sam trying to sit up.<br>\r\nThe Mayor waved his fat hand and three very muscular guys in white came in to help Sam to his feet. Sam's gut was now past his knees and his hips spread out about 5 feet on each side. His breasts would never fit into any bra and his ass was probably too big for a couch.<br>\r\n\"Come with my Sammy. We have your clothes all ready in the next room,\" Said the Mayor waddling to the next room.<br>\r\nIt took Sam a moment, but he managed to move his hugly fat foot forward, then the other, and he was soon waddling like he had done it all his life.<br>\r\n\"No drawbacks here unless you want 'em. You want to be immoble, you can be immobile. Otherwise, you can stay ablebody enough to do anything here,\" explained the Mayor as he waddled ahead of the behemoth of a man.<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" said Sam with another gigantic belch.<br>\r\n\"Okay here we are,\" said the Mayor handing Sam...</span></div></div>",

You have clothes this big?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do!\"  Said the Mayor in a powerful tone.  \"Why would we not have giant clothes in a city where everyone is fat?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.  Umm... do you think that I could get some help putting these on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I've got to get back to my office, but these men here will help you get dressed.  You're free to do whatever you want, see you later Sam!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Mayor turned and waddled out of the room.  Sam decided to get dressed after he left, so he grabbed his giant pair of breifs and bent over to put them on.  As he bent over, his giant gut that hung below his knees swung forward, offsetting his whole body making him fall forward.  One of the muscular guys caught him by his flabby sides and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it there big boy.  We definately don't want you getting hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helped Sam keep his balance while he slid his breifs up and over his overhanging belly, making it roll and jiggle with each touch.  The men continued to assist Sam until he was completely clothed in his new attire.  As he walked away from the Gainer Shake Room, he couldn't help but feel normal, like he was meant to be here his entire life.  When Sam reached the main lobby, the secretary behind the counter said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sam, how are you adjusting to your new weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting along just fine, thanks.\"  Sam replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mayor suggested that you go explore the city for the rest of the day.  Now that your fattening process is over with, this is your home town to live and have fun in.\"  Said the secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will!\"  Replied a happy Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam ever so slowly waddled to the door and walked outside into the city.  It was a huge city, and he doubted that he could explore the whole thing in a day, so he decided to stick to this block for now.  Sam slowly walked down the street, his newly aquired gut smacking and jiggling against his thighs with each step.  He rounded the corner, and two distinct places caught his eye, an incredibly large restaurant that made his mouth water thinking about it, and an apparent male strip club called 'The Hidden Jewels'.  Seeing both of these places got Sam excited in both of his places, his gut and his crotch.  Sam had to pick one, would it be food or fat guys?    </span></div></div>",

There was the usual . . water, beer, soda, etc. However one thing caught your eye-\"Weight Gain Shake.\" you wondered .. . was this gainer shake the same you drank to become as big as you are? Thoughts of being bigger tinkled into your mind as you thought about it, and you felt aroused by the thought of being bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like the weight gain shake, to shake things up a bit\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Good one! Now we are having a special today, bottomless gainer shake, the cup has a tube attached, it'll refill until you're done!\" The big waiter stated. You shifted in your seat a bit--not to his seats liking, it groaned and creaked under you. You gazed around, you were on the larger end of people around the restaurant, though there were some that were still significantly larger than you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gaining shake arrived, the waiter picked up the centerpiece on the table to reveal a see-through tube, and connected it to a notch on the side of the glass, he pressed one of a few buttons on the cup and a brown liquid-much like your original gaining shake-poured into the glass, when the glass was filled the waiter waddled away. You wondered, does your butt wiggle side to side as much as his does? Do your clothes emphasize your belly as much as his do? Those thoughts buzzed around your head as you look toward the gaining shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached towards the cup, picked it up, and held it to your lips. A suction noise was heard and it locked onto your lips, for a moment you panicked and coughed, though you adjusted. You were looking at the buttons, a red, a green, and a yellow. You assume the green is the on button and press it, the cup filled until gaining shake pressed against your closed mouth. You opened your mouth and took a sip. You felt your already enormous clothes feel a bit tighter, and you take the plunge. You press the green button and let the gaining shake force itself down into your waiting belly. Its already huge form expanded further, stretching your shirt, and straining your pants. Pounds upon pounds piled themselves onto you, and one of your movement assistance was staring at you--obviously he thought you were done growing. But boy, was he wrong. You belly forced the shirt up on your belly, it slid farther and farther until it revealed your enormous hanging gut. Your mammoth pot strained your pants--you had put your pants over your gut. The shirt was enclosed tightly around your chest, and the shirt felt ready to burst. Your man boobs pressed up against the buttons of the shirt and you heard seams popping all along your shoulders. You looked around you--people are staring--you don't care. You've lost track of what your weight might be, 1200, 1300, 1400? You don't know. Your pants burst all along the seams, and your assistance absentmindedly peels them off. Your shirt reaches its absolute limit, and tears completely--nudity was an entirely un-embarrassing concept though...your belly blocks from anyone see anything too private, and even the biggest clothes wouldn't cover your massive, shelf shaped bubble butt. Something tickles on the bottom of your belly--on the very edge of your overhang. It feels like carpet...is it...floor? Maybe, the chair creaked and squeaked, and collapsed under your enormous growing form. Thoughts of what the yellow and red buttons do tickle your brain, and your belly--it lets out a thunderous roar--this gaining shake hasn't been all that filling. . .</span></div></div>",

The gaining shake slowly dribbled to a stop, you were done growing, for now. Your belly let out another earth-shattering roar and small bits and pieces that looked to be food flowed to your mouth, they were small enough to swallow whole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you've found the expanding food on your pump!\" The waiter explained, \"The food expands in your tummy--easiest way to stuff yourself silly!\" he cheerfully said, smacking your enormous belly. You felt something inside you...not pain...not hunger...what was it? Then you realize--its the food expanding inside you! A torrent of flavors envelope your tongue: pork, chicken, gravy, ice cream, milk, soda, french fries, burgers, the list goes on and on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you--the food acts like gainer shake, you'll gain much more with the food, it's filling, though you only gain when you're asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a poke on the side of your belly, you gaze over and see your assistant, he mouths, \"do you really wanna do this?\" you nod and just let the food flood into your belly. Though you're starting to feel a bit full...nah! It can't be that fast! But you feel so...odd...like somethings pressing on the insides of you. A few moments later you figure out what you're feeling--you're not full--you're <i>stuffed.</i> All that food inside you is now expanding, and you hadn't realized how big the food really got. You slammed your fat hand down on the red button, and for a few more seconds food streams down your gullet into your belly, just two more gulps, <i>it feels like two thousand</i> you think. The last bits of food go into your belly and you take off the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof, I--uuUUUUURRRRPPPP--really---uuurrrp---ate a lot---UUURP--I--uh--UUURRRRRPPP--think I overdid it...\" you say, struggling to breathe with how truly stuffed you are. Your belly, while obtaining a squishy demeanor, is visibly full, and to the touch after a bit of fat it is <i>rock solid</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOof, all that food is making you sleepy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam stared at the menu for a few seconds until his eyes landed on the milkshake selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start with a chocolate milkshake for now, please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter scribbled down the drink order and hurried off as fast as his body would carry him towards the kitchen. Sam, now alone again, continued to read through the menu. There were so many options to choose from! He noticed on the back page of the menu that there were set meals to order depending on weight range of the customer. These set meals had weight ranges as low as 300-500 pounds, all the way to a 2000+ pound person meal (which basically just seemed like an endless stream of food). Although he was just 960 pounds, Sam decided that he would try out the meal intended for the 1000-1300 pound weight range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter came back with probably the biggest drinking glass that Sam had ever seen - it was easily two and a half feet tall and one foot in diameter, filled to the brim of what seemed to be a very rich chocolate milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although you might not need it, our milkshakes have a bit of appetite stimulant in them, so feel free to order more than you think you'd need\", the waiter said as he set the large glass in front of Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking of ordering the set meal for the 1000-1300 pound weight range\", Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice sir!\", the waiter said as he scribbled down the order and went back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's stomach let out a long, low grumble as he looked at the milkshake. He brought the glass close to his lips and began drinking the thick, creamy, chocolatey goodness that was sitting in front of him. It might of been his new belly thinking, but he didn't even realize that he gulped down half the drink, not even stopping for air. He set down the glass and let out an impossibly large <i>UUUUUUURP</i> to complement the milkshake. As he began his second half of the milkshake, Sam's waiter came back from the kitchen with two XL pizzas and set them on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Sam dug into the pizza. He began at one slice at a time like his old habits, but quickly grew impatient as his hunger grew. In just a few minutes, he was already starting his second pizza and stacking three slices at a time and cramming it into his mouth. Everything so far tasted so good and couldn't stop himself from eating. Sam thought that there was no way he was this hungry when he entered the restaurant, but then he remembered what his waiter said about the appetite stimulant in the milkshake. And just when he was thinking about what his waiter said, the waiter came from the kitchen to drop off four buckets of saucy (and large) chicken wings with each bucket holding 50 wings. Sam dug his hand into one of the buckets, covering parts of his arm with sauce, and began to eat the wings as fast as he could. He was going at amazing speed that he couldn't even believe despite his large frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he plowed through the chicken wings, he was getting quite messy with so much sauce all over his fingers, shirt, and mouth, but Sam didn't seem to care. He simply just accepted his messiness as something normal to him. By the time he got to the last bucket, his speed had slowed down by quite a bit as he could start feeling the food in his stomach. As he was finishing off this bucket, the waiter dropped off a very large bowl of pasta with meatballs the size of his fist. Since his hands were already covered in sauce, he didn't even bother picking up the fork that the waiter had set next to him. Sam just grabbed a large handful of pasta in each hand and shoved it into his face. He knew he wasn't close to his limit, so he looked forward to what else the waiter was going to bring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sam was still working on his pasta bowl, the waiter brought out two large platters with neatly stacked burgers on them. Sam noticed that the waiter wrinkled his nose as he walked away from the table, only to realize shortly that he had been passing gas without even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam ate and ate through the feast that was laid before him, the waiter finally brought out the last dish which was a layered chocolate cake. As he started grabbing pieces of the cake, he tried hard to remember what he had eaten but it all seemed a blur... He knew there was pizza, wings, burgers at some point... Tacos? Hot dogs? What else? Oh well, it didn't really matter anyways. Sam was mostly just so astounded that he had eaten so much food that he forgot what else he ate. When he was completely finished with the food, the waiter returned to help him out of his seat and send him on his way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's belly felt incredibly stuffed and tight and could barely move, but he knew he wanted to get home to rest. Sam waddled very slowly out of the doors of the restaurant and noticed that it was pretty late into the night. He had completely lost track of time while he was eating in the restaurant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was very happy that he didn't go very far from his home when he was choosing his restaurant, because he really didn't want to move around while feeling the pressure and tightness in his stomach. When he finally made it to his new home, he evaluated himself in the extra-wide mirror that was in his entryway. The shirt he was given earlier that day had already gotten too small, since it was now riding up towards the top of his belly. Aside from all that, he was a mess from his feast - his mouth, hands, and shirt were all stained in sauce from his dinner. His stomach looked so incredibly large and round due to the insane amount of food he had just consumed. He had definitely gained weight, but was too tired to find out how much he weighed, so started heading towards his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally made it to his bed, he slowly took off his clothing and lay in his large bed, drifting into sleep while wondering what he'd do and what he'd eat the next day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam rounded the corner, and two distinct places caught his eye, an incredibly large restaurant that made his mouth water thinking about it, and an apparent male strip club called 'The Hidden Jewels'. Seeing both of these places got Sam excited in both of his places, his gut and his crotch.  The twinge from his crotch, buried deep within his fat rolls was too much for him, and he decided to head for the strip joint.  Sam waddled his way across the street and stopped in front of 'The Hidden Jewels'.  There was no apparent need for bouncers, since there were no burly men standing outside.  Sam wrapped a plump hand around the handle of the front door, pulled it open, and slid inside.  He was both nervous and excited as he took broad steps inside, making his massive paunch slap against his meaty thighs.  There was a small corridor with an aluminum shutter at the end labeled 'Entrance'.  Sam waddled up to the shutter and saw a pad on the wall next to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing!\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he depressed the up arrow with a chubby finger, and the shutter began sliding upwards revealing a splendid sight.  At first he saw blue carpeting, next were giant bucket seats out-lining the very large circular room, one for each color of the rainbow.  On the side nearest the entrance was a bar, where a man who must have weighed 500 pounds was bartending.  The center of the room was a wide open space that had a 35 by 35 foot tiled square placed right in the middle.  Sam was simply amazed by all of the decoration and color the place had, but one thing he didn't see were the whole reason he came, Strippers!  Sam walked into the place and noticed that despite the lack of strippers, the place was packed!  He walked over to the bar and the bartender surveyed Sam and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Chubby!  What can I get ya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at the moment, thanks.  I'm actually new here, and I was wondering why are there so many people here, and no strippers?\"  Asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender chuckled and replied, \"There are strippers here all the time, but every so often we get a special group coming in.  And tonight is one of those nights, and all these people are here to see them, so you came on a great night Chubby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned to look at the center of the room and saw the tiled floor, he pictured stark naked fat men displaying their blubber in all it's glory and started to get a little hot under the collar.  He turned back to the bartender and asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's the special group coming in tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my favorites!\"  Said the bartender dreamily. \"All of the strippers are...           </span></div></div>",

I'm just not sure... I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Sam, I don't have all day. You know what, I think I have just the guy who can help you in making up your mind. Does that sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam who was still in a bit of a dazed state gave a slight nod and followed the Mayor to section on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam this is Merlin one of our resident magicians here at the Testosterton labs. I think he might be able to help you with your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin extended his hand to Sam to exchange in a handshake. Sam's hand met with Merlin's in a firm greeting. For having a name like Merlin, Sam was surprised to see that the magician before him did not appear to at all very wizard like. Merlin was handsome young bloke with a drop of short jet black hair and a gleaming glow from his beautifully tanned skin. It was apparent Merlin took great pride in his body with one glance at his massively developed muscles. Still, like all the men of Testosterton Sam had met, this sculpted upper body was offset with overly stuffed ball-gut which was revealed just a bit by Merlin's tight muscle shirt. The sight was enough to get Sam a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam here is having a little trouble deciding his preferred method of gaining, I thought maybe you could help him Merlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be my pleasure!\" replied Merlin with a wink at Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sam, in times like these I often use my psychic abilities to foresee into the future... let's see.... oh yes, I'm getting a picture of you 10 years from now, you are being fed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really what do I look like? How am I being fed\" Sam was intrigued with Merlin's routine, but didn't know how much he really believed in the magician's so-called 'psychic abilites'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't know all of a sudden.. yes the picture's become very fuzzy... I hate it what this happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that seem to happen a lot?\" questioned Sam in a sort of mocking manner..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha very funny Sam. I don't know what to do? If I can't use my powers I guess I will have to revert to asking you a few simple questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright by me.\" replied Sam<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... lets see.. I guess this really all boils down to one simple question. How fast do you want to gain the weight? Your wish is my command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam began to ponder the question. How would he answer? Did he want to take it slow and enjoy in a gradual fattening process or would he seek immediate results and wish for quick gains?</span></div></div>",

He likes the taste, kind of like sugar.  Then the Mayor steps up and says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, soon you'll be as big as me!\"  He says wobbling his massive overhanging belly.  \"Why don't you go up to your room and get settled in for the night and get used to your soon to be larger body.  There should be some food up there for you to eat to, there always is around here!  I'll check up on you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Mayor turned around and walked up to his office, belly swaying all the way.  Sam says bye to Merlin and heads up to his room himself.  When he reaches his room Sam drops his jaw at what he sees.  His room is gigantic!  It's about half the size of a basketball court!  It has gigantic tables lining one whole side of the room and a bed that looks like it could hold an elephant!  After Sam gawks at his room he notices that the tables are lined with tons and tons of food.  Just knowing that in an hour he's going to have an extra 15 pounds on him makes him want to eat until his gut explodes.  Sam sits down at one of the huge tables and begins to stuff himself silly with as much food as possible.  After an hour passed Sam felt like he was going to burst.  When he realized that he was going to gain 15 pounds in a couple seconds he looked down at his belly and felt a tingling sensation.  He moaned slightly as a wave of warmth flowed through his body.  He felt his mid-section soften and his body become padded as the magic took effect.  When it was over he was filled out and had a soft fat roll protruding over his waistline.  He reached his hand down and squeezed his tiny roll of fat.  He wanted more of it, much more!  The feeling of fullness left him and he wanted to eat even more.  Sam shoveled even more food into his mouth than before, turning himself into a slob.  He didn't care though, just so long as he got even fatter.  Sam kept eating and eating and eating for hours.  Each time he gained the 15 pounds he ate even more.  Soon after 5 hours had passed, all the tables had been cleared of food, and Sam was 75 pounds heavier.  He had ripped out of his clothes the hour before, and his belly rolled to cover his privates while sitting, and his breasts had rolled over too.  He decided that he had enough to eat for one night so he trudged his heavy-self over to the bed, slid under the covers, and passed out.  Sam was awakened by the Mayor the next day, as he opened his eyes he heard,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't sleep all day Sam, now get out of bed and let me see how much you've grown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam came to his senses and got up out of bed, he had difficulty however.  When he finally stood up the Mayor shouted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, 495 pounds!  You're almost as big as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked down at himself to see how much he had grown, and boy did he!  His belly hung down to the middle of his thighs, his arms and legs were like huge flabby tree trunks.  His breasts overlapped his front and continued around his sides to his back.  Sam shouted aloud,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, I'm huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh Sam!\"  Said the Mayor playfully.  \"You've been asleep for a long time.  Now come down and have breakfast with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about some clothes?\"  Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll only be dining with me don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nervously followed the Mayor up to his office where they both had breakfast and chatted for a bit, during which Sam had gained another 15 pounds.  When breakfast was over and done with the Mayor said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, Merlin has the antidote to the spell you're under.  Just go see him when you want to stop your gaining.  Your room should be filled with food again if you're ever hungry also.  See you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam walked out of the Mayors office admiring his new 510 pound body.  When he got to the lobby he wondered what he should do next.  Go see Merlin about the antidote, or explore the town a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Sam do...  </span></div></div>",

As he spun around, his gut swayed with all it's soft girth, and he continued out the door.  Sam thought he would go back to his room and eat for a while more.  As he was walking up the stairs the clock struck 10 o'clock, and Sam was about to gain another 15 pounds.  Unfortunately, this would be the first time Sam had ever gained that weight standing up.  As he gained his 15 pounds, his whole body got heavier than he expected, it didn't seem that heavy sitting down to him.  His whole body shifted from the weight and he fell forward on the stairs.  Sam tossed the bottle of antidote in the air to catch his fall with his hands, the bottle crashed to the stairs and shattered with a dull 'crash'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I dropped the antidote, and it broke.\"  Replied Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, well that's really bad because I don't have anymore!\"  Said a shocked Merlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Said Sam with a dull 'you have to be joking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, I don't have anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can't you make more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as of now, you need a sample of the potion used for the gain to make the antidote, and you downed my last bottle yesterday!  It'll take me at least a day to brew the potion you used for the gain, and another day or two to make the antidote!  You sure had rotten timing to have butterfingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Merlin explained the ordeal to Sam, he slipped into a stupor, making calculations in his head.  When he was done he said aloud,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I weigh 525 now and it's 10 o'clock, that leaves 210 pounds for the rest of today, 360 pounds for tomorrow, and another 360 pounds for the day after that.  Oh my God, that would make me exactly 1,455 pounds!  Not counting my food intake, which would probably put me over 1,500 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be precisely correct, Sam.\"  Added Merlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I only wanted to be about 600 pounds!\"  Shouted Sam.  \"Now I'll be more than double that!  I wouldn't even be able to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the beauty of Testosterton, nobody would care!  You would be considered wonderful and sexy at that weight, although not many people weigh that much here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you reverse it later, you do have magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, because Testosterton is a place for fat people, we haven't exactly done much research on weight loss magic, since nobody wants to lose any weight.  So if I did try something like that, I couldn't guarantee that it would work well, or even at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you at least try something, I just got here, I want to enjoy the city, not be completely immobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best, but don't get your hopes up.  Just make sure though that you stay in your room until I get this thing finished, we don't want you getting so fat that you can't move in the middle of the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned around once more, his belly jiggling along as it whipped around his sides.  He thought he would go up to his room to kill time, he approached his bedroom door and walked inside.  He sat down in a gigantic chair and watched as his belly rolled to the end of his knees.  As he watched his belly rest on the brink of teetering, 11 o'clock rolled around and Sam gained another 15 pounds, making his teetering gut topple over the edge of his knees, pushing his total to 540 pounds.  Now that he promised he wouldn't leave his room he had time to sit and think about what it would be like to be that fat.  He remembered what Merlin had said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be considered wonderful and sexy at that weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kept playing over and over in Sam's mind, he grabbed his soft belly with both hands and felt how warm and soft it was.  He was really starting to incredibly enjoy his growing girth!  He moved his hands up to his plump breasts and began squeezing those as well, feeling how they wrapped around his sides like blankets.  He felt so secure and safe within his jiggly padding, he loved it even more than he could have imagined!  He was becoming aroused by focusing his attention on his fat, he was also starting to feel very hungry.  He turned to his feeding tables and began gorging on all the food that resided there,  shoving handfuls of any food he could grab into his eager mouth, actually wanting to become fatter.  3 Hours passed as Sam devoured all the food like a hog!  From eating all the food and Merlin's spell, Sam weighed in at an even 600 pounds.  He patted his belly, which now hung between his legs, and sent pleasuring ripples througout his chubby body.  As Sam was enjoying his peaceful bliss, a knock was heard at the door, and without waiting for an answer, Merlin comes through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry to barge in like that.  I just found a bottle of the antidote that I didn't even know that I had!  I notice now that your weight is 600 pounds, right where you wanted it to be.  If you take this now you could be like you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam thought for a while about the ordeal, should he stay at 600 pounds and stay mobile, or should he push it to max limits and be one of the fattest people in Testosterton?  He was enjoying how fat he was already, should he take the antidote and stop at 600 pounds, or should he refuse the antidote and get really big? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No thanks Merlin.  I don't want the antidote right now.\"  Sam says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!  You were just down in my office a couple hours ago and freaked out because you were going to get too big, and now you're refusing the antidote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Merlin.  At least for now, I'll take it gladly but I still want to get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well in that case have fun gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could tell that Merlin was frustrated and confused as he left his room.  Sam didn't care, he just wanted to be fatter, he didn't really know why he wanted to be fatter, his fat just grew on him.  The time was around 2:20p.m., and Sam didn't really know what he should do.  He came to the thought that he should walk around town for a bit.  He left his room, walked very carfully down the stairs, and into the city.  It was a very large city, everywhere he looked there were dining restaurants.  Obviously people with guts this big, needed to eat a lot of food.  One particular restaurant caught his eye, it was called 'The Feeder' and it had a sign featuring a hugely fat man with a funnel in his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what that place is!\"  Sam said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolled into the restaurant and surprisingly he saw nobody inside.  The only person in the building appeared to be the man behind the counter.  As you walked towards the counter, you realized that it was actually a giant blob of fat behind the counter!  The counter he sat behind was boxed in like a square, it's dimensions were at least 6x6 feet, and the man inside filled it all with jiggling fat!  The man noticed that Sam was marveling at his size and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one pictured on the sign you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam snapped out of his trance when he found out that the man was talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... really, well it makes sense.\"  Sam felt stupid at what he just said, he didn't really pay attention to the man's words at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"  Said Sam.  \"I'm just truly amazed at your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\"  Said the man.  \"My name's Adam.  I just opened up this new restaurant a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem to do good buisiness.\"  Sam Said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we get a lot of buisiness, they're all just in the back getting fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's eyes lit up as he said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fed!  You actually feed people here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you just pick a session you want to be fed and you go to the back room and are fed non-stop until your time is up.  We even use some of the genetically altered food the Mayor produces to give people a substantial weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your smallest session?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our smallest session is a 2 hour feeding, and people usually gain about 60 pounds from the altered food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"  Asked Sam, he was very excited about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our medium session is 4 hour feeding, and the gain for that is about 140 pounds.  The more altered food you eat the more you gain.  Our large session is a 7 hour feeding, and the gain is nearly 270 pounds.  And finally, our largest session possible is an overnight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overnight?!\"  Said a startled Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, overnight.  For that session a person pre-schedules an appointment and arrives at 8 o'clock that night.  The person then has a feeding tube inserted directly into their stomach, and is pumped with liquified versions of the food we have.  The person is allowed to fall asleep and feeding continues through the night until 10 o'clock the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, a 14 hour feeding session!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe it!  The weight gain on the overnight session is not for the weak of heart, most people gain around 1,010 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stood with a look of wonder and amazement on his face and the man said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had the overnight a few times myself, and now I happily weigh 3,690 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible!\"  Sam said happily.  \"Is there anyway I could have a session right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is, we have openings for small and medium.  Take your pick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam didn't realize that it was already past 3 o'clock when he was done talking to Adam, so he gained another 15 putting him at 615 pounds.  He began to weigh the issue heavily, he was still under Merlin's spell, so if Sam took the small session he would gain about 90 pounds putting him at 705 pounds, and if he took the medium session he would gain 200 pounds and balloon to more than 815 pounds!  Sam thought long and hard and made the decision to take the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam figured that he could roam around town for a bit, maybe get a little bigger.  He walked out of his building and began walking the streets.  He walked around for a while and really took in where he was.  He was in the absolute best place for him to be!  Sam had always wanted to get fat, incredibly fat, now he had the chance!  He loved it and wanted to meet others.  He found a building called 'The Dining Hall' and thought it would be nice to take a look inside.  He walked inside and saw tons of obese practically naked guys everywhere.  Sam parked himself at the counter, where the hefty man behind the counter said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\"  Sam contemplated.  \"I think I'll have the cheeseburger platter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\"  Said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sam was waiting for his order, another man that looked to be about 900 or more pounds came up behind him and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you look new here.  My name's Tim!\"  He said while sticking out an extremely plump hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took his hand and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Sam, nice to meet you Tim.  How long have you been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a couple of months.  I've filled out quite nicely since then also!\"  Tim said with a chuckle as he squeezed an oversized roll of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you are pretty big.\"  Sam said with amazement.  \"How did you choose to gain weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I chose to gain with pills and food, that's how I've gotten so big.  I kind of asked the mayor if I could have more of the pills.  So now I kind of just take them whenever I feel like gaining some more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's cool.\"  Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the man behind the counter came back with a gigantic plate of cheeseburgers.  He looked at them and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ya need more, just let me know, it's all free if ya didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grabbed a cheeseburger and started munching on it.  During his first bite he gained another 15 pounds due to Merlin's spell.  Tim noticed the change in Sam's weight and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see you chose magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I like it a lot.  I can have freedom and still gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey do you have anything to do?\"  Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\"  Replied Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to come to my place and get to know each other, I don't really have many friends in this place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was beginning to grow on Tim and vise-versa.  Sam jumped at the chance to make a new friend and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!  Let's go now.  Excuse me barkeep, I'd like a to go box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that Tim and Sam were walking downtown to Tim's place, when they arrived inside Tim's room, Sam was astonished by it.  There was food lining every single table in the room just like Sam's, but Tim's bed looked to hold a mammoth!  While you were taken aback by his room Tim heaved his massive frame onto the bed.  He looked at you and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on over here, Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam walked over to Tim really taking his size into account for the first time.  He was huge!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Sam, I know you like me.  I like you too, why don't you make me bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was surprised at Tim's request, he liked Tim, but they had just met.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould Sam stay and make Tim 'Bigger' </span></div></div>",

Well there will be consequences for this decision, no doubt.  But you can't turn back now.  It will be more difficult for you to move, seeing as your muscles will not have grown to accomidate the new weight.  So walking will be difficult for the next month or so.  And lets see not to mention your clothes won't neccesarily \"fit\" all that well . . .\"  Merlin drowned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no matter!\"  He chuckled.  \"What was that my boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much weight will I be gaining?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard was silent.  \"Hmmmmm.  I'll give you a choice of your final weight.  The choice is between 400 pounds or 800 pounds-take your pick!
