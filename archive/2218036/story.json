He went straight into his lab and hits the wall with his hand. \"<i>How could they say that about me?!</i>\"He thought as his mind repeats the reason why he is so angry.<br>\r\n <div align=\"center\">Flashback</div><br>\r\n  <i>Tails was so excited because his friends invited him to a party that he was very excited about. However when he got to the place, he was stopped by a person he didn't know that started to tell him to go away and that it was no place for babies like him. The man continued to taunt and offend Tails until Tails snapped and proved him wrong. That made his friends come and they saw what he did. Tails immediately realized what he did and tried to explain to them what happened. He expected them to understand but they did the opposite and told him to leave and never come back. He begged for their forgiveness but they began to ignore him. Outraged by the way his friends treated him, he left the house running away.</i><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">End of Flashback</div><br>\r\n He began to think of an Idea to take his revenge on them. They would regret ever ignoring them. As soon as he thought of the perfect idea he began to work on building on a machine that will let him execute the plan. After a few hours he succeeded in making a machine that will give him the ability to turn into a ghost and possess someone's body. Smirking evilly he used the machine on himself, Immediately turning himself into a ghost. With his new power he began to look for someone to start his revenge on.</span></div></div>",
