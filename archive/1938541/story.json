Pulling it up the light showed it to be a small yellow and white device, the side open as if for some kind of card reader, and with a tiny window housing a tiny blinking light.  \"What the?\" is all you manage before with a flash the room is lit as though by a flashbang, the light dazzling for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking stars from your eyes you find yourself no longer alone.  A tall yellow creature now stands above you, its long legs fluffy as though belonging to some animal, with tail and ears to match.  Though the body was not so natural, unmistakable curves of hip and bosom, pushed clear against the fur, giving the strange creature an otherworldly beauty as it looked down at you, soft blue eyes moving from the device in your hand to your face, as what looked like a coy smile spread across the creatures lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"So, you are to be my tamer then.
