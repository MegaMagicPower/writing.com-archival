Could you... maybe not read my mind without asking? I don't want you thinking I'm weird.\" Silver asked, blushing.<br>\r\n\"I can try, but I already know about you seeing me naked that one time in the hot springs\" Gold remaked teasingly. <br>\r\n\"Hey I didn't see any-\" Silvers protests were cut off as Gold placed a mask with six dots on it on the table  \"Whats this?\"<br>\r\n\"My old mask, they used it to try to brainwash me, but I was able to block it's effects with my powers.\" Gold explained before continuing.<br>\r\n\"Silver, if we use this in combination with my powers. We could change how a person thinks. Wouldn't that be an easier way to make a better future than talking to people who never listen?\"</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes of thought he came up with Sonic, Knuckles, Rouge, Blaze, Jet, Miles, Elias, Eggman, and Razor the Shark. Sonic and Eggman were the most obvious as they were the two most influential people on Mobius and it would give him a representative from both the Freedom Fighters and the Eggman Empire which would be his soon enough, Knuckles lead the Chaotix a group comparable to the Freedom Fighters in their own right not to mention controlled access to the Master Emerald, Rouge was the best candidate from Team Dark as she essentially was their leader and the team had representation from the Overlander government. Blaze was the leader of the Sol Zone and controlled their Sol Emeralds by herself which considering they were equals to the Chaos Emeralds gave him all kinds of ideas. When it came to Miles he saw him in action when he went to Moebius, the hedgehog knew they had great power there and while Scourge would\u2019ve been an easy choice he wanted to have not only the true brains of that operation running things but the one that was already being followed as well. Elias was the true leader of Acorn Kingdom and all that was needed to restore his power was putting Naugus back into his place with Silver considering using his old Secret Freedom Fighters team to do so. On the final two of Jet and Razor he was going on a whim for as he never met them but heard about them from others as the leader of the Babylonian Rogues Jet had access to all sorts of ancient resources and secrets others wouldn\u2019t have while Razor was a member of a large aquatic civilization that had a strong amount of firepower and resources to boot.

This is an adult story, do not participate in or read if you aren't old enough. If I suspect a chapter is written by a child, I will delete it.<br>\r\n2. A central charcter in this is Gold the Tenrec, a Bisexual telepath from the Sonic Universe Comics, please atleast read over her wiki page if a chapter your about to write involves her. <br>\r\n3. This story is primarily to appeal to mind control and brainwashing fetishes, that being said, not every chapter path needs to be sex sex and evil mind control. You can have legitamate drama or romance if the situation calls for it.<br>\r\n4. Do not force other fetishes into this unless you have some way to work them in naturally to the plot. Inflation, Scat, Vore, Gore and Diaper fetishes are out right not allowed because of the excess of those on other stories. (gender bending, mild expansion and bimbofication are examples of more acceptable fetishes, but do try to focus on the mind control)<br>\r\n5. Since one of the Characters is a Bi lady, Lesbian scenes are more encouraged than gay, but feel free to experiment. <br>\r\n6. No fan characters, theres plenty of blank slate characters from the comics and games that can be used inplace of a self insert and it's not fair to others to include a character that they wouldn't be able to know anything about. If I spot a fan character I will either delete your chapter or replace the character with a similar official character.<br>\r\n7. No sex scenes with Eggman, we don't need the nightmares. I won't say no humans but realize some people find Sonics 3 human girlfriends creepy.</td>",
