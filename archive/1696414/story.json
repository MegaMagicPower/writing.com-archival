This was not the great victory Saruman had promised, there was no man flesh to feast upon, or honor to be gain from fighting bravely. Only death and the smell of rotting Uruk-hai flesh. His brothers were dead or wounded, others chased down like animals by men and slaughtered while the barbarians were allowed to surrender. \"Damn the white wizard and his lies and all other pink skin shit!\" Thought the general as he laid on the ground bleeding to death. \"Their flesh isn't worthy to be eaten even by snaga scum!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the world grew dark and his body grew cold Ugl\u00fak believed this was his end, not in some glories battle but here in the mud surrounded by his fallen brothers while cursing his creator. Then in what he thought was his final minuets on Middle Earth a bright light burst through the trees and a Gandalf the white walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugl\u00fak!\" Said the wizard with a voice filled with such power it made Ugl\u00fak body quake. \"This is not the end of you nor your people, it is the beginning. You have been given the task of leading the orcs in to a new age, free from the servitude of their dark masters. But for know flee, gather your people, and wait for my call for now is not the time to ask for forgiveness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I trust you wizard?\" Asked Ugl\u00fak. \"Saruman also spoke of glory and victory, know look at us! My people were slaughtered like pigs and you were the butcher!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may walk like an adult but you still think like a child.\" Gandalf responded, his voice changed from one of power to one of a caring parent advising his confused and angry son. \"Long have your ancestors been a blight on this land, fighting and killing because it was all they knew. Even you have the blood of the innocent on your soul. This had made the other races of Middle Earth fear and hate your people for many years and such hatred is something that is hard to destroy. Only through salvation can your race be saved from destruction. I offer that to you right now, accept it and you maybe able to save your people or reject it and your people will fall into darkness.\" The white wizard hold his arm in front of Ugl\u00fak who looked at it for a minuet as he tried to make up his mind about what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other choice Ugl\u00fak took the old man's hand, from which a warm glow spreed through his body which filled him with strength and healed his wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now rise mighty Ugl\u00fak, future ruler of the orcs, go and unite your people and prepare to retake your home land from those who are still enslaved by your masters.\" And with that Gandalf dissapered with out a trace.           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Year had pass since the fall of the Dark Lord and piece had returned to much of Middle Earth all except of Mordor. King Aragon of Gondor had been attempting to chase the orcs and goblins that sill lived in the dark lands out but they were well defended and knew the hostile lands better than his solders. He was winning but the price for that was high and climbing daily. He was unsure of what to do, if counted this war it could weaken his country enough that he may not be able to defend it from other invaders, but if he did not defeat the orcs now they will counted to grow until they threatened his people again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this dark time it was Gandalf who offered a solution from the most unlikely of places. Now King Aragon sat in his hall watching something he never thought possible, an Uruk-hai bowing to him on hands and knees and asking for forgiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My King Aragon, I, Ugl\u00fak leader of the free Orlca Kiy (Free Orcs), beg for forgiveness both for my self and my people, and to offer our services to you our King. Our wish is that we may redeem our selves under your command and that we might find peace and freedom, something no orc or goblin has ever known. Our numbers our small, but our warriors are strong and are willing to die for our redemption.\" Said Ugl\u00fak, his eyes facing the ground out of shame and fear. \"We wish to help retake the lands of our ancestors (Mordor) and free the Snaga (slave orc) that sill fight for the fallen lords. I have much knowledge about the land and the people that you might find use full. But if you wish us to serve you another way we will do so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragon was unsure of how to take this, one of his greatest enemies was know asking to be forgiven and to serve him. Though part of him told him that Uruk-hai was lying, Aragon heard no lie in his words and it was not normal for Gandalf to make a mistake such as this. Reaching a decision Aragon said. \"Arise Ugl\u00fak leader of the Orlca Kiy and now servant of Gondor. Your King and Country have need of you.\" And with that Ugl\u00fak stood up strait and tall, with a glitter of happiness in his eyes. \"You need only to ask my lord and I will obey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have decide to except your help with Mordor. I shall let you lead the war against the Snaga and if you do well I will give it the land to your followers and you will be made Earl of Mordor. Now please tell me all you know about Mordor and your own people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall start with my own story. How it began I know Gandalf the Freer has already told you, but I am sure he does not know what happen after he departed. For the past year I have been gather followers, mostly Uruk-hai who served under Saruman the lier. With him dead and most of our leaders killed the few survivors looked to me for leadership and I gave it to them. I had 500 followers around the end of the great war and we hid in Dunland during that time waiting for the call of the Freer. During that time my forces grew as many of my people fled the war, swelling it to nearly a 1200 and we learned much about Mordor and the thousands of Snaga that still live there. They are divide into many factions and each wanting control over the others. And the only thing they agree on is that they hate you more than each other and will only work to gather when fighting your people.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your force is so small and theirs is so large, how do you plan to fight them?\" Asked Aragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My warriors are better trained and disciplined then they are. We have no fear of sun light and we do not fight each other for power.\" Said Ugl\u00fak hoping his answers would please his king. </span></div></div>",

To burn all those wretched, green, vile forests in Isengard's fires, and to-<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Hush. Saruman has lied, lied with every word. He has led us to ruin. Now, his power over us is no more. Now, we are Master.</i> Thus were the thoughts of the lone half-orc refugee from the Battle of the Hornburg as he marched through the grey heath. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the nearest forest several miles behind him and growing more distant with every second, partially of said foliage's own combined volition, his ill-fellings for the large flora might have proven a mystery. Unless one considered the dozens of his spawn-mates and allies who had been literally shredded by the 'trees' -by the huorns- but hours ago. The majority not butchered with the coming of the rohirrim and the lifting of the siege had fled, with all intent to return to Orthanc and the pits they knew- and then the bulk of <i>those</i> were caught by the walking woods, snagged and slain by twitching tree limbs and restless roots before they could make it to the far side and... Freedom? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a mob behind a particularly large cluster of orcs, including several Berserkers whose broad blades had alarmed even the mighty ents to caution, Ugluk had broken free with the rest- only to be grabbed by one last thick tendril. His own sword, wielded with desperate rage now that it seemed his life would end after so nearly reaching salvation- discouraged it; he had been hurled bodily into the distance rather than dismembered on the spot. His helmet had saved him then, that and a skull thick enough to rival a dwarf. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he had awakened, head aching, head-gear useless, sword lost, and bruised and cut like he had fallen asleep in a warg den, there was no sign of anothert thinking being. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Except the wizard... He had certainly been a dream, though as to why he should have dreamt it, who knew? That fiend had been at the battle, on his great white horse, handling his steed -or was it the other way around?- with ability even beyond that of the Horsemen, despite riding bear-back. And striking down Uruks left and right. Ugluk wasn't about to forget <i>that</i>. Still, whatever the dream-man had said, his fresh course seemed obvious to him: He was going back to Isengard, to find Saruman and to make him pay for his lies. And then, after that... He would know in time.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But for now, he trudged through a mercifully clean land of rocks and grassy gnolls, on soil to poor to support any tree, even a walking one. As if specifically to counteract the relief of this, the sun was poking directly into his sensitive eyes, threatening to revive his headache. A lengthy stop by a cold mountain stream to rest and drink had put paid to it earlier, or so he had thought; having never encountered such clean water in such quantities before, Ugluk had enjoyed he novelty of the first swim of his life. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And some hours after that still, he had gotten lucky and managed to break a rabbit's leg with his sling. It had nonetheless made a good attempt to get away before he broke it's neck- that had also been a pleasure; the sensation of bones snapping under his fingers. It would make a nice dinner when he stopped tonight. Of course, there were probably horse-folk swarming all over the hills, and a cooking-fire would be suicidal at best... Well, rabbit was a poor substitute for man-flesh, but it would serve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another factor made it's concern known as he hauled himself atop the next rise. A smear of black, bearing an odd, coincidental resemblance to old congealed blood writhing with maggots, was oozing amorphously across the land to his right. It was travelling not quite parallel to his own chosen route; given a few hours, there paths would cross. He quickly knew it was a group of other orcs; the occasional flashes of light in the dark splotch could only be the last of the sunlight rebounding off blackened armour and weapons, such as only his fellow Uruks carried. While the descending darkness was assisting his vision greatly, if eh could see them, than so could any rohirrim in the area. </span></div></div>",

The fake wizard never created female Uruk-hai and Ugl\u00fak never paid any attention to the human females that he killed. But seeing one lying on the ground made him feel... weird. He couldn't describe it, his body wanted her like it would want food but not to eat her. He wanted to do something else with her but he didn't know what. He also knew that if he wanted he could force him self upon her and yet his body didn't want to do it that, it wanted her to want him, to come to him willingly, and then to hold him close and press her body against him. All these new feelings were confusing and making his head hurt as he tried to sort them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he was standing there attempting to figure out all the woman turned and he was able to get a good look at her face for the first time. She had the dark skin and hair of the southern men, but he couldn't tell what color her eyes were because they were shut. And the most shocking thing about her was her nose and one of the ears, and it wasn't they were incredibly beautiful, it was that they were gone. Some one recently had crudely cut of her nose and her right ear, leaving only bloody stumps in their place. Seeing this Ugl\u00fak rushed to her side to tend to her wounds. He cut some of the leather from his own clothing to dress her wounds and to give her some covering but he knew he had to get her in doors before night. He looked around trying to figure out were to go when he heard a deep groan from behind him. He turned around to see one of the entish trees moving it's roots to show a cave underneath. He carried the sleeping human maiden in his arms over which filled with a strange feeling of pride.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he laid her down Ugl\u00fak went back out side to find supplies and to clear his head. He couldn't be gone for long for the moon was going down and the sun would rise again soon and while the sun would not hurt him it bothered his eyes and made his skin burn when he was out for to long. So he moved quickly through the forest looking for herbs that he could use as medicine as well as meat they could eat and use to make clothing for the maiden. But why did he want to help her, he never cared about his victims before, he would just kill them and keep going, never giving a second thought about it. Even now killing a deer didn't bother him, he barley paid attention to it. Yet when he looked at her lying on the rock bleeding to death Ugl\u00fak had a deep and powerful urge to save the maiden. And maybe that was it, he never paid much attention to the people he killed they were just the enemy nothing more. He would just slash them with his sword and keep going but the maiden was the first time Ugl\u00fak really saw some one die slowly. Or maybe the white wizard did something to him. Eather way he didn't want her to die so he kept up his search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally as the sun was just starting to rise Ugl\u00fak found some plants he could use to help her tend to her wounds and he also found a deer they could eat and make clothing from. So he returned to the cave to find the maiden was....</span></div></div>",

All Ugl\u00fak could do was stare as the human female cowier in fear of him. Normally the orc warrior would enjoy the feeling that he would get when his enemies feared him. For Ugl\u00fak to be feared was an honor, it was something he and his people worked hard at, for those who could inspired the most fear meant that they truly earned that fear in combat. But looking into the golden brown eyes of this human female and seeing just how much of a monster he must be he didn't feel proud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out his hand hoping to help her but she rejected it and crawled further into the small cave. He wanted to go over and comfort her but something told him that was a bad idea, so instead her started a fire on the edge of the cave and began to cook the deer he caught. After he was done he placed piece of the meat off on the side for her to eat if she wanted it.   </span></div></div>",

He put the bones off to the side to be used later, as well as more meat. As he finished cleaning out the fur, he inspected his work, putting the knife next to him. Once he had finished inspecting, he looked back up at the girl, only to see that she had taken his knife, and was pointing it at him. She seemed to be shivering as she held the knife. He held his hands up as he moved towards her, and placed the deerskin around her shoulders. She was still shivering, but not as much, she looked, if Ugluk was reading her expressions right, confused, but thankful. She said something else in that strange language he couldn't understand. It wasn't the common tongue, for all Uruks learn the common tongue as well as Orcish, taking a chance, Ugluk spoke in the common tongue. <br>\r\n\"I don't want to hurt you,\" he said \"Do you speak the common tongue? Only I don't understand what you're saying.\" <br>\r\nThe woman paused for a moment, then replied \"Why are you doing this? I don't understand, why kill so many at Helm's Deep, but save me?\"  <br>\r\n\"All orcs are born with a certain bloodlust, a hate towards all races that are not orc,\" said Ugluk \"Uruk hai are no different. Saruman the White twisted us further, inciting our rage, turning us into killing machines and aiming us at the Rohirrin. My name is Ugluk, I was merely a tool used by Saruman in a much larger war. We are the sword, Saruman is the swordsman, we hate what the wizard did to us, now, the sword he used to attack Rohan is turned towards him.\"<br>\r\nThe human maiden was silent for a while after that. Her wounds would take a while to heal, and Ugluk would protect her until that time. He helped her, but he didn't even know her name, but at least they were now able to understand each other. It was a step forward from what had been going on before, however, Ugluk didn't quite understand what had happened to him, but he didn't want to change it. </span></div></div>",
