She turned on the faucet and splashed some cold water on her face and feeling more awake she looked up at her reflection and gasped.  Her once tone and slim stomach was now slightly pudgy.  She poked at it and her finger sunk in about a hair's worth, but still enough to make Kim panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim sat on the toilet her head in her hands, she had one week of no heroics and nothing else to do but school and some cheer-leading and she managed to pack on a few pounds.  As she tried to decide what to do next a couple of options rose immediately to the center of her mind.</span></div></div>",

So after a light breakfast she jogged to the school and around to the gym.  Using her keys to the gym by her right as cheer captain she slipped inside and made her way to the locker room to change into a pair of shorts and a sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then warmed up on the treadmill and moved onto several of the various pieces of exercise equipment that was either bought when there was enough in the budget or donated to the school.  After about forty-five minutes of exercise she cooled down by  doing some stretches and returned to the girls locker room to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had just turned off the shower when the sound of the door opening made Kim flaten herself against the wall of the shower cubicle.  Slowly peaking around the corner Kim was suprised to see who had shown up to school on a Saturday.</span></div></div>",

Just think about it Kim no more rushing to do the world's bidding, all you would have to do is please me instead.

Monique also had on a strap-on that had to be eight inches long and two inches thick while Bonnie had the same length and width she also had two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walked up too Kim and Bonnie grabbed her roughly by the hair and brought the plastic cocks to Kim's mouth.  \"Listen up pig in one minute I will be taking your virginity so you better put that mouth to good use if you want these lubed up.\"  With that Bonnie quickly kissed Kim roughly her tongue invading Kim's mouth before she stopped the kiss and plunged both of the cocks straight down Kim's throat.  Kim took them for a few seconds before quickly pulling one out and ravishing the first with her mouth and tongue.

Bonnie was very rough while Monique was as gentle as possible.  She gave Kim a long sweet kiss before inserting the dildo into Kim's mouth.  Kim sucked eagerly at the phallus while Monique moaned and gently held Kim's head encouraging Kim to go faster and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim felt like she was in heaven and eventually she felt her body give in and she experienced the most powerful orgasm she had ever had.  Then to her surprise she felt Monique's cum shot down her throat and into her stomach as Bonnie filled her ass and pussy.  \"It wouldn't be a slut sandwich without the special sauce,\" Bonnie said as the two caretakers pulled out and sprayed Kim with the last of their cum.  Kim saw a small hole at the tip of each of the strap-ons and moaned at the feeling of being so full.</span></div></div>",

When she had returned him to his village he had hugged her and Kim was praised by everyone in the village.  Soon more images came to her, the jungle from up close as she moved from tree to tree, people in need of help looking at her with teary eyes as she selflessly assisted them with no thanks needed.  It was the people that she was doing this for and the pleasure she received was just the bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim straightened her shoulders and stood tall and proud before calmly striding from the gym unaware of a pair of eyes watching her in disbelief as she simply left without a backwards glance.  Bonnie's fingernails clawed down the doorway as she glared daggers at Kim's back.  No one rejected Bonnie, especially not a wayward little pig that thought to highly of itself.  Oh Bonnie would make sure that Kim paid for this insult one way or another Bonnie would find Kim and get her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Bonnie was now confronted with an issue that needed to be addressed.  Kim was a survivor and very tough, it would take a lot to catch her unaware and then capture her.  She was half tempted to wait it out and let time lower Kim's guard, but Kim's insult fueled Bonnie's rage beyond her control and Bonnie had to do something to control her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was about to launch herself from the doorway and go after Kim another possibility struck her.  What if before she went after Kim she took the time to practice and collect a few more pigs in the process.  The other cheerleaders would be a good challenge and if Bonnie could hide what she was doing from Kim's sharp gaze then Kim would be brought down by her own teammates without Bonnie having to lift a finger.</span></div></div>",

A timid tapping drew Monique's attention to the front where Kim was nervously shuffling her feet.  \"Kim, sweetie what's wrong?\"  Monique marched around the counter and up to Kim who stared at the floor her face bright red.  Monique paused and then shut and locked the doors and put up a sign that said out to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Monique,\" Kim was still addressing the floor, but the red was fading from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem girlfriend, now tell me what's wrong,\"  Monique said as she wrapped an arm around Kim's waist and dragged her to the employee break room.  Once Kim was seated Monique got out the lunch that her mother had packed for her and groaned.  At Kim's questioning looks Monique sighed, \"My mother seems to think that I need some more weight on my bones and always packs my lunch with heavy foods.  I mean sure I enjoy the occasional Beuno Nacho, but still I worked hard for this figure and I want to keep it.  It's my mother though and I just can't refuse her.\"  Monique shrugged and got up and removed a large salad and sandwich from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monique sat down again Kim finally spoke up, \"actually that is what I wanted to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lunch?\"  Monique stared at Kim is surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you see its...\" Kim sighed and stood up and pulled up her purple shirt and Monique saw that Kim's once washboard stomach had a little jelly on it.</span></div></div>",

As she chewed on the confection she noticed that Shego was eying her stomach hungrily and licking her lips.  \u201cUh, Shego what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have decided on a better way to spend our time than fighting. \u201c  She smirked at Kim\u2019s raised eyebrow, \u201cyou\u2019re going to become my fat, helpless pet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays the girl who is licking her fingers,\u201d Kim forced herself to drop her fingers and glared at Shego.  \u201cListen Pet you have two choices we can do this the easy way and you\u2019ll get whatever you could need or the hard way I give you the bare essentials and stuff you until you burst every day.  Your call Pet and to show how nice I am I\u2019ll give you some time to decided but don\u2019t take too long.\u201d  Shego then leaned forward and kissed Kim roughly and thoroughly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Kim watched Shego return the jewelry she knew that Shego was serious and more than likely she would be taken in her sleep if she didn\u2019t respond quickly enough.  Shego in a way though offering Kim the chance she was looking for to escape the pressure of society, however the cost was very steep and permanent.  Once again Kim stood on the edge of a monumental decision.  Freedom from a stressful life full of constant demands and interruptions or a life where she was free within a certain set of parameters and yet still had all she could want.</span></div></div>",
