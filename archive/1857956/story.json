However, you can't help but also be a little worried since you could get crushed or even eaten by something since you are now bite size.

You're so excited at the thought, that you forget to consider that Nipper might be all to happy to play with you at your new size as her food.

Eventually, make it to the entrance of the room where the water heater is, thankfully this room doesn't have a door so getting in will be no trouble. You enter the room and make your way towards the water heater in the corner. Next to the water heater you see the large, large to you anyway, cushion that marks Nipper's special napping spot.

You're so excited that you begin yelling and waveing your arms to get her attention. After a moment or two of this you see Nipper raise her head up and turns it to look right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nipper! I'm over her. . .\" You begin to shout but stop when you notice the way Nipper is stareing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look in her eyes wasn't the loving one that was usually in them whenever she looked at you. The look she has in her eyes this time seems more sinister and predatory. You gulp when you suddenly see her lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nipper why are you loo. . .\" You begin to say, when Nipper suddenly cuts you off by clamping her jaws around your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a toss of her head she throws you high into the air. You reach the top of the water heater and then you begin to plummet, screaming, back down to Nipper's wide open mouth. You flail your arms and legs in a futile attempt to alter your course. However, you inevitably land on your cat's tongue with a plop. Nipper quickly closes her mouth, effectivly sealing you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself laying face down a giant cat's tongue as you become soaked from head to toe in her saliva and get blasted by her warm, smelly breathe. Then all of the sudden Nipper begins to lick you against the roof of her mouth and roll you around on her sandpaper like tongue. You beg her to stop and not do this as you try to endure the pain of being tasted by her sandpaper tongue. As you're being tasted you begin to her a rather loud rumbleling sound coming from her throat. You realize that she's purring. Apparantly Nipper really likes how you taste. 'At least someone's enjoying this,' you think to yourself bitterly. Nipper is indeed enjoying it and continues to savor your delicious flavor for a few more minutes. Soon the tongue settles down and starts pushing you back toward the throat. Nipper tilts her head back and with a loud GULP swallows you whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly start to travel down Nipper's esophagus, becomeing covered from head to toe in mucus and even more saliva. You don't try to struggle as you are too stunned by the fact that Nipper just ate you and you can't figure out why. Did you wake her up from a nap causeing her to become angry with you? Did she just not recognize you and thought you looked a lot like dinner? You'll never know since you're now just her food. As the muscles continue to slowly massage you down the esophagus you hear all sorts of unsettleing sounds. You can hear the beating of her heart as you pass by, and throughout your journey you can constantly hear Nipper purring. However, the most unsettling sound you hear is the distant gurggle of the stomach, as though it were calling to you. Soon your journey comes to stop as you hit the stomach sphincter. It quickly opens up to accept you as food, and you soon land with a splash in your new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nipper, please let me out!\" you beg as start to feel a tingly sensation all over your body. However, Nipper either doesn't hear you, or just ignores you as her purring vibrates both you and the digestive jucies in her stomach. Suddenly, the tingly sensation turns to searing pain as the digestive jucies start working even harder to break you down. You cry out in pain, but you 've accepted your fate and allow yourself to be digested. Fortunately for you, you pass out long before you're completely dissolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the outside Nipper goes back to sleep so she can properly digest you. She continues to purr as she starts to dream about eating that tasty, and foolish, snack (you) that had so rudely disturbed her slumber over and over again. In the back of her mind she wonders where she might find more these tasty new rodents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell in the end you were just cat food. You really should have known that Nipper would eat you for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked to be 20ft high, making the creature utterly enormous to a inch high human like you as it lifts its trunk and trumpets loudly. You take a closer look at the elephant's face and you see that the elephant appears to be a female elephant and from the looks of it, she's older than the rest of the elephants. Given her size and her age, she must've been the matriarch of the elephant enclosure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant trumpets again and starts to walk, forcing you to run as you're looking back at the enormous encroaching feet that could flatten you to a pancake. The elephant pauses and then you see her hold her foot over a pumpkin before smashing it and then using her trunk to go through and eat it. As the elephant is eating, some bits of pumpkin fall out of her mouth and land on top of you as you groan. You then gasp because the elephant might see you with the pumpkin all over you and try to eat you. Not wanting to take any chances, you shake off the pumpkin mush and then try to inch away. As you're sprinting, the elephant matriarch's ears twitch and she gives a trumpet of confusion before turning. She focuses her eyes and sees something running from her. She also realizes that the creature she spots appears too small to be a mouth and therefore she didn't have to fear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, the elderly 20ft elephant stomps her way towards you and lowers her head. She then stamps her foot as you yell and you're knocked off of your feet. The elephant's trunk inches towards you and sniffs you as the elephant matriarch leans down and gives a snort through her trunk. You shiver at what this elephant will do now. She obviously has never seen a human so tiny before. You try to inch away, but the elephant inhales you into her trunk and then you yell and grab hold of the thick gray elephant flesh inside the elderly African elephant's nose. You slip on the mucus and have to hold on so you don't completely fall inside as the elephant is lifting up her massive trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up the nostril and you see a moon-sized eye in front of you that makes you shiver. The elephant giantess is looking down on you. You really hope this elephant is friendly as she blows air from her trunk that hits you. You look around at her massive ears and long tusks and wonder what will come next. That's when something strange happens. \"Well I'll be,\" says the elephant in a deep yet surprisingly feminine contralto. \"I knew all humans were smaller than elephants but I didn't think I'd find a human this small. Then again, I'm usually large even for an elephant.\" You gasp. That elephant just... spoke to you. First you were shrunk to an inch high and now an elephant is talking. What next? You just hope this elderly elephant titaness is gentle.</span></div></div>",

These obese titans are a most wondrous sight and you can't help but stare at all the huge beasts that stumble by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as a hippopotamus lumbers in the water and snorts bubbles and then you turn and see a hippopotamus chewing away at a cabbage and even a mother hippo nursing her baby.

You then realize that this hippopotamus is a female hippopotamus as you look closer. This gray skinned giantess was way too busy eating a cabbage to notice you. You figure that the water wasn't safe, so you grab the hippo by her tail and begin to climb upwards, hoping that you will be able to get out of the water and find safety on the hippo's back.

A shadow looms over you. You look up. Your gaze is met by the giant muzzle of the doe. She has noticed you. You stand still, unsure of what to do. The doe begins to sniff. She is clearly trying to determine what you were. You hope she does not think you are vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeer, however, are not as stupid as some humans think. The doe could clearly make you out as a human. Though she was used to humans being bigger she still could identify you. Too long had she lived in fear of getting a belly full of lead. Too many friends of her's had been shot down mercilessly by those filthy humans. Too great was the grudge inside her to ignore this human who somehow was below average size; below fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes meet the the doe's gaze. Somehow you sense a fire in them that tells you to run and indeed, you do. You run. You hear hooves thundering behind you. You try to make it to the undergrowth for cover. It looks as if you will make it. You are almost there. But the doe had only been toying with you. If she would have wanted to crush you instantly she could have. Her hate for humans, however, made her want to do something even more painful, to give the human a death it deserved. With lighting speed she jumps in front of you and lowers her head. Before you have time to react you run straight into the doe's open mouth. The jaws slam shut behind you and you land face-down on the wet tongue. The air is humid and deer smelling. You attempt to bash through the closed jaws, but all you achieve is a knock on the head. The doe laughs (the way deer do) at your futile attempt and quickly pins you with her tongue. She lets her tongue wash you with her saliva. She sucks on you and tosses you around. She rubs you against her slimy cheek and moans with sadistic pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the doe decides it is time for revenge and so tilts her head back. You scream for mercy as you slide into her gullet, but all you receive as an answer is an audible, \"GLURK\". Efficiently, you slide down the doe's esophagus still squirming. You just cannot accept the fact that your life will end inside the stomach of a deer. Inevitably, you come to the end of your slide as the welcoming stomach opens to you. A horrid smell fills your nostrils and quickly you end up splashing around in nothing else, but gastric juice. The liquid fills your mouth giving you your last taste; a disgustingly bitter taste. Slowly, you begin to feel as the corrosive acid eats away your skin layer by layer. You writhe in pain, but nothing gives you ease. The stomach begins to fill with mush which clearly is the doe's lunch. You spend the last, painful moments of your life as nothing more than a topping on a salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe was satisfied. She had avenged all the poor deer who had fallen to human fire. Now, she also realized how good a human tasted to say nothing of the feeling of it sliding down her throat. Perhaps this was a sign from mother nature of a new era. An era where humans are inferior. The thought made the doe feel encouraged. For a moment she enjoyed the feeling of the human tickling her tummy. Then she began grazing, continuing her life as if nothing special had occurred.</span></div></div>",

Your vision is engulfed by darkness as the teeth come together behind you, but not before you get a glimpse of the most revolting sight. Threads of saliva hang off the monstrous maw and bits of chewed up vegetation dot the browned molars that could crush you with little effort. There, however, is little time to think as the tongue that just a second before licked you up begins tossing you around. The sticky saliva soaks your body as the wet and warm muscle massages your puny body. There is little you can do to fight back and that little only causes the tongue to become ever more aggressive. The doe lets out small vocalizations as it analyzes your taste. Whatever it thinks you are, it seems to enjoy you. As a finale you are  pressed hard against the mouths palate and sucked on greedily before a simple flick sends you darting into the gullet. Without a moments hesitation the magnificent creature swallows, forcing you with a loud 'gulp' down its slimy esophagus and towards your painfully slow and foul smelling end of digestion.</span></div></div>",

You stare up into the dark hole of her throat, and the sight terrifies you, causing you to squirm and wriggle under the heavy paw of the lioness with even more energy. But you're still trapped, and you can't do anything to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seems like that might not be necessary. The lioness closes her mouth, and you look up in surprise as she locks eyes with you again. Apparently, she was simply yawning. You feel relieved, but that feeling vanished as the feline lowers her head towards you and sticks her tongue out, giving you a quick and slimy lick that covers your face and coats your head in drool. You squirm some more, the fears of being eaten having been reawoken, but once again, the lioness makes no move to eat you. You stop struggling and look up again, and watch as the lioness snorts and, shockingly, lifts her paw off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie on the ground still, unsure of what to do. The lioness just released you. Does that mean she doesn't want to eat you? Seemingly, she disliked your taste, so that seems likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, and the lioness watches you, but makes no move to pin you or eat you. You look up at her, and uncertainty fills your mind. You're afraid of staying here in case the giant feline changes her mind, but you're also unsure if it would be best to leave. After all, if this lioness does not want to eat you, then that means you should be safe with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you have a choice. Flee or stay. What do you choose?</span></div></div>",

However, she looks it you with her deep, unnaturally red eyes with a look of care. You relax and lean against her belly. That\u2019s a mistake. Before you register what\u2019s happening, your world becomes darkness, heat and wetness. The lioness grinned to herself as she lifted her head, now with a treat in her mouth. She allowed them to run around for a while, then tilted her head. Your world went weightless for a split second, then you fell. The trip was slow, and the bulge was barely noticeable. You disappeared into her belly without a trace. You decide to get used to your new home. That\u2019s when your world shakes.</span></div></div>",
