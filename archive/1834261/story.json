Though it wasn't for a meal they were gathered, but rather to hear of the impending doom the scouts had said would come to their village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Elan was a bard from ages gone by. Now he was an old man who always wore a cloak to try to warm his old bones. His long gray hair and beard almost reached down to the table he sat at the head of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You have heard the words of the scouts and already we have sent away the women who were not of our army and the children to a far off village. Now before me sits our best of both genders. Mages, warriors and battle tacticians. We fear that all of this may be too late. But none of us want to see our village fall. Charlee has a tale to tell of her spying on our coming enemy,\" Elan shared as he motioned to a bright eyed blonde girl to his right, dressed light and ready, a spry archer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Charlee swallowed deeply and began, \"Small camps to the North have already fell under the tread of these monsters. It is no surprise that you should be able to tell who they are just by their enormous size, however I will tell you anyway. They wear furs, much like ancient travellers of the tundra. Yet our lands arn't that cold so they tend to only be small skirts and brasiers. To be honest, they are actually very attractive to behold, until you see what they are capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"They laugh at misery and delight in treating those smaller than them as nothing. Stepping on those below them is like a game to them, stomping unfortunate stragglers under their dirty bare feet. Then any still alive after this treatment,\" Charlee swallowed hard again, her throat dry with fear of their acts,\"Those still alive after being stepped on would be eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Everyone shuffled in their seats, uncomfortable with the news so far. Beautiful monsters that would delight in their destruction were coming to claim their land. Nothing could be done but preparing and hoping for the best. Yet it seemed bleak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was more awkward for a few others. It wasn't a secret that these monsters were indeed beautiful and a good majority of the villagers had actually taken to falling in love with them. They never dared let themselves be seen, or told many other villagers, but some were truly awed by these giantess. They wanted nothing more than to travel to their home and watch them from hiding places around their massive furnature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   None of them spoke up. They'd all watched giantess from afar, but they had no idea what they'd do if they saw one up close. Naturally they didn't want to be crushed or eaten, well some didn't anyway, but the thought of attacking these creatures of beauty was a horrible concept in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Elan spoke up again, \"In my younger days I have seen first hand these fearsome monsters. I do not have faith in our village. I only say that we go out as a task of legend. We show those who live after us that we did not falter. We stood strong, but alas, I fear we alone will not be able to stop the oncoming siege of the giantess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Raenok, a young warrior lad, one secretly who had spied on these giantess before for his own desiring feelings towards them, stood and asked, \"Why have the giantess left their land? They come from a perfect field of all they could need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That we do not know young Raenok. Charlee found them only a few days to the north. As far as we assume, something has driven them from their land,\" Elan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Braegale, a brown haired battle woman stood next, \"What could drive them from their own land? These are beasts! They delight in destroying anything else and make light of it with even laughter and song of their horrible tales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Obviously Braegale wasn't enthusiastic like Raenok, or like her sister Iandrea, who was shy to admit it but couldn't help watching these majestic creatures eat their prey. Iandrea sat next to her sister and was staring at the table. She hated to admit it but she always wondered what it would be like to be eaten by a giantess. Iandrea was shorter as was their hair, the same brown as her sisters but shoulder length unlike Braegale's long ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"We do not know Braegale. All we know is that they are coming our way. We expect them any time now. Our decisions are clear. We can either send out a party to get more details on their camp, or we simply wait for the seige and hope for the best,\" Elan sighed and slumped down in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I will gather a party and venture out immediately. I won't wait for dawn. Somehow we will slay these beasts!\" Braegale growled as she threw her fur cape over one shoulder and glared out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Who's tale will you follow?</span></div></div>",

Horses with lodges loaded full of the heavy bolts where set in motion towards the artillery hill near the village center. \"I can't kill them. Damn, I doupt that I can even harm them.\" He looked over to the armed men running over the streets. Their armor and weapons shining in the remaining light of the fading day. Then he looked at his feet ashamed of his thoughts. This Women are going to destroy their village. They where going to trample everything he loved but still - he didn't care. The love for these women where bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door to the armory and checked his equiptment. He had to smile as he held the heavy sword in his hand. He had seen them. He knew what they could - what they would do. Terrible memories mixed with great pleasure came back to his mind but he tried to shrug it off. He thought about his mates as he felt his helmet if there was something to fix. There was nothing. How much soldiers do we have here? twohundred? threehundred? with the men and lads there was a little more than ninehundred men and some women who was going to stand up to them. There where stories told that one of them could take out a thousand troops. These where stories but he had seen them. He had watched one - Raviel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe layed down in his bed, knowing that he wouldn't get much sleep. Not with the upcoming events - not with Raviel in his head.<br>\r\nMaybe she was there too. Maybe she got hurt or killed. He had to think about so much things.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All through the night, the village prepared itself for war. Swords were sharpened, armor assembled, and mighty siege weapons constructed. The work that would normal take a week was completed in less than a day. The size of the army also grew as groups trickled in from other villages eager to defend the land. The tacticians met to discuss how to fight things dozens of times their own size. Raenok was present at this meeting. A normal defense with companies of men arranged in squares and a charge at the enemy would be suicidal.<br>\r\n\"We should set the entire valley on fire as soon as the giantesses appear, trap them inside and let the fire work. We could do it with virtually no casualties!\" one leader exclaimed, gesturing wildly.<br>\r\n\"That'd never work. We couldn't get everyone out in time. And we'd have to leave the catapults here. In addition, what if they simply walk out of the flames. Then we'd have lost our home, and our armies would be scattered. We may as well cook ourselves and lay on platters now.\" a second one cut in. A fight almost broke out, but Raenok intervened.<br>\r\n\"I believe I have a plan!\" He roared. The others turned to listen. Their faces showed they wholeheartedly agreed with his plan. Suddenly, the battle didn't seem like a lost cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! The giants are on the march! The farms and settlements beyond the woods have been destroyed, our scouts that returned found only footprints.\" A runner on horseback informed Raenock.<br>\r\n\"'That returned'?\" he said back.<br>\r\n\"Apparently, some had not yet awoken after a hard night of slaughter. Several groups came upon the slumbering monsters. They awoke and had a small feast before moving out.\" he said grimly. Raenok nodded solemnly.<br>\r\nAll at once, a great trembling shook Raenok, who was standing with his troops outside the village walls. All the men looked up from their tasks nervously. The tremors increased in magnitude until almost everything seemed ready to fall apart. Then it abruptly stopped. A slow, steady paced thud, thud replaced the previous cacophony. Trees at the far end of the valley fell before some mighty force. Finally, an upper torso and head was visible above the tops of the trees. The giant had flowing golden locks framing a gorgeous face. As she burst from the trees, the rest of her body was revealed. She wore only loosely draped animal skins covering her enormous breasts. From the bottom of her breasts to the top of her waist was exposed, showing off well toned skin. Another series of skins and studs of metal formed a loincloth shielding her womanhood from view. From the middle of her thigh down, her gorgeous legs seemed to stretch on forever, ending in her feet. She stood alone, and gazed down scornfully at the assembled forces before her.<br>\r\n\"Instead of crushing your puny resistance and feasting on your village, we have decided to give you two hours to flee before us. After that, we shall enter this valley and it shall be ours. From there, we shall rule over all the inferior people such as yourselves. However, should you still be here when we return, there will be no survivors. Heed my words, and flee now mortals.\" the giantess boomed, and then once again glared at the warriors as if she was already feeling them pop beneath her feet. Then she pulled an iron cage from behind her back. \"If you think we joke about the absolute destruction we shall rain upon you, then look at your fellows in here. They are all that remains of the northern villages. And now, they too shall perish!\" The giantess unlatched the cage, sending the tiny emaciated figures inside plummeting into her open mouth. Her jaw worked and small amounts of blood trickled from between her lips. Smiling cruelly, she turned and walked away.</span></div></div>",

We will win my friends!\" Raenok shouted to his army. They roared back to him, more to drown out their own fear than in response to his speech. The army in front of the gates stood, not intending to yield an inch. After the allotted time, the ground began to rumble again. Trees shook and were uprooted by massive legs. Wildlife fled onto the plains, hoping to escape destructive feet. This time, two giantesses emerged from the forest. One, raven-haired, resembled the first in shape and build. The second also had dark hair, but had more pronounced curves than the other. She also seemed almost feral. She wore no coverings,and grinned savagely at the army of men. Around her neck was a chain of human skulls, a necklace that curved almost down to her cleavage. Under her eyes were two lines that looked to be painted with blood. Various other trinkets made from the bones of humans adorned her naked firgue. The two giantesses shared a grin before walking slowly down from the treeline. A farmhouse exploded under a foot. A windmill that had ground flour for bread for centuries snapped like twigs before the feral giantess. The two shared a brief meal of sheep. Then the shepherd was ripped in half, his still wriggling torso crunched between teeth.<br>\r\nRaenok's men were getting more and more uneasy by the moment as they saw the true power of the giantesses. Fearing the men were about to desert, Raenok hefted his spear and yelled 'Charge!' The army swarmed across the plains towards the marauding women, who turned their attention to the threat. Both also charged forward, covering the half mile between them and the humans in seconds. The first of their steps landed on the front rows, shattering spears and flattening armored bodies without hesitation. Then they were in the midst of the crowd of humanity, and capable of simply gazing down and stomping them to a bloody paste. But the humans' spears were a painful nuisance, and could cause serious damage. The raven-haired giant circled the army, occasionally stomping down on groups if 10-12 men. The other, unconcerned for wounds, leapt into the heart of the army, flailing wildly. Her feet, her hands, any part of her became a deadly weapon. Dozens vanished beneath her soles, compacted beneath her enormous weight. Her hands sent some men flying through the air, or snatched them off the ground. She shoved them in her mouth and devoured them, spewing chunks of meat, bone, or even entire limbs from bloodstained lips. Sometimes they captives were smeared across her body, painting her whole form red.<br>\r\nThen, just as all seemed lost, the artillery in town opened up. Huge rocks hurtled through the air and smacked against the giantesses. They were forced backwards, and that's when the main force emerged from their cover in the trees, charging for the giants with ropes to entangle their feet. Both fell, catching a fair share of men beneath them. But the rest swarmed up their bodies, too fast for them to swat off or smash. Their tiny spears and swords cut through the raven-haired giantess's vulnerable throat and killed her. The other was better and fending them off, and fought like a demon, even using her chin to crush the men who got close to her vulnerable jugular. She managed to roll onto her chest, burying almost a full battalion beneath her body. She tore off the ropes entwined around her ankles, and struggled to her feet. Soaked in blood, she howled at the soldiers below her. But she'd suffered too many injuries and she knew it. Grabbing a last couple handfuls of warriors, she fled the battleground, stopping only to visit destruction on a cattle ranch.<br>\r\nAn eerie silence fell, broken only by the screams of the maimed. Many lay dead, torn to shreds or flattened, but the first attack had been fought off. Raenok hadn't been on either giantess, but he counted himself lucky to be alive. Putting aside his victorious euphoria, he turned his thoughts from the moment to winning the next battle.</span></div></div>",

They havn't even managed to take care of the wounded or to recover the dead - or what remained of them. Within minutes some men screamed warnings just before dozens of large bolders hit the army, thrown from behind the woods. A constant rain of rocks was tearing the army appart, scattering them and burying lots beneath. Then the screams of at least a dozen Women sent chills down the spines of the survivors. The voices even louder than the impacts of the stones. The constant rumble of the earth and the sounds from the falling stones mixed with the warcrys of the giantess' hid their very loud approach through the woods and before the men knew what happened five women, clothed in leather around their shins, feet and vulnurable bodyparts where running across the clearing. They had on thick sandals also made from leather. directly behind them where three other women carrying bags. They stopped behind the woods and threw handfulls of smaller stones at the terrified men. The low angle let them bounce over the earth, tearing off limbs and making the army fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaenok looked in shocked disbelieve at the upcoming slaughter. His Voice went unheard but almost every single one of his soldiers had the same thought: Retreat. The ones still able to run did so on horses or on foot. Most even dropped their weapon to gain speed just to get into the vast safety behind the high walls of the town. Raenok and his horse where one of the first to enter the village and immediatly he climbed the stairs of the gate to overview the battlefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archers on the walls had problems to aim as the rocks hitting the wall shook the entire structure and leaving big bruises but the wall stood firmly. \"For how long\", he thought. Helplessly he watched the armored Giantess' running over the first men lying on the ground, crushing their injured bodies into the ground and splattering their fragile bodies. Their goal was to reach the retreating men and there was nothing he could do but watch. </span></div></div>",

The steady stream of soldiers into the gates stipped as a sandal landed in front of it. The giantesses killed the men stuck outside as painfully as slowly as they wanted, and the townspeople could only watch. Night came and the screams died down as the last warriors were swalloed, chewed, crushed, of stuffed too far down orifices to be heard. The giantesses camped in the fields outside, some even draping their legs over the walls, and bragged of their vicious deed along with what they'd do in the morning. Townsfolk listened with terror, knowing nothing could be done to stop them.<br>\r\nIn the morning the giantesses awoke, smiling and excited for another day of butchery. They rubbed their stomachs while looking at the village, leaving nothing for the imagination. Finally, they began to advance on the town. But as the first women reached the walls, another sound could be heard. A mighty roar, followed by the sound of beating wings could be heard in the distance. The giant attackers paused, looking concerned. The cry was answered with dozens more, and more giantesses looked unsure. Then a shadow fell over the land. All the people, big and small, looked up and yelled with renewed terror. A dragon, as long as two of the tallest giantesses, flew overhead and blotted out the sun. From this beast came words, spoken with authority and immense power lying beneath each syllable.<br>\r\n\"You have broken ancient pacts, large ones. No doubt you know this will reopen old wounds, and ancient conflicts will begin again. These conflicts will not end as peacefully as before, so we have seen. You would be wise to leave.\" The dragon's voice didn't come from its mouth itself, but from the very space around the combatants, giving an impression of omnipresence. After a moment of doubt one giant stepped forward.<br>\r\n\"We fought your kind before, and we shall do so again. You now come to the aid of these humans, whose only place is beneath the feet of our kind. This is as clear an evidence of your decay as any I have ever seen, dragon.\"<br>\r\n\"So be it, children of the mountains,\" said the dragon. It lazily flew higher, uttering words in an ancient tongue. Slowly, more dragons began to appear. Though all were terrifying in size and appearance, none matched the original beast. All at once, the goantesses began to hurl boulders and trees at the circling dragons. In an instant, the largest dragon dove lightning fast at one of te rock hurlers, slamming them to the ground. Even her tremendous strength could keep the snapping jaws at bay, and soon she stoppef struggling as the life-force bled from her. After breathing a brief firestorm at other giantesses he flew off again. All around dragons burned, maimed, or ripped at the previously invincble women. In ten minutes at least a dozen lay dead, while only one dragon had fallen. The giantess had twisted its head backwards before snapping teeth could tear through leather and flesh like paper. </span></div></div>",

Then slid their remains down their hungry gullets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoom!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive foot stomped down before him.  Raenok turned and fell to the ground, his armor damaged and battered.  He started up at the blonde haired woman, perfect curves, lovely white panties and a white bra.  Her body was adorned like a high priestess, her scent was intoxicating.  She was a literal goddess.  If she were a normal sized woman, her proportions would be perfect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortal!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess boomed to Raenok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This. .  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hand and waved around the town.  Looking more carefully, Raenok noticed even more giants destroying people's homes and lives.  The army was behind him, every man and woman, dead.  Only he lived and the villagers that the giants tormented without end.  The terrified young man screamed a loud frightened scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was all thanks. . .to you!!  You worship us, you give us power!!  You try to resist your love for us, but I have felt your presence!!  I know your. . .desires!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaenok gulped, to afraid to even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess just smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, leave your village!!  Come, come and find me!!  I have a . . special place. . for you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaenok woke, sweat all around his face.  What a nightmare.  Yet, he felt compelled.  The giants had not officially made contact with anyone, only designating specific statements over an entire populous.  Could this have been some kind of specific contact?  Could this larger giantess be one of their leaders?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his quarters, Raenok went towards a small shop just outside of the barracks.  A lot of the men were stationed there, eating nearby and using some barrels as chairs.  He went inside, grabbed his rations and sat out with his fellow soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that the giants rape the last man until he dies.  They use him like. . like some kind of pleasure slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaenok turned towards the man with the dark brown beard.  He was a strong one, but a bit of a large belly on him.  Years and years of alcoholism will do that to a person.  He sat a bit away from him, near his friend Akakio.  A thin spry fellow with short brown hair, and a deadeye aim, Akakio was Raenok's loyal friend.  They made a great team, he leading up the front, while Akakio hunted his foes with a bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon, Peltan, you only wish that those beauties would give you pleasure.  Your better off visiting the whore houses then making up ridiculous stories!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men bolted out with nervous laughter, happy for a little joke about the matter, but still somewhat worried due to the incoming threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayat, a dark haired female mage, tugged at her purple robe a bit as the men laughed.  Raenok had always had a bit of a crush on her, when they worked together but he never said much of anything.  It was dangerous to get attached to someone during a war like this.  It was likely many of these people would be killed in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayat put the wooden plank that once held her food down besides the barrel she was sitting on.  She motioned towards Raenok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raenok 'as already seen the giants 'irsthand, he knows what they do in der towns.  And, I din't think gettin' it on wit' the giants will 'elp, wan't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men grew silent for a moment.  Peltan let out a loud hardy laugh as his belly shook and leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you are right, we won't even need to fight the giants, once they try and understand your foreign accent!! Ha ha ha!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others joined in, Raenok still silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone came running quickly towards the troops.  A messenger, and he looked really tired.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of them were a bit intimidated, due to the sheer height of such a monumental man.  Nicknamed, the \"Giant Killer\", their commander had killed more giants then most of the armies had.  He was one of the only humans that the giants referred to by his true name: Heron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent door opened and a seven foot giant stepped out of the tent, a full suit of black armor adorning his body.  Commander Heron handed a few more pieces of paper to the messenger who had brought them, and the messenger tore off like their was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, excellent!!  You have all arrived.  I have a special assignment for the five of you.  Word has it that. . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeltan stepped forward, his hand stretched towards their commander, a solemn expression on his face.  He moved slowly and timidly towards the commander to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh. . sir, uhh. . Commander, sir!!  I mean no disrespect but. . I am not the strongest or the. . well. . .fastest of the army.  If we are doing. . what I think we are doing. . .maybe it would be best. . . for a younger and . . faster recruit to . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Peltan could finish, Commander Heron rushed at Peltan and took his large greatsword off of his back.  Using the blunt side of it, he slammed it as hard as he could into Peltan's chest.  Peltan reactively reached out with it, his armored hands not stopping the force, but keeping the commander from pulling his weapon back towards himself.  Raenok was stunned.  Peltan had taken that blow head on and .  . he hadn't even flinched!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That . . .is why you are going on this mission, Peltan.  Your stamina is like no one else in the army.  I doubt even a giant's foot could crush you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his greatsword back, Commander Heron patted Peltan like a small boy pets a dog.  Peltan backed up and let the commander continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard rumors of a giantess that is taller than the rest.  She is some kind of magic user with great powers.  No one knows what she looks like or what her name is, but the rumor amongst the giants is she is known as the \"Bringer of Peace\".  An interesting title, considering we suspect she is the one who started this war in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumb took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. .  commander, I have heard rumors among the camps that you are leaving a sub commander in place of the army at this village and returning to the main castle.  Is this true?  You know that our village has no chance of survi. . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Heron slammed his sword into the ground.  Several other soldiers stopped their preparations and turned towards the large imposing man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM AWARE OF THE SITUATION!!!\"  Commander Heron belted out like an angry sailor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are indeed withdrawing to a more fortified situation but, we are doing this in an attempt to pull the giants away from the town.  Now, listen and no more interruptions.  We are sending you all in to find this leader giantess and destroy her.  Once you accomplish this task, the giants will be leaderless and defenseless against us.  This mission will determine the fate of mankind!!  I know, that you can do this!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But. . its our last mission, isn't it, Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkakio brushed his hair back a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once the leader is dead. . we are gonna get swarmed.  There won't be a rescue, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, the commander was quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It. . will be . . unlikely that you may all return, but not impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five all got quiet at this.

Before anything else can be said, a line in the ground splits the area up, breaking the surrounding tent and table.  Commander Heron, Peltan, and Thumb or stuck on the right side, Raenok, Akakio, and Mayat at the other.  A large, overweight giantess loomed overhead.  Raenok had never seen one of these before.  He had heard of such. . .beasts.  Shock Giantesses was their nickname by the other armies.  This one matched their description well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat giantess had short black hair and hundreds of metallic piercings all over its body.  As it tore its foot up and through the Commander's men, its piercings ripping through the men and shredded them to pieces!  In fact, you could see that the beast had adorned its fleshy body with the corpses of humans all over itself.  It was like looking at a living graveyard!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander pulled out his greatsword and slashed at some of its piercings by its foot.  The sword cut through both piercing, and the men attached to them, killing some in the process, but also making the giant's kicks a little less deadly.  Peltan launched himself towards one of the catapults. . he was planning to launch himself at the beast's head in an attempt to kill it.  Thumb, did what he did best, fought.  Pulling out his \"weapon\" which was really just his own hands, he targeted the fat giantess' overgrown foot now that the commander had removed the piercings.  He rushed forward and pulled out his spear to stab at one of her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Raenok stood helplessly on the other side of the crevasse, unable to assist the others.  He watched as the giant tore through men and savagely devoured them.  He imagined that he was those men, getting ripped to pieces by the giant and being unable to do anything to stop her.  Ignoring their attacks, he imagined himself smaller than even the men, getting crushed unknown by her simple stomps that shook the entire ground around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna paint a' pictur' of em or 'elp us fight?!\" Mayat shouted at him, snapping him to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayat put her staff to the ground, creating a floor of light, which Akakio had already used to move himself into a better position.  Bringing his sword up, Raenok realized that he needed to do the same.  He had to face his fear .. . and his desire.  Rushing over, he saw that the commander was tangled by the giant's large hanging stomach, which the giant had used to ensnare another number of men too.  He rushed over and the giant turned towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was paralyzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him and snarled, her giant mouth hungry and wanting to devour him whole!!  She reached down and lifted Raenok in the air, who immediately dropped his sword to the ground.  Raenok felt himself getting aroused as the giant's cavernous maw opened up, preparing to devour him whole!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaarrrrggggghhhhhh!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeltan flung through the air and slammed hard into the giant woman's left side of her face!!  He slammed his mighty axe into the piercings on her face and pushed them in further, causing the giant to yell out in pain.  She opened her hand, allowing Raenok an opportunity to escape.  Making a daring leap, Raenok grabbed onto the captain and yanked him free of his snare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he was freed, Akakio launched 5 volleys of trebuchet blasts right into the giantess.  Blood poured from the beast as she was still distracted by Peltan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling to her knees, the giantess let out a mighty screech. .  and died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha, did you see that!!  That was incredible!!\"  Peltan said, pulling his axe from the giantess' face.  He leaped back on the ground, a hearty grin as he looked for other wounded about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, there is no time!!  She was an advance troop, meant to slow us down while the main force arrives.  In the next 20 minutes, this entire village will be filled with giantess!!  We must flee to the castle, now!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayat looked at Raenok and the others.  She heard moaning as this one giantess sneak attack had disrupted about a fourth of the army.  Half of them, dead, the other half. . critically wounded.  She bent over towards one whose legs had been ripped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we 'an still 'elp these 'eople!!  You g't to let us try!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Heron shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The giants love to snack on us, humans.  Best to use them as bait for when the other giants arrive, then at least your village can take out a couple of them before the rest of you go down.  You had your orders. . .now go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Heron formed up with his men and began the march towards the castle.  Akakio walked towards Raenok, who was still disoriented due to his lack of fighting earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Rae?  You looked kinda shaky against that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaenok shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm. . I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five regrouped at the remains of the tent before making way.  Thumb was the first to make a little conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. . maybe. . .maybe we can stay here. . and fight first.  I mean. . .we did good now, we can probably. .  do good again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew all looked at each other, silently.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't an easy decision, but in the hands of Elan, Braegale, Charlee, and all the others, Raenok was sure that his hometown would survive.  It had too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ragtag team of misfits began their journey carefully through the Forest Keep.  The lands of the giants was dangerous, normal sized things were about as big as the beasts were.  Spiders, animal, and other monstrosities could destroy entire platoons of troops if not dealt with properly.  And here, they only had each other to rely on.  Raenok was most concerned.  As they traveled, his dreams continued. The giantess queen promised him happiness and a place by her side if she betrayed her allies.  He wondered if it was something he should bring up with his crew. </span></div></div>",

Blood, death and destruction where the main topics but it sounded so beautiful that he had to listen to the gruesome stories they told for a while. He thought about what he is about to do.

It was just pure curiosity and he turned his horse and followed the noises. It led him directly to the great lake. as he came closer he could hear women talking loud and the sounds of their laughter. They must be screaming. He saddled off and walked through the brushes towards the water too see what was going on there. Maybe see some naked ladies swimming. He smiled at that thought. With his hands he carefully scooped aside a bush and peered over the water and the plains surrounding it. What he saw let his jaw drop and his heart pound hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere where two women walking alongside the lake. They where far away but still he could see them clearly. They where talking with each other and laughing, making jokes. Both of them where as big as a castle, about 250 feet or more in height. They where barebreasted and where just wearing a small patched leather skirt. The rest of their body was naked except from some accesories they wore and a bag. Both of the blonde women where well trained and their features together with theyr heaven like faces made them the most beautiful women he had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left one pointed onto something in front of them towards the ground. Raenok was so distracted that he havn't seen the tents and waggons standing near the two giant women. The circus on his way to its destination. The two smiled broadly. A cute, innocent smile as they sped up their pace and walked directly towards the small camp. It took them about 15 seconds to reach the circus and one of them crouched down and sayed something in a strange language. From his point he could see seven people running into the opposite direction from the camp. Others tried to run away from the water. The still standing giantess watched them with her arms folded in front of her chest and slowly started to circle the tents. What would he give to be in there right now. Watching these beauties from that near and even maybe talk to them. He wouldn't dare to ask them out but he could manage to talk to them. Even the next few seconds didn't change his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking around the camp a waggon simply vanished into the soft soil beneath her foot with a loud crack and an animal roar. She didn't look down but still stared at the fleeing people in front of her. She was just a few steps behind as he saw the other one grab something and stuffed it into her mouth. Then she stood up and lifted her foot into the air just to slamm it down hard onto something not visible for him. The other giantess had reached the running people which came towards him. They heard their screams of panik but still was fascinated by theyr pursuer. The thought of helping didn't even occure as he watched the beauty having her gruesome fun. The slowest of them was simply trodden on as she walked. His screams of horror cut short as her foot settled. Her following step was so close to one of them that he stumbled and fell. She stood still watching the man struggle for his balance. He stayed on his feet just turned around as he was engulfed in shadows. The women had tilted her foot resting the hell on the ground and letting the sole float over his head lowering slowly. The man gave up to run and cowered on the ground, protecting his face with his arms. Useless as the women pressed down smashing the man. The other giantess was still stomping around and smashing everything beneath her foot. The big tent was nothing more than a small cloth beneath her foot. The third running man was kicked away by her immense ped and flew over the ground. He hit it several times before he lay still on the ground. Then she sped up her pace. She walked past everyone of them towards the fastest maybe 300 ft away from you. She leapt into the air from her running stride and landed right ontop of him, splattering his body around. Raenok had to fight the urge to jump out and run to her feet to give her skin a kiss. He just stood there and watched the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir way cut off, the three men sprinted into the other direction. All of them where trampled as she walked back to her friend who was still stepping on everything that moves in a playful matter. </span></div></div>",

The slightly smaller one cracked open a cart and dropped its contents into her mouth. Raenok could not see what it was but it looked like some sheeps. It didn't matter because as soon as they finished their business they walked towards his hiding space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the light tremor of their steps growing stronger as they casually walked towards him. Fascinated he watched how their body moved gracefully with every motion, how their boobs where wobbling with every stride. Their long legs growing even longer as they moved closerand now he could also see their horrifieing feet, crusted with dirt, flattening everything in their path. Brushes and trees simply vanished with an awful dying sound as the living plants beeing forced into the ground without a further notice. Even rocks crumbled beneath them as they moved. Nothing could withstand their weight although they didn't seem that heavy. They walked right to the border of the woods, the trees just reaching above their ankles. Finally they where close enough that the trees blocked out almost their complete bodies. Only parts of their feet where visible.</span></div></div>",

We must concoct a plan if we are to have the slightest chance at victory. Leave now, and your demise will be certain!\" Braegale paused and slowly turned around and returned next to her sister. \"Excellent. Now, time is of the essence. We must devise a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlee continued. \"Due to the emmense destructive power, nothing short of divine intervention can last through even one of these beasts. As Elan stated, the chances of the village surviving this siege approaches zero.\" Murmurs of panic filled the dining hall. \"However,\" Charlee finished, \"There is a chance we can convince them to leave on their own accord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible!\" Braegale exclaimed. \"These beasts laugh at reason! You said yourself, these monsters show no mercy or compassion to beings smaller than themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Her sister, Landrea spoke up more timidly, \"maybe we can send someone like Charlee, or Raenok, or somebody to see why the giants have left their homes. Maybe something else invaded their own home, and they need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a brilliant idea!\" Braegale shouted sarcastically. \"And after we save the giants' realm, Charlee and Raenok can take Elan, find an androgynous elf, a dendrophobic dwarf, and a sociopathic halfling, and defeat the evil lich Xykon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandrea didn't follow. \"First giants, now a lich? That sounds like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fool! There is no such thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandrea shrunk in her seat in embarrassment. \"Right. I mean, what kind of name is Xykon, anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElan interrupted them both. \"Enough. Both those ideas have some merit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlee said, \"What Braegale says is true. Alone, we do not stand a chance, but if we summon powerful help, we can possibly successfully repel the invasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraegale stood up. \"This is exactly what I have been trying to say since the beginning! These monsters will never listen to reason, so force is the only way! If you fools need me, I will be famed as the first human who has sucessfully slayed a giant!\" Braegale slammed open the door, letting the cold wind howl into the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandrea ran after her sister. \"Braegale, don't go! You'll never make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her.\" Elan said. \"If she wishes to go, then let her. We can only pray for her safe return.\" Landrea sat down, nervous. She didn't want to dwell on what would happen to her sister, lest her dark secret be revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlee continued. \"The only problem is, summoning and divine spells aside, the only place with help powerful enough would be at Mistrall Castle Town, a week's journey. A party sent there and back will never make it before the village is destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe one of those heroes or adventure parties roaming the kingdom we've heard tales of will aid us.\" Raenok stated. \"Surely they could be equipped enough to take on a giantess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be true, but I highly doubt that one will be coming through these doors any time soon.\" A pause filled the air as if everyone was waiting for something, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the very least we can warn others that they are coming!\" Raenok continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will not be made an example!\" Elan rose his voice. \"We will find a way to conquer this foe without hiding like mice!\" Raenok bowed his head as an apology. \"Now, Landrea, did you not have an idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandrea was shocked. \"Um. I said, um... maybe they're in trouble and they need help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does seem plausible. The giants have lived in their northern lands for generations. Surely they must have some reason they left their ancestral homes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hate to see something that would drive off a giantess...\" Raenok was deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have no better options.\" Elan said downhearted. \"Charlee, you will take Raenok and Landrea and try to find out why these beasts have left their homes, all our mages will research the most powerful summoning spells they can muster, while the rest of us will do our best to fortify the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\" Charlee shouted. \"Y-Y-You can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, Charlee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Charlee swallowed deeply. \"But, you don't know what I've been through to get that information I just got. I have seen our own kind have the life stomped out of them, and others swallowed alive and whole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlee, you must be brave. You are our most talented archer, and are a master of stealth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but even I had barely escaped with my life! Surely there must be another way!\"</span></div></div>",
