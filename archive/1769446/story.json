He's made few friends around the office, usually because he is more focused on his job than his office mates. He stands five foot, ten inches tall and is exceptionally lightly built, the consequence of forgetting to eat while programming more than any sort of diet or exorcize regimen. He keeps his long brown hair in a pony tail and wears light prescription glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Susan Hobs</b>: Susan is brand new to the company, having started this summer as an intern fresh out of college. Many speculate that the bubbly blond, former cheer leader, only gained the coveted internship because of her stunning good looks. Despite the stereotype Susan (never Sue) is dedicated and hardworking, very eager to make a good start with the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tom Syler</b>: Tom is good at his job. Very good. He's been one of the top sales in the company for years, and he enjoys reaping the rewards of it. Tom is a 'man's man,' enthusiastic about playing sports as he is about watching them. He dominates on the basketball court, using his six foot, three inch well muscled frame to full advantage. His only passion that's greater than the love of sales and driving a hard bargain is his love of chasing ladies and driving them home in his sports car. Tom isn't one for long term relationships, but at twenty seven, he isn't looking for love and he's at least honest about that when he brings home his many one night stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily Calaway</b>: Emily is a very newly minted assistant manager. She's worked hard to get where she is, rising up through the ranks of the secretarial pool. She's just finished her own degree, perused entirely by taking night classes while working full time. Her night studies have left her soft in several places with a spreading middle and sagging ass. The same night schedule has also left her socially isolated with neither boyfriend or work colleagues to spend time with outside of work. Still, she's determined to get back on track, if she could just figure out how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Heather Rand (Payroll)</b>: Heather is the senior manager in charge of the payroll department. She rules her minions with an iron fist, though an iron fist that's usually clutching a doughnut or candy bar. Her immense frame is soft and doughy, and her eyes peer out from behind thick heavy lenses. At nearly fifty years of age she has nothing in her life besides her work, and her own hefty daughter having been left by her husband more than a decade ago. Her daughter recently applied for the internship program, but was turned down in favor of Susan Hobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alan Summers (Product Development)</b>: Alan has been the company's idea man for nearly twenty years, always chasing the next innovative product for the company and seldom slowed down by morals or ethics in his pursuit. Several of the company's most successful products are based on his patents and research, leaving him wealthy enough to walk away from the job if he ever needed to, however he sees no reason to leave a job that lets him give his creative talents free range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tanya Huff (Human Resources)</b>: Tanya rose through the ranks like a rocket, propelled by a ruthless ambition and a stunning body. She's never been afraid to leverage her good looks and sizable endowments to any advantage she's needed. Tom Syler has often called her 'The Moon' because, in his words 'she might be unattainable to mere mortals, but if one of us ever lands her, he'll be a hero forever.' Tanya sets her sights higher, but is ruthless in her treatment of anyone who gets in her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mat Hardy (General Manager)</b>: Little happens at the company that Mat is not aware of. Having worked his way through the ranks, Mat enjoys every benefit of his position, weather that's company car, comped travel, or his choice of prettiest secretary from the pool. His shrewd business sense has propelled the company to new levels of profitability. While the senior executives know that he's a bit of a sleaze around the office, no one is interested in losing the results he gets, so they let his many infractions slide. </span></div></div>",

Susan was more qualified than your daughter was, besides,  your daughter would be a health liability to the company with her size that is. What a shocker she didn't get hired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other women Heather had been chatting with had disappeared and it was just you two.

Heather come on now I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's eyes glow and she says something in a strange language and then she speaks to you, \"Mark you will pay for what you have said. You will see what it is like for bigger women in the work place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets you go and you feel weak and small compared to her and say, \"I.. I'm sorry for what I said Ms Rand...

Little do you know that you have allready made an enemy of the most powerful woman in the office. As you polish off your dinner for the evening shower and get ready for bed you are unaware that there are powerful forces at work on you. The curse Ms Rand has placed on you is a slow acting one but potent, down to a physiological level. As you sleep that night you dream of strange forces. At the moment you can't quite make them out but you dream food and gluttony, curves and femminity as the curse reaches its apex these images will grow stronger in your unconcious dream state. Your body is changing in invisible but signifigant ways, your body is shutting down in production of testosterone and its receptors, your libido and genitals will remain in tact but all the other implied changes will slowly take their toll as estrogen levels rise. The shift in where your body will store its fat, the breast development, the softening of features, all the whle your metabolism is slowing down and your appetite will begin to spike. You will be helpless as you fight your growing appettite and take in more calories all the while unaware your body wil be slowly storing them up in a nice soft layer of adipose fat around you thighs, hips and esspecially your ass, even your tummy and your breast will be soaking up all the calories you take in.</span></div></div>",

Your stomach rumbled audibly at you for reasons you could'nt quite understand which finnally woke you from your tranquil dream state. For the past week it had been a fight with your subconscious to get out of bed every morning. You had banked your hopes on a relaxing weekend of lazing around the house to restore you're lost vigor but so far that did not seem to be the case. <br>\r\nYou absent mindedly scratched you belly as you made your way to the kitchen. Normally you would do your shave and shower routine first but on this day getting something inside you stomach was top priority. Which was odd considering you had been careful to eat a full portion of dinner last night. Normally some kind of fruit or healthy cereal would be top choice for breakfast but over the last week you had been waking up later and later and seemed more and more fatigued at the end of the day and preparing a healthy meal was just to much time and energy to invest  and you had resigned your self to buying some \"easier\" things to keep around the house when you got hungry. Which seemed to be more frequently then you remembered. You grabbed a \"BIG\" bowl of your favorite sugary cereal and through some microwave waffles with some left over fried chicken from sunday nights dinner. They were'nt very good but you found a liberal application of whipped cream and Mrs. Buttersworth made them pretty good. Lately that would be all you needed for breakfast but today you could'nt even wait for the 3 minute microwave timer to go off so you doubled up on breakfast and killed a LARGE bowl of cereal while you waited for your main course. <br>\r\nAs you picked the last peice of syrupy sweet chicken off the bone and gulped down your last of your glass of whole milk your body rewarded you with an addictive blast of endorphins as it got to work turning those calories into a nice layer of fat. Fat it knew just what to do with, at the moment you had the hormones of a young girl just about to bud through puberty coursing through your veins and your confused body was making up for lost time.<br>\r\nYou did'nt notice it as you showered, or even as you shaved and dressed but you had lost a substantial amount of muscle mass for so short a period of time what had replaced it was about 5 pounds of pliable bouyant fatty tissue.</span></div></div>",

You cursed inwardly at the 1/2 hour of the work week that remained. For today was friday and you were just ready for this week to be over. You never imagined this job would be so demanding physically you spent more time sitting so you thought you would have more energy but so far the opposite seemed to be true. You now had a later start time so you were allready getting an extra hour of sleep but you had taken to napping as soon as you got off immediately following your \"snack\". You had called it a snack allthough really it was more like a second lunch. It had even become a struggle to even stay awake during your lunch hour after the large quantities of fast food you had begun ingesting.<br>\r\nYour stomach growled audibly breaking you out of your mindless reverie and reminding you why you were in such a rush to get out of here and get something to eat. You reflected on the meal you had for lunch at the local italian restaurant some kind of alfredo dish with lots of cheese. It was as delicous as it was laden with carbs and fat. You decided a power bar would resotre your energy for the last 1/2 hour of work and hopefully carry you through some gym time since you had'nt gone all week or even thought of going last week. Which you considered acceptable considering you'r new responsiblities at work all though in all honesty you had no additional PHYSICAL obstacles to keeping up your regimen.<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you the lack of energy you were experiencing was entirely unrelated to work. Powerful magicks had brought your metablosim to steadily declining turtle's pace. And your lack of testoterone had done you no favors in that regard either. It had however done you the favor of turning your now almost tripled caloring intake into an additional 5 pounds or pure fat leaving you at a 10lb gain in less then 2 weeks, Half of which had stealthily disperssed it self among you almost noticibly softer physique while anyone paying carefull attention would notice the other 5 lingering on your slightly rounded posterior. Your boxer and pants still fit comfortably, so you had'nt even noticed that you n longer possessed the muscular dimples on either side traditional of hard masculine ass. It had yet to take on the feminine contours the dark magicks had destined it too but your confused body was running out of room down there to stuff your fat cells with out some further adjustments to your wieght distribution.</span></div></div>",

The new position had suddenly ramped up in difficutly these past 3day and you were allready feeling drained on a wednesday. You had been so busy today you didn't even have time to take a full lunch and as such you didn't get to go to any of your favorite restaurants in the area even tho the list seemed to be constantly growing. You had tried to compensate by doubling up on fast food lunches deserts and all but by the end of the day your stomach was feeling like it was on \"E\". You had decided to steal some of the left over donuts and munch on those in the car on your way to the grocery store but they did very little to satiate your hunger. You knew you were low on groceries so you decided to stop and pick some up on the way home so you could just crash when you got there and the gym was right out of the question,<br>\r\nBeside your mind numbing hunger you had a second reason for wanting to quickly escape the grocery store and it was nestled quite uncomfortably in between your cheeks. Your underwear had been uncomfortable all day. Being out of clean boxers this morning you decided to wear an older pair of tighty whities that you now assumed were to small but in reality were bigger then you boxers or boxer briefs. You attributed that to your constant wedgies all day but the truth of the matter was the past couple of days saw you bottom becoming quite a good deal rounder. You were unaware that you had gained another five pounds bring the total up to 15 and the last five had gone straight to your ass, as they say. Only your case it was literal. Your ass was indeed quite round and quite feminine up under you male work pants which were now to tight on you. The pants served to mask what was going on underneath as well as holding things in place as you had only recently passed the tipping point where your booty had just the slightest hint of jiggle to it when you walked, but it was kept in check by you tight pants, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://followgram.me/i/638315584_18937556\" target=\"_blank\">http://followgram.me/i/638315584_1893755...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid for you groceries and made you way to your car trying to do the shuffle to get your under wear out of your ass but it was held firmly in place. You had stocked up on snacks and couldnt wait to get home to have a few well maybe more then a few. Your stomach rumbled audibly at the thought voicing its approval and you rubbed a quick two circles around it with your open hand in agreement pausing only for a second to consider what a weird gesture that had been.</span></div></div>",

Esspecially since she was being extra cordial today, almost nice even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well follow me\" she said looking you up and down as she did almost as if she was assessing your physique. You began walking behind her with a box of your stuff in hand you were follwing her to the new office your promotion had afforded you. There had been some delay in getting it ready apparently Heather's daughter had been using it and you had to wait it out at a cubicle down stairs while she was relocated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you find there clothes or other personal affect simply give me a call and I'll have some one retrieve them and donate the clothes\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou remained silent the rest of the trip as she prattled on about business only half listening as you were tired. It was Monday now and you had spent all weekend in your most comfy pair of sweats eating your favorite snacks and watching netflix. A Long overdue time of relaxation you thought. You had watched a vareity of movies but surprisingly the romantic comedies had really touched you this time around which was odd as they never had before. The curse had completely changed your biology and your testicles had done a 180 and were now producing an alarming amount of estrogen and Oestrogen in affect they had become like ovaries the changes to your physiology were starting to make themselves apparent. you had gained whooping 10 pounds in 5 days and it had spead evenly through out a nice layer of adipose around your body rounding out your shoulders, bubbleing out your butt and overall softening you physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked behing Heather watching as her massive round check ungulated up and down as her hips swung tooo and fro almost hypnotically. Anyone walking behind you might have noticed a much less sigifigant jiggle but a decidedly feminine jiggle non the less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later heather was making her departure and you were for the first time left alone your new corner office. The first thing you did was sit down in your new designer chair. As your hips and thighs spread out just a little. Ooooo thats comfy you thought as you made a note of the extra cushioning in the chair that really was'nt in the chair at all but in the extra 25 pounds you were now carrying on your frame. After eating half of the donuts Heather had left you as a welcoming gift with a sort of weird smile and the odd comment of \"these are my daughters favorite I think you'll like them\" You decided to have a look around.</span></div></div>",

Today was an important day for your career as you were giving out quarterly reviews and you were running late. While you had managed to wake up on your alarm clocks first ring 2 hours before you had to be to work, a few misteps in time management had you pulling up to work with only 15 minutes to get to your office and get setup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had managed to shower on time but you got held up at breakfast over estimating how much extra time you had allotted yourself and deciding to treat your self to a full on \"chocolate chip pancake jamboree\" which wasted about 45 minutes of your extra time. You might still have made it on time but getting dressed was much slower then your usual 15 minutes. You see in the 2 weeks passed you still had not made it to the gym and your indulgence had had quite an affect on the fit of your pants. While you had grown accustomed to the constant wedgies your now constantly stretched out misshapen boxer were giving you, your work pants had much been much less accommodating. You spent and extra minutes twisting and squeezing and pinching and contorting your way into them only succeeding when you used the decidedly feminine tactic of laying on your bed and sucking in your gut to get them buttoned. And a gut it was indeed, the last 2 weeks saw consistent gains netting you an extra 12 pounds of flab. Your belly was no longer simply a softend pudge but had finally graduated to what would be described as a smallish but rounded belly. It bubbled over your wait band when you sat down and everything. While it wasn't your most prominent feature it was noticeable.

You went white in the face you knew what it was but you had to look in the highly reflective tinted windows of the buildings entry way to confirm. You had split your pant clean down the ass crack. Your mind raced you couldn't conduct quarterlies with your ass hanging out. While a slimmer man would only be exposing his undershorts to the world, your colossus of a butt had swallowed the boxers whole and asked for seconds leaving you with a sort of plaid thong look going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind raced. You only had 12 minutes left before your 1st appointment would be arriving. You couldn't make it into a store to buy new pants and you certainly couldn't make it home. You felt you guts bubbling up. Why hadn't you kept extra pants in your office like the Zaftig younger Rand.....That's it! you almost yelled aloud as it dawned on you. You had grown so ravenous and lazy in your post work routine had never bothered to remove her box of crap from the back of your car if you could find a pair of her pants that matched your top closely enough you could pull this off and keep up your steady climb up the corporate ladder......</span></div></div>",

He'd already left behind the comfortable world of his cubicle and descended past the mechanical rooms, the elevator maintenance area and was down two flights of stairs on a level that couldn't be reached by elevator. It didn't help that the pipes would unexpectedly ping or that a valve would release a hiss of steam at seemingly random intervals, startling Mark and leaving him on edge. At long last, Mark arrived at a secured door leading to the R&amp;D section often referred to as 'The Summer's Zone' by employees, though officially the area was listed as 'Special Projects.' Swiping his badge in the reader, Mark was relieved to move from dimly lit sub-basement maze to a well lit, highly polished lab hallway. Two minutes after that, he found himself in Alan Summer's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mark, good morning,\" Alan greeted warmly, stepping around his desk and brushing bagel crumbs off his white lab coat as he came to shake Mark's hand. \"I'm glad you made it down here in one piece. Didn't get lost did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir, the directions in your e-mail were very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good good,\" the older man continued, running a hand through his short, graying hair as he gathered his thoughts. \"Well Mark, I'm glad you made it down here, we've got a great deal of work to do. Now, before we get started, there are some basics that I'm going to go over with you so that you understand exactly where you're at and at least a little bit of what's going to happen next. A great deal is still to be decided, and your performance on this project will be key to your career here at CGMDI, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" Mark said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then the first thing you should know is that you will not be returning to your desk and your current assignment for quite some time.  You may return to the world of programming at some point along the way, but for now, you're re-assigned as one of my personal assistants. I don't think there's any kind of raise that goes with that, but if it pays less, I'll tell payroll to let you keep your current rate. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's fine, but what about the projects I was working on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll come back to that in a moment son, why don't you come with me into the lab and we can get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, Alan's lab was filled with computer systems and mechanical devices the purposes of which Mark could not begin to imagine. Also waiting in the lab was a very cute looking young woman who's name tag read 'Susan Hobs, Intern.' Evidently, Mark wasn't the only one who had drawn the short straw here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mark, this is Susan, she's going to be...\" </span></div></div>",

Finally, Summers threw a switch sending a wave of current over both subjects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's vision went dark, or maybe it was the room itself going black... when light returned: </span></div></div>",

A few last tweaks ensured that neither of them would forget who they really were, though their memories of growing up may be a bit scattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the simulator, Susan woke first, running a hand through her long blonde hair and dragging it out of her face to blink blearily at the screen. \"Ugh... I fell asleep coding again,\" she mumbled. \"I must have forgotten to eat today. Mark?\" She asked, looking at the slumped form of the intern at a nearby desk. She knew there was some reason that he should be more important than just the new company intern... he was a bit old for the job, but she couldn't put a finger on what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Susan,\" Mark said, shaking off the tired feeling and trying to focus. He couldn't remember what task had sent him off to the programmer's office but he must have fallen asleep by accident. He remembered Susan talking about something called a for-each loop and iteration... whatever it was, it was obviously boring enough to have put him to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should head back down to Mr. Summers' office Mark,\" Susan said as she prepared to go to the break room in search of a large bottle of Mt. Dew and something sugary. Or cheesy... or both. She just felt so drained. \"If he needs something else from up here, he can send you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Susan,\" Mark said, gathering himself up and looking about for his purse before he remembered that he was carrying everything in his back pocket wallet. Turning away from the row of computers and the office of the programmer, Mark headed for the door, knowing he had to get back to Mr. Summers and that it was very important to talk to the researcher, but still very unsure why. </span></div></div>",

So, while she can go do your job, every bit as well as you did, you are now completely free to stay down here and work as my assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mr. Summers,\" Susan asked, still sifting through her new knowledge. \"If his brain is a hard drive, why not just copy the information? It seems like you did a move rather than copy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ms. Hobs, in a sense that's accurate. In this case though, it's because I don't have a <i>read / write</i> head for the human brain. One locus serves as the 'read' but in the process of reading, destroys the data. The other locus can 'write' but cannot truly read anything in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Susan said, reaching up unconsciously to adjust glasses she didn't wear. \"So, once you have 'read' the data from his brain, couldn't you copy while it's in 'RAM' and write to both brains? Or does it have to read and write to the other brain at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sat stunned at the petite blonde having this technical conversation with Mr. Summers. Deep down, Mark knew he should be able to follow the conversation... but it seemed overly technical. He felt like he could get a grasp on it all if they would just use a few pictures, or diagrams... or maybe less technical jargon.... but try as he would, he just couldn't grasp the concepts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human brain stores an immense amount of data Ms. Hobs, there's no way my computer could store it all for replication, at least at the moment. I'm sure the company would love me to find a way to do that, but.... Look at me prattling on. Poor Mark here looks like he's feeling a bit overwhelmed. Ms. Hobs, why don't you get to work, I trust you remember the way to Mark's old cube?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I do.

You have no idea why you've been called to the General Manager's office. You've done your best to go unnoticed. You've done your job well, but not too well that you'd be a threat to anyone. Mat gets up and walks around you. \"Not bad, you should work out just fine, you're the right build. You just need some adjustments in the right places\", Mat comments. Confused you ask, \"What would I work out fine for?\" \"My new secretary\", he states flatly. Confused you say, \"Secretary? Sir, with all due respect I'm a programmer, sir. I'm sure that the pool has plenty of well qualified secretaries that have the proper training.\" Mat sits back at his desk and laughs, \"Oh they have plenty in the pool that are well qualified, but they are lacking qualities that you have.\" You stand there silent and confused. From the stories you've heard the only qualities Mat is only interested if they're hot and they put out. You just then have a horrifying though, \"What if he swings both ways.\" The way he's looking at you suddenly takes on a different meaning. \"Listen Mark, I like you and I want you. Come to work as my secretary and I will make it worth your while. I'm offering you twice your current salary plus a wardrobe allowance. You'll need new clothes. I can also throw in stock options, company car, and a retirement plan, not gold level, but good. I will of course need you on call 24hours a day 7 days a week\", he says. You consider what he's offering. It's incredibly, but your imagination brings up disturbing images of what you might have to do to earn that position. It also brings up images of everything you could use the additional money on. \"Well let's hear it, Mark. Is it yes or no\", he says?</span></div></div>",

Last night had been an exception though. His old boss Roy Johnson was retiring and was having drinks. Roy taught Tom everything he new and even at only 27 he was tipped to replace him. Roy was a scotch man and despite Tom's best efforts to refuse, they had shared the best part of a bottle before Roy had left to meet his gorgeous trophy wife Melissa. Tom couldn't remember much after that, he vaguely remembered chatting to Tanya Huff from HR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I talking to her about though?\" He tried to remember as he showered.

Tom didn't the faintest idea what he was talking about. \"Did I score last night?\" That wouldn't be unusual for Tom, his confidence, great body and good looks made him a hit with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls in question was sitting at reception. A cute little red-head in her early twenties called Annie. Man that had been a mistake, after two hot nights she acted like they were engaged. Tom had let her down gently \"It's not you, it's me, etc\", but she still had cried for the best part of a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any packages for me Annie? I'm expecting a file to be delivered?\" he asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What it is? A heart?\" She asked acidly. Man she was even frostier than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Don't worry about it\" Tom mumbled and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you made an even bigger idiot of yourself than normal last night?\" she called after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, do you know I actually did?\" Tom asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I left early. But the word is you upset some of the management\" She said with a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to his desk Tom was a little concerned. \"What the hell did I do last night?!\" he tried to remember, out of the fog of alcohol he remembered someone telling him to go home and calling a cab. \"Shit!\" The last thing Tom wanted to do was upset his promotion chances. Then again he was the company Golden Boy, they needed him more than he needed them. It would be a slap on the wrists and warning about drinking at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's thoughts were interrupted by Roy's secretary, a hot brunette in her late thirties called Jan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Tom-Tom!\" she said in a sing song voice. Another notch of Tom's bed-post. This one was one of his favourites, even if she was 10 years older. They had spent a good few nights together here and there. But then again she had bedded most of the good looking men in office. Tom felt sorry for her husband but man was he glad he was inheriting such a \"hospitable\" PA from Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jan. Any messages?\" Tom asked with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that bitch Tanya Huff from wants to see you right away\" Jan replied with the venom that only a woman talking about competition can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm do you know why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea Hun. I guess it will be about your new position \"over me\"!\" She said in a mock-sexy voice and licking her top lip before laughing and walking to her desk. Man he couldn't wait for those first business trips away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Tom was sitting on the other side of the desk to the hottest girl in company. Blonde, well endowed, stunning legs, face of  supermodel and heart of pure stone. \"Mr Lyler do you know why I called you here?\" Tanya Huff asked with perfectly glossed lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume to discuss my knew position?\" Tom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smiled, in not a pleasant fashion \" You don't remember last night do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I was kinda drunk, I hope I didn't do anything stupid?\" Tom asked with panic growing in the pit of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mr Sylar you could say that\" Tanya says icily and shifts position. The movement of her breasts suddenly brings back Tom's memories of last night in perfect recall. Drunkenly prepositioning Tanya, promising her promotion when Tom got his and then, when she calmly refused, grabbing those glorious breasts in drunken lust before someone pulled him off and sent him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...Tanya...Miss Huff....I'm so sorry....I never get that drunk. Please you have to accept my apologies.\" Tom pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to accept anything from you\" Tanya said in sudden anger \"You have any idea what its like for a woman to make it in the city? The last thing I needed was you embarrassing me in front of my colleagues! In front of my own team! Well now your going to pay Tom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being sacked.......Bullshit, you don't have the authority. This company would never let me go. They know the competition would snap me up!\" Tom yelled defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have the authority alright. After last night a lot of people feel your a liability, an expensive liability. And Tom, its difficult to get \"snapped up\" with a sexual harassment charge on your record.\" Tanya responded smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't!\" Tom said with less conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No your right I wouldn't. This is a man's industry and you would find a way to weasel out of it. You and that old lecherous bastard Roy Johnson would cook something up. No I have a better punishment lined up for you\" She says, he eyes suddenly glowing.....</span></div></div>",

Tom\u2019s heart pounded in his ears and he tried to run for the door, but he found that try as he might, he couldn\u2019t even move his pinky. \u201cWha\u2026 what\u2019s going on!? Tanya, is this some sort of trick?\u201d he stammered out. \u201cNo, Tom, this isn\u2019t a trick. You messed with the wrong girl for the very last time. Now you will see the world from a Very different perspective and you will know the pain and anguish you have caused others,\u201d she said, walking around her desk towards Tom, as the lights flickered and dimmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have powers you can scarcely imagine, you miserable letch,\u201d she said, blue lightning escaping her fingers over everything she touched. \u201cPlease, Tanya, I said I\u2019m sorry, I truly am. I was drunk, I was  fool, I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you! I swear!\u201d Tom pleaded hysterically. Tanya laugh with pure contempt, \u201cEven if I believed you, I\u2019m tired of men like you thinking they can treat me like you have some right to my body! If you want it so badly, you can have it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! What do you \u2026\u201d Tom started to say, but before he could finish lightning poured from Tanya\u2019s fingers and hit him square in the chest. The world went dark and Tom felt and indescribably strange sensation, like something within him was being pulled and stretched and somehow squeezed at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Tom just heard a muffled voice that he couldn\u2019t understand, then he felt a hand smacking his cheeks, \u201cWakey, wakey, sleeping beauty!\u201d said a strangely familiar voice. \u201cWhu\u2026 what? Huh?\u201d he said, fighting to open his eyes. What he saw startled him awake, it was himself somehow standing over him. \u201cAm I dead?\u201d he asked, noticing for the first time how off his voice sounded. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not dead, in fact you could say you have a new lease on life,\u201d said his doppelganger. Tom looked around and noticed that he was in Tanya Huff\u2019s office, suddenly the memory of what he\u2019d seen before blacking out came rushing in and he jolted up, instantly feeling extremely strange. He looked down and was horrified to see a pair of bountiful breast jostling inside the same exact skirt suit top Tanya had been wearing. \u201cWhat have you done to me?!\u201d he asked, his hands flying all over his new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should be obvious, even for a halfwit like you. I\u2019ve swapped our bodies. Our bodies and lives to be precise. You are now Tanya Huff, and I am Tom Sylar, soon to be head of this company,\u201d she, now he, explained with a Cheshire-grin. \u201cBut, but, you can\u2019t, this is not possible! How \u2026?\u201d he stammered, looking around as if somehow he would find a way to get out of his predicament in sparse office d\u00e9cor. \u201cHow? I\u2019m a witch, well a warlock now, to be fair. Now you will be the one who will deal with men leering at you, of everyone whispering stories about some fantasized dalliance with the boss to get ahead. Although, to be fair, it\u2019s up to you if you want to be the office slut, it\u2019s your life now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s eyes looked like they were about to pop out of his new blonde head. \u201cNow, \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom flipped the file open, inside was the profile of a 21 year old woman called rather amusingly Kirsty Melons, who was apparently the companies newest Junior Admin Assistant, effectively the lowest position in the company, good for making coffee, photo copying and answering phones (as long as they weren't important phone calls). Although from the girl's file she appeared to be under qualified, having flunked out of high school and worked an number of low income jobs: assistant at a nail bar, Hooters waitress and her last role as an \"entertainer\" at a lap dancing club called \"Secrets\". Tom had been to that club many times with clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What this? You want me to meet this girl or something?\" he asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way Mr Sylar\" she said and snapped her fingers again. \"Take another look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked down at the file but couldn't see anything new. And then he noticed his fingers holding the file. They were now much more slender and sporting half inch manicured nails painted pink. Dropping the file to look at his hands, he felt a jiggle on his chest and looked down to see two huge tits barely held back by a low cut pink top as long honey blonde hair framed his view. Grabbing his new assets, Tom jumped up out the chair only to wobble on a pair of five inch white open toe pumps with a half inch platform sole and full back into the chair with a girly squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell have you done to me!\" Tom squealed and grabbed his mouth at the sound of his now high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was laughing so hard at him she could barely talk. \"Oh Tom... your face..... Why don't you see for yourself...\" She snapped her finger again and a large dress mirror appeared next Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom turned to the mirror and slowly stood up, wobbling on his new footwear. He watched the girl in the mirror do the same. Her long straight honey blonde hair flowed down over her shoulders and had a few streaks of platinum blonde tints. The hair framed a pretty, if heavily made up, face with full lips covered in wet shiny pink gloss. Two huge silver hoop earrings hung from her ears. She was wearing a white skirt  and jacket over the pink halter neck holding back those huge, clearly fake tits. They must have been at least DD cup, but on her tiny frame they looked even bigger. Nestled just above the mouth-watering cleavage was a gold pendent that spelt the word \"Sexy\". The skirt barely reached mid-thigh of her tanned legs that ended in the sluttiest footwear Tom had seen in this office. Beneath the skirt Tom could feel the nauseating pull of a thong nestling in his now tight peachy behind and in some very different anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya come and stood behind the new girl as her mouth worked in shock. Tom noticed that he was now at least five inches shorter than her, even with the heels on. Without his humiliating shoes he doubted that he would even reach 5 foot. \"Please...\" he squeaked \"I've learned my lesson, turn me back. I'll leave the company. I'll give you all my money. Anything, just turn me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not Miss Melons\" Tanya said using his new humiliating name. \"For years you've galavanted around this company using your charm and connections to get where you wanted to be and who ever you wanted into your bed. Well now I've taken all that away, you have no education and no connections. Your going to see what it is like from the other side. As far as this company is concerned Tom Sylar has left to work in our Shanghai office. He had to leave straight away to cover an ill executive and take over his management role, perhaps for good. Meanwhile you will walk out of this office as Kirsty Melons, an ex-stripper looking for a more respectable employment and help pay for the debt incurred in erm...enhancing her assets\"  Tanya reached round and grabbed Tom's new boobs to emphasise the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. People can't see me like this. You can't make me work here...as a...girl!\" Tom cried in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not Miss Melons. You are free to leave and go back to working in Secrets\" Tanya said sadistically. Seeing Tom's defeated look Tanya continued. \"You will leave here and report to the secretary pool from where you will work from now on. But I will make a deal with you. If you can rise to a position of management, any management, then I will turn you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I possibly do that! I'm a blonde bimbo with no qualification!\" Tom squeaked in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you use whatever means you have at your disposal\" Tanya said suggestively. \"Thats what I did. You can see for yourself how degrading it is to have to rely on your body to get where you want in life. In any case I have left you your intelligence...for now... use it wisely and I'm sure you'll make Administration Assistant within a few years.\" Tanya laughed nastily. \"Now get out there and get to work. Oh and Miss Melons...\" She said putting an arm around you. \"If you cross me again or try and tell anyone what I have done to you, the there will be even more punishment. Do you understand Miss Melons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuivering Tom looked up into Tanya's eyes. \"Yes\" he said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what? I'm your boss now Miss Melons\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Huff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl and don't forget your purse?\" she said handing him a shiny white plastic purse that magically appeared in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom felt like crying. Today he had expected to fill the shoes of a high rolling executive. In stead he opened Tanya's office door wobbled unsteadily out in the slutty high heels of Kirsty Melons, the lowest paid member of staff in the company......</span></div></div>",

He managed to make it all the way down the hall and around the corner before slumping against a wall  and nearly collapsing to his knees. An hour ago, he'd been ready to take the helm of a new executive position, taking over for his old boss would have been a shoe-in for the top salesman in the company. But now, he wasn't only denied the opportunity, he'd lost his very identity to Tanya Huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of solid shoes coming down the hall prompted tom to push himself off the wall, just before his old friend Chris rounded the corner, a bundle of files tucked under his arm. \"Oh, excuse me,\" Chris said as he nearly ran over the now diminutive Tom. \"I didn't see you there Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um,\" Tom stammered before nervously extending a hand and forcing himself to use the name Tanya had given him. \"Melons. Kristy Melons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delighted to meet you,\" Chris said, surprising tom yet again when he took her hand and bowed over it slightly to bestow the briefest of kiss on her manicured hand. \"You must be new here, I know I'd remember meeting someone as stunning as yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, yes, I am,\" Tom said, struggling to regain his composure. It didn't help that he was so much shorter than Chris, and he wasn't sure if Chris was looking down his shirt at the monstrous DD cleavage because he was being a pervert, or simply because he was that much taller, and there was that much cleavage to look at. \"I just got out of Tanya... er, Miss Huff's office. I'm supposed to start today with the secretarial pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you'll be in good hands then,\" Chris said smiling as he set a hand on Tom's shoulder and began to steer him down the hallway. \"I'll show you the way, I need to pass right buy it on my way to records management. You'll be working for Vivian Garcia, she's in charge of the general pool. She's a good egg, really takes care of her team as long as you can remember that she's the boss and her word is pretty much law. If you're lucky though, you'll get out of the pool quick and get assigned to someone specific. Who knows, you may wind up working for whoever they put in charge of the Sales unit. My friend Tom has his eye on the job and I can put in a good word with him for you if he doesn't keep Jan on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's really nice of you Chris,\" Tom said, nearly tripping over his heels at the shock of having Chris already working to set him up with... himself. But then, Chris had always been a great wing-man. \"I think I should just meet Vivian and see how it goes, but I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Kristy,\" Chris said, grinning like he'd been given a prize over something as simple as a thank you. \"Now, the secretarial pool is just around that corner, take care and I hope to see you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so too Chris,\" Tom said, bracing himself for what lie ahead. Maybe he could work with Vivian, get himself fast tracked to a junior management role. He'd have to figure out how to sweet talk her, make her see him as more than a cheap bimbo. Just one chance and he'd get his live back from that bitch Tanya....</span></div></div>",

On occasion she had taken him to task over his daleances with some of secratarys. Tom sighed and looked at his manicured hands. The good thing, perhaps the only good thing, about being Kirsty Melons was that he was no longer Tom Sylar and he would be starting afresh with people like Vivienne. Hopefully she would have know pre-conceptions about him...her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing to knock at the door, Tom heard a snippet of a phone conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Shanghai apparently....Best place for him if you ask me.....As far away from me as possible.... Annie has never been the same since had his wicked way with her....Yes and I can think of a few others I would send to China to.....Ha Ha yes!.....look dear I have to go, I have a new girl starting this morning....Some high school dropout with no qualifactions, she'll probably turn out to be some blonde big titted airhead that thinks secretarial work is all filleing nails and flirting with guys........I don't where Tanya finds them.... Well I'll see you later... Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom grabbed two handfulls of his tinted blonde tresses and looked down mournfully at his monsterous cleavage. So much for no pre-conceptions. He tried to cover his tits up a bit. But it was no use. Giving up he knocked on the office door and entered, trying to look composed as he teetered in on the platform heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah you must be Miss Melons? Welcome\" said Vivian extending a hand over the desk. Vivienne was a smartly dressed woman in her early 40s with long black hair framing a smiling olive skinned face. Stress and her favourite vice, smoking, had taken it's toll. Fine wrinkles outlined her mouth and crows feet were present around her eyes. She was still attractive though and Tom had tried his luck with her once at an office party, even though she was married (ironically to a doctor). Vivian had refused feigning outrage but had still couldn't disguise her jealousy when he left hand in hand with one of her much younger colleagues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm wet feeling in his crotch reminded him that he would have to impress her a different way if he was ever to see his dick again. \"Yes ma'am, I'm Kirsty. Its great to meet you!\" Trying to sound as confident as he could with a voice that sounded like a cheerleader on helium and extending a dainty hand. But as he meant over the desk, one of his huge tits knocked over a framed photo of her family, which in turn knock over a beaker of pencils and in turn knocked over a cup of coffee that thankfully was nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry!\" squeaked Tom and flapped his hands unintentionally in a girly fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats quite alright Miss Melons. Accidents happen. Just....take seat before you have anymore.\" replied Vivian in a strained voice as she righted the picture and mopped up spilt coffee with a napkin. \"Great now she thinks I'm a klutz as well as an airhead\" thought Tom as he sat down dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can see from you file that you have had a...varied career\" continued Vivienne \"but you have no prior office experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am. But I know my way round a computer\" Tom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well the work we do here is a little bit more complex than internet shopping for new shoes Miss Melons. No it will be quite a while before we let you loose on the company's computer system\" Vivienne said with a chuckled \"Where do you see yourself in 5 years dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to be in a management role like you ma'am\" Tom said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U think we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves Miss Melons\" Vivian laughed \"I tell you what, until we're sure where your skills lay, you can be my assistant and help me here. You can start by fetching me a new cup of coffee. White, no suger please.\" Vivieene handed Tom the empty cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mrs Garcia. I won't let you down!\" Tom squeaked in ernest. At least she'd him a position where he could impress her. Taking the cup, Tom marched out the door, momentarily forgetting his high heels and resulting in a stumble. Catching himself on the door frame he turned and give Vivian an apologetic giggle. She just smiled and waved him away....</span></div></div>",

He pass a couple of guys from accounts who's jaws dropped when they saw his stunning body. Tom tried to look professional and gave them a wave, stopping when he realised even simple gestures like that looked flirty in this bimbos body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen he took care to make the best coffee possible, using his own secret stash of columbian blend hidden at the back of a cupboard. Whilst it percolated, he busied him self by pulling down his tight white skirt, that seemed to ride up his tanned thighs with every mincing step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn this skirt!\" he swore to himself in his girly voice. \"Damn these shoes! Damn Tanya Huff! Jan was right, she is a bitch!\" thinking of Jan brought reminded him of the promotion and his planned celebrations with her. Now instead of her boss he was a rival for hottest chick in the office. Tears stung his eyes as he cupped his enormous breasts \"Kirsty Melons! How degrading! Well I don't care what Tanya says I won't stoop to her level. I'll get promotion and win back my life without using my body. I'm smart enough to impress without sucking and fucking my way to success like she did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the coffee was made Tom made his way slowly back to Vivians office, putting one platform heel in front of the other and holding a hand out to the side for balance. It took all his concentration not to spill it and he could taste the strawberry of the pink lip gloss that smothered his lips as his Tongue stuck out to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coffee Mrs Garcia!\" Tom announced proudly as he entered the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dear. Just set it down in the desk....\" Vivian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately just as Tom reached the desk he tripped on his ridiculous high heels. Falling painfully tit-first with a squeal onto the desk he chucked the steaming hot coffee all down the cream jacket of his new boss. Vivian jumped up out of the chair and quickly took off the jacket before the hot liquid seeped through. \"Clumsy girl!\" she cried her paitence finally breaking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Mrs Garcia!\" squeaked Tom as he lifted his melons off the desk, once again knocking over several objects as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian took a deep breath to calm herself down. \"That's ok Miss Melons. Just stand still a moment. Now for you second task today you can take this Jacket to the drycleaners down the street. Whilst your there you can get me my lunch. Tuna salad please. Oh and some cigarettes. King size menthol please.\" Vivian said taking some money out of her purse and keen to get this stupid bimbo out of her way for a few hours \"Wait for the Jacket please and.....just....be careful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" said Tom unhappily taking the jacket and money. Having no pockets he was forced to slip the money in his new shiny white purse, which he then slung over a shoulder and teetered back out the room. As he closed the door he heard Vivian dial her phone. \" Tanya I must protest about the girl you have sidled me with. She's dressed like a complete slut and has already ruined my Jacket......I know Tabya but five minutes is enough I can assure you.....yes well I will try but it will be hard enough to keep her out of trouble let alone getting some work out of the airhead....well ok if you insist....bye for now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Tom could just imagine the glee on Tanya's face. Sighing he minced back down the hall. The dry cleaners might be just down the street but in these shoes it might as well be 10 miles away.....</span></div></div>",

He'd all but fallen and twisted an ankle teetering down the busy street on the mile high shoes that Tanya had saddled him with, especially when he was walking through the construction zone right next to the dry cleaners. The rough side-walk had made him focus on each step lest he fall, and given the near by workers plenty of time to comment on his new endowments as he minced by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see the cans on that one Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See them, how could I miss them. It'd be like missing a pair of wrecking balls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's my balls that are wrecking me right now. Think she'd come up here and kiss them, make everything better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't stopped once he'd gotten past them either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... the ass on her. Hammer that all the way home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hammer an ass like that, you have to bend it over your knee and spank it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the dry cleaner's at last, Tom handed over Vivian's jacket and paid the matronly shop keeper before taking a seat as far from the windows as he could to wait. While he waited, Tom fidgeted, trying to find a way to sit that didn't cause his micro skirt to ride up even higher, or a way to make that all too small top cover even a hair more of his immense breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up on his outfit for a moment, Tom looked through his purse, hoping to better understand the woman he'd become. The driver's license listed his address, a cheap apartment in a part of town that Tom had always told his visiting clients to stay away from, and gave his official height of 5'1\", so at least he wasn't a midget, even if he felt like one. Also in the purse were a collection of un-paid parking tickets, a business card for a plastic surgeon, a collection of make-up, and a tampon. Yay, something else he didn't want to think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way to take control of this,\" Tom muttered to himself. \"Some way to get back in the game.\" Tom spent several more moments in thought before finding the opportunity in his situation, exactly the skill that had made him a top salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, ma'am?\" Tom called to the shop keeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering. Do you have any garments that have been abandoned... things you might be willing to sell to get them out of your shop because the owner is never coming back?\"</span></div></div>",

I don't know if you'll fit into any of her things though, she was a very petite girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom remembered the girl well. He'd found the brunette doctoral candidate to be amazingly appealing in that shy librarian kind of way. In the end, nothing had come of it, the girl had worked almost exclusively with Alan Summers before she disappeared. That had been nearly a month ago though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, you're a life saver,\" Tom said digging in his new purse for cash or a credit card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet missy,\" the matronly shop keeper said. \"Give me a good reason to help you like this. I'd be taking a big risk to sell off someone else's property. What if she shows up looking for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Tom prepared to haggle hard like he would have when he was a senior sales rep, pressing the point that the clothing is abandoned and would have to be tossed out anyway and therefor had little value. Somehow though, he didn't think that sort of argument would fly very far, so he tried the only other thing he could think of. The truth, or at least, the truth about Kristy Melons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you really don't have to. It's just that I don't know what else to do. I never should have left high school, but I needed to work full time and all I was doing at school was failing. Then everything I did seemed to be the wrong thing... I went from waitressing at a diner to Hooters because the tips were better, and from there to dancing because I needed the extra money to pay the rent... now I'm trying to make it all right, to get a real job and make something of myself. My new boss thinks I'm nothing but a cheap slut because I don't have a real professional wardrobe and she thinks I'm an idiot because I dropped out, and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" the matronly shop keep said. \"Just stop. I'm sorry for thinking the same of you when you walked in the door. I'll help you, but I need something in return....\"</span></div></div>",

He's a quiet boy, more interested in his studies than girls or parties, but this is his senior year. Prom will be in a few weeks, and it's important to me that he have a chance to go. So, if I help you, will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom paused before he answered. It wasn't just the notion of having to date a boy that bothered him. It was the notion of dating a high school boy. After senior prom, Tom had taken the head cheerleader, Cindy Grayson, to a hotel room and the two had fucked like bunnies for the entire weekend. They'd broken up a few weeks later, but Tom had been fine with that. Now, this woman was asking him to play the other half of that role... maybe even help her son lose his virginity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Tom needed the help here. He couldn't go back to work dressed like a cheap stripper, Vivian would hang him out to dry and he'd be fired by the end of the day. \"Okay,\" he said at last. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, come by tonight after you get off work and we can go over the details. For now, let's get you dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Tom, the next few minutes were some of the most humiliating since Tanya Huff had changed his body. The shop keeper poured over every inch of his petite body with a measuring tape before beginning to make quick alterations to the outfit she had selected for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Tom left her shop in a tight fitting black skirt suit with white pinstripes. The hugged his ample behind like a glove, showcasing his tight ass and clinging tightly to his legs. While the fact that the skirt ended slightly below the knees was a benefit in terms of modesty, it functioned like a hobble skirt, having been sized originally for a more slightly built woman and forcing him to take mincing small steps. The jacket would not button fully closed over his immense bosom, but the soft cream colored shirt underneath provided full coverage even if it was spray painted on tight. The outfit still revealed every delightful curve of his new form, but at least it did so without also revealing most of his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past the construction site this time took twice as long, and any time Tom tried to hurry he nearly tripped and fell. Between the tight skirt and the towering heals he felt like he was doomed. Vivian would declare him a klutz unfit to make coffee and he'd be done for. He had to find a way to turn things around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, she was in her office, finishing her own lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Melons, I hadn't expected to see you in my office again so soon. What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom bit back on a stinging response at her fake and sugary tone, reminding himself that he was here because he needed her help. Then again, she was also the reason for his problem, but getting short with her wouldn't help matters any. \"I need a favor. I need you to use your magic on me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving up already <i>Miss Melons</i>?\" Tanya asked, emphasizing his new name. \"Begging to be turned back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I... I want your help. I can't move in this body... everything jiggles funny, it makes me feel like I'm drunk the way I move half the time. I've already made a mess of Vivian's jacket and spilled things, and I constantly feel like I'm going to fall over. I need some help. I want to know if you can use your magic on me to make this body feel like it's mine. So I at least know how to walk without falling over. Can you do that much for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. I think I can. Of course, the favor will come with a price, but I can help you. Brace yourself,\" she said, moving her hands in a complicated pattern before pointing at Tom. A light flashed, washing the room out in bright white light before things returned to normal. \"There, done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Tom asked, not feeling any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. Tell me Miss Melons, when you were tom, how tall were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five foot one,\" Tom said automatically. \"Wait, that's not right... wasn't I taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Miss Melons,\" Tanya said with a smirk. \"Do you remember being taller? How about this, your senior year of high school, what size of bra did you wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-cup, that's why I got a boob job. Wait... What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted your new body to feel like it was yours. So, I've re-written all of your memories. Now, you remember growing up in that body. Oh, I bet you still remember most of your life with the same events, but now the body you remember is this one. Tell me, what was it like the first time you had sex with a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom thought back to Alison Hayes, the first girl he'd ever slept with. He could still remember making out in the back of his mustang, but now he remembered what it felt like when she slipped her hand up his shirt and fondled his budding breasts... and what it felt like when she ran her tongue over his dripping slit. \"Oh my god....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there is a price to be paid for this favor Tom, but I'll let you pick it. Since you wanted knowledge of the body, I get to do one more thing to you. I can either replace your college education with the college education of Miss Melons... or, you can let me alter you physically again. I promise though, if you let me change you physically, I'll make it so the new change still feels natural for you. I wouldn't want to undo the fun I'm already having with your new memories after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tom choose?</span></div></div>",

What else could you possibly do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, Tom realized that he may have gone too far. His massive chest was heaving, his breasts quivering as he drew air, but thanks to the magic Tanya had worked on his memory, it felt like a natural sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's quite a reaction <i>Miss Melons</i>,\" Tanya said, again emphasizing his new name and his position relative to her. \"You think I've already made things as difficult for you as I could? I haven't begun to work my magic on you yet. There are so many other delightful things I could do to you. You think that your breasts are big now? How would you feel if I made them truly fake. Breasts so large they're almost only achieved through serious enhancement. Would you enjoy being ... an F cup perhaps? G?

You don't have to stay a white girl to be a cheap bimbo you know. Maybe you would relate to Vivian Garcia more if your name was... Rosa Melons? Or would you rather something else... you could be very cute as an Asian with tits that size you know, maybe even more popular. I could even give you a nice English as a second language accent. Or keep you blond, and make you a Russian immigrant perhaps? So many options to change you, what should I choose?

His face heated in embarrassment as he realized that no matter what he did, his chest would gain more attention than anything he did with his brain.

It wasn't one of the top offices on the twenty fifth floor, but then, Mat always said he wanted to be in the middle of things, not too far removed from the people actually doing work. The office itself, however, occupied a good sized corner of the building with an attached conference room, reception area, lounge, and even a small personal bedroom for nights when the general manager worked too late to go home for the evening. Or, as Tom well knew, for nights when Mat was too busy screwing his mistress to go home to his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Miss Melons, I've had a long chat with Vivian and honestly, I have a feeling she's more put off by you than is fair and that she isn't about to give you a chance here. That's not a statement that I expect to leave this room, but I believe it's accurate. However, as it happens, I have an assignment that will take you largely out of her realm if you're up for it. I was reviewing your resume and I saw a few things that make me think you're going to be perfect for this. Now, as I understand it, you worked at Secrets, is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" Tom replied blushing. Of course, what had he been thinking. His 'talents' amounted to the ability to have gotten in tremendous debt for a massive pair of tits... what else could Mat be wanting him for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And before that, you were at a Hooters. Now, what I need is someone who can be part stripper, part waitress, and part administrative assistant. We have some very important business functions coming up, executives from some of our clients and a a few of our suppliers as well. While we'll do a great deal of the detail work in meetings and conference rooms, the real power deals occur at after hours functions. I'd like you to be there as my personal assistant. Take notes of course, but expect to fetch and carry plenty of beverages, and to do so in some very minimal outfits. Can you handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe he thought that 'Krissy' was too dumb to  understand if he'd been his usual subtle self, but still, having someone tell you that they wanted you to be a secretary / stripper / waitress was about as close as you could get to having your boss tell you that they wanted to hire you to be the Office Slut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Tom thought about refusing. After all, this is exactly what Tanya wanted to happen to him. To be forced to use his body as a tool to get what he wants. But then, how was that any different than how he'd used his skills on the basketball court with clients before? This might not be hanging out with clients and business partners tossing back a cold beer and playing a game of horse, but it was every bit as much about using what you had to get what you wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mr. Hardy,\" he said. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now, I just have a simple exam for you, to make sure that you really can do what I need done. I have a net-book over here at my desk and a meeting in about five minutes. I'd like you to go ahead and strip down for me, and have a seat in the chair next to my desk. During the meeting I'll expect you to be able to fetch us drinks from the mini-bar here in the office and keep up with notes from the meeting. When the meeting is done, if you've done well, the job is yours. Otherwise... well, there's still the general pool, and I'm sure we can find something that fits your 'talents' if it isn't this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Tom said, caught off guard. He'd thought he'd have time to prepare... maybe even to ask Tanya to give him memories of working as a stripper to make it easier. \"I, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's sudden, but I need a girl who doesn't spend too much time thinking about things and jumps in to get the job done. If it's not for you, I understand, but I need to know. Can you really do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The inch long fake nails made working with the tiny buttons difficult, and his massive F-cup breasts made him feel like he'd burst a button off if he wasn't careful. When the shirt came off at last, both Tom and Mat stared at the size of the breasts it revealed. Deep down, Tom knew they were the same breasts he'd had yesterday, but it felt like he was seeing them in person for the first time. In the lacy bra, they could still be mistaken as natural, though very full and obviously pushed up to generate that much cleavage. Once the bra was gone, he knew they'd stand out as obviously fake, just like his bleached blond hair was obviously fake. Not that he expected Mat to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving lower before he took off his bra, Tom shimmied out of the tight fitting skirt, wiggling his ass in front of his boss in a tempting manner. It wasn't even that he was trying to be seductive about it, just that the skirt was so tight, straining across his hips and full ass that it took a little work to get off. Work that left him bent over in front of his bosses desk, wiggling his ass and slowly exposing the cute thong panties he was wearing underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving his bra at last, he cupped his breasts for a moment, feeling their immense weight and glancing at Mat to make sure this is really what was expected of him. Finally, he let the massive Melons hang free and bent over a final time to remove his panties, standing naked before his boss who's trousers held an obvious erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.galleries.badgirlsblog.com/albums/jill/10164/162bnt.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.galleries.badgirlsblog.com/al...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat where Mat indicated he crossed his legs, almost unconsciously , so as to not put on too lewd of a show and looked at the net-book he had been given to work with. The keyboard before him was small and cramped and one look from the keyboard to his long fake nails told him that he was doomed to fail at taking notes For a moment, he considered asking if he could use something else, but the door opened to reveal one of the company's business partners and there was no time. All eyes were on Tom, and he had to figure out how to make it work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perching on the seat that he had been provided, Tom knew exactly why Mat had wanted a sexy young blond to be present for the meeting. Mr. Ajar Kustafi represented a major middle eastern supplier and was one of the company's most important relations. Tom had taken the man to an endless series of strip clubs two years ago and spent nearly $2,000 on strippers who were willing to go the 'extra mile' for this important client. Like many middle eastern men, he had no respect for women, but he did find pale skinned blond american girls to be exciting and a change of pace from his usual fair. And it had been Tom's job in the past to make sure he found plenty of blond pussy any time he visited. And in a way, that was still his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hardy,\" Ajar said warmly as he took in Tom's altered appearance, feasting his eyes on Kristy Melon's and her obviously enhanced F-cups. \"I see you've taken on a new secretary. I must say, I approve of the dress code.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you approve Mr. Kustafi,\" Mat said extending a hand and shaking the other man's firmly. \"Miss Melon's here is a new addition to our company and should prove to be quite an asset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect that she will... But, as much as I would like to spend some time on Miss Melons... assets, we have a great deal of business to discuss. About last quarter's final numbers,\" he said as he took a seat across the desk from Mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, Tom tried to type notes on the small keyboard, but quickly found that there was no way to keep up with the rapid exchange of information while typing with the ridiculously long fake nails. Desperate for a solution, he seized on the only idea he thought could save him.... he'd have to try to remember the important information while he did something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the small net book, Tom walked around the desk, causing both men to stop and watch as his massive endowments jiggled. \"Oh, don't mind me gentlemen,\" Tom said, kneeling beside Mr. Kustafi's chair. \"I just thought I would make our guest more... comfortable.\" <i> I can do this</i>, Tom thought. <i> It won't be that bad... and I can do this.</i> Taking the plunge he used his slim, delicate hands to unfasten Ajar Kustafi's fly and gain access to the man's firm cock. Tom tried to compare it for a moment to his own lost member. Was Mr. Kustafi's bigger? Smaller? Tom couldn't tell... when he tried to think about his own dick, he couldn't remember ever having one. But now, with Ajar Kustafi's throbbing member before him, Tom had little time to speculate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, hesitantly, he began to stroke the man's cock with his delicate hands, getting comfortable and working up his nerve for what would come next. Then, moments later, he took the first plunge, licking gently, teasingly at the tip of the man's shaft. Tom tried to keep his mind on the conversation, and found that it helped if he just told himself that it was like working on a lollipop. He let his body go on auto-pilot while he followed the conversation about financial information and sales plans. Finally, Mr. Kustafi's member began to twitch, shooting his thick, salty seed down Tom's throat. With no other options, Tom slurped down every last drop, making sure to clean up the other man's cock before putting it away and zipping up his fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well... That was very thoughtful of your secretary Mat... but it leaves me a bit thirsty, perhaps we should take a break for refreshments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. Kristi here can mix you up something at the bar I'm sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stood up, nodding briefly to mat and walking on slightly wobbly legs over to the bar. The two men paused from their conversation long enough to watch Tom's shapely ass walk across the floor, then resumed their conversation. <i>Holy shit, I can't believe I just did that,</i> Tom thought. Reaching for the gin and beginning to mix a Martini for each of the men. Tom steadied himself behind the bar, taking a moment to make sure that Mr. Kustafi's was mixed a bit stronger than Mats before presenting the drinks to the men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after the men finished their drinks, Mr. Kustafi announced,\"you've been a wonderful host Mat, and shrewd as always. I think, however, that the combination of drink and intoxicating company has done me in. Perhaps, we could resume our conversation again later? I hope Miss Melons can be a part of that conversation....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMat stood smiling and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be quite truthful though, I'm still not convinced you completed your assignment. After all, you were supposed to be taking notes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling very confident, Tom walked over to the bar, his shapely ass swaying and his massive breasts jiggling enticingly as he went. \"Oh, I think I have that covered,\" he said, smiling his full lips in a way that came off as coy. \"If you want a transcript I'll have to type it up later as my hands were busy... but there wasn't much you'll need to see in writing. With Mr. Kustafi's proposed asset liquidation, including both the Khandar and the Dubai assets, we're not looking at more than twenty items I had to commit to memory.\" Reaching behind the bar, Tom poured two tumblers of Mat's favorite celebratory scotch over a small handful of ice... just the same way he had before when he and Mat had put the squeeze on a client to get the best deal. \"But if you ask me, the Dubai assets are overvalued. I wouldn't pick them up for more than twenty million, even if he is asking twenty five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMat sat back stunned as Tom walked back across the room to hand him the tumbler of scotch. \"I'd been thinking twenty two myself... tell me Miss Melons, what makes you think we could go as low as twenty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Tom almost let slip who he really was... and the fact that as Tom, he'd been watching those assets closely because he was expecting Ajar to make a move like this... but it wouldn't fly with the new hire identity he now had to work with.

Setting the glass down, he stepped up to Mat, pressing his body close and allowing his massive fake breasts to flatten slightly against Mat's body. This close, it was impossible for Tom to ignore the reality of just how short he had become, and how much smaller than Mat his current body was. Likewise, it was impossible for Mat to avoid staring down into the impressive display of cleavage that Tom had presented to him. \"Some times, you can tell a lot from a person by how they react while you're touching them,\" he said, looking up from behind his long eyelashes at Mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really Miss Melons?\" Tom said, obvious heat rising in his body, and an equally obvious erection pressing into Tom's stomach where he pressed against him. \"And just how did our friend react while you touched him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Tom continued, reaching up and taking Mat's glass of scotch away and putting it on his desk. \"It's just that, when he said twenty five, and you didn't say anything, he relaxed... he came not long after that. He must be a very... disciplined man to keep his mind so much on business while I was 'working.' But, once he thought he had what he wanted, he relaxed and let himself.... go.\" Of course, Tom couldn't mention that he had been to Dubai last summer and had seen the rate that those vary assets had been deteriorating at. Ajar's company no longer had the resources to maintain those assets and had been sniffing around for a buyer for months.... it was getting close to time to cut losses because even liquidating those assets at a slight loss would be better than the impact of carrying the cost of maintaining them. Twenty five million would allow Ajar's company to walk away at better than break even, and there's no way Tom would have let that kind of price fly... now, he just had to convince Mat that he was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think you can read him that well eh?\" Mat said, slipping an arm around Tom and pulling his slim body even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very good at reading what people want sir,\" Tom said, bracing himself for what he was about to do. The scotch helped, but at this point, his next move could make or break his plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what is his next step:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Tell Mat that you need to get a person worked up, make them want something badly, but don't give it to them right away, so that when they get a chance for it, they take it. Back away from Mat, and ask for permission to get dressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tell Mat that you have to throw yourself all in, keep the client's head spinning and distracted so they don't think about what they're signing too much. Haul Mat into the bedroom attached to his office.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had to somehow survive in his new body and new life and he didn\u2019t think he was ready for that. He\u2019d gone down on Ajar and been lucky everything worked out, but Mat and Ajar were expecting Kristy Melons, star stripper, not Tom Skyler, a guy with no clue how to dance on a stripper pole or do even half the things they were expecting.

In moments, Maria was present in the office, in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fe/62/50/fe62507a1a17bd3a8f167f6c865c8552.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fe/62/50/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's hand ran over her skin tight trousers. A faint squeak of protest making her cheeks burn with shame, drawing attention to her perfect, full ass. But Tonya wasn't happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl as blessed as you, needs a bigger blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria whimpered, as she felt her rump expand once more. The trousers strained, the seams splitting. But as she grew her clothes rushed to catch up, the seams restitching themselves for the extra bounce and sway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1f/1b/91/1f1b9122905bf61e4a438076b3dad141.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1f/1b/91/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madre Dios.

It's too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria struggled to find the words in English. A frown creasing her forehead, as she fought to speak in English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want more? M\u00e1s grande...!\" Tonya asked in mock confusion. Maria's eyes boggled, as she spluttered, and gasped. Words beyond her in the moment, panic gripping her, \"No, m\u00e1s.\" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M\u00e1s.\" Tonya said with a cruel smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/62/d8/5b62d8fc7e7fd105e557a3112a0ca87e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/62/d8/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's shoulders slumped in defeat. A last look at Tonya almost waiting for further humiliation, before she slunk off to sit at her desk... No longer a significant manager, now just a secretary.</span></div></div>",

She also felt the bounce in her bust, and butt, as both shimmied within her simple dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked sideways to take in the damage, and saw a gorgeous petite Japanese woman copying his gestures. The uncertainty on her lips, and the doubt in her eyes confirming her new race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u300c\u3044\u3044\u3048\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306f\u6b63\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3002\u300d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan's teeth clicked as her mouth snapped closed.

Any chance of being taken seriously erased. Dan's hands checked her hips were as wide as they felt. Now, terrified to confirm her touch. Hands recoiling as if stung, they wavered by her side, as if too scared to verify that the heavy, round, firm full as was as real as those hips, or that bust. Already pulling relentlessly, making her shoulders ache. She swallowed a sob, as she took in what was certain to be her final form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/6a/3a/296a3a34c25a666c2c3124bd0e35bd5f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/6a/3a/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the panic ebbing from her veins, she rediscovered her uncertain English.

Of course, she\u2019d said nothing about actually making him less intelligent, and she seemed to be reveling in the fact that even with a brain like Einstein\u2019s Kirsty was destined to be taken for a bimbo.  Tom felt reasonably sure that, even if he lost all his education, Tanya wouldn\u2019t actually destroy his IQ.  Not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the disorientation from the changes Tanya had just wrought in his mind and the fear that both options were wrong, Tom failed to notice that Tanya was not only studying him intently but also appeared to be getting irritated with his indecision\u2026</span></div></div>",

Of course not.  I told you, there\u2019s a price to pay, Miss Melons.  I still get to make another change to you.  After all, what would it teach you if you could just walk in here and get help without it costing you anything?  This is a punishment after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom swallowed slowly, knowing that he\u2019d been caught in his little trick of trying to get away without further changes.  Tanya, for her part, was enjoying the buildup, chuckling a little before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be happy, Miss Melons, I\u2019m simply going to correct some problems that you still have acting naturally with that incredible body you now have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you just did that,\u201d Tom protested, \u201cI\u2019m comfortable in this body now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Miss Melons, have a seat while I explain.\u201d  Tanya\u2019s voice was polite and professional, but it was still a command that Tom found himself obeying, slipping into the chair in front of Tanya\u2019s desk in a practiced and relaxed manner, slouching just a little with one arm over the backrest and his legs stretched out in front of him while Tanya remained in her own seat opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, Miss Melons, what do you think about this year\u2019s Heisman Trophy race?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think that Collin Klein has it all but wrapped up.  I mean, I suppose that Barner could still have a shot at it if K-State tanks their last couple of games and the Ducks\u2019 offense keeps lighting it up, but it\u2019s definitely either Klein or Barner this year, no matter what those Luckeye fans who keep trying to push Braxton Miller into the conversation want to believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smiled before continuing, \u201cThat\u2019s a well thought out analysis, Miss Melons.  Not many women pay that much attention to sports, especially not many women with fake DD tits and a stripper\u2019s body like yours, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom knew that she was toying with him, but something was keeping him from quite making the connection and he kept going, \u201cWell most women weren\u2019t originally guys, and most women didn\u2019t go through high school driving a \u201968 Shelby Mustang with 4-on-the-floor like I did either.\u201d  Tom sat up in the chair and hunched forward, crossing his arms and leaning his elbows on the desk aggressively as his annoyance rose, \u201cLook, Ms. Huff, I don\u2019t see how any of this conversation is helping me act more naturally for this body and you\u2019re certainly not explaining anything, so if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m already running behind on getting back to Mrs. Garcia with her lunch and jacket.\u201d  Tom stood abruptly as if to leave, his breasts bouncing slightly from momentum as he straightened into a rather masculine, almost military pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned to leave, Tom heard Tanya comment, almost to herself, \"I\u2019m afraid that just won\u2019t do at all\u201d but it was the snapping of her fingers that stopped him cold.  \u201cI see that got your attention, Miss Melons, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve fixed everything.  You\u2019re free to leave if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, Tom didn\u2019t feel any different at all.  Part of him screamed to just leave before he could make things any worse than what she\u2019d already done, but the perverse desire to find out what new changes Tanya had made in him overcame his flight response and turn back around to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019d like to stay and chat for a bit, <i>Miss Melons</i>?\u201d  Tanya continued without giving Tom a chance to reply, \u201cPlease, sit down again.  I don\u2019t normally take such an active role with such junior employees, but your, shall we say, \u201cspecial\u201d qualifications seem to necessitate more oversight than most employees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom again took his place in the chair across from Tanya, but this time, un-noticed to Tom, instead of his relaxed masculine pose Tom sat with his legs crossed at the thighs, though with the way he kept his chest thrust out his posture, while definitely feminine, was far from \u201cprim and proper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, Miss Melons.  Now, I know you\u2019re anxious about what\u2019s changed this time, but before you start asking me, let\u2019s see just how effective that education I let you retain actually is.  I want you to stop and think about what the most humiliating thing I could change about you would have been.  Go ahead, I\u2019m not going to get angry if you take your time now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Tom started to speak, before Tanya cut him off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo talking just yet.  Think for a few moments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bitch is enjoying this way too much,\u201d Tom thought to himself, but he still knew that his only choice was to humor her and see what he could come up with.  As Tom began to run through the possibilities in his mind he shifted slightly, his posture unconsciously straining the borrowed blouse enough to allow just a hint of cleavage to show through the gap between the pulled-tight buttons as he un-crossed and re-crossed his legs in a way that, had he been wearing a shorter skirt, would have briefly revealed to anyone watching that Miss Melons had chosen a pink thong that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom lost himself in thought Tanya sat back, enjoying Tom's obliviousness to the fact that his unconscious mannerisms were now those of a former stripper with an eighth-grade education.  The look of deep concentration that Tom had only moments ago somehow managed even with Kirsty\u2019s doe eyes and innocent face was gone, replaced with a vacant pout that made it look like Kirsty couldn\u2019t possibly be contemplating anything more complex than whether she though puppies or kittens were cuter.  When Kirsty began absentmindedly biting her lower lip while playing with a few stray strands of her blonde hair, it was all Tanya could do to stifle her laughter; when Kirsty began idly playing her finger along her lower lip in a way that managed to give the impression that her skull wasn\u2019t the only part of her that felt empty, Tanya decided that it was time to clue Tom in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she said she wouldn\u2019t take away my education, and I can still remember my grad school classes and professors, so she seems to be playing straight there, but I\u2019m afraid to guess what she might have done for fear of giving her more ideas\u2026\u201d  Tom\u2019s thoughts were interrupted as he realized there was now a small mirror standing on the desk in front of him.  A small desk mirror that reflected the face of a young blonde woman with the unlikely name of Kirsty Melons and whose current expression might best be described as \u201crecently hit in the head with a brick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she hadn\u2019t seen it with her own eyes, Tanya would not have believed that it was possible for Kirsty\u2019s expression to have become any more stunned than it had been while Tom was thinking.  \u201cYou see, Miss Melons, I\u2019ve made sure that your mannerisms now match your body.  You\u2019ll find that all your little unconscious actions, the way you walk, what you do with your hands when you\u2019re not actively paying attention to them, the way you instinctively react to things, even the way you talk and the facial expressions you make, are now exactly what people would consider <i>natural</i> for your body.\u201d  Tanya paused and chucked a little before adding, \u201cI\u2019m afraid this does mean that you\u2019ll never be much good at poker in this body though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m, like, going to be forced to talk like a total bimbo and stuff too?\u201d  Tom\u2019s hand shot up to his mouth in the sort of expression of total surprise that would be expected only from someone with a name like Kirsty Melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo dear, not \u2018forced\u2019 really,\u201d explained Tanya, \u201cIf you concentrate you\u2019ll find that you can speak normally.  I\u2019ve just made some, adjustments, to what comes naturally to you.  If you really pay attention, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to seem only slightly ditzy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly slightly ditzy?! That\u2019s totally not fair!\u201d Tom would have winced at Kirsty\u2019s whiney protest if his expression hadn\u2019t been on auto-pilot for full pout.  As it was, the best he could do was take some solace in the fact that he\u2019d resisted the urge to stamp his foot in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not, Miss Melons.  The whole point is for you to have to rely on your body to get ahead.  If I took away your klutziness without making other adjustments people would eventually get over your body and your voice.  You should have been able to figure that out, after all your intelligence and education weren\u2019t part of the other adjustments I made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom Syler would have been able to avoid betraying the fear that the phrase \u201cother adjustments\u201d caused, but even someone whose entire literacy training amounted to \u201cSee Spot Run\u201d could have read the anxiety in Kirsty\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, you, like, changed more stuff about me?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course dear.  Mannerisms and speech patterns alone aren\u2019t enough for you to fit that body naturally, there\u2019s also\u2026\u201d  The ringing of Tanya\u2019s desk phone cut her off unceremoniously as Tom cursed the timing, the frustration coming through Kirsty\u2019s face in a manner that suggested a five-year-old who\u2019d just dropped her ice cream.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tanya glanced down at the phone\u2019s display before hitting the button to send the call to voicemail, \u201cSorry about that hon.  Now, as I was saying, speech patterns and mannerisms alone aren\u2019t enough.  There are also certain interests and hobbies that people will naturally expect to go with that body of yours, and others that will just never naturally suit you.  So I\u2019ve fixed that too.\u201d  Tanya smiled, \u201cafter all, I do so enjoy being helpful to you, Miss Melons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just, like, all stereotype-y and stuff!\u201d  Tom\u2019s protest came without thinking, \u201cJust \u2018cause I\u2019ve, like, got huge tits and stuff doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t like whatever I want!  You totes can\u2019t just change all that stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Miss Melons, I\u2019ll believe you\u2019ll find that not only can I change that, I already did.  But since you seem to need some convincing\u2026\u201d Tanya leaned back in her chair with a satisfied look on her face, \u201ccan you tell me again what you think of the Heisman race?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom knew that she\u2019d just asked the same question a few minutes ago, but for some reason not only could he no longer remember the answer he\u2019d given, this time around the question didn\u2019t even make sense to him.  \u201cUm, the Heinz Man Race is, like\u2026\u201d Kirsty\u2019s befuddled voice trailed off as Tom paused to think, her little button nose scrunching up adorably.  Tom was pretty sure that the ketchup company wasn\u2019t sponsoring any men\u2019s marathons so he tried to work through the issue logically inside his head.  \u201cOK Tom, you know she asked this before and you know your intelligence is still intact.  But the question doesn\u2019t make sense and you can\u2019t remember answering before.  It must be a trick of some sort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya could tell that Tom was fighting to figure it out, but she wasn\u2019t about to help him out, and she certainly wasn\u2019t going to correct that delightful \u201cHeinz Man Race\u201d mistake he\u2019d just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Tom a few more moments to reach a decision, \u201cYou\u2019re, like, totally trying to trick me, Ms. Huff!  There\u2019s no such thing as the Heinz Man Race!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triumphant look on Kirsty\u2019s face was almost too amusing to destroy, but Tanya wasn\u2019t about to stop now.  \u201cWell, that\u2019s technically correct, Miss Melons,\u201d she said chuckling, \u201cthere certainly isn\u2019t any such thing as the \u2018Heinz Man Race.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty\u2019s smile brightened even further.  Tom was delighted to have finally found a limit to Tanya\u2019s powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d Kirsty\u2019s face fell into obvious worry as Tanya continued, \u201cthere is such a thing as the <i>Heisman</i> race.  You see, the Heisman Trophy is given to the most outstanding player in college football.  It\u2019s one of the most important sports awards in this country.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom couldn\u2019t contain himself, \u201cThat\u2019s <i>so</i> not true!  I <i>totally</i> know <i>all</i> about football n\u2019 sports n\u2019 stuff and if that trophy thingy were real I\u2019d know about it.  I may be blonde, but you still can\u2019t, like, trick me that easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you spend a lot of time paying attention to football, Miss Melons?  Perhaps you can help me understand something then.  What\u2019s a pistol formation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d  Tom was sure he knew this.  It was an easy question, one of the basics of the sport.  Except that it suddenly didn\u2019t seem like an easy question at all.  In fact, Tom found that he couldn\u2019t recall ever having really paid attention to a football game in his life.  The more Tom thought about it, the sillier the whole sport seemed.  \u201cIt\u2019s just bunch of guys running back and forth with a ball and trying to hurt each other,\u201d he thought.  \u201cI mean, that Jim Tebow guy, or whatever his name is, is really hot, but\u2026  Wait, where did <i>that</i> thought come from?\u201d  Tom definitely knew he should know this (and that he absolutely shouldn\u2019t be thinking like that about one of the players) but he just couldn\u2019t bring anything else to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem a little confused,\u201d Tanya broke in, \u201cperhaps a simpler question would be better?  How about this, what\u2019s your favorite position?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day ago Tom Sylar\u2019s answer would have been linebacker; he had a lot of respect for men who could play a position that required so many varied skills.  The problem now though was that Kirsty Melons didn\u2019t know a thing about football, and, even worse, one of Kirsty\u2019s hobbies that Tom had apparently just gained appeared to be ogling men.  Kirsty\u2019s thoughts were still on \u2018Jim Tebow\u2019 which, combined with the sudden-ness of Tanya\u2019s interruption and Tom\u2019s eagerness to demonstrate that he still had some knowledge caused Tom to blurt out the first thing that came to mind to answer Tanya\u2019s newest question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoggy style, definitely!\u201d  Even as Kirsty\u2019s voice made the answer seem to involve more than a bit of longing excitement, Tom was wincing inside as he realized that Kirsty\u2019s hobbies regarding men probably went a bit farther than merely ogling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Tanya wasn\u2019t able to hold her laughter in.  \u201cWell I suppose you\u2019ve got an idea about some of the hobbies and interests you\u2019ve lost and gained now.  Not to mention an accidental crash course in what can happen when you let yourself just blurt out an answer.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom felt like he ought to be blushing, but apparently Kirsty\u2019s, ahem, life experiences, had removed most of the embarrassment she might have over sexual proclivities and the automatic response he had as Tanya collected herself was simply to giggle and look only mildly shocked in a manner more evocative of a pin-up girl than of true embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya went on, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find the other interests and hobbies you\u2019ve lost and gained as the day goes by dear, but I really shouldn\u2019t keep you any longer.  I want you to know that I\u2019ve really enjoyed this little meeting, by the way.  In fact, I\u2019m thinking we should have a check in like this every day.  I\u2019ll set aside some time each morning and you can come see me first thing when you get in every day.  After all, a young girl like you needs a good mentor to monitor her progress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, like, won\u2019t Vivian be upset with me being late and stuff every morning?  And she\u2019s totally gonna notice that I talk different now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry dear, I\u2019ll clear our morning meetings with whomever you\u2019re reporting to.  And no-one will notice any changes to you; as far as they\u2019ll be concerned you\u2019ll have always been that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d  Tom celebrated the victory of a sentence, however small, without superfluous \u201clikes\u201d in it and stood up to leave, hips swaying seductively with Kirsty\u2019s newly natural walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, one last thing Miss Melons.  That call I sent to voicemail earlier was Vivian wondering if I\u2019d seen you.  Apparently she was expecting you back with her jacket much sooner.  You\u2019ll want to make sure you go straight to her office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmigod!  Why didn\u2019t you, like, tell her I was here n\u2019 stuff?!  That was, like, 20 minutes ago!  Mrs. Garcia\u2019s gonna be <i>so</i> totally pissed at me!\u201d  Tom\u2019s attempts at conveying anger at Tanya\u2019s intentional oversight only managed \u201cpetulant teenager\u201d despite his best efforts and reigning in Kirsty\u2019s automatic responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to monitor your time for you, Miss Melons.\u201d  Tanya\u2019s tone of condescending professionalism grated on Tom\u2019s mind.  \u201cBesides,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe were having far too much fun to let an interruption stop us.  Run along now, and don\u2019t forget your other packages for Mrs. Garcia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom hurriedly picked up the jacket and packages before rushing out of Tanya\u2019s office.  He had the faintest impression that he heard Tanya snap her fingers just before the door clicked shut behind him, but there just wasn\u2019t time to stop and check.  Hips swaying and heels clicking Tom made a beeline for Vivian\u2019s office, hoping that he\u2019d figure out some way to appropriately apologize for his delay.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As humiliating as it was when Tom realized, halfway to Vivian\u2019s office, that he was now running (OK, thanks to the tight pencil skirt it was less of a \u201crun\u201d and more of a reasonably hurried mincing) in a way that was mostly a caricature of overdone femininity, he had to admit that, however degrading Kirsty\u2019s mannerisms were, the ability to move in a way that wasn\u2019t a continuous stumble was at least to some degree an improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never realized how hard it was to run in heels,\u201d Tom thought, \u201calthough they do make my legs (and ass!) look just incredible and I just <i>had</i> to show off this cute pedi\u2026\u201d  Tom wrenched his train of thought back on track, \u201cFigures that shoes and fashion would be interests of Kirsty\u2019s,\u201d he thought bitterly.  \u201cThat\u2019s just great, now I not only look like a sex worker and sound like an airhead, I\u2019m going to prattle on about shoes too.  They really are <i>essential</i> to complete a \u2018look\u2019 though and it\u2019s just so much <i>fun</i> how different pairs can entirely change the way an outfit comes across; plus it\u2019s so exciting to find that perfect pair in my size at a sale!  Especially with my tiny little feet\u2026\u201d  Tom mentally shook his head.  There was nothing to be done about it, he supposed.  He was just going to have to live with the fact that this was the sort of thing he found interesting now that Tanya had made sure he fit \u201cnaturally\u201d into Kirsty\u2019s life.  This was not how he\u2019d envisioned his day going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom approached Vivian\u2019s door, happy that nothing further had happened to him during his walk and now reasonably convinced that he\u2019d only imagined hearing Tonya snap her fingers as he was leaving her office, he caught a few scraps of conversation just before he knocked; it seemed that Vivian was on the phone with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026haven\u2019t seen her either then, Tonya?  \u2026I wouldn\u2019t put it past that ditz to have stopped off at the mall for a quick-mid-day shopping trip.  \u2026don\u2019t know why you keep defending her.  \u2026ok, ok, I promise not to let anyone fire her without your approval first.  I have to go, someone\u2019s knocking; yes, I\u2019ll see you for drinks tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was nagging at the back of Tom\u2019s brain but after all the stress he\u2019d been through and his worry over being late the nagging feeling just didn\u2019t catch and he meekly walked into Vivian\u2019s office as soon as he heard her call for him to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Mrs. Garcia?  I have the stuff you asked me to get.  I\u2019m, like, really sorry that it took me so long?\u201d  Between the worry over Vivian\u2019s reaction and Kirsty\u2019s speech patterns the apology came out more like a hopeful pleading than a statement and Tom cringed inwardly at how different this was from the confident demeanor he was accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Melons, normally I\u2019d ask why it took you so much longer than it should have, but since I can see that you\u2019re wearing an entirely different outfit now I think we both know what happened.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian clearly was not at all pleased and that nagging thought in the back of Tom\u2019s head finally clicked into place.  \u201cDamnit,\u201d he thought to himself, \u201cwhat on earth possessed me to think that she wouldn\u2019t notice that I came back from the errand in an entirely different outfit?  She\u2019s <i>really</i> going to think I\u2019m some shopaholic airhead now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom started to open his mouth to protest that he\u2019d just had the outfit in his car and decided that he should change to suit the office better when he noticed something about the tuna salad he\u2019d just handed to Vivian.  The label sticker was from a food vendor at the mall across town, not from the small bistro next to the dry cleaners where he\u2019d actually gone.  It seemed that he hadn\u2019t imagined Tanya\u2019s last finger snap after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was trapped and he knew it.  If he tried to deny having gone shopping Vivian would point to the label and tear into him for lying; that was certain.  There was only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m, like, really, <i>really</i> sorry Mrs. Garcia.  I just, you know, heard you complain about my outfit n\u2019 stuff and I totally wanted to get off on the right foot with you so I thought that, like, maybe if I came back looking professional and all\u2026 but then I just, like, lost track of time and then I was, like, <i>so</i> scared that you would be angry\u2026\u201d  Kirsty\u2019s ingrained responses overwhelmed Tom and he faltered, wringing his dainty hands and sniffling like a scolded child and trying not to cry.  Tom wished that his fight against tears was simply his remaining masculine pride, but most of it was due to Kirsty\u2019s interest in not smearing her makeup, which only added to the humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Melons,\u201d Vivian\u2019s voice was firm, \u201cWhile I appreciate that you wanted to make yourself look more professional,\u201d adding inwardly that almost anything would have been an improvement over what the little stripper had been wearing earlier in the day, \u201cdriving across town to complete an errand that could have been completely by walking only one block and then stopping in the middle of it to go shopping is completely unacceptable.  What if I\u2019d had a meeting and wasn\u2019t here when you got back?  I shouldn't have to go all afternoon without lunch.  I need to know that I can depend on my assistants to accomplish their tasks on time.  If it were up to me, I\u2019d fire you right now.  But for some reason Tanya, that\u2019s Ms. Huff, really seems to want you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian\u2019s clarification of Tanya\u2019s name was less a reminder that Tom was not at a level to call his boss by her first name than it was an indication that Vivian clearly didn\u2019t think that Kirsty was bright enough to have remembered Ms. Huff\u2019s first name.  \u201cAs though I didn\u2019t have enough of a reminder that this body screams \u2018BIMBO!\u2019 every time I open my mouth,\u201d Tom thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian continued, \u201c\u2026so you should consider yourself lucky right now.  Take this opportunity to shape up because without Ms. Huff pulling the strings, you\u2019d be in a completely different position right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony of that statement was not lost on Tom as he stood, meekly nodding and silently hoping that he could ride this out, or at least get Kirsty\u2019s sad little sniffles under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vivian continued her dressing-down of Kirsty Melons she gradually realized that the poor girl was practically cowering and she began to relent a little.  After all, Vivian could see that Kirsty was trying and Kirsty really couldn\u2019t help the fact that she was obviously one of the duller knives in the drawer.  The girl was clearly never going to be management material, but Vivian supposed that she could always promote Annie and plop Kirsty down at the reception desk if it came to that.  Or, if Kirsty turned out to actually be as hopeless as she seemed Mat was always looking for a new girl to take a position under him and that would at least be a way to get Kirsty out of her hair.  There were options; she didn\u2019t need to berate the girl right now.  Besides, she needed to leave early today to get to her daughter\u2019s dance recital anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, Miss Melons,\u201d Vivian said, wrapping up, \u201cI can see that you feel bad about this and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll work harder in the future.  I know this is a stressful transition for you, so, since I have to leave anyway, I\u2019m going to let you have the rest of the afternoon off.  It\u2019s already 4:00 anyway so you\u2019re not losing much time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom noticed that Vivian hadn\u2019t said that she thought he\u2019d actually <i>do</i> better, only <i>try</i> harder, which was a bit depressing for him, but he suppressed a final sniffle and thanked her anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, like, really appreciate this, Mrs. Garcia.  I\u2019m totally going to figure out all this professional stuff, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so, Miss Melons.  I\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning, after your meeting with Ms. Huff.  Have a safe drive home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom headed out of Vivian\u2019s office and towards the parking garage, grateful to finally be escaping the building and on his way home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirsty\u2019s stripper heels echoed through the parking garage as Tom headed automatically for his usual parking spot.  His trip down to the garage had been relatively uneventful in that he\u2019d at least been able to avoid serious interaction with anyone, though Kirsty\u2019s \u201ctits first\u201d posture and seductive walk did seem to leave a fair bit of distraction in his wake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the trip down could have gone better.  Tom had been putting off using the bathroom all day, but he\u2019d reached a point where he couldn\u2019t ignore it any longer and ducked into the ladies\u2019 room before heading out rather than trying to hold it in for the entire commute home.  The actual process itself wasn\u2019t that bad, aside from Tom\u2019s frankly unsurprising discovery that Kirsty was the sort of girl who kept her pussy smoothly shaved and liked to wear lacey pink thongs.  Whether it was the help he\u2019d asked for from Tanya or the extra mannerisms she\u2019d forced on him Tom couldn\u2019t remember using the restroom ever having been different; it all seemed perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit that it was a bit un-nerving that, when he\u2019d tried to think of the differences between a men\u2019s room and a ladies\u2019 room he could actually still recall what a men\u2019s room looked like though.  Apparently Kirsty had more than a few trysts in the men\u2019s room at Secrets, which was something Tom could have done without knowing in such graphic detail.  Even that though wasn\u2019t quite as bad as the fact that he, or, rather, Kirsty, had not only spent several minutes in front of the mirror afterwards making sure to touch up her makeup, but that he\u2019d been completely absorbed in it, understanding exactly why it was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he knew about the hobbies and interests he\u2019d acquired from Kirsty, the more embarrassing the whole situation got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching his usual parking spot, Tom received the biggest surprise he\u2019d had since finding himself in Kirsty\u2019s body that morning.  Sitting in the spot was the same car he\u2019d driven in that morning, his prized black on black 911 Turbo S.  It didn\u2019t seem possible that Tanya had overlooked it, but he had to check, even if he knew that his hopes would be dashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through Kirsty\u2019s purse though Tom found the set of keys to his baby.  At this point, Tom was ecstatic.  He\u2019d always loved that car.  Though, now that he was looking at it, he wasn\u2019t quite sure why.  Sure, he knew it was fast, but who needed to go faster than the speed limit?  Anyway, it looked mean and angry.  Cars were supposed to be cute and fun.  And it was so low too; there was no way that it would be easy to get in and out of with a skirt on.  Looking at the car now, he really couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d ever liked the car at all.  It wasn\u2019t even a pretty color like pink or anything, just boring old black, and a dull matte black at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all of Kirsty\u2019s preferences rearranging the way he thought of the car, Tom was still happy because at least it was something constant from his old life.  Something Tanya had somehow missed  Even though he couldn\u2019t manage to stop Kirsty\u2019s cutesy little jump and clap when the button on the remote unlocked the doors, Tom was still in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sat down sideways in the seat, folding his legs in after him, then closed the door and settled into the car, savoring the connection to his former life.  Even the seat was still adjusted for his previous height.  \u201cFirst things first, I suppose,\u201d he though, adjusting the seat and mirrors to suit his new height of 5-foot 1 (and taking a minute or two to primp in the rearview mirror, which still annoyed him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d he said to himself in Kirsty\u2019s squeaky schoolgirl voice, \u201cnow for the fun part,\u201d as he turned the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.  The lights on the dashboard came on, but the engine didn\u2019t even try to crank.  He tried the key again a couple more times, but still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something with the carburetor,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cor the knudson valve?\u201d  He felt like there was something wrong with either of these theories but he didn\u2019t know why.  Tom had vague memories of Kirsty being told by a mechanic that her car needed a new knudson valve and of her paying for its replacement.  Opening the door and stepping out to look for the hood release he found a button on the door sill and did another little jump and clap when the hood popped up a little.  \u201cMaybe the problem is just a loose wire somewhere,\u201d Tom thought as he walked to the front of the car and, finding the release, raised the hood only to be suddenly incredibly confused when there was no engine, only carpeted trunk space.  Something was very wrong, but Tom couldn\u2019t figure it out.  Cars had their engines in the front, he knew that.  Everyone knew that.  But this one didn\u2019t.  It didn\u2019t make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving some trouble, Miss Melons?\u201d  Tanya\u2019s voice rang out in the garage and Tom\u2019s heart sank.  This probably wasn\u2019t going to be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, thanks, but I\u2019ve totally got it under control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?  Let me see if I can start it.\u201d  For some reason, Tom couldn\u2019t resist.  He closed the hood and watched as Tanya got into the car and fired up the engine immediately.  \u201cSeems to be working fine for me,\u201d she said, switching off the engine again and stepping out, \u201cyou try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom got into the car and turned the key.  Just like before, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Huff!  You\u2019re, like, using magic or something to make the car not work for me!  Can\u2019t you just, like, let me go home?\u201d  Kirsty\u2019s body and voice were in full whine mode, but Tanya just chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise, Miss Melons, I am not using any magic to prevent the car from working for you.  It\u2019s just a manual transmission.  You have to press the clutch pedal or it won\u2019t start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d  Tom felt like he should have known that, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t remember ever having driven a car with a manual transmission.  With a sinking feeling he realized that cars weren\u2019t one of Kirsty\u2019s hobbies or interests and that no-one would ever expect them to be, which meant that any car knowledge he might have once had was probably wiped out earlier that day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, like, which pedal is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one on the far left dear.  Just push that one all the way down and the car will start when you turn the key.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom carefully pressed the pedal all the way down and turned the key.  The car fired up instantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAY!\u201d  Again came Kirsty\u2019s adorable little jump/clap which made her incredible breasts bounce wonderfully.  Unfortunately, this also made her foot come off the pedal and the car, being in first gear, lurched forward and stalled, bumping into the concrete wall of the parking garage in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d mused Tanya, \u201cyou really don\u2019t know how to drive a stick shift, do you.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to get this car out of the parking garage, much less back to your house, Miss Melons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stepped out of the car to inspect the damage, then turned away from the car towards Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I, like, totally need to be able to get to my home n\u2019 stuff,\u201d Tom pouted.  \u201cI know this is, like, supposed to be a punishment and junk, but can\u2019t you please make it so that I can drive my car and, like, get to my home n\u2019 stuff?  This is, like, totally important!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya looked passed Tom to the car behind him and then back at Tom, \u201cLet me get this straight, Miss Melons, you are asking me to make it so that you can drive your car to your home so that you can actually be involved with your life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gawd!  Yes!  That would be, like, totes wonderful!\u201d  Tom\u2019s excitement at the idea of being able to drive his car overrode his ability to keep Kirsty\u2019s speech in check and he ended up gushing like a cheerleader asked to Prom by the most popular boy in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snap of Tanya\u2019s fingers echoed through the garage.  \u201cDone.  Miss Melons, you are now able to drive your car back to your home so that you can get back to your life outside of work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much!  I, like, totally don\u2019t know what I woulda done otherwise!\u201d  Tom started to turn back towards the car, but Tanya stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast.  There\u2019s still the matter of the price.  I used magic to help you, so now I get to make more changes of my own choosing.  Surely you didn\u2019t forget that was the deal we had earlier today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom did remember, but he\u2019d been too caught up in the moment earlier to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThat\u2019s, like, <i>so</i> not fair!  I totally couldn\u2019t just stay here all night!  I hafta, like, be able to get myself home n\u2019 stuff!  It wasn\u2019t a favor!\u201d  Tom knew he was going to have to work on paying more attention to Kirsty\u2019s habits; his new default \u201cdebate\u201d style of \u201cfrightened ditz\u201d wasn\u2019t likely to work on anyone who wasn\u2019t trying to get into Kirsty\u2019s panties.  \u201cOn the other hand, that means it\u2019ll work on 100% of the straight male population,\u201d Tom thought to himself.  It wasn\u2019t the sort of consolation he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that to some degree you're right, Miss Melons, you did need a way to get to and from work.  Though I hear that they have these things called 'busses' now...  In any case, giving you what you asked for was a lot of fun all by itself, so I suppose it'll just be a small physical change this time.\u201d  Tanya snapped her fingers once again.  \u201cThere.  Done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom felt a brief shiver go through his body, leaving him slightly aroused but otherwise nothing really felt any different.  \u201cUm, like, Ms. Huff?\u201d  Tom's question trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, Miss Melons, this was just a small change.  I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually, but for now we should really both be getting home, don't you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom figured that, sadistic as Tanya had been, she was also pretty true to her word and if he didn't notice the change right away it probably really was something relatively minor.  In any case, Tanya didn't seem interested in explaining it right now and he really didn't want to risk upsetting her.  Besides, he looked himself over and everything looked the same to him.  Deciding to cut his losses, Tom nodded in agreement and turned back to the car, grateful that he would now be able to drive it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Tom's sense of masculine pride what he found when he turned around was not the 911 he expected, but rather an old, very dented, very pink, Chrysler Neon.  Memories of Kirsty running into various parking lot fixtures to cause most of the dents flowed into Tom's mind; apparently Kirsty's lack of interest in cars had also translated into a lack of interest in learning how to drive well.  Tom really hoped that this hadn't carried over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d  Tom's old voice would have echoed commandingly in the concrete garage, but Kirsty's pleading little squeak didn't have the same effect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Tanya turned back around to face him, \u201cSomething wrong, Miss Melons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou totally lied!  You said I could, like, drive my car n' stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now you can.  You, Kirsty Melons, can now drive the car that belongs to Kirsty Melons.  I did exactly what you asked me to, Miss Melons.  I gave you your car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I, like, wanted <i>my</i> car...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure, Miss Melons?  Don't you think this car is a much better color?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah.  An' it's totally cute n' all...\u201d  Tom was having trouble.  He knew that he should like the 911 better.  He knew that he shouldn't like extra girly color or the cutesy little compact Neon.  But he did now.  The discrepancy between the person he used to be and the new interests and hobbies that kept breaking into his brain, or Kirsty's brain, as it was increasingly beginning to feel like, was incredibly frustrating.  It was also terrifying because while he only had the faintest wisps of memories of what he liked as Tom, Kirsty's interests came through all too clearly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, don't you think people would start asking questions about how a girl like you could afford an expensive sportscar?  What would Tom Sylar have thought of a girl like Kirsty driving a 911?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sighed.  He knew Tanya was right; the assumptions that people would make about how Kirsty Melons had gotten a car like the one Tom Sylar drove would only make things worse, and, embarrassing as it was to admit, his new interests meant that he really did like the Neon's cutesy appearance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...\u201d  Tom's grudging acquiescence was accompanied by a shrug and pout that set his chest bouncing and an expression like a sad puppy.  \u201cI mean, I don't want people to think that I'm, like, some gold digger an' junk...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smiled and reached out, patting Tom on the head.  \u201cThat's a good decision, dear.  I'll see you tomorrow morning.  Have a safe drive home.\u201d  Tanya turned and walked off, leaving Tom to fume over Tanya's newly patronizing tone as he backed Kirsty's Neon out of the parking stall and headed home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive home had been rough on Tom.  The overly feminine car would have been bad enough without the dozen or so strands of Mardi Gras beads hanging from the rear view mirror, along with a tiny disco ball and a few other cheap tinkets.  Kirsty having a collection of Mardi Gras beads wasn't a surprise to him, the girl was a stripper after all, but the beads hung there as an obvious reminder and, thanks to the way Kisrty's preferences were overriding his own, he kind of liked the way they looked hanging from the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the old car's air conditioner wasn't working either, which had forced Tom to roll the windows down during his drive and the fact that he was legitimately feeling worried about how much the airflow was messing up his hair was humiliating.  On the other hand, that was nothing compared to the way he'd automatically winked and blown a kiss to the motorcyclist who stopped beside him at one of the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding one final reminder of his predicament, when he'd turned on the radio for a distraction he found that it was set to a cloying pop station instead of Tom's preferred classic rock.  Jumping through the presets he found they were all set for either pop or club music stations and he was set to manually tune to his former favorite station just as soon as the pop station's song switched over from the surprisingly good song he'd happened to tune into.  It wasn't until three songs later that Tom realized that he'd been dancing in his seat and singing along.  Internally he was mortified, but Kirsty's interest in the song and her bubbly mannerisms won the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had briefly thought about stopping by the dry cleaner's to talk with the owner about his earlier agreement to take her son to prom, but decided that he hadn't actually given the shop keeper his name there really wasn't anything she could do about him not showing up.  Besides, he reasoned, he didn't need any rumors flying around about Kirsty and underage kids.  He also wasn't sure that he'd be able to deal with the fact that, with the way he talked now and the things he was interested in, even high school kids were likely to look down on him intellectually.  That was a reminder he didn't need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the focus on his embarrassment over the car and his evaluation of his decision not to stop at the dry cleaners, Tom didn't even notice that he hadn't driven to Tom Sylar's house, but instead to an old apartment block in a part of town that, while not exactly dangerous (\u201cThank God for small favors,\u201d he thought musing on Kirsty's defenseless little body) was certainly rather run down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom cringed a little realizing the full meaning of Tanya's promise of \u201cyour car, your home, and your life\u201d and, hope triumphing over experience, tried and failed to remember where he'd lived as Tom Syler.  All he could remember now was that he lived here, in apartment 32E.  \u201cTanya certainly did everything to make sure I couldn't forget this,\u201d he thought bitterly as he reflected on the appropriateness of the apartment number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing once more, he opened the door and stepped into Kirsty's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKirsty?  Is that you,\u201d called a woman's voice as Tom's mind suddenly grasped a memory of a roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, like, know it is, Becky.\u201d  The memory of a roommate fleshed itself out more and Tom suddenly knew that Becky was another dancer at Secrets, a 5'10\u201d lithe redhead with an athletic build, perky natural C-cup breasts, and freckles that certain clients just loved.  Another memory jumped in as Tom suddenly knew that Kirsty considered Becky to be \u201cvery smart\u201d since Becky was working at Secrets to help pay for a college degree in information science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so glad you're home early, Kirsty.  Some friends and I are going out tonight, you should come along.\u201d  The voice seemed to be coming from what Kirsty knew was Becky's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds totally fun,\u201d Tom found himself honestly exclaiming as he found himself trapped with another of Kirsty's interests.  \u201cJust give me, like, a half hour or so to get ready an' stuff, K?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for Becky's reply, Tom all but skipped into Kirsty's room, excited for the evening.  Kirsty's car had been girly, but the room somehow managed to out do it.  Aside from the unsurprising pink and white color scheme, Kirsty's bed was a pretty, if obviously second- or third-hand, four-post bed with a mock canopy.  The sort that was exactly what you'd expect from a woman named \u201cKirsty Melons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really do love that bed,\u201d thought Tom, \u201cthose posts are so pretty...and useful when a guy ties me up...\u201d  Tom shook his head, trying to avoid the realization that, one, such a thought had occurred to him and, two, that the thought of it had brought a warm, damp feeling to Kirsty's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom closed the door and turned to the mirror.  \u201cWell Tom,\u201d he thought, \u201cmight as well get a good look at what you've ended up as before slutting it up for the club tonight.  God, I can't believe I'm looking forward to that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom pulled off the heels and set them aside, surprised at just how much bigger everything looked now that he was barefoot in Kirsty's 5'1\u201d body.  Next came the jacket, laid gently across the back of a chair, then the skirt and blouse.  Standing there in just Kirsty's pink thong and lacey bra he turned to look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's just, like, soooo not fair...\u201d Tom whined quietly in Kirsty's schoolgirl-on-helium voice as he noticed that, sitting just above the waistband of the thong and below his belly button was  a tattoo of a cupcake with the words \u201cEat Me\u201d.  He knew that hadn't been there earlier when he'd gone to the bathroom at the office.  It must have come with Tanya's \u201cminor\u201d physical change.  As he turned around to look himself over more thoroughly, he noticed two more tattoos on his back.  One on his lower back that simply said, \u201cHarder! Faster!\u201d in script and, written upside down across Kirsty's back at roughly shoulder level was the phrase, \u201cMy name is Kirsty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse than being stuck with the body of the type of girl who would choose these sorts of \u201chelpful\u201d tattoos though was the fact that the more Tom looked at them, the more cleaver and fun they seemed.  After all, sex was definitely one of Kirsty's hobbies and Tom was beginning to realize just how much attention Kirsty paid to that hobby.  Tom's mind wandered a bit from thinking about the tattoos themselves to the way men reacted to them, Kirsty's mind imagining just how quickly a man's pants tightened when he saw her tramp stamp, and how much fun they tended to have later...  \u201cPlus they never forget my name,\u201d he thought with an embarrassing mental giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm, damp feeling in his crotch grew more intense and as he thought about clubbing with Becky his bra and panties seemed suddenly superfluous.  Kirsty giggled.  Her tight little club skirt would cover just enough to prevent an indecent exposure charge and a halter top would hold her massive tits in well enough for what she had in mind.  She slipped off her bra and Tom got his first look at Kirsty\u2019s chest.  The breasts were huge and obviously fake; they sat proudly up and out on her chest, her thick nipples permanently poking out thanks to a silver barbell piercing in each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty\u2019s nipple piercings hadn\u2019t fazed Tom too much; after the tattoos the piercings had seemed pretty much in character, but it was when Kirsty shed her thong that Tom really got a shock.  Kirsty now sported a pair of labia piercings.  Those definitely hadn\u2019t been there earlier when he\u2019d stopped in the office bathroom.  Kirsty\u2019s mind positively purred over the memories of men discovering her \u201cjewelry box.\u201d  \u201cMmmmm,\u201d she said aloud, softly, \u201cand when they find out about the tongue stud\u2026\u201d  Kirsty automatically licked her lips and Tom, for the first time, realized that she now sported a small barbell through her tongue as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too much for him and he sat down on Kirsty\u2019s bed.  Tanya\u2019s most recent changes were indeed technically minor, but they definitely made sure that Tom was aware of just what Kirsty\u2019s hobbies were.  And, thanks to the fact that Kirsty\u2019s hobbies were now Tom\u2019s, he was getting revved up just thinking of them.  Not good.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom sat on Kirsty\u2019s bed fighting with Kirsty\u2019s personality over the evening\u2019s plans.  Despite the fact that Tom Syler knew that going out for an evening with a Secrets dancer and her friends would be a problem, especially with all the little bits of Kirsty that Tanya had shoved into his brain, those same bits and pieces meant that he <i>really did</i> want to go out and have fun.  No matter how much he knew that it wasn\u2019t the way Tom Syler would have seen things, the more he thought about spending an evening out with Becky, the better it sounded\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky <i>does</i> know a lot of really smart guys,\u201d the Kirsty part of him thought, \u201cand they\u2019re usually really, <i>really</i> hot\u2026  And well-hung.\u201d  A moan that was all Kirsty escaped his lips and Tom slowly realized that during his internal debate Kirsty had slid her hand between her thighs and she\u2019d been gently massaging her clit for the last couple of minutes.  Even though Tom knew he should stop, Kirsty\u2019s habits were overpowering.  Tom lay back on Kirsty\u2019s bed as her silky smooth legs spread themselves allowing easier access to an incredibly wet slit.  The wetness meant that Kirsty\u2019s manicured fingers slid smoothly into her vagina despite its tightness and Tom\u2019s mind filled with memories of Kirsty absolutely loving how firmly her little tunnel held onto her favorite part of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm!  Oh FUCK yes!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn\u2019t even realize he was practically screaming until Becky knocked on his door.  \u201cKirsty!  You can get yourself off later!  Just get ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom quickly pulled Kirsty\u2019s fingers out of herself, wiping them on the bed sheets without thinking in a way that, had he had his wits about him, would have suggested to him that Kirsty got caught like this a lot.  \u201cSorry Becky!  I, like, got distracted an\u2019 stuff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the whole floor knows you got distracted hon.\u201d  Tom could hear Becky\u2019s laugh through the closed door.  \u201cJust get ready, OK?  The guys will be upset if we\u2019re too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confirmation that Becky\u2019s friends were guys only made the frustration that Kirsty was feeling from not having finished her impromptu solo session worse, and Kirsty\u2019s excitement about men combined with how disoriented Tom\u2019s brain was after even that little \u201cplaytime\u201d meant that Kirsty was in full control as she dressed and primped for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easily 40 minutes later when Kirsty bounced out of her room and into the main room of the apartment.  Tom was mortified knowing that he\u2019d tried on at least a dozen outfits, some more than once, before settling on a pink halter top that put Kirsty\u2019s midriff and bust on full display (\u201cI paid good money for the twins and they\u2019re spectacular so I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t show them off\u201d) and a pair of black short-shorts that were so tight that they may as well have been painted on.  Kirsty finished off the look with a pair of 6\u201d black platform \u201cfuck me\u201d boots that came up to the middle of her calves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all the trouble deciding on an outfit, most of Kirsty\u2019s delay came from sitting down to change her makeup and hair.  The hair didn\u2019t take too long as Kirsty satisfied herself with tidying up any stray locks that had worked themselves out of place during the workday, and Tom, though unsurprised, was very annoyed to find that he now cared deeply about making sure that his hair was just right.  \u201cAfter all,\u201d he\u2019d thought to himself, \u201cno boy wants a girl who doesn\u2019t take care of how she looks.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t terribly happy about Kirsty\u2019s desire to look good for \u201cboys\u201d but the fact remained that the thought of a man wanting her was an integral part Kirsty\u2019s favorite things.  The makeup had taken much longer because he\u2019d had to clean off what he\u2019d been wearing at the office and start fresh to make sure that everything was right for an evening out.  Even though he\u2019d expected as much, Tom was amazed that he now knew exactly how to apply makeup for full effect as he watched Kirsty\u2019s tiny feminine hands transform her cute and innocent face into one which, thanks to bright lipstick and a sizeable amount of pinkish-gold eye shadow, now looked hot and ready for anything a man might suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time!\u201d  Becky\u2019s chiding was friendly and Tom felt himself falling to Kirsty\u2019s impulse to smile and stick out her tongue without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re, like, gonna go to the trouble of finding us some boys to play with I hafta look good, don\u2019t I?\u201d  Tom cringed inwardly but figured that this wasn\u2019t the time to go against Kirsty\u2019s instincts; he didn\u2019t want Becky to start wondering why her roommate was acting differently all of a sudden.  Besides, thanks to all of Kirsty\u2019s habits and mannerisms he was now truly horrified at the idea of going out without being \u201cdone up,\u201d especially when there were men involved.  \u201cSo, um, where are we going?\u201d</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re going to a bar for drink and then we\u2019re going dancing,\u201d Becky said, Tom felt a bit conflicted about that, mostly because the idea really appealed to him \u2013 he could see himself dancing and grinding those surgically enhanced curves against one of Becky\u2019s friends on the dance floor- but he knew that not too long ago none of that would have ever crossed his mind. \u201cUh, hello?

He could picture in vivid detail the different shades Kristy had looked at.  Tom had gotten completely lost in Kristy\u2019s interests as he\u2019d gotten dressed, but he found those memories unsettling. \u2018How much of me is going to be left when this is all over?\u2019 he thought. \u201cKristy, what\u2019s wrong with you?

It was sort of like air was filling his mind somehow. Suddenly Tom could remember himself as a teenage girl going through high school. He remembered struggling to grasp the things that most of his classmates understood easily. He could feel the frustration at having to repeat freshman year over and over again, remembering the first time a teacher offered some *extra-credit* after school to help her grades. But he recalled how even after many such encounters the only thing he got any better at was having sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the world?\u201d Tom asked, grasping the side of his blonde head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t do give you Ms. Melon\u2019s education and not the memories that came with them,\u201d Tanya explained. \u201cEducation is more than mere titles and certificates or the simple breadth of knowledge one acquire, but also the experiences that formed that knowledge.\u201d Tom looked at Tanya questioningly, \u201cBreasts of knowledge, what?

But your jackets ready now.\" the matronly shopkeeper replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok thank you anyway\" Tom replied and fumbled with the pink wallet. His long nails made even the simpliest tasks a chore. Eventually he prized it open only for a waterfall of change and, to his embarrassment, two unmistakable silver condom packets. The shop keep looked Tom up and down dissaprovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm....I like to be prepared\" Tom mumbled with an a apologetic smile and scooped up the spilt contents before handing over the cash Vivian gave him. The shop keep just handed over the change and shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom minced his way back out onto the street and blushed bright red with the whistles and cat calls that followed him. Whilst he purchased the rest of Vivians stuff it occurred to him that his earlier idea of purchasing a new outfit might not be out of the question. First he needed some cash so on his way back to the office he teetered over to an ATM. Finding his new bank card he realised he had no idea what Kirsty's pin number was. \"Damnit! Come on think!\" he cursed in his girly voice. Then he had an idea, he had a ditzy girlfriend once that was always forgetting her pin so she wrote it on the back of a passport photo. Fumbling through the pink wallet, he found a passport sized photo of his new face looking particularly vacant. Sure enough there were four numbers written on the back. He quickly punched them in using a pink nailed finger and celebrated by punching a dainty fist in the air when it was accepted \"Yes!\" he shouted in a squeaky voice drawing stares from people passing by. Tom didn't care, finally something was going right. His smile soon disappeared when he checked his balance, there was only $156 in the account! \"What the fuck!\" Tom squealed in anger. There's was over a month until pay day, how would he survive! He was used to having so much cash he never checked his account. Feeling totally depressed he ejected the card without withdrawing any cash. He would have to be frugal until payday so he would have to make do with these slutty clothes for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later Tom made it back to office. He was dying for a pee so he made his way to the lavatories. Steeling himself Tom entered unchartered territory - the ladies bathroom. He made his way to a cubicle and pulled down the tiny skirt to reveal a pink lacy thong covering a neatly shaved pussy. Unhappily he pulled down and looked at his new equipment with discussed. \" I don't deserve this!\" he exclaimed in his bimbo voice ad he relieved himself....herself now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside he heard the door open and two women enter and stand by the sink. He recognised the voices as Annie and Jan. Tom wasn't ready to face two of his conquests in his bimbo body. So he sat and listened to there conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shanghai! It's just like that slimeball to fall on his feet!\" Annie said acidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Annie! Lighten up your just saw because he dumped you. With a guy like Tom you just enjoy the ride and what a ride!\" Jan laughed \"I'll miss him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God Jan your 37 and married! When are you going to stop being such a slut\" Annue replied clearly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having fun darling. Speaking of sluts have you seen this new girl yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she wobbled through reception earlier. I would have took her for a call girl but then I remembered Roy Johnson had retired. Honestly Jan, Kirsty Melons! Her tits are the size of melons! She'll give you a run for your money. The guys are all tripping over their tongues\" Annine laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard she used to be a lap dancer. The little bimbo better stay out my way!\" Jan said with venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom listened in horror. One day as a girl and he had a reputation as a slut! He hadn't even done anything yet. How would he ever get anywhere like this! After the gossiping women left Tom made his way to Vivians office. His new boss wasn't there so she dropped off the jacket, salad and cigarettes . On the table was a note from Vivian:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Melons, I'm in a meeting for most of the afternoon. Please.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom pulled up outside a run-down apartment block on the wrong side of town. It had been an eventful journey from Vivian's office. He had decided to pick up his new security pass on the way out of the office to save time tomorrow morning. The facilities manager Ted's eyes nearly popped out when he opened his office door to the sight of Tom's enormous cleavage. Tom had giggled nervously and explained that he was the new girl, whilst Ted took down some details, never once looking up past Tom's chest level and left to fetch a log a new pass with security, trying unsuccessfully to hide the tent that had formed in his trousers. Tom let out a dainty little sigh as Ted left and perched on Ted's desk while he waited. \"I guess I'll have to get use to that\" he said to himself. After all if he still had a dick, it would be rock hard at the sight of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ted was out of the office, Tom over heard a conversation between two guys coming down the hallway and wasn't surprised to hear the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you man she is one hot piece of ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, have you seen her lips? I bet she could suck a grapefruit through a hosepipe! and those tits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know man, they have to be the size of cantaloupes at least. Hey have you entered the sweepstake on who bangs her first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not worth it dude, Tom Sylar will win that easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude haven't you heard? Sylar's gone off to the Shanghai office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I might stand a chance after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in line my friend, get in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was disgusted as he listened to the conversation disappear down the hall. He had took part in those sweepstakes plenty of times with college in-terns and work experience girls. He never thought he would be on the receiving end and it didn't feel good. Tom was ashamed of all he times he had made bets over who would bag a girl, like they were a prize to be one rather than a human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ted came back with the new pass (and an enormous erection), Tom made his way to the underground car park. He wasn't a bit surprised to see that his brand new Porsche had been replaced with a beat up VW Beetle. But did it have to be painted bright pink with a Playboy bunny stencilled on the front bonnet! Tossing his purse in the back, Tom noticed some opened condom packets on the floor of the back seat. \"That must have been uncomfortable!\" he thought to himself. hopefully he would never find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finally Tom was at his new home, heels clicking on the dirty hallway floor as he made his way to the apartment number on Kirsty's drivers license. He opened the door to a pokey one bedroom apartment a far cry from the spacious up market place he had left this morning. \"Home sweet home!\" he squeaked sarcastically to him self. A quick tour revealed that Kirsty wasn't the tidiest of girls. The lounge was littered with fashion and gossip magazines. The small kitchen area was home to unwashed dishes and pizza boxes. The bathroom was filled with an array of beauty products. The bedroom contained an unmade bed (with pink sheets of course) and an over flowing chest of draws. Tom sat on the bed and unbuckled his slutty platform heels, which felt more like torture devices than footwear. His feet were killing him. Stepping out of them gave him a both a feeling of relief and annoyance when he realised how much shorter he was. Tom stripped off the work clothes (if you could call them that) and looked for something more comfortable to wear. Standing in just a thong and bra Tom opened the closet door and caught sight of the underwear-clad huge breasted bimbo reflected in the mirror on the rear of the door. It was very erotic view and Tom felt a slippery wet feeling growing in his crotch. For the first time he noticed his belly button was pierced with a silver stud and a little chain hanging down with a star on the bottom. Sticking out his tongue he noted that that this was pierced with a ball stud, he knew from experience that this improved fellatio technique. \"Oh my God, what have I become!\" he cried out loud. He tried to take the studs out but found that they seemed to be missing catches. The same went for cheap looking hoop earrings and the gold \"sexy\" pendant. \"Of course Tanya wouldn't make it that easy for me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the matter at hand he flicked through closet and noticed with distress that it contained very little in the way of practical clothing, in fact most made todays outfit practically conservative. All the clothes were either pink, white or pink and white. He could see very little that would be appropriate for work in an office. \"I'll cross that bridge tomorrow morning, lets just get dressed before I cream myself at my own refection\". In the end he pulled on some pink sweat pants that were extremely tight across the ass and a Hooters top, which he guessed was from a previous job. The top only just stretched across Tom's huge surgically enhanced tits and left his midriff bare. He decided it would do for now, but as he turned he caught sight of the small of his back, which sported a tattoo  just above the cleft of his peachy ass. It spelled out \"Slut\" in italic writing. \"Oh god!\" Tom yelled \"That bitch, how could she do this to me!\". That was the final straw, his life as an successful executive had been stolen from him and he had ben left with the smutty life of a cheap slutty bimbo. No one would ever take him seriously again. A days worth of emotion welled up and giving into to her new hormones, the new Kirsty Melons collapsed crying onto her much used bed......</span></div></div>",

As usual every mans head turned to see the blonde bombshell mince unsteadily with her huge creamy bust barely held in check by the light pink mini-dress she was wearing. Long golden blonde hair framing a heavily made-up face with full pouty lips smothered in glittery pink gloss that for some reason looked perpetually embarrassed. The sight of the walking wet-dream caused a delivery driver to drop his clip board as he passed it to Annie, the receptionist, who sighed and shook her head. \"What a nerve that slut has to come into work dressed like that everyday\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom made his way to Mrs Garcia's office. He hated going to work these days. It had been three weeks since Tanya Huff had taken his life as a high flying exec away and sentenced him to the life of a huge breasted ex-stripper with no qualifications. He was still Viviviene's \"assistant\", which meant general dogsbody. To think three weeks ago he was looking forward to having his own office and now he didn't even have a desk. No doubt he would spend the day jiggling and mincing around the office running errands, desperately trying to ward off the advances of the men in the office whilst attempting to make a good professional impression. So far he had failed spectacularly and who could blame him. Nobody in the office looked beyond his tits and even the most insightful business comment sounded incredulous when spoken in his high-pitched bimbo accent. Of course this was Tanya's intent. Despising his womanising ways, she wanted to make sure that Tom's only course of action was to use sex to get what he wanted or give up. So far he had resisted lowering himself to that level, despite being asked out by nearly every single man in the office (and some of the married ones).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Mrs Garcia\" he squeaked with a smile on entering Vivienne's office. Vivian looked her up and down disapprovingly, what was she to do with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Miss Melons. Can I ask you once again to review your wardrobe next pay day please, your outfit is hardly within the company's dresscode\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try Mrs Garcia\" Tom blushed. Little did she know that Tom had done exactly that. The first thing he had done when he got his pay-check last week (after getting over the shock of how small it was) was to go and buy himself a smart and professional looking dark grey pants suit and blouse along with some black low heeled shoes. Excited he had returned home and tried on the new outfit. It was an expensive purchase with his now minuscule wage but he was pleased that he finally had a respectable suit for the office. But as he twirled in the mirror he was horrified when in a blink of an eye the pant-suit turned into the the pink spendex mini-dress he was currently wearing and the smart shoes transformed into the cheap slutty platform shoes of a stripper. Whilst sobbing into his pillow he realised that Tanya wasn't going to make this easy for him. The same went for his make-up, every night he washed it off and every morning he woke up tasting the sickly strawberry gloss that appeared on his lips overnight. His long shiny nails made even the simplest tasks a chore but every time he trimmed them they grew back half an inch past his dainty fingers within seconds. In short he was stuck as living breathing \"Stripper Barbie\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivienne sighed and adressed her in the tone she always used when talking to Kirsty, that of an adult talking to a toddler. \"Now Miss Melon's, over the last few weeks you have shown have that you are.....capable and maybe its time I gave you something a little more difficult to do than making coffee\" although god knows she still struggled with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's ears pricked up. At last he might get a chance to impress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided to assign you to another member of the administrative staff so that you can get a bit more experience. please reaport to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Margaret Doe, Junior Accountant,\" Tom muttered, reading through the file. \"Nothing interesting here... graduated high school with a 3.4... not honor roll, but not a looser. Two year college degree in business accounting... lots of admin assistant stuff in here.\"  Leafing through the packet he glanced at the few photos the personal jacket held... she was short, a little on the doughy side with thick glasses and dark hair worn in an unflattering pony tail. In short, the kind of girl that no one looked at. \"Resume is pretty lack luster. Volunteer work for senior citizen groups, dishwasher... this girl is plain enough she didn't even make the cut to be a waitress. The most interesting thing on here is a semester spent interning for Victoria's Secret... as an inventory auditor. Where did you find a girl this dull?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you're staring at her. Or you will be anyway,\" Tanya smiled. \"Turn and look at the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom did as she'd asked and glanced at the long mirror that was mounted to the back of the door to her office. Then he did more than glance as he watched the reflection begin to change. His sandy hair darkened to a deep brown even as it grew longer and longer before pulling itself tightly into a pony tail. Glasses appeared on his nose and his vantage point began to move closer to the ground as he shrank from his lofty height of 6'2\" to a considerably shorter 5'4\". Pressure built inside him as muscle dissolved into layer upon layer of soft feminine fat, fleshing out his cheeks, rounding his hips and inflating his ass. His expensive and tailored suit became an off the rack Sears discount special... and a skirt suit at that, while he regained an inch of height from his shoes as they morphed into a sensible pair of brown pumps. A swelling filled his chest as his rock hard pecs became soft feminine breasts. Tom held his breath in mix of anticipation and dread as the breasts grew, but found himself strangely disappointed when they stopped in the B-cup range, and most of that size from the general layer of fat that covered his new form. Finally, the greatest horror, he felt his manhood shrivel and constrict within himself, becoming the soft love tunnel of this overweight virgin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god...\" he said, only to cut off in surprise at the mousy and soft voice that emerged from his lips. \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I thought you would be less of a bother to the female population around here if you walked on the other side of the fence. And this way, you're not even competition for people like Jan and myself. Now... you've been reassigned from Sales to Accounting... I'm afraid the pay isn't as good, but the benefit is that you don't lose your job all together and get sued for sexual harassment, so I guess that's a plus. Now, off with you,\" she said dismissively. \"I have more important work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you can't leave me like this! It's not right! I shouldn't be this... thing... this boring plain nobody! I worked hard to get where I was damn it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right <i>Margaret</i>,\" Tanya said smiling wickedly. \"I'll grant you that. You did work hard. I'll tell you what.  If you want, I'll give you a chance to change your situation. Improve yourself. Get back some of what you've lost. But, you have to be willing to work for it, so tell me <i>Margaret</i>... are you willing to work for it?\"</span></div></div>",

Using Margafet's own words, \"I won't force you to keep that <i>boring plain nobody</i> body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Margaret's frame, Tom was cowering, already feeling terrified by how quickly she'd caved. Surely the life of a simple secretary wasn't beyond him! Was it? Maybe she was right, if it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her emphasis, her re-use of his words still made the hair stand up on the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted.\" she said, extending a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret paused a moment, as if uncertain, before extending her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new opportunity and a new life.\" she told Marge as she give it a firm shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ominous dread filled 's stomach, spreading quickly through her body. It transformed Margaret from a boring plain nobody, into a bodacious secretary with an incredible body. Marge felt her bust swell, her waist shrink, and her ass expand until her skirt looked painted on. Fear flashed over her face, as she knew she'd been played. But her objections died, as she tasted the waxy lipstick coating her lips in a deep, glossy red. Her vision blurred, losing sight of Tonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the newly formed glasses back into place. Margaret was greeted with view of her new physique. Mountainous breasts, already pulling painfully at her shoulders. She could feel the tight band of her bra digging in. A shimmy in her seat, also informed her of what felt like a lacy suspender belt, the straps passing beneath her thong underwear. Already digging too deeply into the depths of what felt like a canyon of ass cleavage. The fasteners to her stockings, and their lacy details pressing firmly, and now visible through her too tight skirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom flipped the file open, inside was the profile of a 20 year old woman called rather amusingly Alexandria Sylar, who was apparently the companies newest Junior Assistant Accountant, effectively a good job in the company, good for newly qualified people fresh out of university. Although from the girl's file she appeared to be slightly over qualified, having qualified with honours while working some low income jobs paying herself though university: assistant at a nail bar, Hooters waitress and her last role as an \"dancer and stripper\" at a lap dancing club called \"Secrets\". Tom had been to that club many times with clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What this? You want me to meet this girl or something?\" he asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way Mr Sylar\" she said and snapped her fingers again. \"Take another look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked down at the file but couldn't see anything new. And then he noticed his fingers holding the file. They were now much more slender and sporting manicured nails painted in a clear nail polish. Dropping the file to look at his hands, he felt a jiggle on his chest and looked down to see two slightly over average tits barely appeared held back by a bra that was underneath a white blouse he was now wearing as long brown (brunette) hair framed his view. Grabbing his new assets, Tom jumped up out the chair only to wobble on a pair of three inch black open toe pumps  and fell back into the chair with a slight girly squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell have you done to me!\" Tom squealed and grabbed his mouth at the sound of his now high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya was laughing so hard at him she could barely talk. \"Oh Tom... your face..... Why don't you see for yourself...\" She snapped her finger again and a large dress mirror appeared next Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom turned to the mirror and slowly stood up, wobbling on his new footwear. He watched the girl in the mirror do the same. Her long straight  hair brunette flowed down over her shoulders and had a few streaks of purple tints. The hair framed a pretty, it was lightly made up, face with full lips covered in light pink gloss. four silver studs two in each of her ears. She was wearing a black skirt and jacket over her blouse and bra that was holding back her breast. They must have been at least C cup, but on her frame they looked OK. Nestled just above the mouth-watering cleavage was a gold pendent that spelt the word \"Alex\". The skirt reached just above her knees. Beneath the skirt Tom could feel the nauseating pull of a thong nestling in his now tight peachy behind and in some very different anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya come and stood behind the new girl as her mouth worked in shock. Tom noticed that he was now at least four inches and is about average hight about 5.6. \"Please...\" he spoke \"I've learned my lesson, turn me back. I'll leave the company. I'll give you all my money. Anything, just turn me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not Miss Sylar\" Tanya said using his new humiliating name. \"For years you've galavanted around this company using your charm and connections to get where you wanted to be and who ever you wanted into your bed. Well now I've taken all that away, you have no connections here anymore. Your going to see what it is like from the other side. As far as this company is concerned Tom Sylar has left to work in our Shanghai office. He had to leave straight away to cover an ill executive and take over his management role, perhaps for good. Meanwhile you will walk out of this office as Alexandria Sylar, Tom's sister who is inteligent, clever, a tomboy and an exelant prospect for future promoton fresh out of university who had to become a stripper to get herself though university and left with top grades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. People can't see me like this. You can't make me work here...as a...girl!\" Tom cried in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not Miss Sylar. You are free to leave and go back to working in Secrets\" Tanya said sadistically. Seeing Tom's defeated look Tanya continued. \"You will leave here and report to the Accountant office from where you will work for now on and you'll meet Mr Williams who will give you your fist job as a Junior Assistant Accountant. But I will make a deal with you. If you can rise to a position of management, any management, then I will turn you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I possibly do that! I'm a girl\" Tom squeaked in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you use whatever means you have at your disposal\" Tanya said suggestively. \"That's what I did. You can see for yourself how degrading it is to have to rely on your body to get where you want in life. In any case I have left you your intelligence...for now... use it wisely and I'm sure you'll make a Full Accountant within a few years.\" Tanya laughed nastily. \"Now get out there and get to work. Oh and Miss Sylar...\" She said putting an arm around you. \"If you cross me again or try and tell anyone what I have done to you, the there will be even more punishment. Do you understand Miss Sylar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuivering Tom looked up into Tanya's eyes. \"Yes\" he said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what? I'm your boss now Miss Sylar\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Huff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl and don't forget your purse?\" she said handing him a black leather purse with red skulls on it that magically appeared in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom felt like crying. Today he had expected to fill the shoes of a high rolling executive. In stead he opened Tanya's office door wobbled unsteadily out in the heels of Alexandria Sylar......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now....</span></div></div>",

At the snap of her fingers the room went pitch black and just as suddenly the lights came back, but Tom instantly felt off. He immediately noticed the platinum blonde hair that covered one of his eyes, when he tried to brush it away he was struck by the long, pink nails that capped the slender finger of his once manly hands. \u201cWhat have you done to me?!\u201d he asked, his eye growing large as he heard his new, high pitched and undeniably feminine voice. His brow furrowed as he thought of how familiar the voice sounded familiar somehow. \u201cHow dimwitted could you be, really?\u201d Tanya asked, once again snapping her fingers, producing a hand held mirror from thin air this time and handing it to Tom. Starting back from the mirror was a face Tom was quite familiar with, it was Melissa Johnson, Roy\u2019s Trophy wife and his third wife overall. She was the poste child for a trophy wife, with platinum blonde hair, a flawless, yet heavily made up face, and a body that few would question had been enhanced with reality TV star proportions courtesy of her husband\u2019s wealth. Tom could feel the tight bodycon dress hugging every surgically enhanced curve of his new body and the straps of an expensive pair of heels on his new feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou turned me into Melissa? What? How?! Why??!\u201d he asked, putting the mirror down and patting his new body to see if it was some sort of illusion. It wasn\u2019t to his chagrin, and he felt every pinch and prod he attempted on his new, curvaceous body. \u201cWhy? So you will finally understand what it\u2019s like to be thought of as nothing more than a toy to entertain the puerile fantasies of a man. From now on you will be nothing but a silly trophy wife and no one will think you even remotely capable of having an informed opinion on anything but the most vapid topics.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tried to get up to either run or punch Tanya, he wasn\u2019t sure, but all he managed was to trip over his new heels and ended up on his knees in front of the witch. \u201cGood grief, how do you expect me to walk in these ridiculous things?! You can\u2019t do this to me Tanya, turn me back, please\u201d he complained, fighting hard not to look even more pathetic than he already did looking up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can and I did. I\u2019m not merciless though, I can help you with moving in that new body of yours, would you like that?\u201d she asked with the look of a cat toying with a mouse. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tsk, tsk, tsk, what do we say?\u201d Tanya admonished as though she were talking to a child. Tom tried to clench his fist but felt his long nails press against the palm of his hands, a further reminder of the strange situation he found himself in. \u201cPlease Tanya, help me move in this body without tripping,\u201d Tom was fighting back tears, which only aggravated him more. He hadn\u2019t cried since he was a child and suddenly he was barely able to keep from becoming a sobbing mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you beg so nicely I\u2019ll be nice and make it so you can move in that body \u2026 just like the bimbo, trophy wife you\u2019ve become \u2026\u201d and with that Tanya snapped her fingers again and Tom felt a dull ache in his now blonde head. At least he\u2019d be able to stand up in the ridiculously tall heels Tanya had made him wear. \u201cStand up, Melly,\u201d she said, using the nickname everyone used for Roy\u2019s wife, driving home once again just who Tom had become now. As Tom stood up he made sure to keep his knees close together, he struck his rear out and gave Tanya a nice look down his significant cleavage. What? Why did he do that? Once he was standing again his stance was decidedly feminine; he tried to stand more like a man, but Tanya just chuckled, \u201cOh, Melly, you look like a kid trying to act like a grown up. It\u2019s too funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Tom asked, looking more and more like the airheaded Melissa than the strong and powerful man he used to be. \u201cI told you I would help you move in your new body and now you move just like the brainless, bimbo you appear to be. You can try to move like a guy if you want, but you\u2019ll find you\u2019re no longer the commanding presence that walked into my office a little while ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to be able to walk in these heels without tripping over myself, I didn\u2019t ask for all this!\u201d Tom complained, gesturing to his new body. \u201cYes, well, I didn\u2019t ask to be treated like a fool and it still happened. It\u2019s high time you learned. Now, I have stuff to do. Perhaps you should visit your new husband, Mrs. Johnson,\u201d Tanya replied angrily, almost pushing Tom out of her office. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grabbed the bannister, but even standing.... everything felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/5a/2b/bb5a2bb4104ae82baa768cbfde096a46.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/5a/2b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wrongness washed over Tom in a tsunami of sensations. His free hand dipped from his glasses to his crotch. Confirming that he was absolutely a she. Tom was Junko! The firm hand pressing against her skirt, drove the satin panties against her sensitive crotch. She felt the spaghetti straps of her camisole run over her shoulders. The icy satin against her nips making them stiffen on contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u305d\u3046\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\" she barked in perfect Japanese. Though her voice lacked any authority, sounding more like yipping puppy than an intimidating dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She said more slowly, more carefully. \"This isn't right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko realised she was now an inch or two shorter than Tanya. She quailed at the idea, as Tom she'd enjoyed intimidating and arguing folk to his side. Hell, frankly it was just bullying with those beneath him. Now, as Junko that wasn't an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll see you don't meet anyone like Tom.\" She assured the nervous new girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You work in a female only part of the office, and you only have one person to satisfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko's shoulders sank with relief. Already unsettled from her body, she absolutely didn't want to be sexually harrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe '<i>Ahem</i>...\" coming from behind her was reassuringly feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smiled, as Junko turned to face her boss and mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ.\" she spat the words in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss was dressed (if that was the right word), in just some latex and leather outfit. A cat of nine tails held ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/07/76/da077672046bfd482408dd92486176d9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/07/76/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you may address me as 'Mistress', or 'Mistress Jun'.\" she assured the newest company intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking the whip aside, she spoke, \"I expect obedience from my girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko took in their two respective outfits. But her office clothes left her feeling more vulnerable and exposed that the woman in front of her. Mistress Jun looked her over as if she had x-ray vision and could see her very soul, and every secret she'd ever kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/ff/18/46ff185dc333c2955232a92f9de42675.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/ff/18/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko paused, wetting her lips, unsure how to answer. But seeing the brewing storm on her face, quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y.Yes. I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd barely closed her mouth before the air between them cracked deafeningly. The cat-o-nine-tails flailing the air between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Mistress Jun. I understand.\" The word ripped from Junko's soul before she could think. Adrenaline and fear filling in the gaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/f7/65/03f765ed40ce9ca2738a18afd4589200.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/f7/65/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko cowered, expecting blows to fall. But, only a hand came forth, stroking her long mane of hair. As if calming a startled pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like her, she's a quick learner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistress Jun spoke directly to Tanya, is if she weren't worthy of any attention.</span></div></div>",

It made no sense to bring Jan in as his replacement... she was a PA, not a salesman. How would she manage to help with anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jan,\" Tanya continued as she took a seat behind her own impressive desk, laying out their employee files. \"You know we've been thinking a great deal down here about who could step in and replace Roy.

His thoughts jarred to a halt, as he felt the room rise around him. The smirk on Tonya's face was unmistakable, she was behind... whatever this was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya remained the same height, as another spell of dizziness hit Tom. He tried to speak, to ask Tanya what was going on.... But his voice came out as little more than a high-pitched squeak before dying in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to cry out again, as he felt his clothes unravel into threads, which dropped towards the office floor, before turning to dust, and blowing away on an air conditioned breeze. Only in his jocks, Tom tried to project confidence in the face of it all. His expensive watch still on his wrist only made him feel more naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya drank him in like he was a piece of meat, his toned stomach something he was proud of, and his general fitness. He kept his half-marathons as a quiet hobby. But his body was fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems almost a shame.\" Tonya observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you'll be a different kind of eye-candy, for your new job, Iris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hazy memory of calling someone eye candy, of dismissing them, of groping them, made Tom queasy. Bringing back the sensation of drunken misbehaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so... so... sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom extended a hand in apology, only to notice it was slender and feminine, topped with long nails, the nails covered in sparkly silver polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eye candy.... Iris Candice... I. Candy...\" Tom tried to smile as he felt the changes race through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, it was clearly her body. A fact that Iris couldn't hide, as she stood there in her lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/55/61/2e5561045a8c63ab53ebffde163904c2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/55/61/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a shocked hand through her mane of hair, she couldn't find any hint of a wig. The blonde mop was absolutely hers, rooted in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hoping this was a trick, some hypnosis or other delusion. Iris cradled her sumptuous bust. The girls filled the cups and the warm flesh was unmistakable as anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/3e/86/a43e862008811f622494969495e4ab28.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/3e/86/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P<i>w</i>ease...

But you can still earn<i> it </i>back if you work hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'it' made Iris want to squirm in her panties. Already it felt oddly alien and intimidating to think of cocks. Her cheeks warmed at the idea. As she didn't know quite how to continue the conversation. She wasn't fond of the damned lisp either. Playing with her hair, she tried to work her people skills on Tonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/de/10/43de10bf62f63716fd9fc7627040c326.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/de/10/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... There was something else you said last night, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris felt the nervous dread, as she struggled to recall. It felt wrong to picture herself as Tom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece. of. Ass.\" Tonya pronounced each word deliberately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/91/10/4b/91104b0efb2c981b8b98e85dbf32bd73.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/91/10/4b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris felt the warmth return to her body. It shifted from her over-stuffed bust, passed through her middle, shrinking it as it went. Reaching her hips, knew what was coming. Unwilling to hear her girlish lisping voice she mutely shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was futile, as Tom vanished even from Iris' eyes. Relentlessly her ass grew and grew. Half expecting her suspenders to snap, Iris whimpered, until the heat faded, and Tonya looked on with approval her work done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/13/35/bc133501dbbbd133f1ab2ff133eba856.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/13/35/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My work is done, but yours is just beginning.\" she took in I.

You slowly opened your eyes and noticed you were in some sort of hospital room of some sort.

You were about to brush it aside when a lady in a lab coat entered the room, \u201cAh, you\u2019re awake, I\u2019ll let Mr. Hardy know. Please, don\u2019t move.

I have plans for this company and they don\u2019t involve you. The good Doctor here had come to me with a revolutionary new process for altering people at the most fundamental level and I couldn\u2019t think of a better candidate to test it out than you,\u201d Mat explained, coming closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat \u2026 have \u2026 you done?!\u201d You manage to croak, frightened immediately by the higher pitch of your tortured voice. \u201cWe have turned you into the perfect \u2026 uh \u2026 what did we say in the email?

This time was different though. This was the 1 out of 100 times that he went to someone else\u2019s office. He knocked on the door, and a familiar and expected voice called out from the other side asked who it was. \u201cMatt Hardy\u201d Matt answered. A moment later the door was unlocked and opened, revealing Tanya Huff. While she was dressed in her normal professional business attire, she was clearly having a very rough day. It was obvious that she had been crying a lot, hence her door being locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Hardy\u201d Tanya said. \u201cCome in. What brings you down to Human Resources?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was quite for a moment as he stepped in Tanya\u2019s office and looked around. \u201cI noticed you left Roy\u2019s retirement party a little early last night. It wouldn\u2019t have had anything to do with a conversation I saw you having with Tom Syler would it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe made some, comments, that weren\u2019t exactly professional, yes\u201d Tanya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure your aware he is the leading candidate for Roy\u2019s position\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d heard\u201d Tanya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been moving up in the company rather fast, hasn\u2019t he\u201d Matt asked. Tanya didn\u2019t answer this question. \u201cWon\u2019t be long before he\u2019s making a case for more, important, positions. Which is why I came down here. Am I to understand that some of the more, unique, rumors about you are true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what your asking, sir\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would seem that Tom Syler is a problem for both of us. And if what I have heard is true, then you alone hold the key to a solution for both of our problems\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u201d Tanya said as she sat down behind her desk and looked for something. \u201cI might just have an idea\u201d. She shuffled through the mound of papers on her desk for a few minutes before excitedly exclaiming \u201cFound it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it exactly\u201d Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe answer to both of our problems\u201d Tanya said with a sinister smile forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Tom Syler was sitting in Tanya\u2019s office. Tanya behind her desk, Tom across from her, and Mat Hardy standing off to the side of Tanya with his arms crossed. \u201cI\u2019m sure you understand, Mr Syler, that your actions last night are completely unacceptable\u201d Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do understand that\u201d Tom said, worried about his future with the company. \u201cYou have to understand I don\u2019t normally drink like that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough\u201d Matt interrupted. \u201cWhile your work here has been some of the best we\u2019ve seen in the past 20+ years, your actions outside the office has made you a liability. Which is why you will no longer be working here anymore\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour joking, right?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cYou know if you fire me I\u2019ll have job offers from each and every one of you competitors before I get to the lobby\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right\u201d Tanya said. \u201cTom Syler would have job offers in no time. But you aren\u2019t going to be Tom Syler anymore\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d Tanya started. \u201cI\u2019m sure you heard the rumors about me practicing witchcraft?\u201d Tom was speechless. \u201cWell, Matt and I decided that since the two of us have a Tom Syler problem, we would give you a new life that solves both of our problems\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see\u201d Matt said. \u201cTanya knows a spell that will make you her niece. You are going to become a 18 year old college freshman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, you can\u2019t do this\u201d Tom stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can very much, actually\u201d Tanya replied. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that difficult of a spell to preform. And as far as anybody outside this room is concerned Tom Syler never existed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tom could do or say anything else, Tanya\u2019s eyes began to glow. Then she started chanting something in Latin and the room began shaking. Tom wanted to try and made a run for it, but quickly found he couldn't even get out of the chair. Tom was growing scared as he continued to fight to stand up. Then, as quickly as the room began shaking, it stopped. But this didn\u2019t bring any comfort to Tom, because he soon began to black out. But not before feeling himself fall out of the chair and on his face.</span></div></div>",

I'd like to meet the new intern and personally welcome her to the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir,\" Heidi said, knowing full well what 'personally welcoming' likely meant. And in truth, Heidi hoped that Mat did manage to sleep with the new girl... maybe if he found a new toy to play with, she could get a few more of her own evenings back. Not that she expected it to last, she'd been sleeping with the boss for the past three years. But at least when he found a new distraction, she got a few months of not working long hours herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the new girl arrived, Mat left her waiting in his reception area while he studied her on the security camera. She was almost a classic girl next door, very pretty, but not terribly beautiful. Long blond hair, lightly applied makeup, soft pink lipstick complimenting her pale blue eyes nicely. From the cut of her blouse and skirt, she obviously kept herself fit, but she lacked the fullness of tits or ass that would have catapulted her into the realms of a true marvel. Her height too was unimpressive, barely 5'4\". Still, there was potential there, if she was willing to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heidi,\" Mat said, again keying the intercom. \"Go ahead and send in Ms. Hobs.\" When the door opened, Mat stood, walking around his desk to shake her hand as she entered and gesturing at the comfortable seating area within his office. \"Welcome Ms. Hobs, why don't you take a seat. I make it a policy to get to know my employees a little bit as soon as I can, I'm sorry I haven't been able to meet with you sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, it's okay, I understand that you're very busy,\" she gushed. It was a bad move on her part. The kind of statement and tone that told Mat she was eager to please. People who were this eager were almost too easy to manipulate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he said as he reclined into one of the comfortable chairs, \"I appreciate you being so understanding. Now I do have a few questions I wanted to ask... if it feels like an interview I'm sorry, it's just habit. Trust me, nothing you say here will cost you your internship, you've already passed that part. Though... if I'm truly honest, it could open the door for faster promotion. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she bubbled. \"Fire away, I'm all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have no idea</i>, Mat thought. \"Okay. I know that your have a background in Marketing, would you say that image and appearance are important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very important. The right image can make or break a product. And appearance, well, I think your appearance is just you just marketing yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in complete agreement with you. Now, this is a little bit of a marketing test. I'm wondering if you have what we're looking for in a spokes model for one of our upcoming products. Honestly, I'm thinking of a position that would have you traveling to several trade shows, being out on the show floor and attracting the interest of potential clients. Would you be interested in something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Mat could see the glee and excitement from the young girl. She was seeing dollar signs, travel, all the things that young people seem to flock to without ever understanding what it takes to get. Well, soon he'd see what kind of girl she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. If you would for me then, go ahead and take off that blouse and skirt and let's have a good look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" She asked, suddenly confused, clearly not knowing yet if she should be offended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a modeling position. Well, to an extent. Don't think I want you to just be a pretty face at the booth, I do want you to be able to talk up the product at least enough to get the potential client to talk to a sales agent. But the first thing that's going to draw people to our booth is seeing an attractive woman like yourself posed in a bikini or other skimpy costume. So, let's have a good look at you and make sure that you've got the qualifications I think you have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hands at your sides.\" Mr. Hardy nodded as Susan complied reluctantly with his orders, that thought about her being completely under his control was creeping back into her mind \"Excellent, now I want you to give a nice and slow twirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed heavily, she was completely mortified, but it was almost over, she began turning in her place and thinking about her new job, maybe there she wouldn't have to see this perverted old asshole ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she was got back to facing Mr. Hardy, she was shocked to see that...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the story of Compu-Global-Maga-Dyne Industries (CGMDI). Here you'll find erotic tales of humiliation and punishment meted out against unsuspecting employees, petty bosses extracting revenge or personal punishments for reasons of their own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally inspired by Casey's \"Punished by Your Teacher\"<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1616079-Punished-by-your-teacher.\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1616079-Punished-by-your-teacher.</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tale takes the notion of abuse by your seniors into the work place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome ground rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Try to keep chapters to a minimum of 3-5 sentences. I understand that sometimes when setting up a fork we're just looking to provide 'option A or option B' type chapters, but if you need to create one of these chapters, please write at least one of the follow on chapters, give us some substance, not just another choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Spell check and grammar please. If it's too bad, I may either re-write it or delete it entirely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Give your sense of kind free reign. Body swap, part swapping, head swapping, weight gain, humiliation, magical and technological transformation.... it's all fair game. Sex is all right, gay is fine. I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of fetish based on human waste, but if it's well written, then I'm not going to nuke it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it. Most important, let's have fun building a a stimulating and exciting set of stories to read and enjoy :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cast: (And of course, you are welcome to create new characters as needed)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Employees: </b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mark Ingram</b>: Mark has been a quiet and dedicated computer programmer for the past several years. He's made few friends around the office, usually because he is more focused on his job than his office mates. He stands five foot, ten inches tall and is exceptionally lightly built, the consequence of forgetting to eat while programming more than any sort of diet or exorcize regimen. He keeps his long brown hair in a pony tail and wears light prescription glasses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Susan Hobs</b>: Susan is brand new to the company, having started this summer as an intern fresh out of college. Many speculate that the bubbly blond, former cheer leader, only gained the coveted internship because of her stunning good looks. Despite the stereotype Susan (never Sue) is dedicated and hardworking, very eager to make a good start with the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tom Syler</b>: Tom is good at his job. Very good. He's been one of the top sales in the company for years, and he enjoys reaping the rewards of it. Tom is a 'man's man,' enthusiastic about playing sports as he is about watching them. He dominates on the basketball court, using his six foot, three inch well muscled frame to full advantage. His only passion that's greater than the love of sales and driving a hard bargain is his love of chasing ladies and driving them home in his sports car. Tom isn't one for long term relationships, but at twenty seven, he isn't looking for love and he's at least honest about that when he brings home his many one night stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily Calaway</b>: Emily is a very newly minted assistant manager. She's worked hard to get where she is, rising up through the ranks of the secretarial pool. She's just finished her own degree, perused entirely by taking night classes while working full time. Her night studies have left her soft in several places with a spreading middle and sagging ass. The same night schedule has also left her socially isolated with neither boyfriend or work colleagues to spend time with outside of work. Still, she's determined to get back on track, if she could just figure out how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Bosses:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Heather Rand (Payroll)</b>: Heather is the senior manager in charge of the payroll department. She rules her minions with an iron fist, though an iron fist that's usually clutching a doughnut or candy bar. Her immense frame is soft and doughy, and her eyes peer out from behind thick heavy lenses. At nearly fifty years of age she has nothing in her life besides her work, and her own hefty daughter having been left by her husband more than a decade ago. Her daughter recently applied for the internship program, but was turned down in favor of Susan Hobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alan Summers (Product Development)</b>: Alan has been the company's idea man for nearly twenty years, always chasing the next innovative product for the company and seldom slowed down by morals or ethics in his pursuit. Several of the company's most successful products are based on his patents and research, leaving him wealthy enough to walk away from the job if he ever needed to, however he sees no reason to leave a job that lets him give his creative talents free range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tanya Huff (Human Resources)</b>: Tanya rose through the ranks like a rocket, propelled by a ruthless ambition and a stunning body. She's never been afraid to leverage her good looks and sizable endowments to any advantage she's needed. Tom Syler has often called her 'The Moon' because, in his words 'she might be unattainable to mere mortals, but if one of us ever lands her, he'll be a hero forever.' Tanya sets her sights higher, but is ruthless in her treatment of anyone who gets in her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mat Hardy (General Manager)</b>: Little happens at the company that Mat is not aware of. Having worked his way through the ranks, Mat enjoys every benefit of his position, weather that's company car, comped travel, or his choice of prettiest secretary from the pool. His shrewd business sense has propelled the company to new levels of profitability. While the senior executives know that he's a bit of a sleaze around the office, no one is interested in losing the results he gets, so they let his many infractions slide. </td>",
