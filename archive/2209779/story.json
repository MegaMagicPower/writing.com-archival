Her heart felt heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight-blue eyes widened at the realization of her gloomy environment. From lying on her side to now kneeling, the brunette scanned the room she was in that was lit by a small glass lamp hung near her on the wall. A small orange light radiated its gentle warmth, casting a shadow from the princess\u2019 body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark-grey stones layered on top of one another to form the walls that enclosed the space apart from the iron bars to her left. The floor and the ceiling were both made of the same type of stone that were rough to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could see beyond the prison bars was darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her eyes to herself, she found her decorative dress removed from her body. Her torso only had a strapless indigo bra tightly binding to her large breasts with her cleavages shown. She wore a pair of gloves and boots with the same shade of color, and she wore a pair of brown leathery underwear and matching stockings that reached just past her knees. A blue flower hairpin was worn on the left side of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gloved wrists were locked together in front of her by a pair of iron dark-grey cuffs. There was not even a chain between them, giving her hands no leeway to be pulled apart. An iron collar was locked around her neck with a single stand of chain attached to the front with the other end being caught in a hook on the wall that was far beyond her reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Father\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered sleeping in her room, waking up to the sound of cries and screams outside her window where the horrid scene of hell presented itself to her innocent gaze. Homes were being burned. Corpses of both knights and peasants scattered across the roads. Horses wounded. Smoke and ash covering the dark, hazy sky where a swarm of winged monsters soar over the kingdom. Monsters roamed throughout in a disorderly manner while wreaking havoc whenever possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youth had crawled out of bed, snuck out of her room, and dashed down the empty corridor with none of the guards to be seen. She sought after her father, the king, only to be met with his bloodied corpse before a demon situated on the throne.<br>\r\nHer memories ended there. Perhaps the shock of that scene had led her to faint on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes had gone by with her kneeling motionlessly, hanging her head in sorrow. But suddenly, heavy footsteps approached her cell from the darkness. Large, beefy grey hands came into sight from a hulking, large silhouette. One of the hands held a ring of several keys, one of which was used to unlock the iron gate which swung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess quivered with a frightened look as an orc stepped inside, lumbering towards her. The muscular humanoid beast had a pale grey skin, wearing clothes of a hunter. The barbaric-looking orc had a snarling expression as he seized the chain after removing it from the hook. With a single yank, he signaled the princess to stand up before being forced to follow this towering monster out of the cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia found herself standing only up to the orc\u2019s waistline. The chain to her collar was like a leash for him to ensure she would not run off somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where is he taking me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess couldn't see anything in the dark corridor. She had never been to the dungeon before; everything in this area was foriegn to her despite located right below her home.</span></div></div>",
