You know him well, but that didn\u2019t matter. He distracts you just as you exited the main building and were about to head to the parking lot. And what kind of building, seriously. You\u2019re glad where you are. A little bit proud too. The University of Bern in Switzerland. It looks like a palace. Every of its buildings look big, but the central one is just huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did the test go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. I think I\u2019m gonna get a nice grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re just about to head home, but the little small talk you had made you hungry and so you decide to go to the nearby McDonald's. There you talked about all kinds of random subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was getting late, the two of you decide to part and so you were once again alone. You head towards your car and take a seat in it. You take the wheel and drive away. You live in a place called \u201cLove Field\u201d, which is pretty ironic. You haven\u2019t been able to set your love straight with anyone yet. You do have someone you have a close relationship with, but the levels of interest are dropping lower every day. You think your relationship is breaking apart and cannot seem to find the cause. Maybe you just have bad luck in the love life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily home isn\u2019t that far. Considering the time you can leave school the traffic makes the city a bit hard to drive through. Still, you are always up for the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething very strange happens on the road though. As you pass a car a truck makes a weird turn and looses luggage. Whatever goods he was transporting, one of them fell right through your window only to hit your forehead. Since you felt a bit annoyed, you first wanted to drive through the mess and head home, but at some point on your way your curiosity drives you mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin searching your car, only to find a strange small remote. You have never seen the likes of it. It seems to be somewhat round shaped, has two points at the top and some kind of rod In between. Somehow that reminded you of a teaser. It is black and you can\u2019t tell what material it\u2019s made from. It\u2019s too soft to be plastic, but maybe that\u2019s just the outside. If you apply heavy force to it, it doesn\u2019t even bend.  There is only a single clear button on it. You really wonder what it is for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you pressed it to see what it does, you notice this weird green laser firing to your car\u2019s ceiling and startled. It seemed to be coming from the top, the little rod. Somehow it reminded you of science fiction stuff, but when you looked at the device it seemed to have done more than just firing a laser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething red appeared, like as if there was a display below the black coating. It showed some symbols followed by your name. You then felt something bite in your hand and out of startle drop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw something freaky crawl in your skin and start to panic. You get out of the car and take several steps backward till your back hits a wall. Carefully staring at the silent device, you notice something odd. Somehow, it changed colors to silver with green. It also seems to be active. The shape changed a little too. The button is clear green. The points look more like teeth now and you can feel it call you. You pick it up only to notice it somehow feels a lot better fitting in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display became visible with clear words. Your name is still there, but the symbols were replaced with the word \u201cOwner:\u201d . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you have seen it all today. First you deluded something entered your body, now this thing seems to have changed shape. Maybe you\u2019re going crazy, but somehow you knew it was real and harmless. It was supposed to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you get shot with a vision, one of you firing the laser at someone and then suddenly you felt as if you were switching positions, suddenly look through that person\u2019s eyes who saw your body turning into a beautiful silver statue. Somehow you felt extremely erotically exited by it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made you curious. Suddenly the remote didn\u2019t seem so scary, instead you want to have it. You take it home and realize you want to test that vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you're going to give it a shot (literally) at</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Currently, you\u2019re eighteen. You\u2019re an exchange student from Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. If the information from your vision is correct then that might only be temporary. You could basically be anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you moved to Liebefeld in K\u00f6niz, to a nice family\u2019s home where you get food, a room, everything a student needs just because you wanted to go to the University of Bern. Your reason mainly being woman. What you\u2019ve heard is that a lot of pretty girls live in Switzerland and since you\u2019re a real man, who has a talent for seeing a woman\u2019s inner beauty, also and often called a local pervert, you desperately wanted to go there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you arrived and for the first time met the family, you realize how nice they were. How nice everyone was. A lot nicer place to live then home. You consider them your family and as such, you have gained some nice friends. A set of two sisters, one of 16 and one of 11. An older brother, 22, who is attending medicine at the university. A nice mother, 38, who can cook better than your real mom. A father, who likes your jokes. What the heck, this family is so not your real one. Everyone is incredibly nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw school for the first time you did notice a lot of blonds, brunettes, reds\u2026 So many girls, you felt like you were in heaven, but\u2026 since there were so many you didn\u2019t know where to start. It was frightening. One day though, you couldn\u2019t help yourself and you started to do things you regret, so now a lot of girls hate you. Still, there was one that found it really funny. She liked being with you and it turned out into a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess she tamed your inner beast somehow. With her around you feel great and you only see her appear in your thoughts. Strangely when at that time other girls are around you don\u2019t go wild quickly. If she is gone though, you feel like you have to do something, but never get a chance. You want to talk to them or date them or whatever comes up in your mind, including erotic fantasies, but since they all hate you and you\u2019re known it\u2019s pointless. Like an elite wall you can\u2019t get through, you can\u2019t really start a good conversation. There are so many you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this one girl, you did suggest to her to become somewhat closely related to her, but she said she\u2019ll think about it. She rather have you not as perverted as you were as she wanted a normal relationship and one she could trust. Since that would benefit everyone you were training your focus and will to resist your inner perverted male self, but as time passes, she cared less and less about you. So now even though you achieved it you\u2019re basically alone. You consider her family though, but she reminds you closely to your real sister instead of a girl friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the family you want to try it on. You want to see how it is from a different point of view. How life is from an angle that is more accepted in the world, one with different opportunities and relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you\u2019ve made a list of people you\u2019re interested in to follow up more closely in their lives to see why they can do things you can\u2019t, for instance why your life still sucks in relationships or why the people at school still treat you the same and distance themselves. You guess you should ask the girls themselves, but maybe this device is a better answer. Luckily you know German and French, so language here shouldn\u2019t be a problem. You guess it\u2019s like speaking English to you. So then who would you want to try it on for testing?</span></div></div>",

You see one of them jogged by, and you park your car at the edge of the road. Matt, he is from the swimmer team, and has a pretty lean body. He's not your close friend per se, you didn't see him often, but you did text with him a lot, especially when he asked you to help him study. He got his own circle of friends, some of them doesn't particularly like you, so you stayed away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt is a good kid, with a good body too. You could feel your hand shake a little, the remote glows slightly. Maybe... maybe you could try it on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou duck under your car window, hoping that he hadn't seen you yet. Then, you aim the device on him. Symbols starts to form on the device with Matt's name beside them, and you push the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was jarring, at the very least. A sudden blip of unconsciousness, and you're now staring at the road ahead of your car. You lift up your hands and inspect them, feeling that it's different, slightly bigger. The device is gripped on your right hand. You look down, you're wearing a gray sleeveless hoodie, black track pants, and a pair of blue running shoes. You rub your hands on your chest, feeling the fabric and a slight amount of hard muscles beneath, your toes curling inside the shoes. It... It works! You're in Matt's body! You're so excited that this thing actually works! So excited, that you start to notice a tent in your... <i>Matt's</i>... <i><b>your</b></i> pants. You wonder if this is the device's doing. You'll deal with it later. Now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to see your car, still parked at the edge of the road. You slowly walk towards it, getting used to Matt's height difference. You open the door, only to see your body, covered in shiny silver coating, and not moving. You poked at it. It feels more like a statue. Hopefully, this means that your original body will be stuck in one place and you could hide it more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're in Matt's body, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

You hop on the driver seat of your car and start the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're looking left and right in the hallway, hoping that no one will notice you carrying a silver statue. The statue itself is surprisingly light.You opened Matt's door and was surprised to find that the room is clean. No books and papers on the floor, no leftover food trash in sight, and his bed is set tidily. You quickly close and lock the door, setting the statue and the device just beside the bed. You take off your shoes and walk to the full body mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... quite a body you have, Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, rubbing his face, his chest and his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never thought yours could be this sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your hands in front of the tent on your pants before sliping it free. The bulge is even more visible under the speedos. Without further thought, your hands dive under it and starts to rub Matt's dick. It is somewhat more pleasurable than when you did it in your body. It's even more arousing the fact that you could see your friend's face filled with lust in the mirror, copying your exact moves. Before long, you spurted loads of cum into your speedos, some dripping off your legs. You're so into it that you didn't notice the remote blinking green light before turning off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh... gotta clean this up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the shower, naked with only towel on your waist. You've made sure that you've cleaned the floor and the speedo from the mess. You walk to the closet and look for what clothes to wear. Eventually, you decided to wear a black hoodie, some jeans and some white Nike shoes. You walk to the mirror again, fixing your hair before pulling the hood over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna enjoy being you for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to visit...</span></div></div>",

You don't have Matt's memories. Even if you two are close, you couldn't impersonate Matt fully without his memories and his abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs on cue, the device's button starts to glow, as if telling you to press it. So you did, a cable sprouts from the back of the device and latch on to the back of your right hand. Suddenly, you feel electric shock and numbness all over your body. Your body spasm a little and you experience a mild headache before it suddenly clears. You're in awe, because now, somehow, you got all of Matt's memories. It's not like Matt's memories are merging with yours, nor does it feel like Matt's persona is taking over. It's more like if your brain is a computer, then you have added all of Matt's memories as a separate folder that you could look into easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you drive your car back home, hide your original body, then jogging your way to the university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attend all of Matt's class without anyone suspecting anything. All have gone smoothly. After your last class, one of Matt's friend, Trent, is calling you in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! Matt!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n\"You doing anythin tonight?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not necessarily. Why?\"<br>\r\n\"I got some nice booze. Want to try it out tonight, but don't want to make it a party, too messy. Figured I could drag you in, since you're one of my best bros.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. You yourself don't like drinking alcohol, Matt is okay-ish, but you have other things in mind. Trent is bigger than Matt, and from Matt's memories, he's quite adventurous. Trent loves to drive out with his custom motorcycle. You <i>could</i> try it out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Good. 7 p.m. at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent walks away, and you're smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you could come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent opens the door to his room, welcoming you in. Trent's room is like the typical jock's room, pretty messy. You'll have to clean it up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is it?\"<br>\r\n\"One sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your chance, Trent's back is facing you.

You now have all of Trent's memories while Matt's starts to fade away, little by little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the mirror, you were surprised at what you find while sifting through Trent's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh damn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent actually has a kink for leathers, and when you try to look at his biker gears at the corner of the room, you are feeling aroused. In truth, Trent wasn't interested in motorcycling, only it's leather gear. He decided to go motorcycling just to cover his kink. He just need a justification as for why he bought the leathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately take off your clothes, your dick straightens up, fueled by the desire of getting into the suit. You put on one of the leather suits, sliding your legs and arms into it, and zipping it all up. You take some pair of socks from the closet and put it on before pulling on the Sidi boots. You put the helmet on and slide your fingers into the gloves. You're now fully suited (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/19f5d7d929641eb06f447408725f92e1/tumblr_pmq4hmcvVE1ws90s9_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/19f5d7d92964...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the mirror, you see yourself in full leather gear. Trent's libido is making your dick hard inside, so you pull off the special zipper on your crotch to let your dick free. It's a bit bigger than Matt's. One hand starts to rub it, the other is exploring your body, feeling the leather against your skin. You click the toes of your boots, feeling it's treads gripping to the floor and the tightness of it gripping your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... boots... too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience, combined with Trent's libido, is too much for you so you cum straight to the mirror. After that, you were so exhausted that you fell to your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Man... *pant* that sure is something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",
