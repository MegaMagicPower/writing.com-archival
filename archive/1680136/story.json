            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Ash loved food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince his childhood, he loved food. He was that little kid who held always a candy bar in his hand and had his cheeks puffed by the cookies he stole from the jar his mother put on the top of the oven and away from him. He always managed to get them by climbing on a chair and hid them in the corners of his bedroom. She scolded him when he was caught but he never stopped eating snacks and junk food. He had his little arms and legs covered with chub and a slight round jiggling belly. He was healthy but his parents weren't very happy about it, especially his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up, and with Mom's strict diet -which wasn't pleasing Ash at all- the boy started to lose his fat. He passed through the elementary school with a slimmer body yet a not so happy mood. Ash always complained but his parents had him under control, and had his weight under control. They made sure that their son wouldn't snack out of the house nor inside, and even if, they gave him only a small snack when he was finished from his homework. By the age of seven, Ash was a slim healthy boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn middle school, Ash was partially free. He sometimes snacked out of the house- not to say everyday, and it gotten to him quickly. His frame started to get chubby all over and again Mr. and Mrs. Ketchum weren't very happy. He was a healthy weight, but the two parents were looking for total perfection and weren't going to stick by something less than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mom!\" yelled a thirteen years old Ash as his mother grabbed the bag of potato chips from his side. He was playing video games and he needed to snack.<br>\r\n\"No Ash, you don't need this. You need to lose weight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gave a pout. He looked down at the slight bulge of his tummy and sucked in it slowly \"N-no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have it once you go to the soccer club we signed you in\" Delia spoke up as she started to search inside Ash's drawers for any hidden snack and she found plenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stood up \"I don't like soccer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We signed you in in other clubs. Pick up one\"<br>\r\n\"I don't like...\" Ash made a face. He tossed away the game controller and walked over his bed, throwing himself into it \"Ugh!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a the game of the cat and the mouse. When his parents aren't looking, Ash gains weight, when they notice, he drops it. His middle school years passed by like that, and Ash got plenty of comments on his body all the way. Especially from his friends Gary and Misty who were surely confused at the way their friend's body changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh school needed a great body. Ash knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis freshman year wasn't the happiest because he wasn't exactly slim. He didn't get picked at but got fat jokes everyday. He wasn't safe from Misty and Gary either and they made fun of Ash's gut every time they got the chance to. It put the boy's self esteem down because he had only some chub here and there and everyone made jokes about his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, his parents had always to put their fingers in the pie, and this time, Ash was cooperative. He started playing soccer outside school, and got pretty well at it. He was in the perfect shape to play with the school team and everyone watched in amazement the big changes. It was his chance to ask Misty out anyway, and he did. She accepted dating him and no person could pull them apart.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"You've... you've changed, Ash\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty spoke in a soft tone, her body very close to Ash's. They were standing up by a tree and were about to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a good way?\" Ash smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead licked her lips as her hand reached for Ash's abdomen and stroked it. She looked hesitant, but finally nodded.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil senior year, Ash's high school life was perfect; he had a great figure, with a ripped six pack and an important muscular mass, he was very popular among girls, he had his own cheer leading team, he was dating Misty, and was feeling very good about himself. Even when it came to food, he ate whatever he wanted because he worked out everyday at school, and that was a good thing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was here, and Ash wanted to get the max of fun before heading to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe too much fun? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the end, all ash could muster was a bright red blush on his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia didn't notice it, but Jenny did. She instantly put the pieces together, how her fat body had captured the thoughts of this young boy. She gave him a hungry look  befor she turned back to Delia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what were you saying about staying for dinner?\" Ash went wideeyed. He hadn't be listing at all to their conversation, and apparantly his mom, being the hospitable mother she is, had invited the blob police officer into their home. \"Oh, yes! I was making dinner for the ash and me when I realized, again, I had cooked too much food. It would be so nice if you could join us.\" Delia replied.  Jenny looked back at ash for a couple of seconds. \"Sure, why not? It's been a slow day anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! Dinner will be ready in an hour. Please, come in.\" Delia said getting out of the way for her. Jenny's massive form walked into the house with surprising speed for her size, as if all that flab didnt hinder her movement at all. Every step she took the house shook just a little bit, floorboards creaking and light fixtures swaying. While walking through his home, ash got to see a good view of Jenny's backside, her butt coming dangerously close from snaking into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable while I prepare dinner. Ash, make sure our the nice police officer gets whatever she wants, alright?\" Delia didn't wait for an awnser and strolled off into the kitchen. Jenny took her words to heart. She walked over to the couch and planted her massive rear on it, breaking it instantley. Ash stood jaw dropped at how she had just destroyed his couch so casually, as if this was a common occurance. Making herself more comfortable, Jenny started to undress her uniform. Ash was feeling all sorts of emotions at that moment. If her outfit before assent revealing enough, ash clearly could see how fat she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripped down her to her bra and panties, she looked over to ash<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man, do you think you could do something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to say no, ash gingerly walked up to her. \"Could you please</span></div></div>",

It was if everything she ate was instantly digested into soft, wobbling blubber.

The Dinner table was a smorgasbord of food. Turkey, ham, chicken, potatoes, pies, cakes, the list goes on and on. Delia seemned to have went all out for the Police Officers arrival, but Ash had a sneaking suspicion that even all this won't be enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to fetch a chair for you?\" Delia asked, knowing that the ones already at the table won't stand up against her tush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you; my 'giggle' behind is a rather comfy cushion for me\" Officer Jenny said. She sat on the floor, yet even sitting dos she was tall enough for the table to be squashed under her Breasts. Without another word she started shoveling food into her face. Ash grabbed his portion quickly, knowing that he might mot get the chance to eat later.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------/-/-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how right Ash was, because by the end of supper, Jenny had DEMOLISHED the feast in front of her...</span></div></div>",

But over time, she started to listen to Ash's commands in battle, and accepted that she was in love with Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fantasies of herself on her haunches, hugging her trainer into her belly. She would nuzzle him and lick his head affectionately, while he wrapped his puny arms around her waist and snuggle up against his Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard was so caught up in her thoughts and fantasies, they she did not notice her sub conscious have her start moving closer, from hiding behind one tree, to one that was closer. She was shocked out her thoughts, as her foot accidentally snapped a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, upon hearing the snap, instantly stopped his pull ups on a trees branch, and looked towards the origin. What he saw, was a small part of a orange claw/foot on the ground, two medium to long sized white nails, and a large flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charizard? Is that you?\" He asked, while letting go of the limp and falling onto his feet. Charizard gulped, and slowly, yet awkwardly walked out from behind the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char...\" She awnserd. Another thing that kept them from being together Charizard thought, Ash couldent understand her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you spying on me?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChairzard simply nodded glumly and sat on the ground, like a child awaiting punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed. Chairzard had been acting weird for the last week. Always looking at him funny, scaring off girls that approached him. He couldent piece it together, he always was oblivious to love. Ash walked over to chairzard and sat next to her, petting her scaly back. Chairzard let out a growl of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know what's going on between us, but if you ever wanna hang out with me, you don't usage to hide.\" Ash said, trying to comfort his Charizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChairzard gave a small smile at ash. But then she noticed something on the ground, a magazine lying right next to Ash's feet. Curiously, she reached her hand over Ash and picked it up, much to his horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GACK!! Uh Charizard, t-t-t-that's nothing it's just a piece of garbage I found on the side of the street and I picked it up, because you know I'm all about saving the planet!\" Ash stuttered out, grooming nervously as Charizard squinted at the tabloid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChairzard wdened her eyes as she realized what she was looking at. There was a picture of an incredibly I race lucario on the front of the cover, rubbing its belly with one paw, and eating food with the other. At the top of the cover it read, \"POKE'FAT, Fat Pokemon are Best Pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Charizard there's something behind you!\" Ash shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zard?\" Chairzard looked behind her, but much to her confusion there was nothing there. When she turned back around, the magazine was no longer in her claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Charizard!\" Ash shouted behind his back as he ran off into the distance, leaving an orange dragon dazed and confused by what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would ash carry something like that?\" Chairzard thought to herself. Of coarse, in human language it came out as \"Charizard?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it dawned on her. Ash always acted different around bigger Pokemon. Sure he lived all his Pikemon very much, but she wasent Unknown to the states that he gives Snorlax while eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh liked fat Pokemon.</span></div></div>",
