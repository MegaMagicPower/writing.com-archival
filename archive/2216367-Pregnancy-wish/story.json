            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amelia was an 18-year-old girl who was last year in high school. She had straight red hair down to her hips, green eyes, some freckles and a nice little nose. Amelia was tall, with a very slim body and small breasts that were almost non-existent. Her clothes, tastes and company were typical of any punk girl. Amelia is a big fan of sports and whenever she can practice one of them, among the ones she is most interested in are water polo, martial arts, archery or fencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia had a younger sister, Maria, who was 11 years old and had very different tastes than Amelia. She was a \"posh\" and happy child. The relationship between the two of them was very difficult. <br>\r\nOne weekend, Amelia had to go to a water polo match on Saturday and to a fencing exhibition on Sunday. Amelia's parents work all weekend, so they called the babysitter (Mila) to take care of Maria while no one was home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila was a 25 year old girl, who took care of Maria when she was needed. At that time Mila was pregnant with twins and 8 months pregnant. Her thin body showed a big belly that was hard to believe that she could handle without difficulty. Since Mila was pregnant, Amelia had been thinking about being pregnant and was jealous of other pregnant women. She was thrilled to think about leading a life inside her and how sexy those curves could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia has a 19-year-old neighbor named Karen. Karen is a redheaded girl with very small breasts and a very large, round belly. She looks like she could give birth at any moment. Since she became pregnant, she is hardly ever seen outside the house and is always in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pregnant person in Mila's life was her water polo coach. Pregnant with a 4 month old baby, it wasn't a very noticeable pregnancy, but her pregnancy was showing. When they were warming up for the game, Mila would try to pretend not to be seen by the coach watching her a lot. Suddenly a thought came to Amelia's mind: \"I wish her pregnancy was mine. At that very moment, a force plunged Amelia into the pool. She didn't understand what had happened, but she came to the surface and wanted to keep warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia soon noticed that she was slower than usual and tired easily, so she wanted to rest by getting out of the water and sitting on the bench for a few minutes. The coach approached Amelia and asked, \"Is everything okay? Is the baby giving you trouble again?\" Amelia was shocked, looked at her own belly and saw that she had a small bump, turned to the trainer and saw that she was not pregnant, a big chill ran through her body. \"It's all right, I'll just go on with the game,\" Amelia replied, thinking it was just tiredness. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began to understand everything, she had stolen her trainer's pregnancy, she got scared and ran to the dressing room where she changed her clothes and without thinking she was coming home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at the bus stop with a thousand thoughts in her head when a special thought came to her: \"I have stolen her pregnancy, I would like to give it back to her. At that very moment she noticed how her little belly began to return to normal. \"So I just have to wish for it.\" Amelia thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment the bus arrived and Amelia got on it. A new thought popped into her head, could she do it among other people? The bus, which was full, offered the answer, she could see a woman with a normal pregnancy, who must be in her 4 months of pregnancy, and by her side a girl no older than 14 who was talking on the phone. Amelia wanted the woman's pregnancy to be transferred to the girl on her side. Immediately that happened, the woman's belly became small and the girl's belly began to become large, neither the girl nor anyone else noticed what was happening. \"I guess this power makes the new pregnancy normal,\" Amelia thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was enjoying herself, she had a weapon in her possession, she could put a pregnancy on anyone she wanted, it could be a weapon of revenge. She also began to feel melancholy and thought it might be a way to do good. Whatever it was, she was going to get pregnant with a spectacular pregnancy.</span></div></div>",

She was 41 weeks pregnant with no sign of an early delivery. \"When will you get out of here?\" she asked as she held her belly, \"I'm sorry, but I'm comfortable in here.\" The baby responded mentally to Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a break, Karen got up and went to the closet. She was working as a guide in a museum. Karen lived alone, with her father, but her father had been in a coma for months and needed money to live. For that reason she became pregnant, his father was on the verge of death, and asked some witches to save him, they made a deal, save the life of his father in exchange for her to take a new life to the world. When she became pregnant, her father stopped getting worse, and she hopes that the day she gives birth, her father will recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren took off her pajamas that left half her belly exposed and put on a black dress to go to work. Then she went to breakfast, another difficult task in her condition. She put on her shoes and every step to the kitchen was quite uncomfortable, both because of the pain in her feet and the difficult balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he arrived at the kitchen and started eating everything he could find, pizzas, buns, meat, cake... Since she was pregnant her hunger had increased overwhelmingly. This time her baby was eager to play and she made every time she ate something happen to her:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
