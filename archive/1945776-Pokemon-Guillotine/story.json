            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you were heading home you spot a new shop called: Franz Joseph Illusions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has a white outline square that\u2019s five feet long and wide, in front of the automatic sliding doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the center of a square says 'No parking'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know magic isn't real, but you walked in any way. You see nothing but magic stuff, but something caught your eye. It's a Guillotine; you walk toward it until you stopped in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who in the right mind selling this?\" you demand in complaint. Suddenly, an old man comes to you by saying. \"May I help you?\" you turn to him. \"Yes, can you recall this? Because it might kill somebody.\" you warned, pointing at the Guillotine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this one is a magic Guillotine. It was build centuries ago, and it\u2019s completely harmless.\" explained the old man. You took a look at it again. \"What does it do? But I know it could cuts off the heads.\" you questioned. \"But it won't just cut heads off, but it can cut any part unharmed,\" he answered. So you got confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... It won't spread any blood out?\" you ask, confused. \"Nope, it doesn\u2019t.\" Now you want to buy it, he said it cost 600,000 Pokedollars (Means 6,000 dollars). You bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I guess?\" you said. \"One moment please.\"  An old man went to the storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Boxes along with a Shrink/Growth Ray, along with the dual X-ray machine for a skull only for any size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne minute later, he came out with a Gurdurr holds a stack of two boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne contains a ray (Top of a stack) and an X-ray machine (Bottom of a stack).  From behind is a Machamp holds a box for a Guillotine. Once the Pokemon place a Guillotine inside the box, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the boxes?\" you questioned. \"Oh! Those have a Shrink slash Growth Ray and a Duel X-ray Machine. Plus they're free of charge.\" he explained. After a second later. \"How can I carry three boxes?\" you wondered. Then an old man produced a mini capsule from the back earlier (Similar to the one from Dragon Ball Z). \"With this.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I put them in there?\" you said. \"That's because I haven't activated it yet, but we must do it outside just to be safe.\" you nodded in agreement. After the Pokemon finished, you and an old man walk outside until through the double doors. Once outside, he pressed it and then toss it to the center of a square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then touches the center of it; it puffs up with white smoke. Once the smoke fades, you clearly see storage; it's one foot around a square. It has a button on the side of the entrance. The Storage opens automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I have never seen it done that before?\" you said in amazement. \"Because I invented it years ago.\" he said. He told Gurdurr and Machamp to bring out the boxes carefully. They came out the store and place them in the storage, and back to the shop. \"So, how could I bring this home?\" you wondered. \"Simple.\" said the old man. He walked to a button and then pressed it, the Storage closes. Once it's closed, it pops back to the capsule. You walked to it and pick it up; you have to because you worried that he might break his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for picking it up for me.\" said the old man. \"You're welcome.\" After you told him, he's getting a case for it. In case it puffs in your backpack. After he comes out, he opens it. You carefully place it inside to make sure it hasn't pressed. Once successful, he said. \"And don't forget to bring back the capsule.\" with that, he went inside the shop. You place the case into your backpack. After that, you send out a male Unfezant and ask it to take you home. Then he did, so once you're on his back, he flew up 50 feet in the air and then taken you home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, Unfezant land onto your yard. It's in the neighborhood. Then you got off Unfezant. \"Thanks Unfezant. Return!\" you said as it sends Unfezant to his Pokeball. After you place it to your Pokeball belt. You then typed in the code and press confirm, as the garage opens. Once it opens, you took out the case that the old man gave you. Open it, then take a capsule out, then press it and toss it on the driveway. Luckily, it\u2019s flat. It then pops up with white smoke, revealing the storage. After you bring them to the garage, you open the big one, but it's sided. After you finish placing a Guillotine, a Shrink/Growth Ray, and a Duel X-ray machine. You wonder who you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wanna try it out?\" He asked, knowing how dumb of a question it must have sounded. Emily didn't respond and just let John demonstrate, by sticking his head in the hole and releasing the blade. Part of her just expected it to be a fake rubber blade for a prank, so she let it happen. To her surprise, John's head fell off his body. \"Oh my god!\" She screamed, when John quelled her fears. \"Told you; it's magic! It even works like this too.\" He stated, putting just his mouth through the hole and letting the blade cut it off. \"See? Nothing to worry about.\" He cays, holding his mouth in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily crossed her arms and eyed up the device, and her cut up brother. \"How do you fix yourself?\" She inquired. \"Just connect the stumps of where you're cut off and good as new.\" He explained, though not actually demonstrating it. \"Move out of the way.\" She shoves him aside and sticks her own head through the hole. Emily grins at feeling no pain, \"There's much use with this...\" She murmurs, standing her body up. John doesn't hear her, but sneaks up on her headless body, placing his mouthless head on it. \"Wait, what? I can't feel my body!\" She shouts, being picked up. \"That's because I am using it right now.\" He giggles, showing Emily the absurd sight. 'Oh my. Now this is a very interesting development.' She mentally notes, as John then cuts off her mouth to attaches to his face. \"My name's Emily, and I don't know what a Charizard looks like.\" He jokes, now speaking with Emily's voice. Reassembling Emily with his mouth and body, John twirls around in a sort of mocking fashion. \"Oh ha ha.\" She sighs, looking at her current male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was really amused by this, and asked his sister, \"This sure is weird, huh?\" Emily nods, saying she needs to get a drink to soak this in. \"Ok; we'll swap back when you return, then?\" John asked, wanting to test the guillotine out on other things; but he didn't want to leave a 'mess' of him and his sister swapped at home, with their parents around. \"Yeah, yeah; let's do that.\" Emily agreed, though it didn't sound like she truly cared entirely right now. John shrugged his shoulders and sat in the garage for a bit, fiddling with the reality altering device in his hand. At some point, he must have unintentionally pressed the button that made the effects go off. This was proven when Emily returned, for some reason 15 minutes later. \"Ready to get your body back?\" He asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I've got my body, moron.\" She annoyingly said, pushing John aside. \"No, we swapped with the guillotine; you agreed that w'd go back to normal when you came back, remember?\" he tried to reason again. But, because he had accidentally activated the reality change, Emily believed she and her brother were how they always were. That didn't mean she forgot about the guillotine and how it can cut people up and swap their parts, however. \"Your rambling is obnoxious, so step aside!\" Emily demanded, pushing John away with force since she had his stronger male body. \"Whoa, Emily, what's your problem?!\" He asked, as the garage door slid open. Outside stood a group of 5 people, wearing masks to hide their identities, and donned in some obscure uniforms. \"What is this?\" John worried, as Emily stepped toward them. One of them sent out a Beheeyem, commanding it to use hypnosis on John; he immediately felt dizzy and collapsed to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst asleep, Emily and the group had their pokemon take the guillotine out of the garage. Fitting it through the doorway, it bumped against the metal frame, knocking loose the blade. No one noticed, so they took the incomplete device away foolhardily. \"We appreciate you finding this for us, Mr. Champion.\" Emily chuckled, taking the guillotine, and unintentionally most of John's body, with her. John lay on the garage floor, asleep and stuck with his sister's smoking hot body, clad in revealing clothing. It was thankfully wise that he had never revealed the remote or sizing ray to Emily, however it was only a matter of time before they found the ray. It was still hooked to the upper side of the guillotine, swinging obviously. All John had left was the reality changing remote; practically useless on it's own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John hears the usual slapping sound of his mother's flip flops as she enters the garage, \"What in the name of- what is this?\" She asks, being careful with her belly. \"Oh, hi mom.\" John greets, setting free the blade so it can drop with a loud thunk. This startles Beth a little, who taps John on his shoulder not to do that again. \"Just picked this up from a shop; some sort of magic guillotine.\" \"What's magic about it?\" She asks. John explains, \"I think it's can cut parts of people off without hurting them. Kind of like the person is still magically ok, just with that part detached.\" His mother has a look of disbelief, \"I hope you don't expect me to be a test subject for this; and how did you manage to sneak this here without us knowing?\" John dodges her question and sticks his right arm in the stock, setting the blade downward. \"Honey!\" She cries, as his arm falls into the basket. He reaches in, unfazed and picks it up. \"See, it's magic.\" John tells his mother, showing the lack of blood and that he could still move his arm. Sticking the arm stump against his shoulder reconnects it, good as new. \"No pain, no gore, it's pretty amazing.\" John exclaims. Beth grabs John's arm and asks him, \"Honey, I've got an idea with this. But there's no way I'd consider trying it right now due to my current state. Could we wait to try it after this is all finished?\" She asks him, pointing to her pregnant belly. John, confused, replies, \"Uh, sure, I guess so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPer his mother's request, John waited over half a year before he was able to find out what she wanted to use the guillotine for. In the mean time, he tested it, the ray gun and the reality changing remote multiple times to see their effects on the world around him. Turns out that only he was able to notice changes to himself when activating the remote, or when a pokemon had changed in size. Even parts of his own could be switched around, such as his left and right leg, though he always made sure to put himself back to normal. One day, after his new sibling had reached the point where they didn't need to breast feed anymore, Beth comes up to her son, finally confident in her idea. \"Ok, John,\" she begins explaining, leading him to the garage. \"This is a totally selfish question I'm going to ask you, but I'm going to be blunt. The day you became the Champion was one of my proudest days ever; not only because it marked the end of your long journey, but because it reminded me of my trainer days long ago. I never got to the elite four, so your accomplishment made me yearn for going through that long trek and reaching the top.\" John was unsure what she wanted still, so Beth continued, \"This is asking a lot, but I think I understand what that guillotine can do. I was hoping we could swap our bodies, so that you become champion once again. But you'll have my body, so I'll be the champion, too. You know what I mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was astounded by his mother's request; it made sense, in some strange way. And he could see why she never tried again, what with having a family and eventually becoming pregnant once again. ''Well, Jessica did invite me for a trip to the Alola region with her; they've just gotten an elite 4 and don't have a champion yet. Would that make you even happier, to be not only a champion, but the first champion?\" he suggested. This lit a fire in his mother's eyes, and she furiously nodded her head. Somewhat reluctantly, John moved over to the guillotine after his mother explained just to swap heads, so that way she can still maintain her position at home. So, John and his mother cut off their heads and switched bodies; also doing the same with their mouths so when his mother sees the televised crowning of Alola's first champion, she'll hear her voice thanking everyone. \"Thank you so much, honey!\" Beth states, about to leave, when John grabs what was his hand. \"Hold on!\" He requests, pulling her back. \"We both need to hold this remote; it can switch reality so that everyone will think we're normal, except for us.\" Nodding, John and his mother both press the button to switch reality, making it align with their current changes. \"Thanks again, honey!\" Beth shouts, sprinting back inside as John sighs. He didn't really know what he got himself into, what with having his mother's body now. She was rather in shape for her age, though her breasts have gone up a couple sizes due to her last pregnancy. \"They're probably an E at this point.\" He grimaces, grabbing what were his breasts for the near future. It cause a rather pleasurable sensation, so he stopped for the time being. \"Better go pack some bikinis.\" He jokes, heading to his room since the trip would happen in less than a week. \"I can do 'that' later.\" He decides, looking at his breasts and feeling his new groin.</span></div></div>",

His E cups jiggled a bunch, thanks to being unsteadily dragged by his girlfriend. \"We're not late for our flight, so you don't need to be in that much of a hurry.\" He joked with a laugh, still in shock that thanks to the reality changing remote, Jessica doesn't notice is very different body and outfit. The past week had been interspersed with packing and getting acclimated to his new mature female body. Said acclimation had been devoid of self pleasure, since he wasn't comfortable trying that out at home with his mom around. So, needless to say, his libido had reached critical state, since all the sensations of a female body had been very pleasing so far. His current outfit had been one of a t-shirt with white yoga pants and red flip flops; it displayed his curves entirely, since that seemed to be the kind of clothing his mother preferred to wear in public and at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the couple was on a plane bound for Alola; being so high in the sky was exciting for Jessica, and it took most of her attention away. This gave John the chance to sneak away to the restroom for some privacy; he'd been holding in the tension for over a week and couldn't stand it anymore. Within the privacy of the plane's bathroom, John pulled off his shirt and yoga pants, enjoying the view of his milf body in underwear. It wasn't covering much, since he had only taken Beth's sexiest pairs for this long trip. \"If I'm doing this for her, I deserve to have some fun with it.\" He reasoned, looking at the tiny black bra and g string showing most of his sensual bits. Grabbing the waistband of his g string, John pulled it up to dig the string in between his moist pussy lips. Moving the fabric aside, he puts his manicured fingers in there instead, running them back and forth with little friction. Moaning, he switches to squeezing his crotch lightly before sticking a few fingers inside it. Having done this often to Jessica, he knew exactly the best way to move his fingers around in his pussy. His inner walls gripped his slender fingers, begging for more pleasure; so he obliged by increasing the amount of fingers he used. \"Hot damn; this is amazing!\" He said, sweating profusely. Groping his breasts for extra sensations, it wasn't long before he had his first of many female orgasms. Panting from exhaustion, he quickly threw his outfit back on, realizing that was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sweat and sexual fluids stained right through his nearly entirely white outfit; he'd have to change. Slipping all of that off, he let his body air dry a bit before using some paper towels. Reaching into his bag, he pulled out a black and white striped dress and slipped it over his small underwear. It expose his upper back and was made of thin tight fabric that stuck to his curves, enhancing his large breasts and birthing hips. For good measure, he even changes his flip flops to a fancier brown pair. Rejoining Jessica in their seats, he crossed his legs effeminately and enjoyed the rest of the ride. He certainly felt that masturbating as a woman was much better than as a guy. After another few hours of napping, they finally landed in Alola; John stretched his legs and stepped out. The fragrant breeze blew his dress around, displaying his mature body even more. \"This'll be a long challenge.'

Once it fully sent out, tiny stars surround a shiny Arcanine, then the stars disappeared. \"Arcanine, can I borrow your body for one day?\" you ask. An Arcanine cannot believe to be hearing that. \"By chopping your head off using a Guillotine, but don't worry. It is harmless, and you have to trust me.\" you said. After a few moments, he trusts you with a nod as he pronounced \"Ar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Arcanine, put your head inside the Guillotine, this won't hurt a bit.\" you said. Arcanine walked to the rear of the Guillotine while you bring a basket out and then take your blanket out of your backpack, followed by placing it in the basket so Arcanine's head would not hit the floor. After you finish, Arcanine placed his head inside the Guillotine. You then take hold of the rope and pull it, as it cuts off Arcanine's head unharmed, dropped down to the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it's my turn now.\" As you pick up his head, you walked to the stock and then locate the head there. You walked to his standing body nears the guillotine. You then walk with his headless body, slightly away from the guillotine. You walk back to the guillotine to leave a basket out-of-the-way, you then place your upper waist inside. You hold on to the floor using two feet and your right hand as you get to the rope using a free hand. You may experience some difficulties. Finally, you grab it as you regain balance. After you fully gain balance, you draw a rope as it cuts off your waist unharmed, dropped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl for seven seconds to reach Arcanine's body. You reach the body before you attach yourself with it. You turn to your Arcanine. \"Lie down and bow down your neck.\" Arcanine did so. You then move your upper body to get close to the cervix. Once you get close enough, you felt yourself attached to a Arcanine's body. That is not all. You felt there was fur grew all around your skin. You recognized it was Arcanine's fur you could even feel your hair is turning into a Arcanine's head-fur. You ran to the box using four legs to look inside as you lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you found the instructions manual, take it out as you read for what caused this. Then you read 'Fur/scale growth... Pg.11'. Then you turn to page 11, you read it out that says 'If any body part comes from a single Pok\u00e9mon attach to a human, will experience some side effects.' you finished. You don't mind about the side effects, as long it is not raining. After you stand up, you bring out Arcanine's Pok\u00e9ball while walking toward his head. \"Don't worry Arcanine, I promise I'll place your head back to your body, return.\" You assure, followed by sending him back to his Pok\u00e9ball. All a sudden, you still have a Arcanine's body. Then you discover something you never see before, you walked toward to the end of the stock, and you see a remote control with a screen on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" you said, confused. \" You then grab it, and you see something written on it. \"Reality changer?\" You turn it on by pushing an on/off button. So it reads in a robotic voice. \"Welcome user, thank you for purchasing the Guillotine. If you afraid to get weird stares. Then push a green button to change reality, the wielder has no effect of a reality change. Press Undo to revert the reality back.\"</span></div></div>",

Some buildings like State Farm make this story, fan fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon trainer discovers a magical guillotine at a magic shop called Franz Joseph Illusions.<br>\r\nIt comes with a ray that shrinks and grows Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon.<br>\r\nA black remote that controls reality, a 'green button' can change reality, a 'white' button can revert reality back where it was before, and it has an on/off button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you've searched 'brain' it means you could make chapters by chop the top of someone's head off to take a brain out and then place in either an empty jar or insert another brainless head without a lid of a scalp to take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a human brain is placed inside a head of a Pokemon's body, still use his/her human language, but other humans hear the Pokemon language. A human brain is adjustable to any Pokemon body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nThe Guillotine is in the beginning when it's sold to John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA person can still feel their cut off body parts until it has attached to someone else<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more than two heads can be onto a body at one time (Half of the body per head).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave at least a paragraph per chapter with some dialog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story's rated 18+ so do not skimp on detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there's a dangerous Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon, like a Ninetales, who curse its victim for 1,000 years. John must demonstrate to Ninetales by cut off his own body part, to prove it is harmless. A disembodied tail of a Ninetales never curses anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScyther trusts its trainer because these Pokemon are loyal to those who owns it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a trainer send a Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon to its Pok\u00c3\u00a9ball with its body part attached to another body (Like a human body), doesn't send in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't cut body parts off to those who are rock types, steel types, or ghost types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't swap heads with Pokemon unless they're human-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not end the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn could travel to Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, and Alola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't make people like John heartless too often, like the minute to steal bodies or parts from anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote:<br>\r\nSend an email to me once you finish an OC, like a Pokemon trainer. You could also send an email to me in case you add John's friend to the story, John has three friends (Seriously, I need OCs for this interactive story. If you have interest on making an OC, add it to the email; 'OC for Pokemon Guillotine'). Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon's allowed in this story and even cut their body parts. There could be side effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's Shiny Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon:<br>\r\nMale Arcanine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's Legendary Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon:<br>\r\nLatias<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn (you): Age 17 - Wears a black shirt with shirt buttons, wears a blue pair of shorts, wears a white pair of socks and wears brown running shoes.
