Sam walked inside and up to her room and went to sleep hoping to feel better when she awoke. The party continued for another 30 minutes when suddenly a bright light flashed next door and when you opened your eyes everything was humongous but you didn't see any giant people. You looked around and noticed your wife laying on the ground amd went over to her.<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, are you ok?\" You asked as you helped her to her feet, still a little dazed.<br>\r\n\"Ya I'm fine but what happened?\" She asked as she looked around starting to panic.<br>\r\n\"I don't know but I think something shrunk everyone\" you said as you started calling out names when...</span></div></div>",

Weird\" she walked out and looked around, the back yard was a mess food and paper plates were everywhere, it was like everyone just dropped what they were holding and left. As she turned to walk back inside she stopped and noticed the grill was still on \"Dad never leaves this on what's going on\" Sam said to herself as she turned it off and headed back inside.<br>\r\nOn the ground you and your wife were calling for people when the back door suddenly opened and your giantess of a daughter walked out completely unaware of you and almost crushed you as she walked past to turn your grill off.

As you and your wife looked up you saw storm clouds high in the sky and could see rain starting to fall. As the rain fell near you the water drops threatened to crush you each time as both of you ran for cover. Luckily the back door was cracked open slightly so the both of you were able to get inside to safety, however you think about how many people must be outside still in this monstrous storm. You can see some people in the distance in the kitchen as you walk around and start making yiur way over to them</span></div></div>",

Derek and susan walked to the stairs and started their long journey up them, as they were climbing Derek was thankful his wife convinced him to get carpeted stairs instead of the hardwood ones. As they made it to the top 30 minutes later they started ushering anyone they say to the couch. They came to the split between the different rooms of the upstairs floor. On the left there was the master room amd the upstairs bathroom and on the right was Sam's and Taylor's rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich room do they check</span></div></div>",

You and Susan head over to the bed climbing over discarded clothes and other miscellaneous objects and reach the sheets. There's enough hanging off that both of you are able to grab on and climb up it and as you reach the top you can make out a dark mountainous landscape.<br>\r\n\"Sam must not have shrunk, this is great! She can help us\" you shout with glee as you begin making your way over to her head. As you aproach the blanket however she moves her legs and the blanket covers you, sending you into complete darkness but you continue heading up anyways since it should still be a straight shot to her head.</span></div></div>",
