There was one chair in the center of the room, a chair very similar to a seat of the council, only it had a small hold at the bottom, one the let your head stick out from below as the chair held you in place. Suddenly footsteps drew your attention as a tall Togruta Jedi in thick Jedi robes approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake. Good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, sitting in the very chair that held you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Master Shaak Ti, I've personally been watching over you for some amount of time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time? You've only been here for five minutes, what did she mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Jedi have been wiping all of your memories of your stay here over the past few weeks\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Shaak Ti, as if reading your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeks I've spent meditating on how to truly punish you, stewing in these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid the Jedi, raising up a thick leather boot and slamming it down beside your head. The Jedi Master twisted her boot around, letting you hear the squelching of sweat around her foot and sent a wave a fear through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it came to me. You see, I've spent many a years in these boots and once we captured you I went into deep meditation and thought of all the different ways to subject you to what rests inside\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jedi Master looked you dead in the eyes as she started to raise her foot from her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will pay for your crimes against the Jedi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaak Ti's boot fell loudly to the floor as her bare foot, glistening with sweat, was now free. She leaned back in her chair as her foot descended down onto your face, her slender toes spread wide as she splayed them around your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will smell my feet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid the Jedi as she cupped her toes together around your nose, trapping you underneath a wall of the most rancid stink you've ever smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I will make this worse for you.\"</span></div></div>",

I am Master Aayla Secura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin only grew from her as she carefully explained your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, once I heard of what you did, what you've seen, I knew that the council would not simply let you go, so I begged you to be transfered to me for questioning, I had so many fun ideas, but when they refused I got so upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jedi giggled with devious satisfaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I did what I always do. I trained. For weeks I trained and trained, challenging myself with the most difficult lightsaber combat programs, after all anger has no place with the Jedi, so I had to get it out somehow. The council spent weeks on you, wiping your mind and breaking it down while I trained, it was to my surprise that once they were finished they left it to me to punish you for your crimes against the Jedi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the Twi'lek had begun walking over to you and she slowly leaned onto the bed, climbing in with you to straddle your stomach and pin down your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the perfect idea on how to do it as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAayla moved her legs forward, resting her thick leather boots on either side of your head, letting her bitty sink into you as she sat on your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I trained for the entirety of you weeks here with the Jedi with no breaks apart from required sustenance, not even to clean myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her boots pressed against the sides of your head you could hear something. You thought about it for a second and.. you weren't certain, but it sounded like her toes, rubbing against the insides of her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since you can never be permitted to leave..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAayla's grin turned into a toothy half-smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the name of the Jedi, I sentence you to a lifetime of serving under me, truly smelling the fruits of my labor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she raised her feet up above your face, using the force to slide off her boots and let them rest on either side of your head once more. Her sweaty feet glistened in the moonlight as she wiggled her long, narrow toes, her dirty blue soles emitting a stench so foul it could send a Rancor running. Aayla giggled once again with delight as she lowered her blue peds, letting her gunked up, long, narrow toes rest elegantly around your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAayla's smile faded into a sadistic grin as her eyes narrowed towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now take a deep breath of my enchanting aroma\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said as she slicked your nose with her footsweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll learn quickly to love that smell, or at least to pretend to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAayla continued, wiggling her rancid toes around your nose, stirring the stench of blue cheese from her toes directly into your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon you'll be sniffing my ripe toes like it's air, begging for a chance to snort my sweaty toejam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, pressing her soles harder against your face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't you worry, I <i>will</i> keep these rancid things ripe and sweaty for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAayla hoisted her feet slightly above your face, letting you see them one more time. The dirt that hugged her feet from being in her boots for so long, the sweat the covered her after letting those rancid soles sit in puddles of the stuff, all the mysterious black and brown gunk between her toes that frankly, you didn't want to know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's hear it, we'll practice..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said lowering her feet a little, as if to threaten you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all, you are officially bound to my service for life, might as well get use to it. Beg me. Beg me for the pleasure of sniffing up all the gunk from between my sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo it, or I make your new life a living hell, my little footsniffer.\"</span></div></div>",

Weeks of your life taken away as we ripped information from your weak mind, being bound a gagged in from of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuminara proceeded to kick off her boots, letting them clump to the ground as she wiggled her short, shapley toes dangerously close to your nose, wafting the stench of her sweat-soaked nasty green soles right into your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spending the rest of your days sniffing the sweaty feet of the most powerful Jedi Masters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuminara's feet closed in on you with incredible speed.

Luminara's reeking soles mashed into your face, pressing hard against you as she slid her green peds up and down, drenching your face with her unbearably ripe footsweat.

Her toenails are painted black.*<br>\r\n*She lowers her sweaty vinegary soles right onto your face.  She wraps her toes around your nose. You take a few deep breaths and smell a very strong vinegary smell with a hint of ripe cheese.  The smell causes you to feel light headed and you think that you might throw up all over her beautiful sweaty vinegary soles, however you hold your gut in knowing that if you threw up she would force you to lick it off of her feet.  She forces her soles down harder forcing you to get more of that cheesy vinegary smell in your nostrils.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Mara lifts her feet off of your face to let you have a break, this is however short lived and she forces her sweaty cheesy vinegary soles back onto your face... You notice after a few minutes that Mara Jade has fallen asleep due to the fact that she was sleep deprived from all of that training.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you think to yourself you realise that the cell door was left unlocked and that her purple lightsaber is still attached to her belt.  As the smell from her vinegary soles still goes through your nose you decide that you need to quickly make your decision,  You think giving her payback by grabbing her lightsaber and making good use of her beautiful body, but you decide that it's too risky to try to attempt.  You weigh in just staying put and being a good slave but you cannot handle the smell pungent vinegary toes.  You think that you can grab her lightsaber and make a break for it out the cell door...  It is an extremely risky plan but you decide to go for it.  You lift her stinky soles off of your face slowly hoping not too wake her and slowly roll out, you hold her soles in one hand as you reach for her hand to bring it underneath her feet to give her the familiar feeling of skin instead of the cold concrete floor and cold metal bedframe... Your successful in doing it and carefully grab her lightsaber from her belt and slowly sneak out of the cell door with one of her boots hoping to chuck it when you find a spot so that she takes longer to react to you missing.</span></div></div>",

Her soles glistening with sweat and her small, pudgy toes held small specks of toejam captive between them, both feet assaulting your nose with the nasty stink of a fine cheddar left out under the suns of Tatooine for over a month. Before you knew it, both of her feet closed in on you, her toes spreading wide to capture your nose between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secondly, this is how you shall spend each day with me. you'll becoming very familiar with having your face trapped under my swamp-like feet. As I don't give myself time to wash often, you'll at first find it difficult to cope, but every day you will be in this position. You will be grateful that I slather your face with my sweaty feet and you will learn to properly breath while I smother your nose in my foul toes, learn to breath in the pure stink of ripe feet while I hold your nose between my toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see my smelly feet are already numbing your mind, just keep taking nice and deep breaths and once you fall asleep, I can fill your mind with force visions of my foul feet.

She takes you to her quarters and lays you down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComfy?\u201d She asks sarcastically <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d You ask nervously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019ll soon see.\u201d She says as she slides her feet from her boots. Instantly a scent of Swiss cheese fills your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusti-.\u201d You can\u2019t even finish your sentence because she has gagged you with her socks. You can taste the sweat as it drips into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have some fun with you. The only question is, how to start.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Curved in such a way that it might be, and with a sudden horrifying realization the hatch opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about the boots back there,\u201d Ashoka says with a smile as she climbs into the cockpit of her Eta-2 starfighter. \u201cBut you just had to go do the one thing I told you not to do.\u201d<br>\r\nSlinking in further you were suddenly face to face with what we\u2019re becoming some of your least favorite things in the whole galaxy, her boots. Being this close the smell was awful but contained, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrashed violently as they got closer to you silently begging her to just stop, \u201cplease just let me go, please just let me go.\u201d A silent mantra you kept repeating to yourself, praying to someone! Anyone! that maybe your prayers would be answered.<br>\r\nPreparing your already soiled nose for the worst you tightly shut your eyes and worked as hard as possible against your restraints to turn away. But they had seemingly stopped, just above your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is just too good,\u201d the togruta half snickered,\u201dyou really hate these that much,\u201d she waved her boots in front of your face to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weak rasp of a, \u201dplease\u201d just managed to escape your throat before you were interrupted by both boots slamming down right next to your head, just too close for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCmon we both know that these boots aren\u2019t what your so petrified of, it\u2019s what makes them smell oh so awful. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside of them that you so desperately want me to keep inside.\u201d she sweetly whispered down to you as she began to pull her bare feet out of the boots that lay next to your head. <br>\r\n\u201cOoooh yeah, that just feels so good to air them out again, you know you were out for a while there and it was quite a trek back here. So if you thought they were bad before well,\u201d she hovers the sole of her right foot just above your face, \u201cyou\u2019re in for a treat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily before she could firmly plant her pungent foot onto your helpless face a communicator buzzed and a hologram of what you could only guess was her master appeared. Seemingly ignoring you for the time being she opted to place her feet back down beside your head instead, but that did nothing to help with the vinegary smell that still emanated from them. And unfortunately she was right they were somehow sweatier, grimier, and stinkier than the last time you had seen them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat have I gotten myself into this time,\u201d you thought as you stared in disbelief at the pale orange foot that soon would be using you as a personal smell absorber. Sure you had committed some crimes against the republic in dealing arms to the droid army but... was this an acceptable punishment for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell guess who\u2019s the luckiest man in the whole galaxy,\u201d she suddenly addressed you staring down  and shocking you out of your thoughts. \u201cAre you gonna guess or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly you replied, \u201cm-me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDing ding ding, correct answer. I was just officially given the go ahead by my master to start your punishment, it\u2019s crazy how fast he can get Padme to agree to something like this.\u201d she gleefully said still staring into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering begging again you tried yet again to bargain with her, \u201cplease I know some spice runners who can pay you...\u201d But she swiftly cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping your nose tight between her malodorous toes of her right foot she began to start up the starfighter.<br>\r\nAs you spasm violently beneath her foot fighting for a breath of fresh air, she speaks clear and confidently, \u201c By decree of the Galactic Republic for crimes against them by aiding the enemy in the war effort you have been sentenced to a punishment of my choosing.\u201d<br>\r\nTears formed in you eyes from both the stench of the slowly tightening grip of the cheesy toes and the realization that you might never be free again.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I bet you already know, that you. belong. to. me.\u201d she accented each word with a squeeze of her toes forcing the stench deep into your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack slowly crept into your vision once more as you found that Ashoka\u2019s rank feet where about to cause you to black out again. The tears held in your eyes spilled freely now as consciousness almost slipped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a breath, a holly wonderful breath of fresh air rushes into you seeing Ashoka retract her foot from your face and feeling the rumble of the engine. \u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable, I just have to focus on getting out of the atmosphere then it\u2019s all R-7. Plus why would I want you to pass out yet, we just got started.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile greedily gulping down air knowing the next might be your last for a while, Ashoka looks down at you a wide grin plastered on her face, \u201cmaybe being a padawan won\u2019t be so bad now knowing I\u2019ll always have you to come back too, now... get back to sniffing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that her pale orange feet came into view again dripping sweat onto your face as they lowered slowly, clearly enjoying the fear you experienced. She planted both heels onto your nose and said simply and sternly, \u201cdeep breathes.\u201d<br>\r\nHer heels were rougher and more calloused than you would have expected for some one her age, but still they stunk of moldy blue cheese and vinegar that had been left out in the heat to boil. You at first refused to breath through your nose opting to use your mouth instead, you could still smell it but it wouldn\u2019t be as potent. But then she called you out on it.<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be a real shame if I used the force to start helping you breathe, but it can be arranged.\u201d she said getting more aggravated with time. <br>\r\nDeciding that being able to breathe of your own volition would be better than not you steady yourself and take a big whiff of her sweaty heels. Immediately it is as if the foulest stench imaginable has entered your nose, enough to make you gag and eyes water \u201cThat feels so go keep it up,\u201d she said while grinding her heels into your nose. Opting for quick rapid sniffs instead one large one you got to work rapidly taking in air from Ashoka\u2019s heels.<br>\r\nShe looked down and moved her feet back some, \u201cnice job on my heels, but now you should really get used to my soles.\u201d She then  buried your face deep into the orange expanse of her sole with your nose getting slicked by sweat, and assaulted by a stronger smell than before. More rapid sniffing ensued and as she slowly wiggle and grinder her feet happily onto your face you enter a lose circle of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her feet back again so now your nose was level with her toes she didn\u2019t even speak, just shooting an authoritative look at you as she cured your nose between here toes. Yet here when you tried the quick sniff it didn\u2019t work she would shut your nose with her toes first and soon you understood. She essentially wanted you to continually take the deepest longest breaths you could at the most foul smelling part of her foot.<br>\r\nSteadying yourself you prepared for possibly the worst experience of your life, so far, and slowly drew in air from your nose. The odor could only be described as week expired milk left inside of a gym sock in the hood that it might become a cheese. It was rank, nasty, revolting and outright disgusting. You wanted to do more than gag, you wanted out now. But Ashoka only gleefully wiggled her toes to show you just how happy you were making here as she blissfully remained mostly unaware of your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo more times...slave,\u201d she said scrunching her nose onto your nose once more.<br>\r\nAlready being this far gone you drew in another wave of noxious fumes and saw your friend darkness creep into your vision again.<br>\r\n\u201cOnce more now, you can do it.\u201d On the verge of throwing up and well past tears you gave in to your togruta owner and pulled the remains of your pride and shattered them just as her foot stink shattered your brain as you drew in the final breath. \u201cOh, such a good slave, and look at that you did such a good job I think i\u2019ll let you have a little nap,\u201d she cheerfully said as you felt your body go limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you felt was the starfighter land and Ashoka slip her boots back on before darkness encompassed your vision fully, and you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wake up this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sweat from her feet poured over your face as she wiped her left foot all over you, keeping your nose between the toes of her right. As you took your first breath from her feet, you immediately gagged, it was as though she constantly kept swiss cheese in her boots at all times and constantly rubbed her toes in it and now all of that stink was being pulled right into your nose. You were forced to breath again, sniffing up more of her ripe foot odor as well as sniffing up some of her rank toejam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, get some good whiffs in. It's like I said, I must have been wearing these boots non-stop for months, but hey that's where you come in. For the next few months while I pretend to be on mission, that cute nose of yours shall pamper my feet. Every day you'll be inhaling the stink directly from my feet, you can dry away all of my footsweat by taking deep breaths up and down these swampy things and when I'm feeling especially nasty, I'm going to wrap my toes around your nose and make you snort my toejam so you can carry my footstink with you everywhere.

The scavenger wiggled her toes while smiling with delight. \"I don't get many chances to wash these poor beauties.\" She practically giggled out in an attractive imperial accent as she pressed her rancid feet harder against your face. \"But do keep sniffing, it feels wonderful.\" Your eyes were already rolling to the back of your head, but in fear of more up close and personal meetings with the scavengers staff or an even worse torture, you tried to make the girl pleased, helping out her rank Aak-dogs get nice and comfy on your face with more cooling sniffs.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaina Solo was the daughter of Han and Princess Leia and a extraordinary Jedi from her first day of academy. She showed exceptional skills with a lightsaber and talent wielding the force. The only downside was the brash, reckless manner she handled situations which often got her into trouble. Even as she grew a bit older into her upper teens, she still showed the same flaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Luke had confidence that she could take care of herself and would send her off on rather dangerous, covert missions that often led to capturing or spying on other threats. It was one such mission that her talents were put to the test when she was sent to a swampy planet to track down a smuggler named Sid who was supplying weapons and trading illegal artifacts to the criminal underworld. Jaina's mission was to find out who these buyers were and bring Sid in. The young Jedi took the mission without hesitation, excited to prove her worth to Grandmaster Luke and her parents. Despite her best efforts to trail him, the smuggler found out and gave Jaina a difficult time tracking his movements. Her boots became sodden with mud and the revolting stench of the swamp but still retained her beautiful appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after weeks of trailing him, Jaina had manage to locate him in a empty clearing where she sensed him resting inside a tent, unaware of her presence. This brought a devious smile to her lips, knowing she'd finally pay the scoundrel back for all those weeks of chasing him around. Her dirty boots squelched against the muddy ground as she confidently approached the tent, entering inside to find the smuggler, resting casually on a bed. Much to her surprise she found him rather young and handsome but that didn't sway her from the mission she was sent. Using the force, she flings him to the dirty floor, keeping him pinned there. His eyes shoot open, as he gasps, more startled then hurt. A confused expression came across his face as he gazed up at the young Jedi while she pulled up a seat and sat down across Sid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really gave me a hard time chasing after you all these weeks. Now that I have you, i'm not letting you go anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Jaina slowly removed her tight hard boots with a bit of difficulty, revealing her reeking beautiful feet that glisten with sweat and was partially caked with dirt from the swampy plant. Her toe nails had no polish to them but that only amplified their beauty, giving them a natural, warrior like appearance. The horrid smell of the bog only enhanced the stench of her feet as she wiggled her toes with anticipation, clearly excited to finally get to put her feet to use and have them aired out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell are you doing?! You already have me captured!\" Sid cried out, clearly confused and feeling his uneasiness grow as he eyes Jaina's pretty bare feet, walking her way through the sodden ground, making small delicate foot prints in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately for you, I need answers and also I really need a nice tongue bath to warm up my reeking soles. There isn't really anyone else here to do it but you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina's hold over him strengthened, keeping him immobilized but unharmed. Before he could say another word, she suddenly plants one moist sole firmly against his face with a light slicking noise, making his cheek squish beneath the pressure. She then gracefully stands up on his face, balancing on top of him perfectly with the ease of a ballerina, sighing contently as her reeking muddy soles wedged themselves firmly against his face, conforming to the shape of it. Her toes scrunch cutely, as she gently cups her toes around Sid's nose, forcing him to take in the brunt of the revolting odor, empowering the young Jedi further. Seeing his face pale as his cheeks flush with embarrassment only made her grin widen as she felt her weight sink into the smugglers face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina may have been light and small but Sid still felt pain at having her full weight pressing down on his face, making muffled painful groans of disgust vibrate against her soles. Not wanting to damage the goods, she sat down on Sid's stomach, letting her feet rest firmly against his face, nearly smothering him as she flexed her toes enticingly against his lips and nose, making dirty foot prints mark all over his face while she became more excited, having never quite had someone at her mercy beneath her feet in such a manner. She did have a bit of regret at his suffering and knew Luke would certainly not approve but the thrill felt so empowering and the warm feeling of his soft face cushioning her reeking feet as she aired them out was so relaxing. Feeling encouraged to press her advantage further, she ignored the regretful feelings and continued to smear her muddy soles all over his face, toying and pulling at his nose often, wedging it firmly between her toes so it was coated with the substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why Mara loves this so much. It truly is a wonderful sensation~ now that I have you all cooped up beneath my feet, there so many things I'd like to test out and try.\" Jaina says excitedly, clearly amused and enthralled by the power rush she felt at having the man at the mercy of her young teen feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Remember! This is a sniffing story, no feet in mouths)</span></div></div>",

It takes a few moments for you to realize that you aren't familiar with this room, and that for some reason you can't move, your body is awkwardly being held in a kneeling position. Panic quickly begins to set in as you try and fail to turn your head to see what is holding you. As though your panic triggered it, a female voice rings out from a part of the room that you can't see \"Finally, you're awake...\" slowly, she strode into view and sat in a chair opposite you, gazing down with a generally blank expression. \"Allow me to introduce myself\" she said in an official sort of tone \"I am Leia Organa. Princess, Senator, and General of the resistance you work so hard to quell\" a ringing silence followed her words... \"you work so hard to quell\"? what did she mean? In a sudden rush, the night before came back to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and a few friends had managed to steal a supply cache from an empire shipment, turned out to contain armor and uniforms. You decided to dress as a general, and your friends as storm troopers, and use these clothes to maybe steal a few more things, and bully some free drinks at the tavern before getting off the planet. The plan was working great, but for some reason, you can't remember anything past trying to take a trip to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're wondering how you got here, and what's going on...\" Leia said in a soft voice and she fidgeted with something in her hands \"So, let's clear things up, shall we?\" there was a small crack, and she held something smoking under your nose, and as you breathed it in, the hazy feeling in your brain cleared at once, and all of your senses felt heightened. \"So, General... as I'm sure you figured out, we drugged you and grabbed you from the tavern last night. This...\" she said as she sealed a container and cast it aside \"is a counter agent to it. It has a nasty side effect of sharply increasing the sense of smell for a few hours, but we'll make use of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled against whatever was holding you and attempted to speak, but it held your jaw firmly in place, making your plea come out in a muffled series of grunts. \"BE SILENT OR ELSE!\" Leia yelled, anger clear behind her eyes \"Your people have great weapons... you destroyed my home planet and killed almost everyone I care about. Now, we intend to take these weapons for ourselves and use them against you. I'm sure you noticed, we have taken one of your experimental prisoner transfer droids and used it on you. Our intel says, these things were designed to be so effective that even a Jedi Master wouldn't be able to break free... but the fact that it seals your mouth makes it quite poor for questioning someone. We haven't quite worked out a way to release that, without fully freeing the person it holds... so here's how this is going to go...\" Leia leaned forward and squeezed your nose shut, your eyes widened with panic as you realized that you had no way to breath or free yourself. She continued, locking eyes with you and whispering slowly as you tried to free yourself, your joints screaming with every attempted movement \"I will give you some incentive to answer our questions... then we will take you to your cell... and you can choose if you want to give us the info we're looking for... and if you don't... we can find start over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly released you and sat back, smiling as you desperately tried to compose yourself now that you could breathe again \"Scary not being able to breathe, isn't it?\" Leia said as she was reaching for something out of view. There was a dragging noise and, though it was under your chin and hard to see, you could just make out that she had moved a small table or something in between the two of you. \"Careful with those deep breaths though... don't forget that the drugs made your sense of smell much stronger... speaking of which... lets get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia removed one of her boots, revealing her bare foot, she had apparently not been wearing socks with them, and she rested her leg on the table between you. The smell was unimaginable... you couldn't be sure if it was because of the drug in your system, or if the smell was just naturally that terrible, but the moment she slid her foot from the boot you had to squeeze your eyes shut to stop them from watering and tried desperately to hold your breath. Every inhale burned and seared with a smell your could only attribute to rotten food, so strong that, even though you couldn't open your mouth, you could actually taste the stink.<br>\r\n\"Look at me -general-\" Leia said sternly, putting a special emphasis on the last word. Painfully, you opened your eyes and met hers as she spoke again \"This is just the beginning, so I want you to breathe deeply while I still let you. If I'm not happy with your performance, I may just have to suffocate you.\" with that, you gazed at the foot, a few inches from your face. There was a coating of dirt on it that appeared slimy from the sweat in her boot, and there were sections of lint or fur or something stuck in random places around her toes. Whatever she says, you couldn't bring yourself to do anything but take short shallow breaths that burned with the hot stink emanating from the foot in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said or you to breath deeply! Enough of this, forward please.\" She yelled, you to your horror, you began to roll slowly forward until your nose was pressed against her toes and she called \"Enough\" You desperately tried to hold your breath, wanting nothing more than to put off the moment you had to inhale, trying more desperately than ever to turn your head. You could feel her wet, tacky skin against your face and could feel a hot, sick sensation in your stomach and throat. You couldn't wait any longer... you had to breathe in, and it was so much worse than you could have imagined. With the stink, came bit of debris that you had no choice but to inhale, and you could feel it stick in your nose. The horrible rotting smell was so much stronger now, that your eyes were watering freely, and you were starting to feel as though all your senses were being assaulted. You mouth was watering uncontrollably as your body tried to wretch and be sick, but you physically couldn't so it was constantly choked back... yet you could still somehow taste this retched smell as it flooded your lungs.<br>\r\nMinutes, hours, days, weeks.... a century may has passed as you were trapped against this foot. You had hoped you would adjust to the smell over time, but no such luck... somehow, you could only assume it was the drugs at this point, the stench only became more rancid. Leia didn't speak again, or even look at you from what you could tell... not that you were able to see well with how badly your eyes were watering... but over time, you started to notice that it was becoming harder to breathe. She was pressing her foot harder against you, forcing you to work more or each breath, and pull in more of the gunk between her toes. Time ticked away and she squeezed your nose with her toes, harder and harder until things were starting to get dark as oxygen was becoming more scarce. It was then that she finally spoke again, as you struggled on the brink of consciousness \"Pass out if you want... I'll be keeping you here or a while. I want to me sure that this smell doesn't leave your face while you're in your cell. I'll be leaving my other boot on so I expect it to get much worse in there... just in case we need to do this again.\" She laughed softly to herself \"I actually almost hope that you won't answer our questions... I think I might enjoy this.\" </span></div></div>",

Your arms and legs were all but useless in stun cuffs, but your mouth was working like a dream: <i>\"Let me go! I-I'm innocent... please, your majesty!\"</i> you whimpered pathetically in your bondage. Duchess Satine's bright blue eyes stared down at you. Her reply was short and precise. <b>\"But you were caught negotiating with a terrorist, correct?\"</b> And you had no good answer for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well... I... you see...\"</i> your brain scrambled for an excuse, but as your ribs buckled painfully under the weight of the guards pressing down your back, you were forced to tell the truth. <i>\"... y-yes... your majesty!\"</i> With a subtle hand gesture, the Duchess ordered the two men to back away and you were finally able to breathe. <b>\"Then, it's settled. You will now be tried in a court of law. In face of your crimes against New Mandalore, and given your confession, you will be convicted of treason and sentenced to life in jail.\"</b> she said, calm and collected as usual. <b>\"Take this criminal away.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Duchess revealed your destiny, you were overcome with despair. Your whole life flashed by in a second, and the thought of spending the rest of it in prison filled your heart with dread. <i>\"No! Please... I beg you! I will do anything!\"</i> you sobbed loudly, clawing at the floor as the palace guards dragged you away to captivity. You held your eyes closed in shock, in complete denial of the situation. In an ultimate bout of strength, you managed to force them open. And to your surprise, you were still in the throne room. On the ground. Looking at Satine's heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I believe in redemption, I do.\"</b> the Duchess's voice echoed from above. <b>\"And I'm willing to pardon your sentence. <i>If</i> you are willing to partake in a little experiment of mine...</b>\" The answer flew off your lips as if by instinct. <i>\"Yes, of course, your majesty! I-I will do anything! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\"</i> you exclaimed, almost tearing up in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Great...\"</b> From the floor beneath Satine's throne, you saw her delicate, pale hand play around with zipper on her shoes. <b>\"I am no fan of tradition. But I'm no fan of violence either. You see, back in <i>darker</i> times, Mandalorian women had a clever way to discipline their children...\"</b> Slowly, she began to unzip her grey heels. <i>\"H-how?\"</i> you questioned meekly, as a sharp, putrid scent crept its way into your nose... <b>\"Using their smelly feet, of course!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon finishing her sentence, you saw the Duchess's lily-white feet slip out of her shoes, accompanied by a disgusting squelch... and gut-wrenching stench! Your lungs seared as the first wave of smell wafted into your nostrils: it was a rich, pungent blend of vinegar, a warm cloud of corrosive gas which emanated from Satine's sweaty, pink soles. You gagged over and over, struggling to breathe through the acid stink, while the Duchess resumed her monologue: <b>\"Imagine if we could do the same to our criminals... to traitors like you!\"</b> she exclaimed, brushing the tip of her long toes against your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes, her heels, her arches, they were all caked in toe jam... as her feet touched your face, you could literally feel the stench seep into your pores! That wasn't the smell of a queen, it was the smell of warrior (and a dead one at that!) <i>\"Y-you're sick!\"</i> you managed to yell out, a clear mistake, for when you opened you mouth, you immediately felt the sour foot odor adhering to your taste buds. Yuck! <b>\"Now, now... you promised to help me, didn't you?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there in silence, just trying to hold your breath. So much for clemency! <b>\"Hm, where should we begin? Oh. I know - <i>let's work on the sentences!</i>\"</b> Satine's feet slowly advanced toward your face... <b>which sentence was she going to exact on you?</b></span></div></div>",

But Aurra Sing didn't seem to care about your pathetic efforts when she barged in your hut and kicked you in the head, slamming you down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you raised your head, you got a better look at her. She was tall, wearing a brown vest and a blaster holster over her red outfit. Her skin was a pale white, and she had black makeup around her eyes.  Her long, red ponytail next to a grey antenna was the only hair on her head. She sat on your stomach, putting her feet beside your head, giving you a glimpse of the brown leather boots she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you caught a faint, cheesy smell in the air. Your eyes grew in disgust. It wasn't coming from her feet, right? They were trapped in those boots, her feet must be biohazards if they were smelling even within boots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the little runner finally stops.\" Aurra said, grinning menacingly. \"You know, you made me go quite a distance, in these hot leather boots no less.\" Just as you were about to say something, Aurra put her hand on your mouth, effectively gagging you. \"Sshhhh. The show's about to start\" she said as she took out her blaster pistol. \"No talking, right?\" She asked as she aimed at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in fear, which seemed to satisfy her. She let go of your mouth and began taking off her boots. \"My feet are so sore, and it's because I had to chase you all over Tatooine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots came off with a wet \"Plop!\" noise, and the faint smell of molten cheese, boot leather and pure sweat before assaulted your nostrils with tenfold intensity as she crossed her feet inches before your face. Her long arched slender feet were a pinkish color, and they were glistening with sweat! You could feel the heat coming off her feet, and you couldn't dare to turn your head away because of the blaster she was pointing at you. \"Now, you will entertain me, you lousy scum.

We've received word that a separatist research lab in the old Sith world of Moraband is on the verge of creating a biochemical superweapon, so toxic a few grams could wipe out the entire Republican population. We need positive confirmation that such a weapon exists, and if it does, how it can be destroyed. We request that you infiltrate the secret Confederate base located inside the Valley of the Dark Lords and bring back this information. Please, Commander... be careful. Moraband is a dangerous planet, and if our intel holds true, Asajj Ventress is sure to be watching over her master's bio-weapon. Best of luck, and may the Force be with you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Ti's hologram faded from existence, leaving you alone in your fighter. This all sounded a bit too much for a clone to handle, but then again, you weren't bred for cowering. Your job was to defend the Republic, or die trying! You plotted a course for Moraband, jumpstarted the hyperdrive and laid back on your seat as the planets and stars around you warped into long streaks of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">+++</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on Moraband was easy enough. Surprisingly little defenses for a secret base world - you guessed they were trying to keep the planet as unremarkable as possible. Finding the research facility itself was more difficult. There were no detailed maps on the Sith homeworld, the shifting sands and maze-like valleys made it impossible to survey. But you managed to track a droid convoy back to the Confederate lab, hidden at the entrance to the Valley of the Dark Lords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were just two B1 droids standing guard outside the base. They would be easy enough to snipe before either of dumb boxes of circuits could notice. You reached for the blaster rifle on your back, but your arm got stuck halfway through... as though an invisible hand were holding it still! \"Try knocking next time.\" an icy-cold, female voice echoed behind you. Your loose hand instinctively finds its way to your side blaster, but before you can even unholster the gun, a piercing jolt of electricity arcs through your metal armor, causing excruciating pain before finally knocking you unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me, we're going to have lots of fun...\" Asajj Ventress whispered to herself, smiling as she stood tall over your senseless body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">+++</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flutter open. You've been stripped down to your white cotton clothes and chained tightly to what seemed like an operating table. The room felt hellishly hot, probably due to the floodlights on the ceiling. As you struggled in your bondage, a familiar voice was heard: \"Well, look who decided to wake up...\" Ventress circled a few times around you, before locking her pale blue eyes with yours. <i>\"Are you so bad at killing you couldn't even finish a passed-out clone?\"</i> you barked fearlessly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Acolyte simply laughed as she played with her unlit light saber. \"I assure you, if I wanted you dead, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\" <i>\"Well, I'm not telling you anything either, if that's what you're hoping for!\"</i> you replied, steadfast in your loyalty to the Republic. Asajj giggled. \"What information could I possibly want from an idiot like you?\" her glowing saber suddenly spewed forth from its hilt and stopped just a few inches short of your face. \"The Jedi sent you, right? I knew they were too cowardly to come fight me themselves! I was actually starting to think they wouldn't even send anyone to check up on our 'superweapon'... but then, you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned off her light saber and circled around your table a few more times while talking. \"You see, clone... <i>I</i> am the superweapon. I have uncovered in the caves beneath this world a power of the Dark Side no one has ever seen before! A power that, once mastered, will allow me to defeat entire armies, destroy entire worlds and dominate the entire galaxy! A power that will finally allow me claim my place among the Sith... the power of my disgusting, toxic feet!\" Ventress exclaimed, laying her heavy, leather-clad foot on the side of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the warmth of Asajj's skin radiated through her boots, along with the sickening sound of sweat swishing around inside. <b>What do you do?</b></span></div></div>",

However, you had no time to celebrate as you and your squad of 100 soldiers was cent to the planet Lothal as a garrison of an outpost  guarding one of numerous warehouses where the Empire kept the fuel for the space fleet. Unfortunately, you got unlucky to suffer an attack from the local rebel group, and they managed to catch you off-guard  in your study, while your guys were searching for them anywhere except there. So you found yourself stuck in a room with a Mandalorion girl at the door.<br>\r\nNo. You obviously can't pass by her to escape, so you have one option. Fight this rebel. Your gun is lying on a cupboard shelf where you have left it so for the moment you are  unarmed. You had your pride though, and you could never admit defeat to her like a spineless dog. Options exhausted, you set to action the attack, they say that a man shouldn't attack a woman but against a rebel-scum  woman it was surely justifiable. You rise to your feet quickly, and shoulder-tackle the young Mandalorian in the rib cage, with both of you landing on the floor. For a moment you have taken her by surprise and were on top, but she quickly recovers and pushes you off, sitting on top herself, but you manage to push her off as well. You both roll around for a bit, seeking to gain advantage, until the girl manages to sit on top once more and this time she holds firm. Uh-oh. With a hard kick on your head you pass out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in a small room lying on a quite low table with you hands and feet caught in energy shackles. That very Mandalorian girl was sitting to the right side of your so-called bed with a sly grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandalorian: Welcome to our ship, Mr Imperial officer! I was rather lucky to capture you as you are, obviously, in charge of that outpost and with the information you give us about its guarding systems getting fuel for the rebel fleet will be a cake walk!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: I'm not giving you any info! If I do so and the Empire finds out, I'm dead... So I prefer to die as a hero rather than a traitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandalorian: Don't worry, you are not going to die. At least, not so soon. Knowing what a stubborn donkey an imperial can be Hera left me here to interrogate you, and believe me, I'm a profy! By the way, you may know my name, since you are not getting out of here. I'm Sabine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Pleased to meet you (sarcastically). But in any case I'm not telling you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Shh... You see, the Mandalorian females are known for their feet having a very strong pure vinegar smell. And yeah, I believe, my feet are a bit stinky since fighting the imperials all day inside these tight boots is never an easy task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the Mandalorian girl starts taking off her boots to reveal a beautiful pair of bare feet. She exhales in pleasure as she frees her toes for wiggle and spread after a long day confined inside her boots. Despite the fact that Sabine's feet look soft and silky smooth with pinkish soles, slender toes, curvaceous arches, high insteps and tan round heels, they were very sweaty and exhale a nauseous combination of foot sweat and moist boot insides. The scent of her feet gradually fills the air around you, and your nose starts to get irritated by the smell. You start to understand the way interrogation will look like...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Yeah, sure! My feet are really stinking bad! I can even feel them from up here! \u2013 the girl's face brightened with a wide smile \u2013 Then, boy! What do you think about them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freak out\u2026It\u2019s exactly what you were afraid of. Sabine intends to make you spend the rest of your time as her footstool sniffing her sweaty feet. Knowing that her feet have been inside hot boots for at least several days, you don\u2019t want see them close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Speechless, huh? Now, then shall we begin? Be sure to give my feet some hard sniffs, okay? \u2013 she slowly raised her feet above your head. You could see all the sweat, she had collected while out \u2013 Well, don't get just looking! Inhale my foot odor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine wastes no more time placing her right foot on your face, her heel resting on your chin as she forces you to smell the awful stench of her feet. Her right foot slides off of the nose, onto your face, covering a part of your mouth and one one of your eyes as the left foot joins it, as she then proceeds to rub both sweaty feet in your face. You gagged at the foul smell. A few whiffs garner the most intense womanly, stinky feet of your life \u2013 as well as a few coughs and a slight tear to your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Do you like my feet? \u2013 She asks with an arrogant smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Hell no! \u2013 You reply out of anger, shaking your head, trying to get her feet off of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Stop complaining and just smell my feet. \u2013 She replies with a mock look of taking great offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then presses her feet harder your face. You begin to cough as the smell of pungent vinegar fills your nostrils. She\u2019s obviously been wearing her boots barefoot for quite a while. Taking deep breaths you begin sniffing Sabine's bare feet repeatedly as she rubs them around on your face getting you to smell every area. You sniff her heels, then up her soles sniffing her arches, insteps and the balls of her feet. She then starts to manipulate your face with her feet having you make funny faces and the such much to your humiliation. She laughs at your predicament obviously letting out some built up stress probably made from constant fighting the Empire. Sabine then starts rubbing her pinkish soles on your checks and wiggling her toes on your forehead. At times, she would use her feet to smother you, chuckle at your muffled protests. Sometimes she would even use one of her feet to run her toes through your hair. What if she keeps you for days forcing you to smell her feet? Can you really handle that? It's only been about five minutes of her rubbing her foot sweat into your face and laughing at you but it feels like it's been hours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Not very fun under my feet, is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: Come on, that's disgusting and weird. Why couldn't you use electricity or other torturing devices?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Well, may be because you are trained at the Academy to overcome them? I've been a part of that system myself and I know all those tricks perfectly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually instead of rubbing her feet around she just sets her feet over your face so that it is fully covered by her soles. Every area of your face is covered by her sweaty feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Aww look at that! Your face fits perfectly under my stinky feet! \u2013 She says once again taunting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor awhile you just lied there inhaling her vinegary scented soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Now it's time for the best part! Let's see if this will break you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly grabs your nose tightly between her sweaty slick toes forcing you to take deep whiffs in between each of the pads which are by far the worst smelling part of her feet  filled with her toe jam and sweat. Their soft texture mushed against your skin as Sabine sticks your nose deeper between her soft toes wedging it deeply, filling your lungs with the sweaty powerful scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes she finally takes her feet from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine: Alright, I think that\u2019s enough face sniffing for one day. You'll have the whole night to consider if you want to cooperate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then puts on her boots and leaves with unpleasant thoughts and horrible smell stuck in your nose.</span></div></div>",

Just then a beautiful green coloured twi-lek woman comes through the door of the room your in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera: Oh, you've woken up!  I didn't expect you to awake for a little while longer.<br>\r\nYou: Where am I?<br>\r\nHera: You're aboard the Ghost.  Welcome to rebel territory<br>\r\nYou: You rebel scum!  Any minute my battle group (2 ISD, 1 Victory II) will come and destroy your stupid ship.<br>\r\nHera: I don't think the will happen we are safe in wild space.  We should be more concerned about the Hutts.<br>\r\nYou: I am a member of the Imperial Navy and I demand to be let go.<br>\r\nHera: I don't think I'll do that...  But what I will do is put your nose through a little bit of excitement, well maybe if you were Ezra.  <br>\r\nYou: What do you mean?<br>\r\nHera: You'll see!<br>\r\nHera takes a seat and slowly starts taking off her brown boots with a little bit of struggle.<br>\r\nHera: It took me a long time to get you in these shoes,  my poor toes...<br>\r\nHera plops her toes on your nose, you can feel that her feet are moist but dry for the most part.  You breath in and smell a very strong cheesy smell that gets stronger the closer your nose is to her toenails.  You take a minute to look at her size 10 green feet while she continues to rub her cheesy toes around your nose.  You think to yourself that Twi-lek females are known for their strong pungent cheesy smell and unlike most species they aren't capable of having a vinegary smell or very sweaty feet.  Its a good thing, you wouldn't be able to handle the smell of vinegary toes.  Think to yourself that you should be glad that she isn't a human who could have cheesy vinegary smell or a mandalorian who could have a pure vinegar smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera pushes her toes harder into your nose... You take a deep breath and get that cheesy smell inside of your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera: *fake moan* Don't you just love that smell?  Twi-lek women aren't just known for their beauty!  Unlike humans and mandalorian our feet don't get that vinegary smell that turns foot fetishes on so much... But our feet have the strongest ripe mature cheese smell in the galaxy!  Now, doesn't that smell good?</span></div></div>",

The outcast and convicted felon Jyn Erso, daughter of the imperial scientist Galen Erso has been sent to use unorthodox torture methods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in your holding cell just in time to look up and see the door to your cell open. <br>\r\nJyn: well its good to see that your awake now... I hope the effects have worn off because I am going to enjoy this.<br>\r\nYou: What do people want from me!

Jyn ripes off her boots and plops her soles on your face, this catches you off guard and you accidentally smell her fresh vinegary toes.  You notice that her feet have a red tint around her toes and heels which means that she was just training.  You try to move your face away because of the smell but your head is restrained.  Jyn continues to rub her strong vinegary toes on your nose.  The smell would be like heaven if you had a foot fetish but its like hell to you.<br>\r\nYou continue to jerk your head around because you know you won't last for long under the smell of Jyn's vinegary toes.<br>\r\nYou thrash your head around trying to break your neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn: I have to say you are a feisty one, all of this can be avoided if you just tell me where the death star plans are.
