He slowly slides his fingers into the briefs and deposits you between his balls so not to discomfort your position as he pulls his cock to point upwards to avoid it smothering you. His hand retreats, leaving you in the dim light of your dads briefs. You make yourself comfortable by laying down across the soft flesh and try to sleep. As you close your eyes your dad says, \"Good to know my little boy is safe...\". His balls constantly shift around at the slightest movement your dad makes, so sleep is almost impossible. A minute later you hear the tv flick on and your dad sits up a little, pulling his crotch between his thighs, this causes you to slide....</span></div></div>",

After walking, crawling and climbing your way to your older brother's right pectoral, you can see his nipple jutting out of his chest like a building, and along the base surrounding it, you see his areola. As you begin to trek onto his areola, you realize that James barely twitched at all. Probably so engrossed in his game that he didn't even feel you down there on his areola. You were going to change that. Dropping on all four, you were face to face with the pink landscape. Noticing just how soft and smooth it was, you brushed your hand along it's surface for  further inspection. It felt like how a dolphin's skin might feel based on what others had told you.

The impact of the fall left Jack unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, Jack was joined in the sneaker by James's huge sock-clad foot. The booms sounded like footsteps, so Jack guessed James was going to work. He worked at a shop, only about a 10 minute walk from the house. Around 10 minutes, James stopped and Jack was trying to struggle free. Eventually, after a while of struggling, Jack slipped through the top of James's sneaker But before Jack could climb up his brother, James walked off to have his break. The person at the till next to James's was James's friend Russell. He was quite tall, just under 6ft, and he had flattish blond hair, that was spiked up a little at the front.  He was 22, the same age as James, and Jack knew him quite well. Jack ran over and climbed onto Russells shoe. Jack...</span></div></div>",

Sure, she had a fringe of her hair dyed blue, but somehow that little bit made her fade into the background, rather than making her stand out. She was small, always wore baggy clothing, never said much, and went out of her way to avoid social contact. Her hair was always in her eyes and her face was always looking down. People barely noticed Amy while she was there, and forgot her when she was gone. Even her teachers, once they took attendance, forgot she was in their glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne person who didn't think Amy was invisible was her best friend and lab partner, Martin. When the two were alone, Amy had no problem talking. Martin didn't know what the rest of her looked like, but he knew Amy had a beautiful face (when you the hair out of the way and got her to look up).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Martin got the shock of his life one day. Amy was over at his house, and they were doing an extra project in his laboratory (a converted shed in his family's backyard). Amy was pulling off her sweatshirt to put on a lab apron. Martin looked over to see Amy in just a T-Shirt. It wasn't a revealing shirt, <i>per se</i>, but it was form fitting. And Martin discovered Amy had quite a fit form. She had a very narrow waist and flat stomach, which emphasized Amy's very firm and very large breasts. Martin had no idea about bra sizes, and obviously it was a question he would never be in a position to ask Amy. He thought they were somewhere between the size of a grapefruit and a cantaloupe, but that still gave him no idea of what bra size Amy wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy quickly got the apron on, and never saw Martin checking her out (or the erection he got at the brief sight of her shape), but from that moment on, Martin was a man obsessed. He had to see her breasts. He just had to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin finally got his chance.

But the logic of the situation appealed to him. If he could shrink Amy, then he could address Amy, and examine Amy, and especially Amy's breasts, and there was nothing she could do to stop him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Martin began experimenting, and finally found a combination that would shrink an animal down to a tenth of its original size. It made no sense, of course. If you reduced an animal down to that size, it shouldn't be able to function. And yet, somehow, the animals were no worse for being shrunk (except for being just a tenth of their original size).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter testing it on a number of animals, Martin felt it was safe to try on Amy. Anyway, he had to. He just had one dose of the shrinking formula left, and wasn't quite sure about the formula's exact composition, since it was pretty much accidental how he had arrived at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he brought Amy into his lab, he first gave her a birthday cupcake he made for her. She was oohing and aahing over his creation when he handed her the shrinking potion, explaining it was birthday punch. Amy was about to drink it when the shrinking potion bubbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it was a practical of some sort, Amy laughed and told Martin he \"almost got her,\" before pouring the drink down the sink.

Since She\u2019s lesbian things that might feel weird or awkward for strait woman to do with Sam, doesn\u2019t feel weird for her.   When you want to see a movie, she sneaks you in, when you guys go to a bar, and she\u2019s wearing something without pokets she sneaks you in between her boobs, she sometimes is in the house half, or rarely fully nude, not caring that you are staring at her, and sometimes she lets you sleep (Actually sleep) with her in her bed.  Stacey also on accasion brings home a lady friend for some love making.  You aren\u2019t as successful with the ladies, so when Stacey is in the bathroom she asks you to entertain the woman, or talk Stacey up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam has a job, on Fridays he goes to a lab, and they do small tests on him, such as dna samples, density, weight, height measuring, resistance to certain things, and you get payed a sizable amount for how little work you do.

How it works is that women pay a fee to model some underwear, and they ask Sam if they look good in it, or if its right for them, and he gets paid for the commission, he also uses it as a way to flirt with women.  See, how its set up is that the woman press a button when they\u2019re decent, and Sam who is in a small glass room with remotely opening windows wired to that button, judges them and convinces them to buy it.  If Sam likes the girl he opens a door on the box, and lets them hold him and then he flirts, for his safety he was a tracker in his uniform and a small button on a glove which can trigger a small alarm to warn a security worker named Valerie that he is being stolen.  It happens every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Friday nights, Sam and Stacey go to a popular lesbian bar and acts as eachother\u2019s wingmen, though Stacey is more successful.<br>\r\nStacey is genuinely nice, and you enjoy being her roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His dad always expects him to stay where he leaves him but Tommy couldn't  stand having his life decided for him. He suddenly heard footsteps coming down the stairs and turns to see Gus in just a jockstrap. Being a military family and it being just giuys in the house, nudity wasn't uncommon. Gus lumbered into the living room and hovered over the couch, putting Tommy in the shadow of his large butt. Gus snatched up the remote and changed it to something, but Tommy was busy trying to determine if his brothers bare butt was about to smother him. Gus let his knees buckle too quickly for Tommy however, leaving him dazed as his brothers cheeks crushed him into the sofa.

Don't want to sit on you like I did last week, though that was a pleasant experience as it always is.\" Gus said as he picked up the pair of compression briefs and drops them on the floor, showing he didn't intend getting dressed yet or even at all today. You strode out into a more open area of the bed that Gus was looking at and waited patiently for him to finally see you. Finally his gaze spotted you and he extended a hand that scooped you up in a fist, you could feel him moving around on the bed before the hand opened and you were deposited on his abs. You ignored the fact he was still wet and of course you were mere inches from his manhood, which you had your back to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do little bro? My friends just cancelled on me so I have nothing to do all day, and Dad isn't coming home until this evening, so we have the day to ourselves.\" Your brother said as scratched at his left pec. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thought about it, going out on the town was a Nono with you, and you're sure your dad would not only punish Gus but you too if he found out, so going out was never an option for you really.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Physically, Grace and Michael looked nothing alike. It was almost impossible to think they were cousins. Michael was a gangly, fair skinned blue eyed young boy with unruly blonde hair. He did share Grace's naturally sunny disposition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace knew her cousin Michael had a crush on her, but she didn't think anything it. She just thought of as something that made him even sweeter than he already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, what did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll answer your questions later, Grace, For now, we need to get out of here,\" Michael said hurriedly. WIthout ceremony, Michael grabbed Grace and dropped her in his daypack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand questions went through Grace's mind as she got jostled about in Michael's daypack, with a big one being, Why Wasn't She In A Full Blown Panic? Somehow, her cousin had managed to shrink her, and she was acting like it was the most natural thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairly soon they arrived at Michael's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's mother and father were both highly regard professionals who provided for Michael very, very well but who didn't have as much time as they would like with him. So Michael was more often than not left to his own devices. So, as he carried a tiny Grace in his daypack to his room (actually, more of a mini-apartment), he knew he wouldn't be interrupted as get to know Grace better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Grace knew, Michael's hand reached in the daypack and pulled Grace out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace felt...,well, skittish was a good word. Not fearful, exactly, even though she had every right to be, but not comfortable either. She and Michael just stared at each other silently for a moment. Grace was trying to come to grips with what had happened. Michael was marveling at how warm and good his beautiful cousin felt in his palm. The dark skin of her exposed limbs contrasted remarkably against the pale skin of his hand. And he was most intrigued by her large chest, pushed out so eye catchingly against her cheerleader top, moving in and out as she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Grace broke the silence by asking, \"Michael, how---how did you do this to me? And how are you making me stay so calm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the magic spell I cast on you,\" Michael explained. \"It not only shrunk you, it helps you trust me. Because I would never hurt you, Grace, I love you too much. And if I did hurt you, well, the spell would instantly break. There might even be bad consequences for me. So that's why you're calm. Because the spell is letting you know nothing bad is going to happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace nodded. That made sense. And it wasn't like she ever gave it any thought, but she knew that if anything had ever happened that would be her at a disadvantage, her sweet cousin Michael was one of the few people she knew he would not hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was quiet for a few moments, before she continued. \"Michael, I love you too, sweetheart, but what you've done. Well, it's not natural.\" That was a major understatement, if ever there was one. \"Can you undo it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded, \"Yeah, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe you better,\" Grace continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael's face screwed up in concentration, before ne nodded his head and saidl \"Okay,</span></div></div>",

He lives with his mother, younger sister, older sister, and his cousin that shows up once in while to play. Mike's life was normal for a few years, until he had an accident last year no thanks to both of his sisters. He doesn't remember much of what happens other then that now he is one micrometer tall. His family wears either special contact lens or glasses to see the micro boy, but it only helps when they are paying attention to Mike, otherwise he's on his own since no one can hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother's name is Charlotte, a nice mother that cares for her children. She is a tall, slim woman, six feet tall to be exact, has long blonde hair, always like to wear as a pony-tail. She incredibly smart, which make Mike think that it was one of his mother's invention that cause him to be this small. She will always wear either a blouse and a skirt, or some kind of dress. She mostly takes Mike with her to keep an I on him, while trying to home-school him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily, Mike's younger sister, is six years old. She is playful, kind, and energetic towards people, but she's also very forgetful, too energetic, and clumsy at the same time.

She is one of the people who shrunk Mike to a micrometer. She knows that now she has to be extra careful with her micro brother, but she mostly cause more trouble for the poor boy and is unaware of the problems she causes him. There are times she forgets Mike when she puts him in her pockets, almost crushes him or eat him, and few other stuff. Mike knows his sister is young, but because of these events it made him terrified for his life when his mother assigns Lily to take care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina, Mike's older sister, is ten years old. She's not the stereotypical blonde, she is smart, but she can be very lost in space or get distracted easily that it makes others question her. Despite that part, she is calm, athletic for her age, and fun to talk to. She is about the average size for a ten year old girl, her hair goes down to her back. She the other person that is why Mike now lives the life of a microbe. She is slightly more responsible to Mike than Lily, but she tends to be impatient with him because she doesn't pay attention to the fact he can't do much at a micrometer height. Because of this impatient nature of hers, Tina tends to stuff Mike somewhere on her when she does sport; shoes, pockets, mouth, nose, if she can stuff Mike on or in her she'll do it no matter where or how embarrassing it is. Mike doesn't mind Tina, but he wish that she is more patient with him... or at least put him somewhere that isn't her clothing for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCousin:( Insert description here)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was in his room, waiting to see who is it that will be in charge of him today.

A huge bed with the sheets tossed back sits in the middle of the room, which Tony was most likely going to land on. Further observance rewards him with the site of shorts and jockstraps littering the floor, between the bed and the monolithic door that leads to the bathroom. Next to the door, a dog bed with an enormous mass of muscle and fur was nearby. The creature occupying the bed was none other than Blaze the Doberman, one of the Family dogs. Tony has had many experiences with blaze and has been on every millimeter of that dogs body, inside and out. Tony had learned at a young age he could withstand enormous pressure, and could go a long time without substantial oxygen, the ways of learning were never pleasant however. Tony finally landed on the bed sheets with a silent thump, then quickly got up to survey is immediate surroundings. The scent from the sheets was no doubt that of Hunter his father, who was basically a god to Tony. As if on cue, the bedroom door swung open and Hunters massive frame filled the doorway. His chiseled pecs rose and fell as he stood there a second as if knowing Tony was around to admire him. It wasn't too uncommon for the men in the house to get domineering with Tony, playfully dominating and commanding him to worship every inch of their godlike figures. Hunter finally heaved his frame into his room, causing Blaze to flick his ears at the disruptive noise Hunter made as he simply walked, each step shaking the room slightly. To Tony each footfall of his father was an Earthquake, each word from his mouth a Boom, each burp and fart a hurricane. Tony broke from his daydream to notice that his father was soaking wet and in a tight fitting swim trunk. His crew cut hair glistened with water droplets as did his entire body. Tony watched as his father peeled off the trunks and exposed his hefty package to the room. Hunter then grabbed a used towel nearby and quickly dried himself off, dancing around slowly to get every crevice lining his body. When he was finished, his Goliath rear was now facing Tony. Hunter, Ross and James bring the term Mooning to the next level when Tony is involved. Their cheeks are the size of mountains to him, their cracks canyons, their holes caves. Tony stepped back as his dad sat down on the bed, sending ripples through the fat and muscles of his backside as well as the bed. He shifted backwards more and rotated so that he was now laying on the bed, leaving Tony between his massive thighs, facing his canyon butt crack with his building sized balls hanging over it. A sigh escapes Hunter as he grabs his phone and begins to flip through it, Tony capitalizes on his fathers prone state too.... </span></div></div>",

Tearing your eyes away from Dalton you look up at Cole and try to get his attention but it fails. Cole picks up his singlet and shakes it out sending you flying. The world passes by in a blur but when you hit a wall you now instantly what it was made of. You had flown off and hit muscle. Specifically Daltons massive left pectoral muscle. You then start to slide down but luckily he has a bit of chest hair and you grab on. At normal size your about 3 inches away from his nipple right above a tattoo he has of a compass. Dalton smells of manliness but not in a bad way. You're so caught in trance about Dalton that you don't even realize as he pulls his singlet strap on.

He is around his late thirties to early forties and has very tan skin. His head is covered in salt and pepper hair and he's in extremely good shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look up into his face waiting for him to say something you realize that this is the first person you've ever known that your family didn't introduce you to and that's kind of terrifying since it means you don't know is you can trust him.

You made slow progress towards it, listening carefully for any change in Tim's breathing. The thunderous snores continued unabated, however, and you eventually made it out of the bedroom. There was a little more light out here, due to there being multiple windows and the bright moonlight. It allowed you to find the stairs with relative ease. You thought it would be a gruelling climb down, but then you remembered your invincibility. So instead, you jumped down the first thinly-carpeted step. It was like a normal-sized person jumping over 150 feet and the adrenaline rush was amazing, but when you landed with a heavy thud you felt nothing except a heavy impact. There was no actual pain and no damage to your body. No bones broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whooped in joy and took the next step with a running leap. You thought about jumping skipping the stairs entirely - the stairs had wooden bars horizontally across on the right side and you could easily have slipped under them and jumped to the floor below. But that was too scary to contemplate, and in all your 18 years you'd never tested you invincibility <i>that</i> much. One step at a time would be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after 10 or 11 fun little parachute-free BASE jumps, you had reached the floor. And the front door was right there in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem...how on earth to get out? There was no catflap or letterbox on the door. There would probably be some way out of the house if you looked hard enough...but it was the dead of night and who knew what kind of creature might be lurking. You hadn't asked Tim if he had any pets - there hadn't been time - so to look around too much was to risk being eaten by his hypothetical dog or cat. Alternatively, you could simply lurk there, out of sight, and slip out in the morning when Tim opened the impassable mountain of a door.</span></div></div>",

Invincible or not, you could end up trapped down there. You found a couple of crumbs on the kitchen floor and brought them over to the hole, dropping them in, but they were too light to make a sound when they dropped - or the hole went all the way into a basement, which Tim might have for all you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was an incredible opportunity to take some control of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the tiled bathroom, which was kept relatively clean, pristine white with light blue walls. You spotted the shower on your left, perched high, high up on the wall. The giant god would be there soon enough, but you needed to hide. You spotted the sink next to the shower - getting behind it would make you virtually undetectable but it might impede your view of the giant.

You nearly gave an involuntary squeal of excitement as two white-socked feet entered, with you peering around the corner of the sink. You didn't want to be so obviously visible. Soon the white socks were removed and placed elsewhere, perhaps the small washing hamper you'd noticed earlier, revealing a pair of gorgeous, brown feet that dwarfed any pair you'd ever seen. They must easily have been size 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came shorts and underwear, with the giant almost causing you to fall - such were the reverberations when he stepped out of them. They also ended up also into the hamper, presumably. But at your angle you couldn't see all the goods.

You looked away from him for a moment and saw a towel on top of the bathroom rug, with a pair of boxer shorts atop it.

It was a good place to hide out and a <i>great</i> place to spy on him. So as the giant stepped into the bathroom, shaking everything around you as he did, you held firm. If you'd run you'd have just exposed yourself anyway. He'd arrived far too quickly. You felt incredible anticipation as the giant removed all his clothes and put them into a nearby washing basket...you could smell the sweat from here but it only served to further excite you. You gave a little whimper of sheer excitement as the giant climbed - <i>crashed</i>, really, such was the cacophony it caused - into the shower and you stared up, all the way up, at this well-over 6ft giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cock was enormous, uncut and thick beyond your wildest dreams - you figured it must be twice as wide as you were tall, to say nothing of the length - even soft, or semi-soft, you realized it was 9 or 10 times bigger than you.

You suddenly felt the cold of the water and steeled yourself to resist it, knowing it would soon warm up and be much nicer. And so it did. Once small amounts of steam began to rise nearby, the god took a couple of steps from the other side of the wall of water directly into it, and the real show began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was magnificent to watch. The giant's muscles rippled with beautiful intensity as he scrubbed every inch of himself with the half-open shower gel on the other side. He applied the tiniest amount of shampoo to his head - which wasn't, you noticed, completely bald but shaved very close - and then bent down to wash his magnificent toes, all of which were longer than you, all of which were capable of utterly dominating you. It was the same for Tim, but in the case of this god it felt that much more...real, that much more intense. Possibly because this giant was simply the most powerful creature you had ever encountered. You felt to be a victim of his enormous, powerful weight would test even your invincibility. He then washed his dick, and that truly was a sight to see - an enormous sea serpent being gently washed, cleansed by the long, rough, tough fingers. He peeled back the foreskin, exposing the head and washing underneath. The smell of the dick wafted down to you at this and you blew your load at this amazing sight, but it didn't deter your desire to keep watching as the giant ran his hand up and down it, giving it a thorough service and manipulating it still further, causing it to grow stiffer and larger. Your mouth dropped open - you didn't think that was possible, and yet here it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to rip your lungs out, to do something <i>drastic</i>, in supplication. The water ran off the body, and you felt absolutely miniscule as drops of it soaked you through, but you realized it was that miniscule size that was allowing you to witness this religious event. It felt like a pilgrimage, an out-of-body experience. You simply stared, trying to take in every inch you possibly could - the pecs, the thighs, the enormously muscular shoulders and upper arms, the delectable toes, the smattering of armpit hair (clearly he shaved it but not too regularly), the dick, the beautiful face, the deep, baritone hum that emanated from that powerful diaphragm...and his gigantic arse, like two perfectly toned mountains side by side that you were treated to a perfect vision of when he turned around briefly. They caused you to go weak at the knees a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at his brown eyes as he furtively cleansed every area of himself with a loofah, before the enormous arm reached over you to hang it back in its designated spot. You never wanted this to end, but it looked like it was about to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

You realized it could be the end of your freedom, that he could easily trap you somewhere, do anything he wanted to you. But you felt sure the giant wouldn't do that. It was about whether you trusted yourself, backed your own judgement. And you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one night, when Michael was alone and watching TV, you ventured into the living room. There he lay, in his grey tracksuit bottoms and a shirt that hid his powerful figure. You decided the best way to get his attention would be to climb to the sofa, where his head was, so you did so. The climb was difficult but nothing too taxing - you'd gotten used to this sort of thing by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you stood, behind Michael's massive head, covered in dark, very short hair.  You walked closer to it. You had decided to play it humble. \"Umm...excuse me?\" you said loudly to the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael jumped up, startled, and the movements nearly threw you off the couch. You stumbled around and sat, hoping to maintain some sort of equilibrium on the arm of the couch by lowering you centre of gravity. Instinct screamed at you to turn tail and run, to just dive right off the couch and hide. But no. You stayed sat exactly where you were as the huge head turned around and stared at you, eyes wide and nostrils flaring out with surprise. It was, as always, quite a thing to be stared at by such a massive, intimidating presence. You stayed where you were, your whole body shaking with fear and adrenaline as Michael leaned in closer. You felt his warm breath upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke in that deep, booming voice. \"What...are you?\"<br>\r\nYou couldn't respond immediately. You simply stared at him for a few seconds, unable to think or speak, such was the fear that now gripped you. Eventually, you said, \"um...I'm...just a guy...a small guy.\"<br>\r\nMichael shook his head, unable to comprehend what was happening. You stared at each other a little more before you broke the awkward silence. \"I've been living here for a little while now...I wasn't sure whether or not to introduce myself. But you seem like a decent enough guy so, um, I thought maybe I could trust you. I didn't want to keep sneaking around. It's your house, so if you want me out, I'll go. Seemed unfair that you didn't know.\"</span></div></div>",

Um, ok then.\"<br>\r\n\"Any more o' you I should be looking out for?\" asked the giant.<br>\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"I don't see my family anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n\"I ran away,\" you said, not wanting to totally lie. \"We...um, disagreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael paused, then nodded. \"OK,\" he said, holding up those huge hands, palms facing you. \"I don't want to pry.\"<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Don't worry, I like living my own life.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool. Well you're welcome here, little man.\" Something about the way he said \"little man\" really did it for you and set the pulse racing with excitement more than fear for the first time since meeting Michael.  <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whereabouts do you sleep?\" he asked, leaning forward a little, clearly burning with curiosity. His face dominated your vision and  it was more of a struggle than ever to maintain eye contact with such a behemoth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In-in the walls,\" you stuttered.<br>\r\nMichael raised his thick, black eyebrows, his dark eyes fixed on you. \"Cold in there?\"<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" you shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Well you can have the spare room,\" he said with a laugh. \"I was gon't use it to work out in, but it's too small.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" you asked. <br>\r\n\"'Course. Bed's still in there. All yours. Might be a bit high for you though. Have't find some way to get down in the morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, that won't be a problem. I'll jump.\"<br>\r\n\"From there?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm invincible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael blinked, shook his head and said, \"what?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm invincible. Don't get hurt or damaged or anything. As far as I know. I don't go trying to kill myself or anything. But I've fallen onto hard floors from the ceiling of a room and been fine, a dog once tried to chew me and couldn't bite my skin...nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's face changed into an impressed one. He gave a low whistle. \"You're kiddin'.\"<br>\r\n\"Nope. Try and squeeze me. Bet you can't.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what Michael might do. He was going to test your invincibility, but you wondered if it had limits. This was an immensely strong giant you were dealing with here. Maybe he'd be the one to break it. If he was, though, what a way to go? Shaking his head, the giant leaned back a little bit and brought one of the huge hands right over to you. You resisted the urge to run away from it as it hovered near you. Warmth emanated from it, as well as a vague smell of manhood. Your knees went weak. \"Sure about this?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\nMichael took a deep breath and pinched you between thumb and forefinger very, very gently. It was an exhilirating experience. His fingers felt a little rough, but his touch was light and caring, gentle. And the roughness only made him more attractive, anyway. He lifted you up. There was a disorienting gust of wind as he moved around on the sofa so he was in a sitting position, with you still help gently but securely in just two of the giant's fingers. Now he was staring right at you, and you felt the fingers begin to squeeze tightly. But you felt no pain, no fear of death. The grip was strong, incredibly so, you could tell - it just wasn't doing anything to your invincible body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" you said, a little smugly.<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said, amazed. \"This is mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tilted his hand up and let go, so you dropped and slid down until you were in the centre of his massive hand, which was itself the size of a room. You looked around it and sat down to get  a better centre of gravity as the hand was raised even closer to the giant's face. He broke into a huge, toothy grin which had a little air of mischievousness to it. \"Now I won't have to watch where I'm going so much,\" he laughed. \"I could step on you and you'd be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Please don't,\" you said hastily, but Michael just laughed again. Suddenly a huge force, a jolt, came from the arm below as he flung you into the air. Your ears popped as you rapidly ascended several feet, before hurtling back down. You screamed as you descended at terrifying speed, before...landing safely in Michael's cupped hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified, out of breath... but exhilarated. That had never happened before, nothing like that. Michael raised the two hands to you and opened them up, so you once again sat in his palm. \"Alrigh'?\" he said.<br>\r\nYou just laughed out loud, adrenaline pumping through your body. \"That was amazing!\"<br>\r\nMichael grinned again, that delightful smile. \"We're gonna have a lot of fun, little guy.\"</span></div></div>",

She thought I was really cute and hung out with me. I was surprised about how cool she was with the whole thing. After a while they got married...I was there, hidden away in Michael's suit pocket. He really was very kind to me...he played with me a lot, sometimes even absent-mindedly while watching TV, but I liked the attention. Obviously when they had kids he had less time for me but I was happy to help out whenever I could...however I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I had incredible lust for him, but I was able to satisfy that a fair few times...especially when, one drunken night, Laura suggested I help \"spice up\" their sex life. I tried not to agree too eagerly, even though it was unbelievably hot. Michael was worried it would make things weird, to which I said, \"this is already really weird.\" And he laughed. The first couple of times he had trouble lookinga t me but he got used to it eventually, and my god riding his dick while he ploughed Laura was an unreal experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, it was all good. I suppose a life like that is a form of adventure, but it's not the seat-of-your-pants \"ahh the tiny is in trouble! oh look it's another guy who wants to use him sexually! Oh look it's a bad guy, how will he escape!\" kind of adventure you want to read about...so let's call it a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to go...they're \"trying for a third baby\"...or that's Michael's excuse, anyway.

There was a huge crash and your eyes opened to see the \"ceiling\" - actually the bottom of the sofa - collapsing in towards you. You yelled out for a second, then clapped your hand over your mouth. You heard a huge, deep sigh above you and realized what happened. The giant had sat down on the sofa. That was the cause of this ruckus. You wiped a little sleep from your eyes. You had no idea how long it had been, but it didn't feel like very long. It was still very light outside, you could tell. Maybe a couple of hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were more pressing matters. For one thing, the 250lbs giant sitting directly above you. It was a very tense situation. Though, thinking about it, you couldn't imagine a situation where he might look under the sofa as long as you didn't make too much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you crept forward towards the edge. You couldn't see the giant's legs or feet at all, which was  a little disappointing - you supposed he was lying on the sofa, controller in hand. You stared at the nearby coffee table, upon which was an open bottle of beer. You watched as the thick arm reached over to grab it and you heard deep, satisfied gulps before it was returned to its spot. Now the screen was turned on, a gaming menu navigated, a shooting game opened. You recognised it because your brother had played it before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant went online and you realized he could be here a while. What did this guy do, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you decided to sit and watch the show. The TV was thunderously loud, the gunfire effects rattling through your body, making for a very intense experience. You sat, cross-legged, still under the sofa but close to the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the giant started to lose a few games and he gave a threatening grunt. You gulped as the giant shifted ahead, perhaps trying to get more comfortable. You certainly didn't want this guy to see you if he was in a bad mood...you withdrew a little bit, just in time for the feet to land on either side of you, directly ahead.  They were very far apart, much further than you would have thought, and you imagined being able to see the whole of the giant sitting on the sofa, legs far apart, spreading himself, dominating the space. It made you tremble with excitement. What's more, now you could see the two perfect feet right ahead of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were perfect things, very dark brown, nicely-clipped nails, clean after his recent shower, and really, really big. Even for a giant. You inched forward and stared up at the muscular calves, bulging through a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms that he was using to lounge around in. You gulped, unable to contain your lust for this guy. You wondered if he would notice if you touched the feet...just a little bit. It was a heavy risk, but the more you thought about this guy the more you just didn't care. Or you could be sensible, stick to the plan - wait until you knew more about this guy before taking the risk of revealing yourself.</span></div></div>",

The sounds of the videogame and the giant using the controller were relegated to the background as you got a great view of the giant's face from below. God he was handsome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved on, closer and closer to the left foot, until eventually you reached it. You examined it closely, every line, every imperfection on the skin. You walked to it, walked around it, took in its scent. It smelt fairly clean, but also like a foot, a foot that would utterly dominate if given the chance. It was perfect, the skin tone, the size, the long, meaty, powerful toes and clipped nails...perfection. You couldn't stop yourself - you stroked it. Touched it. You felt your arousal as you did it, the warmth of the giant's skin transferring to you, causing you to shudder. It felt great, smooth, magnificent. You walked around to the toes now and knelt, licking the second toe and feeling between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realized the stupidity of what you were doing.

But at least now the monstrous dog had a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprinted for the car, which had seemed close at first but such was your anxiety it now seemed further and further away. You estimated you were about 10 seconds from it, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" you heard the yell of the master and looked back. Hugo had pulled himself free of the giant human's grip and, after a moment's hesitation, started tearing towards you! You looked straight ahead and committed to the sprint, but the car was surely too far away at the pace Hugo was closing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a drain cover to your left, though. Diving in could be your only chance to avoid being dog excrement.</span></div></div>",

Then, shortly after that, the chaos stopped. You realized you weren't being dragged along anymore and the water was more calm. So you opened one eye a crack and looked around. You could see a light up above! Letting the last gasp of air out of your mouth, you made for the surface and broke the water, coughing and spluttering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sewer. You were in the sewer. It utterly stank, so much so that you gagged before breathing through your mouth. Looking around, you noticed a set of stairs leading into the water and you swam over to it, using the well-worn, chipped concrete to climb your way out. You fell onto your back, completely exhausted, trying to get your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, you stood up and climbed another step, then another, until after 5 or 6 you were at the top.  You looked around. Off in the distance were some...bars, almost like a prison, in the middle of the sewer canal. There were floor-to-ceiling and covered by a concrete arch. That must have been the metallic thing you struck on the way down, so that was the way you came from. You could back that way, try and find a way up that might be somewhere roughly similar to where you started, or head in the opposite direction and look for another way out. </span></div></div>",

Sleepily, you wondered if you were falling in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he sat up, so he was staring down at the briefs and you in his gigantic hands. Still smiling, he said, \"alright. Gotta go to work. How do you want to travel?\"<br>\r\nYou were confused by the question and just looked up at them, staring at the black hair that was flecked with the slightest grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've got two choices, bud,\" he said.

Maybe once you got to know each other better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll, uh...ride in your pocket, if that's alright,\" you said hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looked disappointed for a second, but then said, \"no problem,\" with that wide grin of his. He placed you down and treated you to a show as he got ready for work. He took you to the bathroom and you watched him shower, amazed at the raw, lithe power of his muscular body. You grew hard watching him and imagined yourself living within inches of that body all the time. As the reality of such a wonderful future dawned on you, you gave a little shudder of delight as Tim stepped out of the shower and walked over to you, towelling off in front of you. You stared at him, agape, and he laughed. \"Impressed, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Your body is amazing!\" you called up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I like yours too,\" he said with a chuckle. He reached down and petted you with a single finger. The pressure was incredible but you felt no pain due to your invincibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later he was completely ready for work. \"Alright little man, let's go,\" he said as he grabbed you and slipped you into his shorts pocket. \"Don't worry, I won't put anything else in there. It's just for you,\" he said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pocket was dark and deep, but comfortable. You sank all the way to the bottom. It smelled strongly of a combination of Tim's personal scent and fabric softener. Clearly it was a fresh pair. Without warning you felt an incredible pressure pressing you into the wall of muscle that was Tim's thigh. \"Hope you like it in there little one. Just punch my leg a few times if you need anything...don't worry about hurting me, I doubt you ever could.\" He roared with cocky laughter and you blushed. Tim was right, there wasn't much you could ever do to hurt him. Your future existence lay entirely in his beautiful, rough, tough hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough space in the pocket became incredibly limited. The muscular leg pushed against the fabric as Tim sat down in his car. You wondered if you were creating a lump in his shorts, a suspicion confirmed when a single finger began to stroke you. \"I see you,\" Tim's muffled voice came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he drove. The engine of the car reverberated through you. Eventually, though, Tim arrived at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then began to walk with a strong, confident purpose, his hand occasionally reaching down to pat and stroke you. After a couple of minutes you yelled out in shock as your fabric home was invaded by Tim's long, powerful fingers, which began to play with you, running up and down your tiny little body. You reached out and stroked the fingers, licking them, and you heard Tim breathe out slowly in excitement. \"I gotta stop playing with you,\" you heard him breathe. \"It's gonna look bad if I try and coach these guys while rock hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, through the mesh pocket you could see the bulge in his boxers growing a little bigger. You grinned. Perhaps this was a challenge...you began to rub yourself up against the leg, and then push yourself against the pocket wall, jumping against it to try and reach the slightly-expanding dick. You used all your energy to try and arouse him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Tim shudder - literally shudder - in excitement, and you felt a rush of pride as you realized you had done this, you had done this to this gigantic god. Tim suddenly and abruptly changed direction. \"First stop, my office, then,\" he said roughly. He strode up some stairs, with you continuing to arouse him. Soon enough you were in Tim's office, the room where you'd first spoken. </span></div></div>",

Closer to you, you saw the bulge in his tracksuit expand somewhat and you smiled.

He tilted his head forward which protected you from the rush of water and gazed upon you with a combination of lust and protectiveness. You returned his excited smile, and he manoeuvred your body into his palm. With almost no warning he began to run you all over his body, across the coarse chest hairs and his arms, even into his pits. The hands were careful with you but not too much, and as the shower continued they began to press harder and harder. It was a richly enjoyable experience as you felt every inch of Tim's skin, down his legs, his muscular calves and fantastic thighs, then back up and over his arse cheeks - he pressed you particularly hard into these taut, muscular, brilliantly toned hills and moaned as he moved you across the hole and back again. He then rubbed you into his nipples, moaning ever louder as you did your part, licking and massaging every inch of skin you could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought there was only one area left, but Tim had other ideas. He bent down and placed you on the floor of the shower, leaning forward slightly to again protect you from the rushing, falling water. Regardless, it was hard to keep balanced as water fell down all around you, but that quickly became irrelevant as Tim knocked you over with his big toe and held you down with it. It knocked the breath out of you briefly but you recovered...from your new, prone position, you could see this muscular coach in all his hairy, magnificent glory. With the water and steam all around him he appeared more godlike than ever, and you could tell from his lengthening dick and wide, excited eyes he was loving every second. He held you down effortlessly, applying almost no pressure as you wiggled and squirmed which caused him to begin pumping his dick back and forth until it grew to truly monstrous proportions. \"GOD that feels good,\" he moaned, increasing the pressure on your tiny body, pinning you with just one toe. You writhed even more, your own dick rock solid, when suddenly the pressure was lifted and you were snatched up from the ground with lightning speed and held to Tim's dick with his massive hand as he brought himself to an explosive climax. You finished too, though it was still exciting for you when Tim kissed you before cleaning up and finishing.</span></div></div>",
