They all went to a private school that had student from toddler age to 12th grade. Sam was excited to be starting 6th grade this year and to see his friend Matt after he was away for the summer. They all walk inside you dad had stopped at this strange store on the way to school to get you a drink. You get inside and walk Andrew to his toddler class. Seth had already run off to join his friends. As you are walking to class you pop open your drink. As soon as you swallow it you feel strange. You drop to you knees as the world begins spinning. What was in that drink? When everything finally calms down you look up and scream. Everything was now extremely huge. You estimated yourself to be around the size of a grain of salt. You need help you stand up to see you are outside....</span></div></div>",
