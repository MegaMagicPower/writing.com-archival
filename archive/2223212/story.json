She briefly bemoaned an insecurity of hers, not that she would every admit to such a thing. A nagging jealousy sat in Raven's mind, and now before her was a thick, ancient tome that promised to rectify her perceived shortcoming. She was attractive - and she knew this - but she saw the attention that Starfire always seemed to get. Raven would never wear the kinds of clothes that Starfire wore, but she knew of another way to turn heads now. She began her chant in earnest, and the book before her began to glow an Eldritch green.
