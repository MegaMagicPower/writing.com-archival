The figure wearing the cloak, a young slender woman with deathly pale skin, hovers above the floor with her legs crossed, chanting an ancient incantation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall scantily clad redhead rummages through a large refrigerator, humming softly to herself as she schemed the next meal for the tower. She wiggles from side to side, her lissome form moving tantalizingly as she does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is Titans Tower, the headquarters to some of the youngest, and most tenacious, heroes of Earth; the Teen Titans.

Her dark leotard hugged her every curve and accentuated the pinch of her waist and the swell of her modest, yet shapely chest. The cowl of her hood hid the small red jewel in her forehead and the sharp cut of her short hair.

She briefly bemoaned an insecurity of hers, not that she would every admit to such a thing. A nagging jealousy sat in Raven's mind, and now before her was a thick, ancient tome that promised to rectify her perceived shortcoming. She was attractive - and she knew this - but she saw the attention that Starfire always seemed to get. Raven would never wear the kinds of clothes that Starfire wore, but she knew of another way to turn heads now. She began her chant in earnest, and the book before her began to glow an Eldritch green. She would find that...</span></div></div>",

She felt shivers, but the heat in her body increased as if she was in the summer sun. She broke into a sweat, her breathing began to quicken, and she started to take stock of what was going on, what her body was doing. Was something wrong with the spell, she wondered? Had she made a mistake?<br>\r\nThe stretching of her leotard drew her attention to the tightening in her chest. In the span of a few short breaths, her breasts, once modest B or C cups had nearly doubled in size, almost without her knowing! She felt the fabric of her uniform rub and move over her rapidly hardening nipples, making her breath catch in her throat. She smiled despite herself. \"It <i>does </i> work!\" But that smile was short lived, as in the time she took to make this revelation, her chest had gained three new cup sizes, approaching F cups. They were well beyond a handful now, and already pushing what she had wanted for herself. And it only seemed she was getting bigger...<br>\r\n\"Wait... No, hold on...\" She frantically reached for the book she had dropped, quickly noticing the new, pendulous weight on her chest. She silently thanked her ability to move herself with but a thought, but still worried how big her newfound bosom would become. She searched for the spell, quickly finding her previous place in the book, and frantically tried to discern some form of counterspell for her rapidly growing predicament. She heard stitching begin to pop as her breasts reached HH cups in size, now as large as her head and beginning to take up a great deal of her torso, attention, and body mass.</span></div></div>",

She could feel the sides of her new tracts of land being exposed to the cool air of her room as her leotard started losing its battle with them. She fought to suppress moans of pleasure as her nipples, growing as well and now the size of her thumb-tips, continued to be stimulated. She could feel the bottom curves of her breasts moving across the bottom of her rib cage, gently pushing over her upper abdomen. <br>\r\n\"Azerath, Metion, Zinthos!\" She practically shouted. And then she did moan. Her large and growing breasts nearly instantly doubled in size, shredding cloth and mental fortitude alike. Sitting cross-legged as she had been, her breasts would nearly reach her lap, roughly the size of basketballs, her nipples painfully erect in the cold air. Raven took a shuddering breath as she tried to mentally grasp what just happened, what she had just done, but the still growing mounds before her continued to baffle and confuse her normally quite agile mind. In seconds they had begun to brush her legs, causing her to gasp, and then groan in growing need at the sensitivity of her breasts. She most certainly had not had sufficient time to grow accustomed to the extreme pleasure her new nerve endings were sending her, and she was largely powerless as the spell continued to run its course.</span></div></div>",
