            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat back on the couch and let out a big sigh of relief. Finally, the next big step in your life was ready to begin. With the help of your younger sister Tracy, you'd just finished bringing your belongings from your old house into your new apartment in the quiet suburban community of <i>Sanderson</i>. Of course, since you were a tiny from birth, you didn't really have a lot of personal belongings. In fact, all of your clothes, toiletries, and various other belongings fit completely inside of a single duffel bag, which was currently resting on the floor beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new apartment was spacious and clean, and definitely a place you could see yourself living for the foreseeable future. It was a two-floor house, with the first floor having an entry hallway, living room, kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom, and the second floor having three bedrooms. The kitchen and living room came fully supplied with appliances and furniture. Each of the three bedrooms also had a bed and a dresser. On that note, you wondered how you missed the fact that there were only three bedrooms while reading the apartment description. Based on your split-rent deal, there would be four people total in this apartment. You supposed that someone would take the living room as their bedroom then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered when your new roommates would finally arrive, as everyone was scheduled to move in in about the same timeframe on this day. Tracy had left twenty minutes ago after saying her goodbyes, and you hoped you wouldn't be by yourself for much longer. Truthfully, you were nervous to meet the three other guys who would be sharing this place with you, but seeing as how they would be tinies like you (as you were still absolutely sure that you'd clicked the <i>Tinies Only </i>button), you believed that you'd be best friends with Morgan Sinclair, Avery Sinclair, and Quinn Wallace. As it was, all you knew about them were their names and ages, as their profiles had been quite barren on the website.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you'd been reduced to nothing more than twiddling your thumbs while waiting on the living room couch, you heard the unmistakable sound of the front door to the apartment opening. Instantly bolting up at the ready, you quickly brushed your hair a bit neater and straightened your shirt. You weren't sure why you felt this compulsion to appear as neat as possible for your fellow tinies, but first impressions were important, after all. However, you were a bit caught off guard by hearing female giggles after the door opened, and could only assume that your new roommates had also enlisted their sisters for help moving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and all thought fled out of your mind as two titanic giantesses strolled into the room. The first had long, chocolate brown hair, and was a fair bit taller than the second girl, who had the same brown hair dyed with bright streaks of pink. Both girls had deeply tanned, smooth skin, and were unbelievably attractive. Your mind went straight to their rather abundant curves (and you chastised yourself for staring at them even as you kept doing it), and their bodies were shown off brilliantly. The taller girl was wearing tight compression shorts and a trim tank top, and the shorter girl was wearing a quite revealing tank top and barely-there booty shorts. They were like twin angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, this is a comfy living room!\" The shorter girl gushed, her voice bouncy and energetic. She spun around in a circle as she entered the room. \"Don'tcha think so, Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller girl rolled her eyes, but was still smiling. \"Yeah, Avery, it's nice. Lots of space for my workout gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept talking while looking around the living room, but you could only stare at them slack-jawed, your mind racing at a mile a minute. A tiny, unsettling thought had been creeping up into your mind as soon as you heard female voices in the entryway, but hearing the girls confirm their names for you sealed the deal: somehow, you had both managed to join an apartment deal with people who weren't tinies, and people who were giantesses on top of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shaken out of your dumbfounded stupor by the sight of Avery approaching the couch backwards, still engaged in conversation with her sister. The sight of the curvy girl towering above you stunned you into motionless inactivity, at least until she started lying down on the couch, never once making eye contact with you. You let out a startled scream and tried to run, only to trip as Avery's butt plopped down onto the half of the couch furthest from you, shaking the couch cushions and toppling you over. To make matters worse, your scream was drowned out by the titanic girl's infectious giggle, and fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Morgan sighed, and Avery laughed harmoniously again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gettin' comfy! Like, unloading our stuff can wait!\" Avery grinned childishly, utterly oblivious to what she was doing to the living room's third, tiny occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Avery completely laid out on the couch, and with a muffled <i>squelch</i>, her left breast crashed onto you. She was lying on her side, so her sizable boobs had piled right onto your body, squashing your miniscule, one-inch body all the way up to your neck under her copious mounds of flesh. Your weak body flattened into nothing under her tank top covered boobs, and you thrashed your head around in a futile attempt to get free. All you could do was speak, which you hoped was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Please! Please, get off! I'm down here!\" You shouted as loud as you could. Unfortunately, they way Avery's boobs were pinning you down, you had to angle your voice more into the cushion of the couch than up towards the two girls who could actually do something about the humiliating position you'd found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, fate cut you a break, and it was enough. Morgan frowned, and began looking around the room. \"Uh, Avery...do you hear that?\" She began pacing around the room, trying to pick up the location of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery shook her head. \"Nope. Is it someone outside? Are Quinn and that other girl...Hunter...here yet? I hope that they're both super cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smirked for a second. \"You hope everyone is cute. But no, it sounds like...\" Her voice trailed off as she spotted your almost unnoticeable head, sticking out from under her twin sister's tits and buried into the couch cushion. Kneeling in front of Avery, Morgan peered closely at you and gasped. \"Oh! Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery bit her lip adorably. \"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan flicked her eyes up from you to her sister. \"You...uh...sat on a tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, and everything was cleared up. Or, at least, as well as it could be. You had introduced yourself to the twins after being freed from under Avery's boobs, and they had introduced themselves to you in turn. The three of you couldn't believe how crazy the mix-up in the apartment scheduling was, but Morgan and Avery seemed totally fine with rooming with a tiny. Avery in particular seemed quite intrigued by the prospect. From your initial meeting with them, Morgan seemed like the down-to-earth and sensible twin, while Avery was much more flirty and fun-loving. This whole scenario still put you on edge a tiny bit, as (aside from your mother and sister) you'd had very little direct interaction with giantesses your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introductions, Morgan had gone to use the bathroom, leaving you alone with Avery. However, that only lasted a second before the front door opened again. Avery jumped to her feet to greet the newest visitor, and you, back on the couch, turned to watch as a third girl strolled into the room. Presumably, she was Quinn Wallace, and her appearance here practically cemented how dumb you had been to not double-check the apartment website before signing the contract. You'd seen your roommates' names, and as they were fairly gender neutral, you hadn't thought twice about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pre-planned introduction to Quinn fell to pieces as she walked into the room. Her hair was pitch-black and cut in a bob with bangs, and compared to the twin's, her skin tone was much paler and milky smooth. This was hardly the only difference, as you shamefully noted just how large Quinn's proportions were. Morgan and Avery had been a vision, true, but Quinn was on another level of thickness. Her boobs, butt, and thighs were some of the largest you'd ever seen, and they jiggled a bit as she walked. She was heavier than the twins, but in all the right places as far as you were concerned. She was wearing a comfy black sweater and very tight black leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, right as you regained the ability to form sentences, Quinn walked over towards you while looking at Avery. Avery smiled cheerfully at Quinn, then flicked her eyes down to you. A mischievous glint twinkled in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! You must be Quinn!\" Avery beamed. \"My name is Avery, and can I say that you are totes adorable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn huffed out a bit of air. \"Thanks. Name's Quinn Wallace.\" She folded her arms and began to sit down, directly where you were on the couch. You hardly had time to react, and could only look up in surprise. Out of the corner of your eye, you saw Avery smiling with a playful expression that made your heart sink. She was totally letting this happen. That girl was going to be a handful, wasn't she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, not as much of a handful (in the literal sense) as Quinn, as the black-haired giantess plopped down onto the couch, utterly obliterating you beneath her massive derriere with ease. Her incomprehensibly large rear just about swallowed you whole, and your squishy body flattened out into a pathetic little pancake under her shapely, jiggly left cheek. To make matters worse, Quinn wiggled a bit to get comfortable, dragging her butt across your body and smearing you flatter into her leggings-clad ass. Your face was rubbed fully into the fabric of her leggings, the pain of squashing contrasting with the almost pleasant smell of her perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Avery couldn't hold in her mischievous, prankster attitude any longer, and she burst out laughing. Giggling rightly, Avery smiled at Quinn, who merely looked at her with a raised eyebrow. \"You...you sat on a tiny!\" Avery said, between fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn frowned and looked down at the couch, where her big butt took up half of the total sofa. Shrugging, she looked back at Avery. \"Huh. He should've moved, I guess.\" Quinn replied, while taking her phone out of her purse and checking a text she'd just gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery's smile dimmed at that response. \"O-oh, it's actually our fourth roommate, Hunter. We thought he'd be a cute girl, but there was some mix-up, and he's actually an adorable little tiny. Couldn't even tell before meeting him, cuz of his name! Isn't that amazing?\" Avery had to pause a nanosecond to catch her breath. \"Morgan and I have never lived with a tiny before! It's so exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged again. \"Sounds like it.\" She finished typing her text, and then stretched her arms. She continued to make no attempt to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was getting nervous now, and felt the faintest twinge of guilt for putting you into this situation. With each passing second, Quinn's indomitable ass crushed you further flat, and the heat was beginning to build up quite a bit. \"Uh...could you get off of him? I'm sure he didn't mean to be sat on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn rolled her eyes and put down her phone. \"He isn't bothering me where he is. I'll be getting up in a few minutes.\" Quinn stated. \"Anyway, you said your name was Avery? Does that mean Morgan is your sister? Is she here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Avery's face lit back up into full excitement mode, and she launched into a rambling and bouncy conversation about herself and her sister. She told Quinn how she was hoping to become a world famous super model, and that Morgan was a super-fit exercise junkie working at the local gym, <i>Workout World</i>. Quinn responded in turn, saying how she wanted to be more approachable, so she'd applied for a more active job, and landed a position as a lifeguard at Sanderson Beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you heard none of this, as all sounds of the outside world were muffled while under Quinn's hefty buttocks. All of the curvy girl's weight as squeezing you into paste beneath her butt, and you soon began sweating profusely. Your sweat only served to further bond you to her leggings-clad left cheek. Try as you might to struggle or reform, it was quite pointless. You only hoped Avery would save you soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that hope was entirely useless, as you'd slipped Avery's mind the second Quinn had asked her about Morgan. Avery was a mile-a-minute type of girl, but this came with the drawback of her exceptionally forgetful and oblivious mindset. Her airheadedness was unrivalled amongst almost anyone in the world. This ditzy nature could be a detriment to herself and others, but no one could stay mad at Avery for long with her boundless enthusiasm and overflowing optimism towards life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what this meant for you was that you went unnoticed beneath Quinn for the next five minutes as they talked. Then Morgan returned and got caught up in the conversation, and you were stuck for another thirty minutes. Then the girls helped each other unpack their belongings, and move into and set up their new rooms on the second floor. You stayed stuck to Quinn's booty for this entire three hour experience as well, and were pretty much just a sticker on her jiggly cheek by the time everything was said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over to retrieve her water bottle from the floor, Quinn's shapely rear was accentuated for all to see, and Avery's wandering eyes were drawn to the heavenly sight. Taking in all of Quinn's beauty, Avery smiled, but paused when her eyes locked onto you. Confused for a split second, the pink-haired girl finally connected the dots, screamed out almost comically, and pointed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! Hunter, you poor thing!\" She cried, gesturing to you. Morgan followed her sister's finger to you, and gasped, while Quinn merely looked over her shoulder to where they were pointing. She couldn't even see you from that angle, her ass was so massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How did he get there? How long has he been there?\" Morgan exclaimed, looking between her twin and Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally forgot that Quinn sat on him!\" Avery explained. \"When she first came into the living room!\" The carefree girl tactically avoided informing her twin about her involvement in getting you squished to Quinn's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could berate her sister, Quinn sauntered over to the nearest mirror to help her see you better, then began picking you off of her leggings. \"Yeah, I figured he'd still be stuck. I was sitting on him for a while before getting up, then with all the moving around...\" The black-haired girl shrugged. \"It was probably a bit too much for him to reform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Avery blinked at Quinn, then each other. Morgan then gaped at Quinn. \"Wait...you knew he was there the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded. \"Assumed he was, at least. But, it's not like I could feel him, so he wasn't bothering me enough to get me to peel him off while we were working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan threw up her hands. \"But why would you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn held up a hand defensively. \"Don't misunderstand. I'm not being rude or disrespectful to tinies.\" As she spoke, her fingernail finally slid between your pancaked body and her curvy butt cheek. Peeling you free, Quinn kept talking. \"I've lived my whole life with friends who were tinies, I know about their struggles. Even still, tinies need to learn how to be strong on their own. I left Hunter under me because I wanted him to fight for himself. People won't always be around to save him.\" The girl dropped you into Morgan's warm hands. \"Still, I didn't make it easy on him, I suppose. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she apologized, she looked you right in your squished, slightly smeared eye, and you could tell it was a genuine apology. You didn't know what to make of her and her seemingly apathetic attitude towards life just yet, but there was clearly more to her than you saw at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thirty minutes passed, in which Morgan whisked you off to the bathroom and helped you wash off and tidy yourself up. She'd then carried you to the kitchen and fixed you a small little meal. You couldn't help but feel that, to a small degree, she was babying you a little, but you assumed that this was just her personality. From what you'd gathered, she was a caring, helpful girl who would willingly go out of her way to lend anyone a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that diversion, Morgan had carried you into the living room, where Avery and Quinn were waiting. She sat on the couch beside Avery, and set you down on the coffee table in the middle of the room. Quinn was in a recliner beside the couch. Quinn gave you a small nod of recognition, and Avery winked at you while sticking her tongue out playfully. You rolled your eyes at her, prompting a satisfied giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that it dawned on you, the full weight of what your future held. Here you were, away from home and moved into a brand new building, in a brand new community. You, a one inch tall tiny, and your three new gigantic giantess roommates. Whatever the future held, it was surely going to be wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this is it, then.\" You said, a bit awkwardly. All three of the girls nodded. They'd each moved into the three bedrooms upstairs, unpacking all of their belongings. Actually, if they were upstairs, then...your eyes drifted over to the side of the couch, where your duffel bag packed full of belongings was still sitting. You hadn't unpacked your stuff yet! Now where were you going to sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your eye, Morgan followed your gaze. \"Ah, that's your stuff, isn't it, Hunter?\" She asked. Smiling a bit sheepishly, she continued. \"We kinda took all the rooms upstairs, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved her off, trying to act as confident as possible. It wasn't hard, with your extroverted personality, but the twists and mishaps this day had brought were still trying to settle in your mind. \"Nah, it's no big deal. I can sleep wherever there's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded, in an approving manner. \"That's good. Still, sorry for not asking you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, who was rocking back and forth in her seat, burst out. \"Come on guys! It's barely even four o'clock in the afternoon. Aren't we gonna do something fun today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rubbed her sister's shoulder. \"Let's take it easy for today. Hunter's had quite the time of it, right? If he wants to do anything, let him decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery looked sulky for a second, before cheering up again. \"...Kay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the coffee table, you observed the three jaw-droppingly gorgeous girls who were now your roommates. Well, this was it. Your new life. Better make the most of it!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could think of something to say, Avery piped up with an adorable little exclamation noise. \"Oh! Wait! Where's little cutie Hunter going to sleep? We took all the bedrooms, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed. \"Yes, Avery. That's what we were just discussing.\" She playfully rapped her sister on the forehead with her knuckle. \"Pay attention sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...hee hee!\" Avery giggled, then looked down at you. As she leaned forward, her boobs threatened to spill from her already incredibly revealing top, and they jiggled slightly as they hovered above you. You had to fight to keep looking the pink-haired giantess in the eye instead of at her abyss of cleavage. \"Anyway, we gotta pick out a room for you, don'tcha think, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned up at her. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl <i>tsk tsked</i> you, wagging her finger. \"Well, ya can't sleep in the living room down here all by yourself. That'd be lonely! Plus...\" Avery smirked and winked at you. \"You got all squished twice today already on this couch. Don'tcha think it would happen a lot if you slept in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the ditzy girl's line of thinking was spot on, but her reminder of how you'd been introduced to both her and Quinn still made you blush a bit, earning a grin from Avery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at her sister's reasoning, Morgan laid down her palm in front of you, and motioned with her eyes for you to hop on. You were grateful that she was willing to carry you around like this, so you hopped on. She delicately stood up, careful not to shake her palm too much. She brought you all the way up to her eye level, and smiled at you. Her radiant face, and the way her chocolate brown hair framed her features was a sight to behold. Your breath caught in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Hunter, I know it might be a little weird, but Avery makes a good point. I think you would be safest and more comfortable sharing one of our room's upstairs.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, it did make perfect sense, even though you were embarrassed beyond belief that you'd now be sharing the same room as one of these three total knockout girls you'd only just met. Still, you flashed Morgan a thumbs up. \"Sure thing! Sounds like a plan to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled at your show of acceptance, and moved to leave the living room with you. Avery hopped out of the couch, and Quinn stood as well, the black-haired girl picking up and shouldering your duffel bag of belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Quinn.\" You said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"You couldn't have gotten it yourself.\" She reasoned. Taking the lead, Quinn walked up the stairs, Morgan following after and Avery behind. As the four of you ascended to the top of the stairs, your gaze was entranced by Quinn's perfectly sculpted, humongous rear end swaying side-to-side as she meandered up the stairs. It was an incredible sight, and one you had to literally slap yourself out of gawking at. After slapping yourself, you heard a small chuckle above you, and you turned to see Morgan smirking playfully. Your staring at Quinn had apparently not gone unnoticed by your carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the second floor, Morgan slipped by Quinn and approached the first open door. \"So, this is my room. If we're doing this like some sort of equal debate thing, I guess it's choice number one.\" She said, and you realized that she was right. It would only be fair for you to look at each girl's room first, then decide who you wanted to room with. Really though, that just made all of this even more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan showed off her room, and it was basically what you expected from someone like her. Her bed was tucked in and straightened, her clothes were neatly stored away in dressers and in the closet, and one corner of her room was taken up by a organized collection of exercise weights and training props. One other corner of the room was barren. The entire room was decorated in shades of tan and brown, a very earthy and natural feel. There was also a TV with what looked like a gaming console hooked up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled. \"If you wanted to room with me, you could have that whole empty corner to yourself. That way, we wouldn't be taking up each other's space. I also have a spare pillow I can give you to use for a bed, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was next to show off her room, and once again it was right in the same ballpark as how you would've guessed. It was the same sort of neatness as Morgan, but filled to the brim with personal belongings. There were twice as many dressers and drawers for clothes, a sprawling make-up table, and even a full-size mannequin currently wearing a sparkly white dress. There was hardly any free space, and the whole room was colored in a wide assortment of rainbow hues, though mostly bright pinks, blues, and reds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery spun in a circle excitedly. \"If you wanted to room with me, I have a few empty drawers for all your stuff.\" Avery gestured to one of her dresser cabinets, where two empty drawers were (worryingly, right beside what appeared to be drawers stuffed with lingerie and swimsuits). \"I also figured we could just share the bed, as there's totes enough room for me and a cutie like you!\" Avery giggled, prompting a startled blush from you, a surprised look from Morgan, and a shrug from Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's room was last, and it was the one that caught you off guard the most. You anticipated that everything would be mostly colored in black, gray, and purple, but what you didn't expect was for it to be so messy. She had the same style bed, dressers, and closet as the twins, but the floor of her room was covered with clothes strewn all about. You'd be hard pressed to believe she had only just moved in hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn put her hands on her hips as she talked. \"Yeah, it's a mess, I know. I have a hard time...feeling like I need to tidy up. Still, it's comfy, I guess. If you wanted to room with me, I'm sure you could find space somewhere, like on the floor, or in a drawer, or something. Anything that doesn't bother me is okay. You can do whatever.\" She shrugged again, and you couldn't help but smile. Something about her nonchalant attitude could be so endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour finished, Morgan took you back out into the hall, and the three girls looked at you expectantly, obviously anticipating your answer. You knew this was a pretty big decision, so you thought about it for a second, cleared your throat, then spoke up.</span></div></div>",

She started to walk upstairs, occasionally glancing down at you once or twice to make sure you were still there and hadn't fallen off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would you like to sleep, Hunter? I'm sure we can set up some sort of bed for you on my nightstand that you'll be able to climb up and into?

You couldn't help but stare at the giant pair of breasts in front of you as she said the word squish, thinking maybe you'd enjoy it a bit more than you should let on to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that doesn't sound too appealing. The nightstand bed sounds like a great idea,\" you call up to her, and she smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the top of the stairs and look around into the room, noticing how clean and orderly everything is. All the luggage was off to one corner of the room with no clothes or accessories strewn about anywhere on the floor. The bed was nicely made and you noticed that even the nightstand was spotless, with an alarm clock and lamp to keep you company through the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan set you down on the bed, then sat down gently next to you, making sure that the impact didn't jostle or throw you up into the air. You appreciated the carefulness she showed towards you, and started to feel like you made the right choice choosing Morgan to room with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just gotta change into my pajamas, and then I'll be set for bed. Maybe we can order in dinner or something too to celebrate our first night as roomies,\" said Morgan, breaking you out of the little stupor you were in. \"No peeking while I change though, or else you'll be in trouble,\" she added, with a raised eyebrow and the slightest hint of a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course milady,\" you respond, bowing in an exaggerated manner and grinning up to her, before turning towards the middle of the bed and covering your eyes. \"Don't take too long, or else I might not be able to hold back any longer,\" you joke, feeling the bed around you elevate slightly as Morgan gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be looking, so don't you dare turn around,\" Morgan retorts, and you start to mentally undress your unbelievably attractive roommate. You feel the blood rush down slightly into your nether regions, and you start to wonder if Morgan would really notice if you turned around slightly just to see what she was up to.</span></div></div>",

This is gonna be so fun!\" Avery squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, good luck with that.\" Quinn said, before turning and heading back towards her bedroom. As she did so, you couldn't help but be distracted by the massive butt that had squished you earlier in the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's voice snapped you back to the two sisters. \"Are you sure sharing a bed is a good idea guys? Avery could easily steamroll you in her sleep. She tends to roll around a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupidly, you hadn't even considered this. Your mind flashed with images of you laying down in bed, only to be awoken by an avalanche of boob as Avery rolled over onto you. \"Avery, maybe your sister has-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could continue your objection, Avery snatched you up into her own hand. \"You're always worrying Morgan! It's going to be fine, trust me. And even if I do squish him a little bit, he did fine under Quinn's butt today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna get squished a lot living with us. Might as well get used to it.\" Quinn's voice called out from her bedroom. The three of you were all surprised she had joined the conversation at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I'm not gonna squish him, it'll be fine, you'll see.\" Avery retorted. \"In fact, it's getting late, I think me and the little guy are going to turn in early tonight. Quinn's butt probably tired him out anyway.\" Avery didn't wait for a reply from the other girls. Satisfied with the arrangements, she just walked into her bedroom, your tiny body gripped in her fist as it swung disorientingly at her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to her room, she dropped you down onto the right side of the queen sized bed. From your perspective, it was massive. Morgan must have been worrying too much, you were sure the two of you could share all of this space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get changed little guy. No peeking! Even though we both know you want to.\" Avery teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you turned towards the head of the bed, covering your eyes with your hands for extra measure. Though you couldn't see what was going on behind you, your imagination was happy to mentally undress the giant girl despite yourself. Maybe this whole rooming mixup would turn out for the best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can open your eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turned around, your saw that Avery's penchant for revealing clothing carried over into pajamas. She was wearing a matching pink pajama set that looked like it was a few sizes too small for her. The bottom edge of her butt cheeks peeked out of the tight shorts she was wearing, while her top hugged her breasts tightly and only covered up to her belly button. You could tell she was no longer wearing a bra, as the outline of her nipples was visible through the fabric. She had also put on fluffy pink ankle socks, presumably to keep her feet warm while sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute right?\" Avery asked, striking a little pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah... Very... 'cute'.\" You replied, realizing you hadn't blinked for 30 seconds at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned and flopped down into bed. The impact of her butt on the mattress launched you a few inches into the air, but her soft mattress also was there to break your fall moments later. When you stop up again, Avery was laying in bed on her side, smiling cutely at you. Even when she was a little careless, it was impossible to stay mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get you to your new sleeping spot.\" Avery said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused. You were already on the bed, weren't you? \"I thought you were just going to have me sleep on the mattress next to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my first plan, but I was thinking it'd be better if you slept on my body. That way I don't have to wonder where you are when I wake up in the morning.\" Avery explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. Her body? It's true that Avery was incredibly hot, but this still seemed like a big jump for first day roommates. And where on her body would she put you anyway? Your face reddened as you imagined laying on her chest, using one of her enormous breasts as a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo I can tell by the color of your face that you like this plan.\" Avery said, her grin widening even further. \"Now, let's get you situated. I have a nice.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. soft mattress picked out for you.\" (Avery lays on her chest and tucks you into her pajama bottoms, making her ass cheek your \"mattress\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. comfy room picked out for you.\" (Avery tucks you deep between her tremendous breasts, leaving you unable to move an inch)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. warm sleeping bag picked out for you.\" (Avery decides to tuck you into her socks, figuring sleeping up next to her feet will keep you warm and cozy all night)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI have a nice comfy room picked out for you!\u201d Avery giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s soft, padded all around, and more warm and cozy than you could ever dream!\u201d The pink-haired giantess grinned from ear-to-ear, and then leaned forward, causing her prodigious chest to swing like a pendulum directly above you. The abyss of her cleavage was seemingly infinite, and you found it impossible to tear your gaze from her titanic tits as they jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaping like an idiot, you stammered out a reply. \u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s eyes gleamed with delight. \u201cAny guesses where your room is, cutie?\u201d The flirtatious giantess pressed her arms up against her breasts, squeezing her gargantuan globes tighter together, accentuating their incredible size and threatening to spill her boobs from her tight top. You were once more enraptured by the sensual display, with the logical part of your brain screaming at you to focus and divert Avery from this line of thinking. Sadly, your hormones won out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Avery\u2026uh\u2026\u201d You balked, utterly failing to be a proper gentleman. To be fair, Avery was pretty much cheating, having cornered you on her bed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling again, Avery scooped you up without warning, pinching your chest lightly between two fingers and hoisting you up into the air. You let out a small yelp of surprise, which only caused Avery to grin wider. The faintest of blushes was growing in her cheeks, and you quickly realized why. Even in your dazed stupor, you weren\u2019t so dumb as to not figure out Avery\u2019s plan, as your new giantess roommate dangled you above her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widened, you sobered up instantly. \u201cW-wait, Avery! I don\u2019t think\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, cutie! No need to worry! This is perfect.\u201d Avery cut you off with confident assurance. \u201cLike, you\u2019ll sleep like an adorable baby, Hunter!\u201d Leaning forward again, Avery puckered her lips and planted a kiss on you, her plush lips easily overwhelming your entire body. Your protests were eaten up by her lips encompassing your whole being, swallowing you in sticky saliva and euphoric bliss in equal measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling you back from her quick smooch, Avery smirked playfully at your dumbfounded expression, winked in a sultry manner, and dropped you. To stunned to even cry out, your inch-tall body fell through the air, before finally landing directly in Avery\u2019s cleavage; a clean drop. You sank in between her mammoth mammaries up to your neck, her pillowy flesh wobbling all around you. Though she wore no bra, her tight top more than compressed her tits enough to hold you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, nighty-night, Hunter! Hope you have a totes awesome night!\u201d Avery exclaimed, before delicately slamming her index finger into your head. Shocked back into awareness, you uttered one more panicked plea for your flirty roommate to stop, but to no avail. Powerless, you could do nothing as Avery shoved you entirely into her cleavage, all the way until your body disappeared from view, your vision became darkness, and everything around you was hot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still desperate to avoid this situation, so as soon as Avery withdrew her finger, you began thrashing and kicking, trying to crawl out. As unbelievably sexy as Avery was, you really didn\u2019t want to spend your first night with her jammed into her cleavage. It was, frankly, kind of demeaning for her to treat you this way. Also, from your little interactions with her, you knew she was a colossal ditzy airhead. Spending the night crushed between her boobs seemed like a recipe for disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your panicked squirming only registered as a faint tickling sensation, which Avery interpreted as you enjoying yourself. Blushing more and smiling in a satisfied manner, the pink-haired giantess flicked off the lights and then flopped backwards onto her bed, her head plopping down onto her pillow. Pulling the covers up over herself, Avery closed her eyes and quickly slipped off into peaceful dreams of toying with cute tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Avery laid down, her breasts sprawled out, no longer so tightly constrained by gravity. Hot flesh poured onto you from all directions, and you attempts to wiggle free backfired horribly. Legs and arms sprawled out while trying to move, your limbs were now crushed and flattened in painfully twisted directions, your whole body forcibly contorted into a pretzel-like figure. Your mouth, held open to call out to Avery, was met by a wall of breast flesh forcing its way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, you\u2019d been reduced to not much more than a sticker, mangled and flattened between Avery\u2019s gigantic globes of flesh. The tight confines, and the extra addition of the covers Avery pulled up increased the temperature by a hundred, and both you and Avery\u2019s boobs were slicked with sweat mere minutes after Avery turned off the lights. The warmth was unbearable, simultaneously gross and exhausting, while also luring you to give up an embrace sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to back down despite your size, you soon formulated a plan. Bracing yourself in position, you twitched and squirmed what little bit you could still manage, and pushed back against the unrelenting walls of boobs all around you. Though it strained your muscles, you managed to clear a miniscule pocket around yourself, in which you were free to resume reforming back to normal shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimbs reinflating slowly but surely, you fought the urge to yawn and succumb to sleep. Sweaty as they were, Avery hadn\u2019t been lying about how heavenly soft her skin was. Her boobs were essentially the world\u2019s largest and comfiest pillows. There was also something mesmerizing about your giantess roommate\u2019s methodical, rhythmical heartbeat as it pounded softly, the only noise you could even hear while entombed in breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you were unflattened, and with an agonizingly slow pace, you began crawling across Avery\u2019s skin. Pitch black in the cavernous confines of her cleavage, you didn\u2019t exactly know where you were going, or even which way was up. Still, you were determined to escape from her tits and back out onto her bed. If you were fast enough, you might even still end up able to catch a bit of actually peaceful sleep before morning came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery small bit you wiggled forward was taken with painstaking care. Avery\u2019s boobs were rising and falling with her every breath, generating a nauseating wave-like motion. You also sunk into her doughy flesh even with your miniscule amount of weight, your body displacing boob flesh all around you. It was claustrophobic as hell with her boobs serving as the ground, walls, and pressing ceiling above you, but you kept fighting. Whether you came out the top of her shirt or the bottom, you\u2019d take your victory and run with it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, as fate was wont to do, a cruel twist spelled out disaster. You were still thoroughly trapped and hidden away, a surprisingly hefty amount of breast flesh pinning you down from above, when Avery apparently got tired of lying on her back. Still happily dreaming, Avery let out a cute groan of discomfort and flipped over onto her stomach, quickly and efficiently. It happened in the blink of an eye, catching you totally off guard and ruining everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy flipping over, all the weight of Avery\u2019s breasts now squeezed down onto you, once more crushing you flat and reducing you to nothing more than a sticker on her sweat-slicked flesh. The weight was immense, and you found yourself completely unable to move a single muscle, or even twitch. The swell of Avery\u2019s chest was far too pronounced for someone at your size to conquer, and your plans to escape had only led to your own defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust barely, you could hear Avery lightly giggle in her sleep, and some part of you knew that she wasn\u2019t planning on moving again anytime soon. Crushed under the full, overwhelming weight of her breasts, even your most desperate attempts to move or reform were all for naught. Squished away like a mashed, mangled boob sticker, you gave up your hope and plans, and allowed yourself to succumb to the warm embrace and soft caress of Avery\u2019s tits, passing out and sleeping fitfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome morning, it was immediately clear that only one of you had slept restfully. Though you briefly forgot where you were, Avery\u2019s steady heartbeat, coat of sweat, and softness of her flesh reminded you quickly. Testing out your ability to wiggle, you found yourself seemingly engrained to your giantess roommates\u2019 tits even more than before. Apparently, Avery had stayed on her stomach all night since turning, and the hours of pressure had quite thoroughly baked you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was incredibly distressing, as you were now one step closer to being nothing more than a tattoo on Avery\u2019s skin. Sadly, the culprit was entirely oblivious, and you could feel yourself shaking and jostling around as Avery yawned adorably and rolled herself out of bed. As she sat up, a figurative mountain of flesh fell upon you, squashing you tightly and piling all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm\u2026oh. Oh! I have the day off! OMG, sweet!\u201d Avery\u2019s bubbly voice came out muffled from under tons of her breast flesh, but you could still make it out. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll shower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the pink-haired giantesses massive breasts bounced as your captor stood up, and it was immediately clear to you that the scatterbrained girl had totally forgotten all about you. Moving and speaking was impossible crushed this flat, so you mentally begged Avery to remember you and notice you. Your only reply was for Avery to yawn again, stretching her arms upwards as she padded out of her bedroom and towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stretched, her arms pushed against the sides of her prodigious chest, pushing her boobs up just a bit. As they rose, the pressure on you lessened greatly, and you felt yourself rising too. When her stretch finished and gravity took hold again, her boobs claimed you once more, burying you totally and crushing you up into a mangled form on her skin. Or, to be more specific, ONE boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you realized where you were, and it scared you tremendously. During your blind and failed crawl to freedom hours earlier, you\u2019d apparently ended up closer to the bottom of Avery\u2019s tits. When she\u2019d flipped onto her stomach, you\u2019d ended up wedged underneath her left breast, and stayed crushed there all night, your malleable body engraining itself more and more to her smooth, supple skin from all the pressure and hours. Essentially, you were squished up deep in Avery\u2019s left underboob, the folds of her boobs tucking you away and mashing all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the bathroom, Avery giggled at her disheveled bedhead and stripped out of her clothes, while turning on the water in the tub and letting it heat up to incredible temperatures. As soon as she slipped her top off, her humongous, perky breasts hung loose and free. Incredibly, this smooshed you even further into her flesh, as her left tit fell around you, pressing into you and hiding you from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Avery took a passing glance at herself in the mirror, smiled, and then turned around. You weren\u2019t visible in the slightest, mashed as you were into the underside of Avery\u2019s left breast. In fact, even if someone looked at you from below, they wouldn\u2019t see you, as you were crushed up where her boob squished into her chest proper, folded tight. Someone would only notice you if they actually grabbed hold of Avery\u2019s left breast and hefted it up and away from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware to the horribly cruel position that her tiny little roommate was in, Avery switched the water from faucet to showerhead and then hopped into the tub, grinning at the searing temperatures that she loved so much. The water cascading down her body, Avery childishly spun in a circle, relishing in the feeling of her routine morning shower rinsing her completely and fully waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where you were, only the slightest amount of water actually trickled down Avery\u2019s curvy body and touched you. It singed so hotly that you mentally cried out in pain, only for your pain to be met by Avery singing a happy song, her vocals surprisingly good from someone as airheaded as her. One part of your brain thought of how she really was the total package, save for smarts. The other part of you snidely remarked that it was exactly Avery\u2019s lack of smarts that had put you into this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for a washcloth, Avery dabbled body wash onto the cloth and then began thoroughly scrubbing her body. As she bent to scrub her legs, her boobs squished back into her chest, the weight crushing you doubling as you were squeezed from all sides. It seemed like a welcome reprieve when Avery stood back up, but you soon felt the sensation of her wash cloth approaching, and it dawned on you that this was actually very, very awful instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one redeeming grace to this whole travesty was that you\u2019d been crushed into Avery\u2019s tit back first, so your face was looking out. You\u2019d hoped this would make you just a bit more easy to notice, despite how thoroughly crushed from sight that you were. However, as Avery scrubbed painfully away at you with the washcloth, you realized fate would never, ever cut you break, and would instead find ways to make everything so much more hellish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no reason (in her mind) to be extra-delicate or careful, Avery casually rubbed the cloth all around her boobs, including her underboobs. This meant she dragged the cloth harshly against your body, over and over and over, like you were tiny, flat cheese, and the cloth was a cheese grater. Each pass over your body mangled and smeared your squishy facial features, blurring your vision and muddying your recognizable appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved eventually, but the damage was done. Not only did you feel even more engrained into her flesh, but you were significantly harder to spot. All the remained was the slight skin tone difference between you and her breasts, and your faintly visible but contorted facial features. Otherwise, in the span of a single rough night, Avery had just about turned you into the perfect little man tattoo on the underside of her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to her underboob tagalong, Avery spent the rest of her shower scrubbing and treating her hair carefully with the most designer of products. Finished after nearly thirty minutes under the water, Avery emerged like a naked, soaking goddess, and she reached for a nearby towel. With the same carelessness as with the washcloth, she dried off, subjecting you to just a bit more grinding from the rough towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueaky clean and dry, Avery sauntered back to her bedroom, sparing a quick wave and smile to Quinn, who was on her way off to her job as a lifeguard at the beach. Her twin, Morgan, had already left for work too. Avery reentered her room a minute later, and began digging around for a cute, stylish outfit to wear for her relaxing day off. Her mind spun with ideas for what she could do, ranging from a lazy stay-at-home day, to shopping sprees, or even a full-body massage at the local massage parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed clothes, her gaze drifted to the bed, and lingered there. A faint tickling sensation buzzed in the back of the pink-haired giantess\u2019 admittedly fairly empty brain, and she frowned. She felt convinced there was something important she was forgetting, but she couldn\u2019t place her finger on what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped as you were, glued to Avery\u2019s left underboob, you could only pray her mind put the pieces together.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, let's get you situated. I have a nice warm sleeping bag picked out for you.\"<br>\r\nAs those words left Avery\u2019s smiling mouth she sat up and began sliding her foot out of her fluffy pink sock. <br>\r\nYou began to panic at the thought of spending the night squished up next to Avery\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n\u201cA-Avery, I-I\u2019m not sure this is such a great idea,\u201d you tried to reason with her, already regretting not deciding to room with Morgan. Avery\u2019s innocent smile never left her face, clearly not understanding why you were anxious about rooming up with her massive foot.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, cutie. This\u2019ll be totes the comfiest bed you\u2019ve ever had. Plus you\u2019ll have five cute little friends in there to cuddle with all night,\u201d to emphasise her point, she wiggled all 5 of her toes teasingly at you. At your size her toes may have been seen by some people as cute, but they were definitely not little, the smallest one was almost the same size as you.  \u201cThey\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re nice and warm. And hey, if you\u2019re worried about it being a bit smelly I only showered like 2 hours ago, I use a fruity lotion that I know you\u2019ll love the smell of. You\u2019ll be glad your rooming with my cute toes, I can tell you from personal experience that Morgan\u2019s feet reek after she\u2019s done with a work out, which is basically always. You\u2019ll be glad you picked me. Anyway I\u2019ll get you all tucked in.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Avery plucked you up off the bed with a wink, you couldn\u2019t help but be shocked at how airheaded she was. If you had chose to room with Morgan then you wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near her feet! Did Avery think this was what people did normally with tiny guys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery hoisted you over to her foot, her toes were wiggling in anticipation. You turned your head to plead with Avery, but as you looked up to her happy, carefree face staring down at you with a childlike glee you realised there probably wasn\u2019t anything you could say to stop this.<br>\r\nYou were lowered down to her now bare foot, between her big and second toes. She gently grasps you between the two massive appendages, surprising you at how gentle she could be, not crushing you at all. Before you could get another word in your world went dark as you were covered by the pink fluffy sock she was pulling back over her foot, trapping you inside with it. The air immediately became much hotter and it trapped the overpowering scent of Avery\u2019s berry scented lotion in with you. Avery\u2019s preference of tight clothing seemed to extend slightly to her socks as well, as the presence of the sock seemed to press her toes in on you slightly, holding you firmly in place between her big and second toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy that her sock was on and her cute little roommate was secure, Avery happily flopped back into her bed with a content sigh.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight cutie. Hope you get on well with your bunkmates,\u201d she snickers playfully as her toes gently squeeze you, slightly compressing your tiny form without her realising. \u201cI\u2019ve got the day off tomorrow, so when Morgan and Quinn go to work we\u2019ll have the whole house to ourselves, we can get up to so much fun, I can\u2019t wait!\u201d<br>\r\nShe stopped talking to you after that and you assumed she was going to sleep. Trying your best to go to sleep yourself in the stuffy, hot environment of Avery\u2019s sock, you almost managed to. Until Avery started to move in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Avery rolled around, she kicked out her legs and scrunched her toes, all gentleness her feet once showed you was gone now that she was sleeping. Her toes mercilessly crushed your minuscule form further into the recess between her toes, compacting you further and further. Even now after what you only assumed was around a half hour her feet were starting to sweat, the salty smell and taste quickly beginning to overpower her lotion. You tried to scream out to get Avery\u2019s attention, but your crushed form only managed a small buzz against the sensitive skin between her toes. You heard Avery mumble something indistinguishable, before there was a shifting sound as she moved her other foot around to scratch the spot you had irritated. Her gargantuan big toe on her other foot plunged between her big and second toe, pushing you further into the crevices and silencing your cries for help. <br>\r\nThe itch now gone, Avery let out another content sigh and rolled over once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mangled body was now nothing but an unrecognisable tan smear between Avery\u2019s toes. The constant motion and scrunching of the surrounding digits kept your body from being able to reform and if anything only compacted you further. You started to worry about how difficult it could be to get out of here if this treatment continued all night, hopefully Avery wouldn\u2019t forget you in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of this treatment you felt Avery\u2019s toes stop moving as she came to what seemed like a restful part of her sleep. You immediately began trying to reform and pull yourself out of this crevice on your roommates foot that every squeeze of her toes seemed to push you deeper into, but you found that your reforming was taking a long time. Just as you felt yourself making some progress her other big toe returned to scratch the irritation that you were obviously causing by struggling to reform, crushing you back into the recesses of Avery\u2019s foot even worse than you were before, before retreating and Avery lay still once again. This repeated a few times before you passed out from exhaustion, crushed even worse than you were before trying to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were woken up by the sound of Avery yawning softly as she woke up, stretched her legs out, which splayed her toes to the side, giving you your first respite from the crushing embrace of her toes since last night. After she stretched and the constricting toes returned, you noticed a little less pressure than there was before you passed out, it looked like you had been compacted further into the crevices while you weren\u2019t awake. You hoped you weren\u2019t too crushed to get out on your own, or failing that, for Avery to get you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh what an amazing sleep I had! Should probably go for a shower before I get on with my day off, how did you sleep cutie...\u201d<br>\r\nShe looked around the bed for you, clearly having forgotten where you were. You started to panic, if she had forgotten where you were you could be trapped in here all day at least! <br>\r\n\u201cHunter? Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense moment of her searching, her toes scrunched up over the top of you, painfully crushing you.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201c... he was in my sock, duh!\u201d (Avery remembers where you are and is able to free you.)<br>\r\n2) \u201c... he was in my sock, duh!\u201d (Avery remembers you but is unable to free you/ can\u2019t find you.)<br>\r\n3) \u201c... he must have gotten up early and went downstairs!\u201d (Avery has completely forgotten about you.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up at your three giantess roommates from Morgan\u2019s hand, your eyes traveled from the exuberant energy of Avery, the interested warmth of Morgan, and finally to the complete nonchalance of Quinn. In fact, Quinn wasn\u2019t even looking at you, she was clearly reading something on her phone. The logical side of your brain was screaming at you to pick Morgan. She had an entire corner of her room unused that you could comfortably fit in. Plus she was by far the most reliable out of the three. But some part of you held you back. You thought about it for a moment then realized that if you wanted to be babied then you would have just moved back home after graduating college. You wanted to be an adult, and living on your own meant literally living on your own as much as possible. No doubt about it, even knowing that you lived with a responsible woman like Morgan brought you great peace of mind. But as for the literal room you wanted to live in, you craved a bit more freedom. For this reason once again your gaze turned to the utterly uninterested Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I want to dig out some space in your room, Quinn, if that\u2019s cool with you.\u201d You said up to the three. Avery\u2019s jaw dropped with shock, Morgan\u2019s eyebrows raised as well, and Quinn simply looked up from her phone, looked towards you, and responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, you don\u2019t take up much space anyway so it works for me.\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI already have your stuff so hop on and we\u2019ll find a spot to set you up.\u201d Quinn held out her hand close to Morgan\u2019s and you rather daringly hopped across the divide. Rather impressed by even this small feat of strength, the three women smiled down at you. Both of the twins had their doubts about your choice of living situation, but they weren\u2019t the boss of you by any means, so they simply let it be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you two go get set up, we\u2019re going to head downstairs and hang out. Come join when you\u2019re all done!\u201d Morgan said, Avery excitedly nodding in agreement. The two then turned and walked down the hallway and down the stairs. Quinn simply walked the two of you back into her mess of a room. There was hardly a square inch of space not covered with some article of clothing. Luckily it seemed like other than being a bit untidy, she didn\u2019t have any really nasty things laying around like trash or food. You could handle some spare clothing no sweat. Reaching a spot smack in between Quinn\u2019s bed, her dresser, and the path to her closet, she peered downward and with one bare foot began kicking articles of clothing to the side. Eventually she cleared a few feet of space and dropped your duffel bag down, lowering you down rather quickly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your space, set up your stuff however you want, makes no difference to me.\u201d Quinn said, already walking towards her queen bed and flopping down on it, pulling out her phone to continue browsing. You hopped up onto your duffel bag and grabbed the zipper that was as big as you were, effortfully unzipping the bag open. Your sister Tracy had packed almost everything herself, an act which took her no more than five minutes. You knew it would take you significantly longer to unpack everything. Once again you thought about how quickly either Avery or Morgan would have set all of your belongings up if you had decided to room with them, but you felt some deep satisfaction going through the arduous process of doing it yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours must have passed of you painstakingly dragging items out of your duffel bag and onto the patch of carpet beside you. Somehow, Quinn stayed laying on her bed the entire time, part of the time browsing social media on her phone, and part of the time napping. By now you were pretty exhausted, you had set up your wardrobe and bed at least. Your bed being a sample square of memory foam given to your family by a salesperson along with a frame made out of popsicle sticks that you had fashioned together. Your wardrobe was a repurposed cracker box, that you fitted with a few tiny shelves to separate your things. In reality there had already been a variety of tiny versions of products made for the shrunken population of men, but you took some pride in making things yourself. Collapsing onto your bed to relax, mirroring your giantess roommate, you closed your eyes and chilled out for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, after hours of immobility from Quinn, this was the exact moment which she stood up to head downstairs and figure out what the girls would do for dinner. Her first step off of her bed pressed down onto a pile of laundry, a feeling she had grown used to over the years. But her second step brought with it a bit of squish, along with a surprisingly loud series of crunches. Quinn casually looked down beneath her, leaving her foot where it was. Standing at 5\u201910\u201d Quinn had appropriately large feet for a woman of her height. For that reason in a single step her heel had obliterated your handmade dresser, while her toes had shattered the frame of your bed, squishing down onto the bit of memory foam on top, as well as your tiny body. She looked down more carefully and saw your tiny body, now eyes wide open, pinched between her second and third toes and staring up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh shit, did I just destroy your stuff? My bad, dude. You probably should have set your stuff up somewhere else in retrospect. We\u2019ll figure somewhere else out for you to sleep after dinner though.\u201d Quinn\u2019s half-assed apology caught you off guard. You could tell part of it was genuine, but at the same time you knew that her intentions of forcing you to \u201cbe strong on your own\u201d were going to lead to many events like this in the future. Case in point, with any other woman you would have expected her to reach down and save you from your current position and toe jam, but not Quinn. She simply lifted the foot you were trapped on, brushed the broken popsicle sticks off of her sole, then returned both you and her toes to the carpeted ground. The top half of your body was sitting pinched between her toes, and the bottom half of your body was smashed under the ball of her foot with every step. You knew this was what you signed up for when choosing to live with Quinn, but man you expected to have at least a bit of a break after the hours of ass squashing earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment she reached the living room and plopped down onto the couch next to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Quinn\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter at?\u201d Quinn simply lifted her feet and plopped them on the ottoman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI stepped on him accidentally in my room, he\u2019s right here between my toes. So what\u2019re we doing for dinner?\u201d Quinn said both these sentences with the exact same inflection, paying no special attention to you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery gasped, \u201cQuinn come on can\u2019t you give the little guy a break? He\u2019s been through a lot today!\u201d Avery looked right at you, and was just about to reach out and save you, but you pried Quinn\u2019s massive toes apart using your upper body strength! Your lower half still being slightly crushed, you fluttered down onto the ottoman beneath you, coming to rest beside Quinn\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m chillin, don\u2019t worry about me ladies!\u201d You said, dragging yourself away from the massive sole next to you while simultaneously putting on a sense of bravado as if you were in control of the situation the whole time. Both Avery and Morgan then chuckled, Quinn giving you a slight but still noticeable nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo really, what are our dinner plans?\u201d You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan spoke up. \u201cAvery and I were thinking of just keeping it simple for our first night of living together. How does the local pizza restaurant sound? I think it\u2019s called Pizza Palace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a thumbs up. \u201cSounds good to me! I can always go for some pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery burst into giggles. \u201cOMG! And, and, I bet you only eat, like, a tiny little bit of a slice! That\u2019s so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, as you really did eat next to nothing compared to everyone around you whenever you went out. You looked back at your black-haired roomie. \u201cIs pizza alright with you, Quinn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Quinn shrugged. \u201cSure, can\u2019t complain. If it\u2019s what everyone else wants.\u201d Though her response had been traditionally apathetic, you caught the faint glint in her eyes and the rising curve in the corners of her mouth. She\u2019d never admit it, but you could tell that Quinn was head-over-heels for pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shuffled away to grab some things, and Morgan followed suit. You moved to do the same, until you felt a soft, delicate hand wrap around you from behind and hoist you up into the air. A short gasp escaped your lips before you were whirled around to face the angelic smile of Avery, a playful expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Pizza Palace it is then, huh, Hunter? Gosh, I can not wait to see your adorbs face stuffed with gooey cheese!\u201d The pink-haired girl grinned from ear-to-ear, and her infectious energy rubbed off on you, just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, it should be great.\u201d You agreed, and then paused. \u201cIs there\u2026uh\u2026any particular reason you picked me up to say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smirked in a mischievous manner. \u201cWell, eating out can be scary for tinies, I beat. Lots of big girls like me walking around everywhere. We need to make sure you don\u2019t get lost, cutie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, I appreciate that, Avery, but\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo! I\u2019ve got a special place for you, dude!\u201d Avery giggled, and then released her grip on you. Another startled cry strained out of your mouth as you fell, but it wasn\u2019t long before you impacted against Avery\u2019s soft, squishy left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking your face up from Avery\u2019s boob, your face blushing deep red, you looked up at her in confusion. \u201cA-Avery! What are you doing? You don\u2019t have to carry me in your clea\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery silenced you by placing her index finger on your head and lightly pushing, smushing your lips flat. She then swiped across her breast, dragging your body forward and knocking you into the absolute abyss of her cleavage. Your limbs sprawled and flailed in a futile attempt to stop yourself from falling in. All you succeeded in doing, however, was uselessly slapping and ticking Avery\u2019s sensitive skin, earning a small smile and faint blush from the flirtatious giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one emphatic shake of her prodigious chest, Avery watched as your tiny body was enveloped in the jiggling of her breasts, and you disappeared from view deep into her cleavage. All that surrounded you was darkness and soft, hot flesh. Your body crumpled in on itself in the tight confines of the busty girl\u2019s cleavage, sounds of the outside world muffled. All you could clearly hear was Avery\u2019s ecstatic heartbeat, and your own troubled thoughts, torn between mild arousal and indignation at Avery\u2019s treatment of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring at her tits, and enjoying the feeling of you between them, Avery almost missed Quinn standing in the corner of the room. Looking up, Avery met Quinn\u2019s eye. The black-haired girl, who had witnessed the entire incident, rolled her eyes and looked back at her phone. Avery merely stuck out her tongue and winked, then strolled over to the front door, relishing the feeling of her new, adorable tiny roommate squeezed so intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was the last to the front door, and she looked at Quinn and Avery with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? One of you carrying him?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn lazily glanced at Avery, who stumbled a bit before recovering. \u201cUm\u2026yes! He\u2019s totes in my pocket. Yep!\u201d The enthusiastic girl gestured to the side pocket of her booty shorts, patting it affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, having no reason to doubt her twin sister, merely nodded. \u201cAh, gotcha. At least he won\u2019t get lost that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three girls (and you) left the apartment and headed out to Morgan\u2019s car. Avery slid neatly into the back seat while Quinn sat beside Morgan up front. Morgan turned on some catchy music and pulled out onto the road, driving off to Pizza Palace. It was a fifteen-minute drive, and the time passed by for the girls pretty easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed much slower for you. With each passing second, more and more sweat accumulated between Avery\u2019s succulent, shapely breasts, and that same sweat rolled right over you. To make matters worse, Morgan accidentally hit a pothole in the road that caused Avery\u2019s boobs to quake like crazy, and they heavy mounds of flesh mashed you tight, reducing you to a flattened smear on her tits. Mentally, you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the girls pulled up to Pizza Palace, surprised to find it so packed. Getting out of the car first, Quinn walked off to request a booth, while Morgan and Avery took their time. Avery was second out of the car, and she was just about to dash off to the main entrance of the restaurant when Morgan grabbed her by the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery. Where is Hunter?\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAbout time to get him out of your pocket, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery paused for a moment, blinked, and then gasped. \u201cOh! Hunter! Totes slipped my mind, hee hee!\u201d She giggled, prompting a groan from Morgan. \u201cForgot he was in my pocket!\u201d Avery reached to her pocket to grab you, but came up empty. She checked her other pocket, but was similarly unsuccessful in retrieving you. Beginning to panic, Avery looked at her sister. Morgan merely raised an eyebrow, wondering what was taking so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short span of the car ride, what Avery had done to you had completely flooded out of the ditzy giantess\u2019 mind. This was in part due to the pothole squashing you so flat between her boobs that she could no longer feel you. Thankfully, when Avery began looking herself over in search of where else she could\u2019ve put you, her scatterbrain reconnected the dots as soon as she glimpsed her abundant cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepishly, Avery grimaced at Morgan and then stuck a hand down her cleavage. Morgan stared, wide-eyed, as her twin sister felt herself up looking for you, and finally hooked you on her fingernail and pulled you free. By this point, annoyance had overtaken surprise, and Morgan yanked you away from Avery. She began wiping you down with her shirt, trying to get the accumulated sweat off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Avery.\u201d Morgan sighed, pushing past her demure-acting sister. \u201cOne day. LESS than one day, and you\u2019re making moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery ran alongside Morgan as they entered Pizza Palace. \u201cHe\u2019s super adorbs, Morgan! How could I help myself with a hot little guy like him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan didn\u2019t dignify that with a response, so Avery grew quiet. The twins met up with Quinn and a harried looking waitress. The waitress was dressed in a red blouse and black slacks, an outfit that wouldn\u2019t have been flattering if it wasn\u2019t a size too small. As it was, the blouse and slacks pressed hard against the girl\u2019s decently curvy body, creating a surprisingly alluring visual. A small nametag pinned to her breast read \u201cLila\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila brushed some of her long, frizzy brown hair out of her face, simultaneously rubbing sleep out of her eyes. \u201cYour table is\u2026*yawn*\u2026this way.\u201d She murmured, and then wandered off, the three girls following dutifully. As they walked, you finally finished reforming in Morgan\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you took in the sights of Pizza Palace. It was pretty big for a pizza restaurant, and it was almost packed to max capacity. Over fifty patrons filled the tables and booths, and five other waitresses bussed busily from customer to customer. You could make out a small play place and a few arcade machines in one corner, as well as the door to the kitchen in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila eventually gestured to an empty booth, and Quinn and Avery slid in, each girl taking a menu from Lila. Morgan was last, but before she sat, she gently dropped you onto the corner of the table. She then settled in, and picked up her own menu, and as you looked at Quinn and Avery, you found them both similarly consumed by reading their menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes for drinks.\u201d Lila explained, and each of your new roommates nodded or uttered an appreciative \u2018thanks\u2019. However, before she stepped back from the table, Lila spotted you, and the brown-haired waitress frowned. Her overwhelming exhaustion was blurring her vision, to say nothing of the fact that she\u2019d forgotten her glasses at home, but she could\u2019ve sworn there was a bug on the table. Frowning, she swatted it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were in no way a bug, but the far-sighted, weary waitress didn\u2019t know that. You couldn\u2019t even cry out before her giant hand slapped you off the table and onto the floor. Your new roommates didn\u2019t notice a thing, too busy scanning their menus. You could only splat down onto the floor, flattening out a bit from the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up, you looked and saw Lila take a step towards you, off to continue her waitress duties without a clue you were beneath her. As her black boot raised itself over you, you fought with all your might to move, before this little dinner excursion became a nightmare all onto itself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sadly, though you possessed the full motor functions needed to escape from Lila\u2019s boot in any other circumstance, the oblivious waitress simply wasn\u2019t giving you enough time to act. You\u2019d barely moved a muscle before her foot slammed down, and your miniscule body was smushed into a flat blob under her heel. Your body squelching barely made a noise, and as Lila walked off, both she and your three new roommates were totally unaware of the fate that had befallen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step Lila took only smashed your body into even more of a blob, and you were left utterly defenseless as you began to stick to the bottom of her boot. You had no idea where she was going, but as the soft carpet crashing into you was replaced with hard, smooth flooring, you had to assume she\u2019d entered the kitchen. This fact alone filled you with fear. A kitchen was never a place that a tiny like you would want to be without supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, fate wasn\u2019t giving you much of a choice in the matter, but it did throw you a bone, at the very least. Lila stopped for a second by the chef\u2019s counter, where there was a small, rough floor mat. Grinding her heels across the mat, Lila casually freed dirt and bits of food from the treads in her boots. She did this nearly a hundred times a day, so she spared no extra thought to the almost imperceptible feeling of a squishy blob rolling off her heel and onto the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, you were saved, but in no less dangerous a situation. Lying flat on the ground, you worked overtime on focusing your body to reform, and watched as Lila shuffled away, no doubt headed to get the drink requests from your roommates. She was replaced a moment later by the Pizza Palace chef, a pleasantly attractive redhead who had an apron tied across her blouse. She, too, nearly stepped on you, but thankfully missed by a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping back to normal size, you figured that trying to escape through the kitchen by yourself was a fool-hardy effort. A cursory glance around helped you to spot no less than two other chefs and three other waitresses tromping around the place, heedless to what lie beneath their feet. A single misstep could get you crushed to another girl\u2019s shoe, and if they didn\u2019t wipe their feet like Lila had, you could be stuck for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left getting someone\u2019s attention as your primary choice, and seeing as how one of the chefs was right beside you, you picked her as your target. The only downside was that the kitchen was abuzz with noise, whether it was beeping ovens, hissing steam from grills, or employee\u2019s shouting orders. There was no way you\u2019d be heard from down on the ground, so you took a deep breath and began climbing the counter beside you, the one the chef was standing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood of the counter had a few chips and cracks in it, which was exactly what you knew you\u2019d need to scale it. Using these imperfections as your handholds, you were able to rely on your fairly fit body and high capacity for stamina to scramble up the side of the counter. Eventually, you flopped onto the countertop, took a second to wipe sweat from your brow, and then you hustled over to the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you opened your mouth to speak, you hesitated, and that hesitation ended up costing you quite dearly. The chef had turned away from you, her hand resting right beside you. In her other hand was a gigantic glob of dough. On the counter around you was a rolling pan and a wooden pallet. The scent of dough and flour was overwhelming. Somehow, in all of your panic, you\u2019d yet to truly consider that the counter you were climbing was one where pizza was made. After all, you were smack in the middle of a hectic restaurant kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your same moment of hesitation, the chef turned back to face you, her hand gliding across the counter. As it did so, she accidentally back-handed you, flinging your miniature body backwards towards the center of the counter, beside the rolling pin. You collapsed onto your back, winded from the hit, and gasping for air so you could begin shouting. Looking up at the redheaded chef, you saw her gaze squarely locked on the electronic sign above you, which stated incoming orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026uh\u2026okay! Standard pepperoni! Easy peasy!\u201d The chef grinned with confidence. All while keeping her eyes on the electronic order sign, the hefted the chunky glob of dough up onto the counter, and let it fall from her hands, smacking down heavily. Of course, this also meant that it fell straight where you were, and with nowhere to run or escape to, you could only let out a strangled scream as you were buried under the mountain of dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally looking down, the chef went to work, blissfully unaware of the extra ingredient she\u2019d just added to her pepperoni pizza recipe. With the effortless ease of a professional, the chef kneaded and shaped the dough, using the rolling pin to squeeze it across the counter into the perfect shape of a world-class Pizza Palace pizza. With the application of the rolling pin, your body was mashed and mangled beneath the dough, buried and out of sight. All your attempts at screaming were muffled beyond human hearing capability, and it was far to heavy and pressuring to wriggle free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, with the pizza set in its basic shape, the chef turned to fetch the toppings and ingredients, humming a happy little tune. Desperate to not succumb to this fate, you bit through the dough overtop of you, clawing your way to freedom. It was disgusting, and you felt ready to burst from fullness after just a few bites, but finally you freed your head from the doughy pizza prison. The bright kitchen lights temporarily blinded you, so you squinted and shouted to the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE! HELP M\u2013\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cries were almost immediately silenced, as a heavy downpour of sticky, viscous red sauce rained from above, splattering onto the pizza. The sauce flooded into your mouth and soaked your head and hair, causing you to sputter and gag. It stung your eyes, but your arms were still too stuck to wipe away the sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing applying the sauce, the chef froze, and frowned. She leaned forward, frowned deeper, then glanced around. \u201cHuh\u2026could\u2019ve sworn I heard someone\u2026so weird!\u201d She sighed and laughed, turning to the next topping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving up sauce from your throat, you coughed rapidly and prepared to cry out again, efforts renewed by the knowledge that the chef could actually hear you. If you could just shout out again, you might genuinely be saved. However, before you could finish sputtering out the remnants of sauce clogging your throat, the chef returned with freshly sliced mozzarella, and rained it haphazardly across the surface of the pizza. Your only response was to widen your eyes and gurgle out an unheard cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appeared to be the largest bit of cheese slapped right into your face, shoving you back down into the dough and burying you from view. It also indented the dough a bit, which allowed the swamp of sauce to flood around you, submerging you completely. It was like you were being entombed in sauce, and everything became darkness. Only the knowledge that tinies couldn\u2019t drown kept you from falling into utter despair at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that despair resurfaced a few minutes later, as you felt the chef lift her creation up with the wooden pallet, and carry you across the kitchen. As the humidity of your pizza prison increased tenfold, and you heard a muted metallic bang, you knew that you\u2019d been place inside of the oven. In seconds, the temperature began to rise by extreme degrees, and you couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in agony (which only earned you another mouthful of sauce pouring in).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven was hell; there was really no other delicate way to put it. The pizza remained in for twenty minutes, during which you sweat so much that your whole body felt dried of moisture. Your skin sizzled and had burned bright red, a fact which you only vaguely realized helped your miniscule tiny body to blend in even more with the sauce all around you. Your head was faint and foggy, and you teetered on the edge of passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely took note of the pizza being retrieved from the oven and placed back on the counter. It was hard to remain focus. All desire to break free had left you after the ordeal in the oven, and you wished only to sleep. You had long since lost the strength to claw or eat your way out, especially now that the sauce, cheese, and dough had solidified around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate clearly wanted to prolong this torture, and wasn\u2019t content to merely kill you. The redheaded chef, still humming her happy song, sliced the pizza into nice symmetrical slices, narrowly avoiding bisecting your body. She then grabbed a nearby carton of fries and box of chicken strips, prepared for her by one of the other Pizza Palace chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got my next order?\u201d A voice said, and the chef turned to see Reagan, Pizza Palace\u2019s most experienced delivery worker. She had her motorcycle helmet under her arm, and her delivery bag slung over her shoulder. \u201cJust got back from a delivery, ready for the next one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you just like riding your motorcycle.\u201d The chef teased. \u201cBut, yes, I do have one ready.\u201d She reached for a to-go box, but stopped at the sight of Lila strolling back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila yawned, then spoke. \u201cIs there a pepperoni pizza ready to go for those three girls?\u201d She looked down at your pizza prison. \u201cOh. Yes there is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef held up a hand. \u201cHold on, Lila. Reagan wanted this pizza. Her delivery is also important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan shrugged. \u201cActually, give it to whoever. When was each order placed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef tapped her chin. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check. Give me a second\u2026\u201d She said, looking at the electronic order sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you barely heard any of this conversation, some innate part of you knew that your immediate future was hanging in the balance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your heart sank as you heard the chef say that your pizza would be going to Reagan\u2019s next delivery. You were going to end up at a complete stranger\u2019s house. This meant that not only would this stranger not be looking for a tiny man, but even if you did manage to escape this pizza prison, it would be much harder for you to get back to your roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chef boxed up your pizza your fate was sealed, you felt like you wouldn\u2019t be getting back to your roommates any time soon. You could barely see before from the sauce and cheese covering you but the darkness inside the now closed box robbed you of what little sight you had. Your world shifted as the box was lifted and handed to Reagan, who you faintly heard thanking the chef. The box began to rock back and forth as Reagan walked out of the kitchen and through the restaurant towards the front door. You could hear the muffled sounds of the restaurant through the box, and you swear for a split second you heard Morgan say, \u201cHey guys, have you seen Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s voice disappeared as quickly as you heard it and you could only cry internally as it was too late, they wouldn\u2019t find you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan swung the door open, holding it for a few customers who were just coming in, before sauntering over to her motorbike, several pizza boxes in hand. She had a few deliveries to do on this run and she was looking forward to having some more time riding her bike, not knowing about her tiny passenger sitting at the bottom of the pile of boxes she was carrying. If she knew you were in there she\u2019d have done everything in her power to get you out, she cared deeply about tiny guys. As if to emphasise this, she paused her walk briefly when she felt like there was gum stuck to her foot, she sat the pizza boxes down on her bike\u2019s seat and lifted her foot up to peel the tiny guy she had accidentally stepped on. She apologised profusely and ran back into Pizza Palace to hand him to the group of women she had held the door open for, who were now frantically searching for their tiny friend.<br>\r\nThat minor distraction out of the way she got back to her bike, secured the pizzas in the bag to keep them warm during the journey, and set off. <br>\r\nYou hoped that over the journey the constant motion would help to possibly dislodge you, but the stacked pizza boxes kept movement to a minimum. Also as the pizza cooled slightly, not a lot in part due to the heat sealed bag, the crust seemed to harden slightly, as did the cheese covering you. This made the surrounding pizza hold you in even more tightly. You sighed when you noticed this, it seemed that everything was going against you today, all you wanted was to have a nice dinner with your new roommates and get to know them better, but now it looked like you were destined to end up in the stomach of a random stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around twenty minutes, with a few deliveries in between, you felt your pizza box lifted, and the familiar motion of Reagan carrying the box to the door where you were to be delivered to. You heard a feminine voice answer and thank Reagan, before you felt the pizza box shift as it changed hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza box was placed on a solid surface, presumably a table, before it was opened. Once your eyes adjusted to the change in light you looked up to the hungry face of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ... Your sister Tracy, her and your mom ordered takeout and invited your Aunt Norah to join them.<br>\r\n2) ... A complete stranger<br>\r\n3) ... Someone else you recognise (writer\u2019s choice)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your reaction was just a bit too slow, unfortunately, and you found your efforts to scramble out of the way useless as Lila\u2019s black boot stomped down onto the ground. Your body was crushed paper thin under her heel, the tiny squelching noise you made inaudible due to the laughter, chatter, and music of the Pizza Palace. Lila didn\u2019t have a clue in the world she\u2019d stepped on you, and even if she had, she genuinely might\u2019ve been too exhausted to stop and peel you free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, the weary waitress trotted off through the restaurant, in the direction of the play area near the back. She\u2019d been asked by her boss to tidy up some spilled snacks, as well as adjust the coin collector for one of the most popular games in Pizza Palace. This annoyed Lila to no end, but she wasn\u2019t about to talk back to her boss, as she needed this job too badly, even if it was a hellish, soul-sucking job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the arcade, Lila bent down and methodically scooped up the crumbs and food pieces left behind by careless patrons, yawning intermittently. You could do nothing but stay squished firmly under her shoe, your body having been squished over and over each time she took a step. Lila was far from a heavy girl, but her giant boot had still done quite a number on you. You still fought to reform, but it was mostly useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, it was useless until Lila approached the faulty arcade machine. It was a simple fix to adjust the coin collector and get the machine back up and running, but was Lila finished, she absentmindedly scraped her boot along the carpeted floor. Because you were flattened but not totally engrained in the treads of Lila\u2019s boot, your malleable body ripped free from her boot and was left behind on the ground as the titanic waitress took another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste your chance, you focused all your efforts on reforming and managed to pop back into normal shape. As you did so, you noted that you were right beside one of those traditional car racing machines with the makeshift driver\u2019s seat and steering wheel. It was partnered with an identical racing machine, no doubt to enable two people to compete against each other in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noted a girl standing right beside the machine, with her back turned to you. With how loud the Pizza Palace was, you doubted she would hear you from the floor, but you guessed that climbing higher would allow her to hear you. You didn\u2019t know this stranger, but you were placing your bets on her being willing to carry you back to your roommates. It beat trying to walk all the way back through the crowded restaurant, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that plan in mind, you hopped up onto the machine and scrambled up into the seat of the driving chair. You then pushed your upper body strength to the limit and scaled the back of the seat, all the way up to the headrest. It was tiring, but you made it in less than two minutes. Taking one split second to catch your breath, you were about to speak when the unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly twisted her hand backwards, and her giant fingers slapped into you. The air was knocked out of your lungs and you fell backwards with a silent cry. Splatting down onto the hard plastic of the seat, your body flattened out. Groaning, you began trying to reform again, even as the girl above you stepped aside to reveal a second girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! They just fixed the machine.\u201d The first girl, the one who had slapped you, said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that awesome, Zoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl (Zoe, apparently) who had yet to fully enter your view, laughed confidently. \u201cSure is! God, I love this game. Ready to get totally wiped?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl rolled her eyes, but smiled. \u201cYou take this way too seriously, Zoe?\u201d Laughing, she walked out of your sight, and you could hear her sit down in the adjacent seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Zoe herself stepped forward, and she was quite the sight. Tall, with nicely tanned skin, and shoulder-length red hair. She was wearing a stylish hoodie and a flashy red miniskirt, both of which accentuated her rather shapely body. You took particular notice of her large, alluring rear end\u2026especially as she stepped with a leg on both sides of you, and you stared right up at her as she began to sit. The reality of your situation finally hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it hit you too late, and a much more tangible and painful force hit you a second after that. Zoe\u2019s big bubble butt pounded down onto the seat, utterly obliterating you. To make matters worse, her miniskirt flared out as she sat, revealing her creamy butt cheeks and barely-there thong to the private audience of one helplessly trapped tiny. Her bare left cheek crashed onto you, slamming your almost reformed body back down flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe\u2019s hefty derriere barely fit in the confines of the racing chair, so the red head wiggled a little to get more comfortable. This had the disastrous consequence of grinding her ass cheeks back and forth across the plastic, smearing your body side-to-side as she wiggled in place. You mentally cried out for her to stop, but your mute pleas fell on deaf ears as Zoe continued to shift around. Her smooth flesh ground into your face, smudging your malleable body into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe eventually settled down, but the damage was done, and you were much flatter and compressed than before. All sounds of the outside world were muffled, but you could distinctly make out Zoe\u2019s confident boasts as she started up a competitive race with her friend. The race lasted five minutes, and each time Zoe jerked the wheel, her whole body twisted, meaty butt cheeks digging into your flesh. Every time she slammed the brakes to drift, her ass clenched, more pressure squeezing into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skilled red head won by a landslide, and gave her friend a cocky grin after it was over. However, as her friend stood up, Zoe herself was stopped from standing by a timid looking girl who had watched the race from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026d-do you think\u2026I-I could race you?\u201d The nervous girl inquired, stammering. \u201cI\u2019ll p-pay for your race\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe raised her eyebrows at the challenge, gave her friend a look, and then smiled at the nervous girl. \u201cHeck, why not? Sure thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anxious girl smiled appreciatively, put in a dollar for her ride and one for Zoe, and then a second round of competition began. Second verse, same as the first, from your perspective. More crushing and squishing from the oblivious red head who had so thoroughly dominated you with her impeccable booty. There was nothing you could do by now to try and fight against her, as you were much to crumpled and pancaked to attempt reforming, let alone speaking or wiggling to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe won the second race as easily as the first, but again before she stood, the timid girl\u2019s mother approached. Caught off guard, Zoe listened to the motherly giantess explain how much she played the game when she was younger, and her confidence in besting Zoe. She even offered up a five-dollar bet. Eyes glinting with the promise of high stakes, Zoe eagerly too up her offer, and a third race began. Zoe\u2019s friend, meanwhile, wandered off to order pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began the reign of the Racing Queen. The third match was the most intense yet, but eventually Zoe came out on top, eking out a first-place win by a hair. By this point, she was working up a hearty sweat from the pressure of maintaining her win streak, and that sweat was pooling around her doughy buttocks, creating a little swamp right where your tiny body was unfortunately wedged. You were thoroughly doused in sweat and the increasing stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her moist ass brought a grimace to Zoe\u2019s face, but she merely lifted her ass off the seat for a moment and then clapped it back down. Her pillowy left butt check utterly demolished you upon landing, squishing your miniscule body firmly into its hot, fleshy embrace. You felt yourself stick to both it and the chair in equal measure, and you began to genuinely fear you\u2019d become a tattoo on either Zoe or the seat if this lasted any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, last longer it did, and for quite a while. Zoe performed twenty flawless races in a row, the stakes for each growing higher and higher as nearly everyone in the Pizza Palace sought out the Racing Queen to challenge her. Her friend stood diligently beside her and supplied her pizza slices in between races, and after an intense but exciting hour, Zoe had raked in one hundred dollars in winnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the restaurant, Morgan was tearing her hair out looking for you, and was on the verge of tears. Trying to soothe her, Quinn and Avery promised that they\u2019d find you, but that Morgan needed to take a break. Apprehensive at first, Morgan eventually agreed, and she wandered off to calm her nerves. By chance, she ended up taking note of Zoe right as the red head was finishing another race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I really like this game.\u201d Morgan said by way of introducing herself. Zoe\u2019s recent victim wandered off sadly, and Morgan ended up sliding into the second seat. Zoe gave her new opponent a wide grin, and once more absentmindedly wiggled her prodigious rear end in her seat. By this point, you were more of a smear than a man, having suffered under this blissfully unaware girl for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp for a competitive race?\u201d Zoe offered to your beautiful roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded, and smiled back. \u201cProbably what I need right now, yeah. Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe caught the confident glint in Morgan\u2019s eye, and realized she had finally met a true rival. Steeling herself, she gripped the steering wheel tighter as the race began. Morgan did the same, totally oblivious as the how close her missing tiny roommate was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the race go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With your connection to the outside world completely cut off due to the crushing weight of your current captor. The only thing you knew about this girl was that her name was Zoe, she had a rather large, soft, butt, and she was evidently great at this stupid racing game. You didn\u2019t even know if your new roommates were looking for you or not. They could have easily gotten caught up in conversation, eaten some delicious pizza, then headed home without you. After all, you hadn\u2019t even lived for these three girls for a single night yet. You couldn\u2019t possibly expect them to keep your wellbeing as their main priority at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, almost as if fate was giving you just a taste of salvation, Zoe just then lifted her ass into the air. For her, she was merely airing out her now overwhelmingly sweaty ass cheeks that were beginning to stick to the firm, plastic seat. But for you it gave you the briefest connection back into the realm of normal people, and as she did though you heard a recognizable voice say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Cruising through California racetrack on the hardest difficulty sound good?\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe your ears, but it was Morgan\u2019s voice! If you could have known how hard she was looking for you before you would have been even more grateful to your hopeful savior, but even being close to someone you knew gave you a flash of positivity in this otherwise depressing situation. However, before you could get too excited, Zoe dropped her rear a few inches back onto the firm seat, obliterating you once more. Once again, reality became muffled and your entire world was sweaty ass above you with unforgiving plastic beneath you. Your fate was in Morgan\u2019s hands entirely, and she didn\u2019t even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Zoe said while grinning. She adjusted her seat forward an inch to make the seat even more tight around her tall and voluptuous frame. This increased the pressure on you yet again, but gave her a bit more control that she felt like she might need to beat Morgan. The two beautiful giantesses watched their respective screens as the countdown to the start flashed, until finally the green light signaled the start and they both slammed their feet onto the pedals. It was clear the two girls were neck and neck in terms of skill with this game, keeping pace with each other almost exactly. Of course, you had no clue about the outcome of the race. Your only way of discerning any information was how harshly Zoe would lean onto one cheek or the other as she took sharp turns, either crushing you worse or giving you the briefest of respites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround two minutes of torture (for you) later and exhilarating fun for the girls, they were reaching the final stretch of the race. Zoe was actually in the lead by a few car lengths, feeling confident that she would keep her tremendous win streak alive. However, out of seemingly nowhere, Morgan took a sharp turn and jumped across an entire out-of-bounds section of the track! Zoe\u2019s jaw dropped as Morgan\u2019s car landed far and away ahead of hers. Zoe shifted gears in desperation, but it was too late. Morgan\u2019s car zoomed across the finish line first, with Zoe a second behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Morgan exclaimed, pumping a fist in front of her, \u201cThat was a great race! I didn\u2019t tell ya this before but I have the console version of this game at home so I know all the shortcuts! You definitely would have had me if not for that!\u201d Having clearly enjoyed the competition, Morgan warmly talked to the girl beside her. Part of Zoe wanted to be mad about losing finally, but the overwhelming warmth and sincerity that Morgan was giving off mere seconds after seeming so competitive won her over. Zoe simply smiled back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed, not a single other person in here could come close to beating me. I\u2019ve gotta give credit where credit\u2019s due, you\u2019re really good at the game.\u201d Zoe then stood up for the first time in over an hour. For a brief moment it felt like you would be torn in half, with your body\u2019s squishy characteristics being stuck equally to the girls damp ass flesh as well as the plastic chair. But after a brief tug, you popped free of the giantess\u2019s derriere and snapped back into being a flat sticker on the seat of the chair. You watched as her red miniskirt fluttered back down, just barely covering the butt cheeks that you had gotten to know so well. Shaking yourself out of the physical distress you felt, you finally realized that Morgan must have won! Looking upwards now, Zoe continued to talk, \u201cHere the Player 1 seat is all yours, you\u2019ve earned it! It\u2019s probably about time for me to get out of here anyway! Hopefully I see you again sometime, I\u2019d love to have a rematch!\u201d You then watched the girl walk away, taking a moment to appreciate how attractive she was. In your head you thought shallowly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be squished left and right throughout time living on my own, I\u2019m at least glad it\u2019s underneath beautiful women like her or my roommates.\u201d You prided yourself upon being a positive person for the most part, despite finding yourself in a myriad of seemingly hopeless situations quite often due to your size. But of course as fate seemed to love to do to you, the second you thought about being thankful to be crushed by good looking girls, you saw Morgan\u2019s equally impressive ass stand up from the seat next to you. You saw that she had changed into ever so slightly less revealing athletic wear from earlier, but they still did nothing to hide her toned curves. You cried internally, assuming that once more you would be decimated under an unaware ass. At the very least this time you would be underneath someone you knew though. Ideally you would stick to her shorts, hitch a ride home, then unstick yourself when she changed later in the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready planning for more hours of pressure, you were confused when it didn\u2019t immediately come. You looked up to see not Morgan\u2019s buns, but her eyes, and they were staring right at you! Her face had a look of utter shock, as did yours. In this exact moment, a wave of relief washed over your body, not just for the current situation, but for the future too. Quinn\u2019s no-nonsense tough-love for tinies and Avery\u2019s overwhelming combination of flirtation and forgetfulness had led you to believe that you were going to end up crushed more often than not. But seeing how Morgan actually checked a seat before dropping her ass into it was a game-changer. Perhaps there was hope for you to live normally amongst these three girls after all! You knew that was a pipe dream, but the thoughtfulness of Morgan gave you just enough hope to keep that dream alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, Hunter!? Were you under that girl the entire time!? Have you been here since we got here!?\u201d Morgan said down to you. You weren\u2019t sure if she actually expected a response, or if she was just thinking out loud. You wished desperately that you could respond to your new friend, but you couldn\u2019t. And at just that moment another relatively younger woman approached the racing game setup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I saw you beat that girl who was beating everyone, you up to race me?\u201d She said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh actually I\u2019m just saving these seats for a moment, sorry. Maybe in a bit though!\u201d Morgan fumbled through her words slightly. In reality she loved competition and honestly did want to race this new girl. But her worry about your wellbeing was far more important at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually we have a policy here to not save seats on the games. You must either play or give the game up to whoever else wants it.\u201d The sleepy waitress from earlier approached the two. She really didn\u2019t want to get involved in a dispute of any kind, but once again she couldn\u2019t afford to lose her job for being caught not policing the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s mind raced with fear, she had no clue what to do. If she sat down and raced this girl, then she knew you would at least be safe, albeit crushed underneath her butt. Maybe she could beat this one girl super quick then work on freeing you. But part of her still would feel terribly guilty about crushing you intentionally. She thought briefly about texting Quinn or Avery to come and take the seat from her. It seemed like either her sister or her new roommate cared far less about squishing you than she did herself, so perhaps she would spare herself the agony of doing it herself. Lastly, her third option was to simply come clean to the waitress and the challenger about you. However she had no idea how Pizza Palace\u2019s policies towards tiny customers were. After so many years of society growing accustomed to tiny men, it was likely that they would be understanding, but some establishments still took advantage of the relatively relaxed policing towards the mistreatment of tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s mind jumped through the options, until finally she decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Morgan may have hated herself for considering it, she really didn't want to put you through the pain and torture of dealing with her ass, Avery might take it too far or even enjoy crushing Hunter, but Quinn on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked up, seeing her sister bouncing about from game to game excitedly, getting along with other people enjoying the arcade, and collecting whatever meager tickets her casual and playful enjoyment won her from each game. Quinn meanwhile, seemed utterly focused on the cyclone arcade game, up against a few other kids who were hoping to claim the now large jackpot waiting to be won. With a deep breath, and a concentrated look, Quinn smacked the button, hitting it right in the center and causing the ticket dispenser to shoot out her jackpot winnings, a small smirk on her face as she collected her winnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quinn!\" Morgan called out to her, prompting her attention, albeit in an uninterested gaze. \"Come try out this racing game! It's really fun!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, Jackpots really low now anyways...\" Quinn motioned to the Cyclone machine, before walking over with her tickets in hand. Morgan glanced down at you apologetically as she made way for Quinn. You did stick to her ass before, so with any luck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's intimidating shadow loomed over your squished frame as she came into your view. handing Morgan her tickets as she scooted into position to sit down, her jiggly ass filling your view before it came crashing down brutally and uncaring of your situation. Morgan couldn't help but frown, watching her curvy new roomie decimate her small new roomie by simply taking a seat, the leather seat giving out an audible, and almost mocking hissing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, beneath the enormous ass of Quinn, you already felt the heat rise dramatically! (Not like it was all that cool from the brief moment of freedom from being beneath anyone's ass) and the heat only amped up further, along with excruciating pain as Quinn shifted her hips back and forth, getting comfy in the seat. Was getting stuck to Quinn's ass really the best option? You couldn't help but wonder if you had better chances staying on the seat... You could just barely hear the outside world as you lay helplessly smashed between the leather seat and the copious amounts of ass flesh above and around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan winced as she saw Quinn shift about, along with the accompanying sounds of her ass dragging against the leather seat of the game. Quinn then paid the obligatory token amount and began racing the challenger. Every now and then, Quinn would readjust her ass as she played, apparently unable to get comfortable in the seat (Probably because it was made with kids in mind) the faint sound of her now sweating ass peeling off the leather could be heard, before it would come crashing back down on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn kept her uncaring demeanor even when racing. Or perhaps it was a look of focus, it was hard to tell with her this early in their friendship, Morgan thought. She just hoped Quinn would be willing to peel you off her ass again like earlier, and not condemn you to a whole night of arcade games before helping you out. Morgan quickly came to determine that it was indeed focus that Quinn was expressing, as during the race, she effortlessly took the lead against the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Quinn beat the girl, crossing the finish line with a healthy lead. Another small smirk flashed on her face before vanishing completely. The challenging girl huffed slightly, Quinn's relaxed attitude and lack of any emotion certainly didn't make her loss any more easier to take. Quinn looked over to Morgan. <br>\r\n\"That was fun. What now?\"<br>\r\nShe put her hand on the armrest, going to lift herself from the now sweaty chair, having just rose from the seat when another girl ran over.<br>\r\n\"That was awesome!\" the new girl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn opted to relax in her seat as she talked, dropping back in, causing the leather seat to hiss again.<br>\r\n\"Can you face me now? I just gotta try to beat you after that!\" She asked, and as she finished her sentence, some other girls, presumably her friends, came over, each seeming just as eager to take on the new Queen of the racing game. Morgan grimaced, this wasn't what she was hoping for at all, what was she going to do now!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shifted her ass in the slightly slick seat, the friction once again burning you and smearing you beneath her ginormous cheeks as she briefly pondered the request before saying:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I guess since we're all sort of strangers, except for you two...\" You said, gesturing to Morgan and Avery. \"...we should probably each spend some time hanging out with each other and getting to know one another.\" You shrugged. \"If that doesn't sound too dumb or corny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shook her head and smiled. \"No, it sounds like a great idea, Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a thumbs up, and inquired. \"Then how about you and I hang out the rest of the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great to me!\" Morgan replied, gently lowering her palm back to the coffee table for you to hop on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up onto Morgan's outstretched hand, you caught sight of Avery's briefly sullen expression, as well as Quinn's trademark indifference. A moment later though, and Avery was back to her normal self, no doubt consoling herself with the fact that she'd hang out with you later. Jumping out of her seat, she grabbed Quinn's arm and practically dragged the black-haired giantess out of the living room. Quinn tried protesting, but the infectious giggles of Avery drowned her out. The two soon disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with Morgan, the brown-haired girl stared at you caringly. \"What did you want to do, Hunter? Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \"Well, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That's a great idea!\" Morgan nodded, and began carefully walking out of the living room and upstairs. You were amazed by how deliberately and slowly she carried you, and it was genuinely hard to tell you were even moving if you closed your eyes and relaxed. Her soft palm was like a floating bed of wonder, whisking you away. Once upstairs, Morgan slipped through the first door and into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan showed off her room, and it was basically what you expected from someone like her. Her bed was tucked in and straightened, her clothes were neatly stored away in dressers and in the closet, and one corner of her room was taken up by a organized collection of exercise weights and training props. One other corner of the room was barren. The entire room was decorated in shades of tan and brown, a very earthy and natural feel. There was also a TV with what looked like a gaming console hooked up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess guardian gently placed you down on the corner of her bed. \"Well, this is it. Nothing too special, but I'm still really looking forward to living here for the next few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around the room. \"Yeah, I mean, it's super well-organized. Very neat. I bet you never lose anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled at your compliment, and moved to sit down. The sight of her descending gave you a brief moment of shock, which was entirely unjustified. Morgan was sitting on the opposite end of the bed, nowhere near you, and she was watching you the whole time. You were just jumpy around giant women, as you'd experienced your very fair share of mishaps over the course of your life. Still, it was a sight to behold, Morgan's firm butt pushing her compression shorts tightly against her as she bent down to sit, her weight displacing the mattress a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stretched her arms after she sat. \"My room is tidy, sure...I only wish Avery and Quinn were the same. Have you looked in the kitchen and bathroom yet? Those places are practically a mess, and we just moved in hours ago.\" She huffed, and stuck out her lower lip in a faux pout. \"It's a little annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you wanted, I could help you clean up.\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks.\" Morgan grinned, the faintest trace of a blush in her cheeks. \"That's super considerate. But...I don't know. Maybe I'll just destress with a good exercise. Nothing helps me more than getting in the groove and sweating out my issues.\" She looked over to where her exercise equipment was stored in the corner. \"Or...you and me could do something else entirely. I have some game consoles and stuff.\" She glanced back at you. \"Honestly, you decide. I'm no good with so many choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took you back a bit, but you didn't want to let your new roommate down, so you thought for a second before replying.</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t like the idea of exercising, seeing me get all hot and sweaty?\u201d She teased, and you started to blush, which made her giggle. \u201dI\u2019m only kidding Hunter, but in all seriousness I will whip you into shape before long! In the meantime though I do think that your suggestion is better for getting to know each other.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that she stood up and walked across the room to her tv, turning it and the console on. This gave you a view of her firm glutes, tightly covered by her compression shorts. You couldn\u2019t help but stare, and you heard a giggle as you saw Morgan looking back at you with faux offended smile.<br>\r\n\u201cJust what were you looking at Hunter, whatever it was clearly was taking up all your attention,\u201d as she said this she wiggled her hips side to side, swaying her backside tantalisingly in front of you. She laughed as you went beet red in embarrassment at being caught. \u201cYou were so preoccupied with whatever it was that you didn\u2019t hear me ask which game you wanted to play.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I won\u2019t really be able to play without a controller sized for me, I\u2019ve got one in my stuff but I\u2019ve not gotten around to unpacking yet. So I guess just pick what you want to play.\u201d You stammered out, still embarrassed.<br>\r\nMorgan selected a game and sauntered back over to the bed, with an extra sway in her step, clearly enjoying teasing you. She sat down on it before plucking you up off the bed and sitting you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, I figure this way I\u2019ll be able to hear you better,\u201d she said to you with a warm smile, clearly finished teasing you for now.<br>\r\nFor the next hour or so you and Morgan chatted, getting to know each other while she played her game. She told you about the job she had just got at Workout World and you explained that you hadn\u2019t managed to secure work yet but you were looking. You explained about your mom and sister and she listened intently. You were feeling like you and Morgan were making a genuine connection and could end up as good friends. Just as you were about to ask her about her family you both heard the sound of the doorbell followed by Avery shouting that she would get it. The door opened and you heard an excited squeal from Avery followed by the sound of her running up the stairs before bursting through Morgan\u2019s door in excitement.<br>\r\n\u201cOur moms are here!\u201d She squealed before rushing back downstairs.<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, I wasn\u2019t expecting a visit from them until tomorrow at earliest. I would have loved to have had the place clean before any of our parents visited but oh well,\u201d Morgan shrugged before smiling down at you. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love them Hunter, they love tiny guys.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that she stood up, which as she did, she leaned forward. You started to slide forward, at risk of sliding down into her cavernous cleavage, pushed up by her tank top. However you managed to grasp onto a stray hair to keep yourself on your perch on her shoulder. She saw your struggle and apologised, picking you up and carrying you down on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan carried you down the stairs towards the living room you heard the sound of energetic conversation before Morgan rounded the corner and you saw it\u2019s source. Quinn was sitting in a corner, quiet, she was clearly overwhelmed by the sheer energy from the conversation between Avery and her parents. They were standing in the middle of the living room and their energetic conversation was accentuated by hand gestures and high pitched laughs from all three women. Morgan said hello and her two moms turned to face you, giving you a good look at them.<br>\r\nOn the left was a tall, slender woman with porcelain pale skin and platinum blonde hair so bright it was almost the colour of snow. She towered over all the other women in the room, you\u2019d guess she was around 6\u20192\u201d, and was dressed in a simple grey dress that accentuated her slim curves beautifully. She possessed a quite elegant appearance, almost royal.<br>\r\nOn the right was a woman almost exactly opposite of the woman on the left. She was of Half-Hispanic descent, with dark brown hair similar to Morgan and Avery. She was shorter than her wife, but had a lot more weight on her, with the majority of it seeming to go to her curves, giving her a very impressive hourglass figure.<br>\r\nBoth of their eyes lit up at the sight of their other daughter and they both let out a squeal as they rushed to embrace her. Morgan was forced to clench her fist tightly to keep a hold of you as she was embraced by both of her parents. <br>\r\n\u201cWoah, mom, mom let me go for two seconds! I\u2019ll give you guys a hug once I set Hunter down,\u201d her parents gave her a quizzical look as Morgan opened her palm, revealing your flattened form. Morgan gave you a sheepish smile at seeing how mangled her hand had left you after a few seconds. The taller parent gives you a look of fascinated curiosity whereas the shorter one spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, sorry little guy. We didn\u2019t notice your cute little self, did we Lilyana,\u201d she looked to her wife, Lillyana, who responded.<br>\r\n\u201cNo we didn\u2019t Mariah, sorry little man,\u201d she spoke with a slight hint of an accent, maybe Russian? It was difficult to tell because it was faint.<br>\r\nMorgan quickly placed you down on the coffee table and hugged her parents. You saw Quinn give you a nod and a slight panicked look, she clearly wasn\u2019t prepared for the sheer amount of energy coming from the women in the room with her and was feeling a bit overwhelmed. Avery gave you a wink and a giggle before returning to conversation with her parents. Morgan\u2019s hand hadn\u2019t crushed you too badly so you popped back into shape fairly quickly. Before you could get your bearings you felt yourself scooped up in a pair of hands, turning to face the person who lifted you and seeing that it was none other than Mariah, the curvy Hispanic mother of the twins. Before you could even utter a word she brought you up to her lips, which embraced you in a series of kisses. Both Morgan and Avery\u2019s jaws dropped as you were thrust repeatedly into Mariah\u2019s plump, full lips.<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Morgan cried, embarrassed by her mother\u2019s sudden affectionate display towards you.<br>\r\n\u201cMwah, sorry dear but your little friend here is just too adorable for me to resist,\u201d as she said this you turned to see Morgan\u2019s mortified face, but was that a hint of jealousy you saw in her eyes? Maybe you were imagining things.<br>\r\nAfter that incident, everyone sat down and you stayed on the coffee table. Conversation flowed, even Quinn was dragged into the conversation now that the excited energy had died down a bit. Mariah and Lilyana were very curious about you and your life so far. You learned that Lilyana was a well-known event coordinator and party planner and Mariah owned a local burger joint called Sinclair Sandwiches. You had actually heard of Sinclair Sandwiches and you and your family had actually eaten there on occasion, a fact that Mariah was very happy about. Eventually the twins parents talked to Quinn about her job at Sanderson Beach as a lifeguard before turning to you.<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you have a job, little guy?\u201d Lilyana asked you.<br>\r\n\u201cNo actually, I have been looking for a job but I haven\u2019t managed to secure anything yet,\u201d you admitted, there was a lot of work for a tiny man like yourself but some of it was too dangerous for your liking.<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you are interested I have an opening for my personal assistant, would you be interested?\u201d Lilyana\u2019s proposition was tempting, although you weren\u2019t exactly sure how much you could do to help her in her job.<br>\r\n\u201cI could always use more help in the kitchen at the restaurant as well little guy, you\u2019d be more than welcome there,\u201d Mariah piped up.<br>\r\nAvery seemed very excited at the prospect of you working with one of her parents, Morgan looked happy at them offering as well, but you did feel like you saw a slight bit of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you accept either of their offers?<br>\r\n1) You decide to become Lilyana\u2019s personal assistant.<br>\r\n2) You decide to go work at Sinclair Sandwiches.<br>\r\n3) You politely decline their offers, much to the two women\u2019s disappointment.</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s the passion of being a chef!\u201d She laughed heartily. \u201cYou and I are going to get along splendidly, aren\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint flash of rejection passed in Lilyana\u2019s icy blue eyes, but it was replaced quickly with affection towards her spouse. \u201cWell, I know that you\u2019ll be a perfect fit at my sweetheart\u2019s restaurant. They treat everyone like family there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah beamed proudly. \u201cThe Sinclair Sandwiches motto: scrumptious sandwiches and satisfied smiles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s head bobbled up and down energetically. \u201cOMG, this is way too cool! My new adorable roomie working at my mom\u2019s restaurant. I totes need you to whip up a special little burger for me sometime, once you\u2019re a master!\u201d The pink-haired girl winked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity, huh, Hunter?\u201d Morgan asked. \u201cYou can trust my mom to treat you well and pay you fairly. Plus, the three of us can drop by and visit often!\u201d She glanced at Quinn. \u201cEr\u2026not to impose, Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour apathetic roommate shook her head, the faintest smile playing at the corners of her lips. \u201cNo problem. I actually kinda like burgers\u2026I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah clapped her hands together. \u201cThen it\u2019s decided! You can start tomorrow, cutie! Don\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019ll fit right in!\u201d She leaned over you and extended her thumb as a sign of an unstated work relationship beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, it was a struggle for you to tear your gaze from the woman\u2019s abundant cleavage, which was on full display as she bent over you. Her chest was massive, approximately the size of Quinn\u2019s unbelievably bountiful breasts, and Mariah\u2019s low-cut blouse left little to the imagination. The abyss of her cleavage practically beckoned you, her skin looking heavenly smooth and soft. It wasn\u2019t hard to see where Avery and Morgan got their killer looks from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment, though, you tore your gaze away and grasped Mariah\u2019s entire thumb with your hands, shaking it up and down with a smile. Mariah laughed, her eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Sinclair Sandwiches staff, little man!\u201d She grinned pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening wasn\u2019t entirely uneventful, but that was to be expected in your hectic, accident-prone life. Lilyana stepped on you twice while walking back and forth between the living room and the kitchen, and Mariah plopped her shapely booty onto you because she\u2019d forgotten which seat you had taken, resulting in you spending nearly an hour squished under her thick derriere. Still, it could\u2019ve\u2019 been worse. Each woman apologized\u2026though you couldn\u2019t help but see a flash of something more in their eyes each time they discovered you and realized their blunder. They eventually left, with Mariah promising to swing by in the morning and pick you up for your first day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Morgan woke you up and fixed you breakfast, and afterwards you cleaned yourself up and changed into fresh clothes. Mariah arrived a few minutes later than she had stated, bustling inside with a energetic attitude and a giggly apology to Morgan for being late. In her haste, she spared no backwards look at the couch (which is where you were waiting for her to notice you), and instead began to sit down atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Sinclair, wait!\u201d You cried out, madly dashing to the side to avoid the meteoric impact of Mariah\u2019s hefty ass crashing onto the couch. Surprisingly, the curvaceous giantess actually heard you, but fate still screwed you over anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness, are you under me, little cutie?\u201d Mariah inquired aloud. Wanting to be cautious, the giantess woman shifted over a foot, and plopped down onto the other couch cushion instead. Of course, in your efforts to escape her falling butt, that\u2019s the exact same couch cushion you had attempted to escape to. Now, all you\u2019d done is slightly change the location of the inevitable, and you crumpled to paper under Mariah\u2019s plump booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it took Mariah only a few minutes to recognize what she\u2019d done, and she soon had you peeled off her buttcheek and reforming in her palm. \u201cSo sorry about that, cutie. I thought I moved out of your way, but I guess I moved INTO it, huh? Gosh, it must be hard for you tinies, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce reformed, you stood up and waved confidently to Mariah. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing, boss! I can handle it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah laughed, a twinkle in her eyes. \u201cIs that so? You\u2019re gonna be a little trooper, aren\u2019t you. That\u2019s so adorable!\u201d She titled her hand suddenly, catching you off guard, but you quickly realized she was simply depositing you into her purse. \u201cStay safe in there, hun, and I\u2019ll take you back out when we get to the restaurant. It isn\u2019t too far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting until you got comfortable, Mariah flashed you a wink, said goodbye to Morgan, and strolled out of the apartment. She set her purse down in the passenger\u2019s seat of her car and drove off to Sinclair Sandwiches. True to her word, the drive wasn\u2019t much longer than fifteen minutes or so, and Mariah spent the entire time singing, her melodious voice enthralling. It was genuinely a pretty soothing car ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the restaurant, Mariah began heading inside, and you took the opportunity to climb onto the edge of her purse and peer at the restaurant. From the outside, it wasn\u2019t much, but it did have that \u2018local family-owned business\u2019 feeling to it. Just looking at the building made you feel warm and fuzzy, and a bit nostalgic. You weren\u2019t a professional designer, but there was definitely something in the construction of the place that made you feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the restaurant was even better. Pastel colors and happy clouds and sunshine decorations lined the walls and the ceiling. The irresistible aroma of freshly cooked burgers wafted through the air. A few ceiling fans spun slowly, generating a cool breeze and pushing the burger scent all through the restaurant. Soft jazz music played from a few speakers. It was just so overwhelmingly friendly and homey of an atmosphere you couldn\u2019t help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in your dazed stupor, you didn\u2019t realize Mariah was sauntering so close to the counter as she walked briskly into the kitchen. Nor did you realize just how close to the lip of her purse you\u2019d climbed to get a better look. In the blink of an eye, Mariah lightly bumped her hip into the counter, let out a short gasp of surprise, and utterly failed to notice as your miniscule body flipped up and out of the purse and onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flopped and rolled to a stop, sitting up groggily and watching Mariah carry on further into the kitchen, towards a door in the back that was presumably a small office. You cursed your inattentiveness, as you were now effectively stuck her on the front counter until she came back for you, as it\u2019d take you nearly ten minutes to walk to her office on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026ew, gross.\u201d A voice behind you said, the tone cold and disgusted. Whipping your head around, you found yourself staring at the pronounced chest of a towering giantess. She was wearing a bright pink and cheery restaurant uniform that was maybe a size too small, as it hugged her noticeably large breasts quite tightly, and two of the blouse\u2019s front buttons were strained to the seam, revealing a bit of her cleavage underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes up to the girl\u2019s face, you saw a pretty, angular face framed by dark brown hair with a streak of blue, pale white skin, and angry hazel eyes. The girl\u2019s expression was one of utter disgust, her nose crinkled up and her lips pulled back in a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026hello! I\u2019m the new employee here! My name is Hunter, and\u2013\u201d You began your introduction, but a loud scoff from the girl cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, who let a tiny in here? Freakin\u2019 bugs.\u201d The girl rolled her eyes and raised her clenched fist above your body. \u201cSee you later, bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Wait! WAIT!\u201d You screamed, pathetically shielding yourself from the girl\u2019s sudden attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your savior came through. Mariah appeared suddenly, catching the girl\u2019s hand. \u201cWait, Phoebe! That isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s our new adorable employee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pulled her hand back from Mariah and frowned, eyeing you with contempt. \u201cYou seriously hired a tiny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah pouted. \u201cI know you find them a bit\u2026weird\u2026but try to like this one! He\u2019ll be a great addition to the team, I promise!\u201d<br>\r\nPhoebe brushed a strand of hair out of her eyes and glared at you. After a moment, cruel mischief danced in her eyes, and she smiled slightly. \u201cYeah\u2026maybe he will be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah, oblivious to Phoebe\u2019s intentions, clapped her hands excitedly. \u201cOh, this is amazing. You and I will have to teach this cutie everything we know about working here, and soon, he\u2019ll be a perfect employee!\u201d Mariah looked down at you and beamed. \u201cReady to get started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes from Phoebe, who was still smiling eerily at you, you nodded shakily. Uh\u2026yep! Let\u2019s do this!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mariah plucked you up between two fingers before depositing you in the palm of her other hand. <br>\r\n\u201cAlright, little cutie, let\u2019s show you around. Get you used to where you\u2019ll be working,\u201d she seemed excited to have you on board. The same could not be said for Phoebe, who was still giving you looks of disgust and also wanting to mess with you.<br>\r\nMariah briskly walked into the kitchen, where you could see several people were already busy getting everything ready for opening.<br>\r\n\u201cOk little guy, this is the kitchen. I think we\u2019ll start you off in here today, but we can get to that in a little bit. Say hi to your cute new coworker ladies,\u201d as she said this, the kitchen staff paused what they were doing to look at you and when they saw you they all waved. Some said hello, others remarked at how cute they found you. At least everyone back here seemed nice.<br>\r\nWith that she moved through a side door into a small room with a few couches, a coffee table, and a countertop with a microwave and a coffee pot. It looked well decorated and cozy.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the break room, I tried to make it as cozy as possible. I\u2019ll also see if I can get some stuff appropriate for your size on the counter top. Wouldn\u2019t want a cute little thing like yourself to have to share the couch with us big girls,\u201d she looked down at you with a warm expression. You appreciated the lengths she seemed to be going to to make your time working here easy. Although the way she seemed to fuss over you was a little embarrassing.<br>\r\nFinally Mariah walked through a door on the other side of the break room, leading into a small office space with two desks. You could see one of them, which was very disorganised and untidy, had a picture of Mariah and her family, pretty much giving away that this was her desk. The other was more organised, but was covered in various documents and invoices, however it was currently empty, it\u2019s occupant wasn\u2019t here yet.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Stefanie\u2019s, our accountant, and my office. I\u2019m not in here very much, paperwork\u2019s not really my thing. I prefer to be in the kitchen making delicious food!\u201d You could tell from the way that Mariah excitedly talked about her job that she loved it very much.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it\u2019ll take a few days for us to get you a uniform, we\u2019ve never had a little cutie like yourself before so we don\u2019t have any uniforms that\u2019ll fit you. For today I think the best thing is for you to be my adorable little assistant in the kitchen. We can maybe get you to do customer service another day, I\u2019m sure a little thing like yourself would be very popular with our customers but to start you off I think kitchen experience is better,\u201d you nodded as Mariah finished explaining things to you and she smiled warmly in return. <br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me boss,\u201d you replied with confidence. In truth however you were incredibly nervous. A kitchen could be a dangerous place for someone your size, but you didn\u2019t want to disappoint your new boss on the first day, or Morgan and Avery for that matter either, they seemed pretty excited for you to work with their mom.<br>\r\nWith the tour over with Mariah sets you down on her desk. You try not to move too far just in case she loses you amongst all the stuff on her desk. After setting you down she went to grab her apron and started to look for her hairnet but after a few minutes of looking she let out a frustrated sigh.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is my hairnet, I\u2019m sure I left it in this office before I left last night. What am I going to do, I can\u2019t cook with my hair down like this, I need to find something to hold my hair back,\u201d as she said this her eyes drifted to you with a pleading look that worried you. \u201cHey little guy, I need to ask you for a huge favour, I can\u2019t seem to find my hairnet, and I can\u2019t cook with my hair down like this. Would you be fine with me using you as a hair band for today, we can get to training you tomorrow?\u201d <br>\r\nAs you looked up at her warm, smiling face you struggled to find a reason to say no. Her low cut top displaying her abundant cleavage also distracted you from thinking of any reasons to say no.<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah sure, whatever you need, boss,\u201d you sheepishly smiled up to her, dreading this shift now that you were going to have to spend it as an object.<br>\r\n\u201cYay, oh thank you so much you little cutie. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without ya!\u201d Her relieved expression eased your apprehension about this situation, she wasn\u2019t doing this out of maliciousness, just that she needed help. Plus she was your boss so helping her out with this favour could only be a good thing, right?<br>\r\nAfter thanking you, Mariah quickly picked you up and began to stretch you out, before pulling her hair back into a bun and wrapping you around it, holding it in place.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks so much little guy, just hold out till the end of the shift and then I\u2019ll let you out ok?\u201d With that, Mariah quickly strode out into the kitchen.<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by fairly uneventfully, you served as Mariah\u2019s hair tie well while she prepared countless delicious meals, all the while she was happily humming a song when she wasn\u2019t communicating with her staff. Her hair smelled fruity from the shampoo she must have washed it with, although towards the end the smell of grease and burgers began to overtake it. Other than that it was kind of boring. Mariah acknowledged you every now and then, asking how you were doing before realising you couldn\u2019t talk in your stretched out form and giggling to herself for her silliness.<br>\r\nEventually the day came to an end and, after serving her last burger of the day, Mariah went back into her office and took off her apron and then you. She smiled down at you, easing your fear that she may have forgotten you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou did great little guy. Tomorrow I think we\u2019ll get you to do some stuff in the kitchen though, I don\u2019t think you signed up to be my hair tie, but if you ever feel like a career change you\u2019re pretty good at it,\u201d she laughed at her own joke. \u201cAnyway they\u2019ll be almost ready to close up shop, let\u2019s get out of here, little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Mariah drives you home and says she\u2019ll be back tomorrow to pick you up again at the same time.<br>\r\n2) Tomorrow is the day for giving the kitchen a deep clean before opening so you and Mariah will need to be in early, so she takes you home to spend the night with her and Lilyana.<br>\r\n3) She asks Phoebe to take you home as she has somewhere else to be. Will Phoebe take you home? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I guess since we're all sort of strangers, except for you two...\" You said, gesturing to Morgan and Avery. \"...we should probably each spend some time hanging out with each other and getting to know one another.\" You shrugged. \"If that doesn't sound too dumb or corny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery enthusiastically shook her head. \"No way, cutie! That sounds amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a slightly weary thumbs up, and inquired. \"Then how about you and I hang out the rest of the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds totes perfect, Hunter! Hop on!\" She said, slapping her open palm down onto the coffee table, nearly squishing you in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up onto Avery's outstretched hand, you caught sight of Morgan's somewhat reserved expression, as well as Quinn's trademark indifference. No doubt Morgan had a few reservations about you hanging out with her airheaded sister, but she smiled again a moment later. Standing up, Morgan offered her hand to Quinn, helping the black-haired giantess to her feet, and then the two girls strolled away into the kitchen, perhaps to talk for a bit while having a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with Avery, the pink-haired girl looked at you with adoring eyes. \"What'cha wanna do, Hunter? Like, any fun ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \"Well, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Awesome!\" Avery nearly squealed with delight, before sprinting out of her room and up the stairs. For a spilt second, you nearly flew out of her hand, before her palm closed tightly around you, dainty fingers crushing your painfully and flattening you up to your head. You honestly weren't sure if this was any better than flying away, and could only look up uselessly at Avery's sexy, beaming face, as she was holding you too tightly to move. Were you getting in too deep and too fast with her? Hopefully not. Eventually, she reached her bedroom on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery showed off her room, and it was right in the same ballpark as how you would've guessed. It was relatively organized, but filled to the brim with personal belongings. There were a large number of dressers and drawers for clothes, a sprawling make-up table, and even a full-size mannequin currently wearing a sparkly white dress. There was hardly any free space, and the whole room was colored in a wide assortment of rainbow hues, though mostly bright pinks, blues, and reds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the totes cute private quarters of Princess Avery!\" Avery declared dramatically, adopting a silly posh accent as she spoke. She finished with a flourishing spin, in which you finally slipped out of her grasp and fluttered down onto the corner of her bed, still slightly mushed. You sighed at the ditzyness of your new roommate, and began focusing on reforming, your limbs slowly inflating back to normal. As you reformed, you looked up at Avery finishing her twirl, only for the giantess to then back up towards you and begin to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in one day, an ass of meteoric proportions descending towards you from above, shadows falling over you. Though not comparable to Quinn's humongous derriere, Avery's was no less succulent nor threatening, most of the girl's tanned, curvy buttocks revealed because of her barely-there booty shorts. You only just had enough time to reform your arms and scramble away, crawling frantically as her booty plopped down onto the bed right where you had been. Even still, her bare thigh caught your right leg, pinning you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avery! Hey!\" You cried up at her, catching her attention. Glancing down at you, Avery blinked in surprise and then smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! How'd you end up there, cutie?\" Avery smirked, grabbing your upper body and yanking you out from under her thigh. She then held you in front of her beautiful face, leaving you to dangle as she kept smiling at you. Your legs reformed, and you wished she'd put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say so, she spoke first. \"So, like, what's the plan, man? Hee hee. We can do whatevs you want, Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to drop the issue of being dangled like a doll for the moment, you thought about her question. Apparently, you took too long for her mile-a-minute attitude, because she began rambling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, we could pull a prank on someone, that would be so funny!\" Avery smirked mischievously. \"I always pull pranks on Morgan, but now we've got Quinn to mess with! She seems like a totes tough nut to crack, so we need to be uber smart with her.\" Avery winked at you. \"But, you'll help out, right cutie? The pranks we could do with a squishy man like you...ooh!\" Avery looked absolutely ecstatic, and you didn't know whether to find that terrifying or endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Avery glanced over to her closet, and frowned. \"Ah man, totally forgot about my missing box.\" She looked at you sadly, like a pouting puppy dog, and explained. \"One of my boxes of clothes got lost. It had some of my favorite, comfy stuff in it. Like thongs, and bras, and bikinis, and skirts, and stuff. Just the best, most cute outfits. It'll suck to replace those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\" You said, and you sincerely meant it. Losing belongings was always a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smiled genuinely at that, perhaps the first smile that wasn't one of her giddy, energetic ones. A moment later though, and Avery began staring at you intently, her eyes focusing in on you to a degree that almost felt a bit scary. It was like she was analyzing you, and you could nearly make out the gears turning in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Avery's face broke into a huge, playful grin, and she blurted out her plans for spending the day with you.</span></div></div>",

The pink-haired giantess bounced enthusiastically on her bed, and you really, really wished she would put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to form a coherent thought despite all the shaking, you spoke up. \u201cW-well\u2026what kind of prank is it, Avery?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s Cheshire grin was irresistibly cute, while still possessing a disconcertingly mischievous hint to it. \u201cWe gotta prank Quinn, little dude! You\u2019re totes perfect for it, so I was kinda thinking of some funny stuff to do, and then it hit me!\u201d The bubbly giantess paused for a moment, and bit her lip tentatively. Looking at you with downcast eyes, she curled her sensual lips into a pout. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me\u2026right, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a twenty-one-year-old man with minimal experience with giantesses outside of your immediate family, you were putty in her hands. Almost dreamily, you nodded and smiled. \u201cS-sure thing, Avery. Anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s expression burst into joy, and she giggled happily. \u201cAw, thanks, cutie! Love ya so much!\u201d She exclaimed, then rushed you up towards her mouth before you could react. An attempt at crying out left you the instant Avery pressed you into her plush lips, embracing your entire body in an enveloping hug of pleasure. Rational thought left your mind as Avery\u2019s lips caressed your body, easily overtaking your one-inch form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was blissful, and far too short form your perspective, as Avery pulled you away after ten seconds of kissing, ending with a resounding \u2018smack\u2019 noise. You were coated in a bit of moisture from her lips, and practically panting for breath. Noting your obvious enjoyment of her kiss, Avery snickered playfully, a faint blush in her own cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, cutie! Your reward for being such an adorable lil\u2019 trooper!\u201d Avery explained. \u201cBut, enough of messing around. Pranks are serious business, right? We don\u2019t cut corners around here!\u201d Avery wagged her finger. \u201cThis could be a little uncomfy for ya, Hunter, but totes worth it in the end. I hope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout explaining herself further, Avery moved her palms together, angling you between them. Still riding the high of her kiss, you didn\u2019t process what was about to happen until it was too late. The ditzy giantess clapped her hands together, demolishing your tiny body and slamming you flatter than paper. By rubbing her palms in circles afterwards, Avery mashed your malleable body into a circular shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was racing into overtime now at this drastic change in your situation, but Avery wasn\u2019t done yet. Powerless to fight her now that you were crushed, you could only grimace and blush further as Avery smoothed you out into a perfect circle, then effortlessly tore your clothes off with a single swipe of her well-manicured fingernails. You were left stark naked in her hand, a fact that brought a grin to Avery\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for taking this for the team, Hunter.\u201d Avery smiled playfully, flicking her eyes across your body. \u201cOMG, you are a looker, huh? Gawd, so cute!\u201d She winked at you, and then reigned herself back in. \u201cAnyway\u2026time to sneak into Quinn\u2019s room. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019s still downstairs, so we can be all quiet like ninjas! Uber pretty ninjas!\u201d She giggled with a lilt, and then crept out of her room and down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Quinn\u2019s room was empty, allowing Avery to waltz in unobstructed. As she entered the room, carefully maneuvering around the mess of clothes and belongings strewn about, she made her way to a dresser by the wall. On top of the dresser, there was a black bra, pair of panties, t-shirt, and shorts lying out. Avery came to a stop in front of the bra, and the smile on her face sent shivers of fear down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkiedokie, Hunter! Here we are!\u201d Avery whispered excitedly. \u201cWhen we were moving in earlier, I totes saw Quinn set these clothes out all purposefully and stuff. It\u2019s gotta be what she\u2019s wearing tomorrow. SO! I\u2019m gonna stick you to her bra, where you can hide out or whatever, and then when she goes to put it on tomorrow, you can leap out and spook her! Or maybe tickle her! Or, or, or\u2026bite her, or something! Whatever you want, hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, lost in her own imagined enjoyment of your future shenanigans, didn\u2019t feel your frantic, panicked wiggles and squirms of terror. She merely moved her hand over the inside of the left cup of Quinn\u2019s bra, and then dropped you inside. Your body sank into the cup, sliding down to the very bottom of the curve, and coming to rest. The sides of the cup arched up all around you, creating a funnel of vision that just barely revealed Avery\u2019s radiant face out of the top. You were remained of just how utterly massive Quinn\u2019s chest was, which brought equal feelings of anxiety and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner-in-crime, however, frowned. \u201cUgh, wait. Your tone totally clashes with the bra. She\u2019ll she you right away. Plus, you look like you\u2019d slide around easily, not stick.\u201d Avery sighed, demonstrating surprising thoughtfulness. Unfortunately, that thoughtfulness continued, albeit down a dangerous path. \u201cGimme a sec, Hunter. Be back in a jiffy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery skipped away, leaving you all alone in Quinn\u2019s bra. Wanting no part in a prank this ill-conceived and intimate, you tried to reform. Alas, you made no progress by the time Avery returned. Helpless, you couldn\u2019t do a thing as she fished you out of the bra cup and laid you out on the dresser beside Quinn\u2019s delicates. In her hand was a small bottle of some sort of polish liquid, and in her other, a brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you need a touch-up, mister!\u201d Avery giggled, trying and failing to sound serious. With an adorable look of concentration on her face (complete with tongue sticking out), Avery dipped the brush into the bottle, and then proceeded to paint all over your tiny body, vigorously and thoroughly. The polish was chillingly cold, freezing your skin, but you couldn\u2019t do much to stop Avery now. Any opportunity of convincing her to stop this ridiculous prank was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, your entire body, crushed into a small circle as it was, was perfectly and uniformly colored black. Avery hadn\u2019t missed a spot, and had even found polish with the same exact black consistency as Quinn\u2019s bra. Side-by-side, you realized that you matched it entirely, and that realization genuinely made your blood run cold. Did Avery even realize the position she was about to put you in? Probably not, knowing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery picked you up, smiling happily at her good job, then replaced you into the bra cup. This time, she applied extra pressure herself, rubbing you down in place. Her fingers massaged your body into the fabric of the bra cup, until you felt yourself firmly sticking in place. Actually, it felt more like the sticky polish that had painted you black was adhering to the fabric of the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully (or perhaps not), Avery elaborated after she finished molding you into place. \u201cSo, this handy dandy polish stuff is totes super-sticky. Glues itself to pretty much anything. Now, you should be in no danger of slipping out or coming undone.\u201d Avery twirled a strand of her hair. \u201cActually, it could take some extreme measures to even get you out as well. Isn\u2019t that amazing? There\u2019s no way our prank can fail now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shattered at that last remark, as it fully dawned on you that Avery had just painted you to blend into a black bra perfectly, then essentially perma-glued you in place. With the polish already hardening, it sank in that you truly were now incapable of movement. On top of that, the polish coating sealed over your face, keeping you entirely flat and thus incapable of speech. How could you even prank Quinn, at this point? The only visible part of you was your miniscule, beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirheaded Avery was oblivious to this though, and all she did was blow you a kiss, sauntered out of the room, and turn of the lights, leaving you well and truly alone. For the first hour you tried to reform just out of desperation, but it was hopeless. Avery had done far too good a job painting you and ironing you into place. You were locked into this now, whether you wanted to or not. In fact, it\u2019d take help from Avery, or perhaps Quinn, to even get you loose now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed with nothing but silence to keep you company. Meanwhile, Avery spent the rest of the day chatting and hanging out with Morgan and Quinn. She made up a lie about you being tired and resting in her room to cover for your disappearance. Your new roommates bought it, and no one thought twice about you that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate in the night, the lights flicked on as Quinn strolled into the room. You weren\u2019t able to glimpse her, but you could hear her stripping out of her clothes, doing one last check of her phone, and then climbing into bed. The lights went out again, and after a while, you could faintly hear soft breathing. Quinn was asleep. Taking her cue, you gave up your fruitless fights and allowed yourself to slip off to slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awakened around eight o\u2019clock the next morning by the sound of Quinn moving around. The lights were on again, and after blinking to adjust your vision, you saw the utterly enrapturing sight of a topless Quinn standing beside her dresser. Thoughts of panic or unease fled your mind and were replaced by amazement and awe. Quinn\u2019s breasts were massive normally, but towering above you and fully nude, it was like gazing at a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, and Quinn angled herself to peer down at her bra. Miraculously, her eyes actually seemed to snap right onto your body, and a small frown crossed Quinn\u2019s face. At that moment, you suddenly realized that you weren\u2019t so sure you even wanted to be seen by her. How would she react? What would happen if she was annoyed? Or even angry?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your bubbly new roommate grinned, her angelic expression morphing into one of a bit of playful slyness. \u201cSay\u2026Hunter. You wouldn\u2019t mind doing a favor for me, wouldya cutie?\u201d Avery asked with a lilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hanging in the air between her fingers, you kind of felt like you didn\u2019t have much of a choice, but you still asked anyway. \u201cUm\u2026well it depends on what kind of favor, Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, still radiating mischief, but her lip cutely. Apparently even she was a tiny bit apprehensive of what she wanted to ask you. \u201cW-well\u2026basically I was thinking\u2026ya know?\u201d Avery hesitated, and sort of wiggled a little while seated, the dictionary definition of adorable anxiety. Though you were apprehensive of what this flirty, ditzy girl had planned, she was incredibly cute\u2026even if you could still picture yourself lying on the corner of her mattress, stuck under her while she was doing all this squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cListen, Avery. No need to be scared. I am willing to help if you\u2019ll just explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-haired giantess\u2019 cheeks actually flushed red. \u201cO-oh, I\u2019m not scared\u2026just\u2026\u201d She put her finger to her chin. \u201cYou tiny cuties are all squishy and stretchy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you saw that earlier today. When Quinn sat on me.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I mean\u2026like\u2026SUPER squishy and stretchy. Like, you can be molded and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small feeling of dread welled up inside of you, but you pushed on regardless. \u201cSure, yeah. It\u2019s kind of like our defensive mechanism. A tradeoff for being born like this.\u201d You admitted, even if you felt that being squishy and stretchy was often directly the cause of so much trauma and torment throughout your life. You refrained from telling this to Avery, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery perked up. \u201cAh! That\u2019s totes what I thought! So you\u2019d be willing to help me out with my favor then, right cutie?\u201d She leaned a little closer to you, winked flirtatiously, then exhaled. A cool, minty breath brushed past her luscious lips and over your tiny body, lightly blowing you in the wind. You momentarily lost all sense of self, the cool caress of Avery\u2019s breath tickling your body, her minty fresh scent overwhelmingly satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brief moment of lost composure, you nodded without even thinking. \u201cUh\u2026yeah, of course. I\u2019ll help you out, Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery lit up like the night sky twinkling with stars, grinning widely and blissfully. \u201cAw! Thank you so much! You\u2019re a lifesaver, Hunter!\u201d Without warning, she puckered her lips and leaned just an inch closer, but it was enough. No time to brace yourself, Avery\u2019s plush lips made contact with your body, your miniscule frame utterly dwarfed by their magnitude. Though the kiss only lasted a second, it enveloped your entire being in a warm and stimulating embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour affectionate new roommate pulled back with a satisfied smile on her face. You had to take a deep breath after the kiss, both to get your lungs refilled and to calm yourself down. You really didn\u2019t want Avery to take note of what was going on in your pants right now, lest her endless teasing and flirting never cease. You also wiped away a trail of moist saliva left behind on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuirking her mouth to the side, Avery\u2019s blush lit up again. \u201cYa know, I might be falling in love, Hunter. You\u2019re totes my new bestie, that\u2019s for sure!\u201d The giantess giggled, and her harmonious voice filled you with an overwhelming sensation of happiness. It was like her own love and joy was washing over into you. It became harder and harder to want to resist her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were snapped back to reality a second later, as Avery squeezed her palm tightly around your body, mashing you into a flat blob. It happened so quickly you didn\u2019t even process what had happened to you until the deed was done. One moment you were being held, teased, and kissed by your new gorgeous (if not airheaded) roommate, the next you were putty in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Avery in terror, your blood ran cold at the almost casual expression on her face, as if she didn\u2019t care what she had done to you. For a horrible moment, you thought Avery\u2019s nice and cute attitude was all an act, and her true colors were shining forth, but then you remembered that you\u2019d agreed to help with her favor. The favor she\u2019d requested right after asking you about your squish and stretchy nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to mentally scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware to your mute pleas, Avery began to methodically mold and squish your body, kneading you with her fingers. \u201cSo, basically, I gotta use your squishy and stretchiness, lil\u2019 guy! Ya know how I talked about my missing clothes? Some of those are super-duper important over the next few days, like, uber important. I totes can\u2019t buy new clothes this suddenly\u2026but I can absolutely ask my adorable new roommate to replace them! How awesome is that?\u201d Avery giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full weight of her favor dawned on you, and you fought with every fiber of your being to break free from Avery\u2019s grip, or at least get your frustration with her across. She was planning on molding you into clothing, and then wear you! She hadn\u2019t even hinted at this being her end goal from the start, and you felt lied to and cheated. You never would\u2019ve agreed to this otherwise. Sadly, Avery was much to thorough with squashing your malleable body, and your attempts to squirm were useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been molded into clothing only twice before in your life, and both times had been incredibly humiliating and painful experiences. Your younger sister, Tracy, had once gotten angry at you as a kid, and had squished you into a hairband. This was before she\u2019d matured in her attitude, and became the loving sister you cherished so dearly. She was a little demon for a few years in elementary school, and this was during that time. She wore you to keep her hair in a ponytail for a week before your mother caught wind and freed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time was at the hands of your mother, and was three times as bad. After being laid off from her job, she\u2019d come home at midnight from a night of drinking, and stumbled into your room mumbling about needing a new skirt. Drunk out of her mind, and giggling incessantly, your mother had grabbed you and stretched you to your limits, molding you into a simple but cute skirt, despite your protesting screams. Worse still, after collapsing into bed, your mom awoke the next morning with a raging hangover and no memories of the previous night. She\u2019d merely spotted her \"<i>new skirt</i>\", slipped it on, and went about her day. She wore you five times over a two-week period before finally realizing what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in no hurry to repeat these past traumas, but Avery was obviously oblivious to that as she kept working your body. Eventually, she hooked her perfectly manicured fingernails into your chest, and with a small flick of her wrist, tore your clothes right off. You were now fully naked in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, for the only time since you\u2019d met her, demonstrated surprisingly reasonable (if no less frustrating) logic when speaking up. \u201cSo, your totes naked now. If you\u2019re, like, wondering why, it\u2019s \u2018cuz clothes would give you away to anyone looking at you! I mean, I asked you to be MY clothes, so you don\u2019t need your own! Duh!\u201d She finished with another giggle before clapping her hands together, making your body a perfectly flat shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could convey to her how she had never once specifically asked you to be clothes for her, but it was far too late for that. Unless Morgan or Quinn walked in right now, saw what was going on, and stopped Avery, your fate was entirely in her gorgeous, scatterbrained hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the plan, Hunter. I have a few options for you, so that\u2019s fun! One: I totes need a new thong, and I have a feeling you\u2019ll be an uber soft and comfy replacement for my old one. Two: I\u2019ve been wanting a new skirt. One that shows off my pretty legs and kinda like flows a bit, ya know?\u201d She said all this while stroking your body. As soon as you heard the word \u2018<i>skirt</i>\u2019, your blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then third: I need a sock. And, you\u2019re probs like, what? A single sock? Yeah\u2026I totes ruined my other cute one by ripping it one a loose nail in my old house. Now I just have one little sock. Hee hee! I\u2019m such a klutz!\u201d Avery laughed, then lifted her foot above you and wriggled her toes. Her dainty, smooth foot smelled heavenly, but you had a horrible feeling it wouldn\u2019t be that way for extended periods of time. \u201cSo, yeah! Those are the options!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the ditz she had proven to be, the pink-haired giantess waited a minute, presumably for you to pick your option. It was only after your total inability to talk registered with the girl that she slapped her head and smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you can\u2019t talk, huh? That\u2019s funny! Guess I\u2019ll pick for you!\u201d Avery wistfully tilted her head back and forth in an exaggerated show of thinking. You could only keep trembling with fear in her hand, your fate left fully to her. This favor had spiraled way out of control. Avery spoke up again. \u201cAnd, don\u2019t worry, lil\u2019 cutie. This\u2019ll only be for a few days, maybe a week at most. Then I can go shopping again. Also, this\u2019ll be the last time I talk to you until the favor is done! Can\u2019t be chattin\u2019 up my clothes, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flirty, horribly tone-deaf wink, and a last wave of horror hitting you, Avery reached a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I'll make you into a thong. I figure that one should be the most fun for you.\" Avery said, giving you an exaggerated wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed internally at what you had just heard. You wanted to scream out loud, but Avery's squeezing hands had smushed your mouth away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's try this out...\" Avery's fingers jumped into action, gripping and tugging on your squishy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a tiny person, you'd been stretched countless times, but it never got any easier. Your body desperately wanted to snap back into its natural form, but Avery's fingers easily overpowered your natural elasticity. It was hard to identify individual body parts at this point, but you felt your \"arms\" tugged in either direction, stretched wide like you were going to be hugging someone. Avery tied them together at the ends, ensuring the only thing you'd be hugging was her hips. Your legs came next, dragged down and then up to the arm knot, where they were tied as well. From there, the shape was mostly right, and Avery just went about final adjustments, ensuring you were the right size and smoothing out any bumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada!\" Avery said, presenting your now thongified form to the mirror. As your disorientation from being molded cleared, you got a good look at your new form. You were nearly completely indistinguishable from a real thong. The only giveaway was that your eyes were faintly visible in the spot where what was left of your face had ended up. Your panic only increased when you realized that that spot was right in the middle of the back of the thong, ensuring your face would be buried between her butt cheeks. This fact wasn't lost on Avery either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're going to have a lot of booty in your future. Lucky you.\" Avery said with a giggle, bringing you down towards her feet. She couldn't wait any longer to put you on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as Avery's giant foot swung over you, reflexively terrified by the sight of giant soles after a life as a tiny man. But when her feet slipped through your holes, your priorities shifted to a much more pressing threat: Avery's gigantic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a good look Hunter. This booty is your responsibility now. I hope you can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made one last attempt to scream, but your mouth was still squished. There was no way for you to communicate with Avery as she pulled you upwards, rushing you towards her looming butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision with her cheeks forced your body even thinner to squeeze in between them. The smooth butt flesh rubbed against your face as you were dragged deeper into the abyss of her crack. When she stopped pulling you up, you were in complete darkness. There was nothing butt walls of butt cheek in every direction as they molded around your new thong form. Meanwhile, you could feel a light tickle on your legs as she adjusted the front of the thong, dragging them against the short field of hair up front. Your only consolation was that she hadn't pulled you up any further. The last thing you needed was to be pushed up against your new roommate's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, I was right, you make a super comfy thong Hunter.\" Avery said, completely unaware of how unpleasant this was for you. She looked at her ass in her mirror, eyes tracing along the thong as it disappeared between her butt cheeks. \"Cute too. Too bad no one will be able to see you under my clothes. Maybe when we get a beach day in I'll make you into a bikini bottom and show you off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Avery was already falling in love with your new thong form. Would she even turn you back? You'd decided she was a nice girl when you'd met her, but in truth you barely knew her. For all you knew, she could decide she'd rather have a pair of living underwear than a tiny roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl continued to prattle on: \"And I definitely can't tell Quinn and Morgan about this. If they knew how comfortable you were they'd probably want to wear you too, and then you'd never get a break. Plus, their butts aren't as cute as mine.\" Avery decided to emphasize this point by smacking her ass, causing her cheeks to collide as they reverberated from the impact. Your mouth had reformed enough to scream at this point, but there was nowhere for your screams to go. They just echoed around between Avery's butt cheeks, trapped in the abyss with you. \"Anyway, I'm sure this week before my new clothes arrive is going to fly by for both of us. And I can already tell you that even after my new thongs arrive, I'd be happy to wear you again if you get nostalgic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved at least to hear that Avery still planned to turn you back at the end of the week. But the fact that she thought you might just want to be her thong again for fun showed that she had no idea what you were going through in her butt, which did not bode well for the upcoming week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to stop talking to you now Hunter, it's time for me to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Go out dancing! (Avery is going out dancing with Morgan, maybe they convince Quinn to come as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Go to my exercise class with Morgan! (Spin class or Barre class, I don't want to do yoga since that comes up in Morgan's gym route)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Writer's Choice<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can ask Quinn to come too! That\u2019d be totes awesome! The three of us\u2026and you, Hunter.\u201d Avery giggled, stroking your taut limbs hugging her hips. \u201cFor real though, last time talking to you, Hunter. See you in a week\u2026or so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word this time, Avery immediately stopped mentioning you, and went about digging out an appropriately sexy outfit from her closet and drawers to wear to the night club. Her slightest shifts in movement caused you immeasurable discomfort, but it was slowly dawning on you that, unless a miracle saved you, your week of suffering with Avery was only going to get significantly worse from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ditzy girl eventually settled on a risqu\u00e9 pink miniskirt and matching halter top that showed off most of her lean stomach. She took another minute to touch up her make-up before dashing out of her room, practically skipping downstairs. You mentally groaned as her thick ass cheeks chewed up your malleable body, each step causing her booty to jiggle and squeeze into your elongated form. This was hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling into the living room, Avery found Morgan and Quinn, and she struck a dramatic pose and winked. \u201cWho's gonna hit up the club with me? Huh?\u201d She asked, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked her twin in the eye for a second before sighing. \u201cOh, I totally forgot about that. You really want to do that tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery nodded happily. \u201cUh huh. It\u2019ll be kinda like a celebration for moving in. It\u2019ll totes be fun, too! Hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rolled her eyes, but stood up from the couch and stretched. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go. IF ONLY to stay sober and drive your sorry butt home when you get plastered. You drink way too much when we got out to clubs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery gave her sister a mischievous smirk, and didn\u2019t dispute her statement. She merely turned to Quinn and winked. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to come with, Quinn. Have some fun dancing and drinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the mild surprise of the twins, Quinn nodded and also stood. \u201cSure, whatever. Sounds nice, I guess.\u201d She said, and with that being her only explanation, she walked away and up to her room. Morgan followed, and the two girls took about fifteen minutes to get ready. Avery passed the time by looking at her phone and pacing, her constant movement grinding her thick butt cheeks mercilessly against your body. You begged for her to stop, but your silent mental pleas obviously didn\u2019t reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Quinn returned, dressed for a night out. Morgan had changed into a simple but attractive red dress, and seemed to be slightly anxious about wearing one, as it wasn\u2019t too typical of her. On the subject of typical, Quinn had slipped into a black blouse and black skinny jeans. The simplicity of the outfit really fit her, as did the literal FIT of the clothes. Even Avery was ever-so-slightly taken aback by how snuggly Quinn\u2019s jeans hugged her shapely rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA possible flirtatious remark died on Avery\u2019s lips when Morgan cut her off. \u201cHunter is with you, right?\u201d She inquired, while beginning to walk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery paled, but recovered quickly. \u201cUh\u2026no. No. He\u2019s upstairs. Didn\u2019t think a night club would be too safe, and he was really tired. Looked super cute all snuggled up on my bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, approaching her car and not looking back at her twin, shrugged. \u201cAw, that\u2019s a shame. Oh well. Don\u2019t forget him when we get back.\u201d Just like that, Morgan dropped the issue. Had she seen the overtly conspicuous look on Avery\u2019s face, she\u2019d be more concerned, but she hadn\u2019t. As such, she had no reason to not trust her sister\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn gave Avery a look with a raised eyebrow, but said nothing. The three roommates piled into Morgan\u2019s car and were off to the night club. You hadn\u2019t heard a word of any conversation while trapped deep in Avery\u2019s sweltering ass, as most sounds were muffled. However, it didn\u2019t take a genius to guess your surroundings as Avery plopped into the passenger\u2019s seat, her bubble butt compressing as she wiggled to get comfortable. Any spare space you had was gone in an instant, your entire being enveloped in slick ass flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was not more than fifteen minutes, but it practically felt like an eternity to you. The faintest bump in the road caused crazy vibrations in Avery\u2019s doughy buttocks, which of course reverberated right back onto you. Not only was the tightness of your confines painful, the strain on your tiny limbs hugging Avery\u2019s wide hips tiring, and the ever-growing sweat and stench overwhelming, but this entire scenario was humiliating beyond belief. You were furious at Avery for using you like her own personal object, while at the same time acknowledging that she really was just an airheaded girl who didn\u2019t know how horribly she was truly treating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the night club, the three girls hurried inside, and found the club to be packed to the brim with inebriated partiers and over-worked security guards. Avery, utilizing her rather lucrative salary as a model, purchased tickets with ease, and your giantess roommates eventually wormed their way through the crowd and found an empty booth to sit at and take stock of their bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark in the club, and the music was blaring loud and the lights were pulsing constantly. Even inside of Avery\u2019s butt, you could still hear the pounding of the dance music bass. Admittedly though, it was hard to focus on the music, as the more pressing issue was the heat. Inside the packed night club, the temperature had risen substantially, and this was reflected by copious amounts of sweat beginning to roll off Avery\u2019s buttocks and soaked your body. An unpleasant stench also built in intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to all of this, Avery waved to her sister and new friend, and then skipped off on her own, eventually finding her way to the bar. Throwing down some cash granted Avery a succulent alcoholic beverage which she drained in seconds, followed instantly by a refill. Avery was as lightweight as they came, and already feeling the effects of her sobriety flying out the window, Avery giggled and stumbled onto the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy chance, the club had just begun to blare one of Avery\u2019s favorite songs. A dopey grin spreading on her beautiful face, Avery let loose an excited squeal that rang as a chorus with all of the other partiers. She then began to unleash herself on the dance floor, joining the rest of the club\u2019s patrons in jumping around, spinning in circles, and twerking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Avery rocketed into motion, your night became twice as horrible. The miniskirt she was wearing was sexy as hell, but hardly tight on the same level as Quinn\u2019s jeans. Because of this, Avery\u2019s might derriere swung side-to-side with her movements, jiggling and swaying like she did. Her butt cheeks clapped and slammed together in time with the music, crunching up your thong-shaped body and mashing you painfully, over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Avery\u2019s miniskirt had ridden up a bit, leaving a fair bit of her gorgeously eye-catching booty out for all to see (and it did draw quite a few eyes). Still, Avery was too far gone to care, and she merely laughed gleefully as she continued dancing. With each movement, your body was drawn up more and more into the embrace of her buttcheeks, sweat, stench, and darkness becoming your entire world. Your visual human features were also beginning to fade due to the constant smearing and smashing of your battered, bruised form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Avery stumbled in a haze back to the bar and chugged another alcoholic drink. She felt as light as a feather, and happier than she\u2019d been in weeks. Dreamily, she sighed, wishing that her adorable new roommate had come along to the club instead of staying at the apartment (because yes, of course airheaded, scatterbrained Avery had already forgotten what she\u2019d done to you because of her inebriation, believing her own made-up excuse for you instead of remembering the truth).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Avery figured she could just find someone else to flirt with, or else dance until she dropped from exhaustion. Requesting a fourth drink, Avery absentmindedly scratched at her butt, and hiked her thong up just a bit more. It was slick with seat, but still comfy and supportive. Of course, Avery had no clue in the world that adjusting her underwear so casually only truly succeeded in mashing your face up into her asshole, wedging you in the darkest, deepest part of her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her drink, Avery grinned lazily. This was such a great night!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avery tilted her glass upside down as she took down the drink in one go. Savoring the sweet flavor of the cocktail, she took an extra beat before lowering the glass from her face. When she did she saw the familiar faces of Morgan and Quinn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyy guys! This place is awesome, right!?\u201d Avery exclaimed, throwing an arm around the neck of both her sister and her new friend. \u201cI love the music and lights, it\u2019s sooooo much fun in here! I wish Hunter could be with us though it would be so cute to dance with the little guy! But a place like this probably wouldn\u2019t be safe for him.\u201d Avery drunkenly lamented not having you with her, having completely forgotten that you were practically vacuumed between her ass cheeks at that very moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grimaced upon hearing Avery speak. She could tell that her sister wasn\u2019t quite trashed enough to be slurring her speech, but clearly Avery was fairly intoxicated based on how loudly she was talking and how much she was leaning on both Quinn and herself. Knowing that a lecture about trying to remain somewhat sober was futile at this point, Morgan simply chuckled at her sister\u2019s chaotic nature before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, we\u2019ve been trying to find you to tell you that Hunter could have come with us! This is a mixed club designed specially for both tinies and regular sized girls!\u201d Morgan said and Avery opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh shit, really!? I haven\u2019t been paying any attention!\u201d Avery said while lifting her left pump and turning her foot so she could see the sole. Avery was a carefree girl without a doubt, but she still felt remorse as she expected to see the squished bodies of a number of tiny guys underneath her shoe. To her surprise she didn\u2019t see a single one! And as she shifted her weight, now leaning onto Quinn to check the sole of her other shoe, Morgan spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you airhead, they aren\u2019t just walking around on the ground. In what world would they just force the little dudes to dance around the feet of clueless drunk girls like you, huh?\u201d Morgan poked fun at her twin. \u201cThey have elevated dance floors that sit a few feet off of the ground and these cool tubes that the guys can walk through to get in between them! They\u2019re kind of like hamster tubes\u2026 not that I\u2019m saying men are like pets or anything! That\u2019s just what the tubes reminded me of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery took no notice of her sister putting her foot in her mouth at the end, being far too enthralled by the stuff she said before. She finally unlatched her arms from Quinn and Morgan, standing up on her own two feet before scanning the room. She looked closer at what she previously thought were little waist height bar tables, and saw tons of guys dancing on them! Thinking back for a second she definitely remembered dropping off an empty glass of hers on one of those \u201ctables\u201d earlier and hoped that not too many guys were hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ask me I think jumping through all these hoops for tiny guys is kind of lame.\u201d Quinn piped up, slightly more emphatically than she normally talked. Both Morgan and Avery turned to look at the typically apathetic girl as she actually seemed to take a stand on something. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough world for guys nowadays, and don\u2019t get me wrong I wouldn\u2019t wish for anything bad to happen to them, but if they get used to getting special treatment like this\u201d she said while gesturing towards the elevated dance floors, \u201cthen they might not be tough enough to stay safe when have to actually fend for themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked understandingly at her new roommate. Quinn seemed standoffish at first glance, but she could tell that behind that exterior was a caring person at the end of the day. Even if her direct interactions with tiny guys seemed a bit cold and unhelpful at times, they seemed to come from a good place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery on the other hand, had completely zoned out half way through Quinn\u2019s dialogue. Her eyes were locked firmly on the closest table of guys, sparkling with anticipation about the fun she could have with them. If she was flirtatious when she was sober, she basically turned into a wrecking ball of flaunted sexuality when she was drunk. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a closer look!\u201d She exclaimed before skipping off in the direction of the guys. Avery bumped into a number of girls on her way, hardly realizing how clumsily she was moving. Luckily for her nobody took issue with her jostled movements, assuming (correctly) that she was too drunk to know any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reality, meanwhile, was pretty much the same as it had been since the moment that Avery slid your incredibly stretched out body between her jiggly cheeks. The only unfortunate way you could tell the passage of time was by the ever increasing amount of sweat cascading down her crack and being easily soaked up by you. You could only hear the thumping bass line of the night club\u2019s music, or more specifically feel it as it reverberated through Avery\u2019s soft flesh around you. At this point you wished that you could just detach your arms from your legs and come apart just to escape this situation, but the strong knots that connected your limbs as well as the pressure of her cheeks being smashed together by her tight skirt prevented any sort of agency on your part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven considering this possibility made you feel a twinge of guilt, however, knowing that you would feel bad leaving Avery commando when she specifically needed underwear. Catching yourself thinking this, you mentally slapped yourself back to reality. By no means did you want to act as her underwear, but your naturally empathetic and caring nature quite often led you to being forced into situations such as these. Sometimes you wished you could just put your foot down and stand up for yourself, but as a single step taken by Avery mashed your entire body between her cheeks, you reconsidered acting so bold when you had so little power due to your stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, that step that Avery took was the first step in a beeline straight towards the nearest elevated platform for tiny guys. She walked away from Quinn and Morgan without a word, leaving Morgan rolling her eyes at how airheaded her twin could be. Morgan was torn between looking after her clearly hammered sister and hanging out with her new friend, ultimately deciding to stay with Quinn and watch over Avery from afar. Unfortunately, leaving this ditzy bombshell unsupervised was quite the risky choice, as after a moment Avery reached the platform of guys and bent over to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyyy guys, you\u2019ve got quite a nice view from down there huh?\u201d Avery said flirtatiously. \u201cYou guys won\u2019t mind if I dance around you, right?\u201d she concluded before standing back up to her full height. The height of the table left the \u201cdance floor\u201d sitting right below the cheeks of Avery\u2019s moderately tall 5\u20198\u201d frame. As she turned around there wasn\u2019t a single guy who could take his eyes off of the large beauty. Half of them out of attraction to the bubbly goddess, and half out of pure fear upon seeing her round buttocks, having slowly but surely been sliding out of the bottom of her too-small pink miniskirt over the course of the night. She backed up a step more, the backs of her thick thighs now touching the edge of the platform as her bubble butt blocked out half of the light from the ceiling. Without realizing it, even the slightest amount of weight that Avery\u2019s drunken body was putting on the platform had crushed the makeshift railing that ran along the edge, and sent a few guys jumping towards the center for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn on the other hand was slowly sipping her drink while observing the rest of the night club. She didn\u2019t outwardly show it, but she honestly was having fun. As she scanned the club, she slowly took a few steps to the side and found what she assumed to be a railing to rest on behind her. Lifting her butt slightly she leaned most of her weight onto the it, she relaxed and continued to sip her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the comically curvaceous girl, tiny guys were running to each end in absolute fear as their passage tube threatened to collapse at any moment. Two planet sized ass cheeks clad in skin tight black denim caved the top half of the tube inward, threatening to shatter the entire structure without anyone (normal-sized, that is) even noticing a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, unfortunately, noticed both conundrums at the same time. First seeing her twin sister clumsily shaking her ass above a mob of tiny at-risk guys sent her into crisis aversion mode. But as she looked back towards Quinn to ask for help in dealing with Avery, she noticed as well the bent passageway that Quinn\u2019s massive ass was threatening to utterly demolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, you were once more cast into a jiggly hell. Avery\u2019s sloppy dance moves were shaking her ass more and more, causing her skirt to ride up until essentially her entire bare butt was visible for all to see. The guys beneath her demonstrated a combined feeling of attraction and utter terror, something you were quite familiar with, knowing that one clumsy movement could lead to the crushing of dozens of them. Meanwhile, those near Quinn were in equally dire circumstances. Some tried to funnel into the tube off of the platform, but they could see the titanic body of Quinn causing their only escape path to crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one and only silver lining to this hellish situation was that with Avery\u2019s whole ass on display for the world, people could clearly see the minuscule tan thong that was struggling to contain the woman\u2019s fantastic curves. Since the approval of Baker\u2019s law and increased usage of guys like you as articles of clothing, tiny men often felt a brotherly obligation to pay attention to the clothing that regular sized women were wearing just in case someone was being used against their will. More often than not the other tiny dude couldn\u2019t do a thing about it, but at the very least they could alert someone with more authority to do so. You could only pray that this would happen to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Morgan and I signed up for a spin class today, so it looks like you're coming with us!\" Avery announced. She was thrilled that she had such a comfy pair of panties for what would no doubt be a butt focused workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMPHHHHH! MMMMHHH!\" You tried to cry out as you heard Avery's suggestion, but your mouth was too squished to form words. Though it's not like anyone would be able to hear you from here anyway. Your tiny lungs couldn't create a sound loud enough to escape the black hole of Avery's gigantic rump. Unless Morgan or Quinn stopped her, it sounded like you were about to be a pair of workout panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of your mounting unhappiness, Avery pulled out a pair of black Lululemon leggings and stepped into them. All of Avery's clothes were either right or revealing, unfortunately for you exercise necessitated she go with tight. The leggings slid up her legs without too much difficulty, but the shelf of her ass proved a bit of a barrier. She had to hop up and down a few times to pull the leggings up over her butt. Every time she did, you were smacked in the face by the clap of her bouncing cheeks. Finally, she managed to pull them up, sealing you in her ass with the tight black fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so lucky that we met you today, otherwise I'd have to wear some regular panties and I'd totally have panty lines. But I can't see your outline at all!\" Avery continued, inspecting her butt in the mirror. And it was no wonder that she couldn't see you, you were completely buried between her ass cheeks. \"Anyway, I'm gonna finish getting ready. I'll have to stop talking to you until I take you off later. Thanks again for volunteering to be my thong! Oh, and try not to ride up too much. The exercise bike always gives me a wedgie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked in the darkness of her butt at her latest revelation, wondering what it was going to be like to experience a wedgie from the underwear's perspective. What did she expect you to do? No matter how much you wished you could, you couldn't prevent yourself from doing anything. For all intents and purposes, you might as well have been a regular thing, albeit an extremely comfy one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Avery pulled on a tank top and slipped into her sneakers, finishing her workout outfit. Barely even thinking about something as inconsequential as her panties, she headed downstairs to meet Morgan. You were battered by her butt cheeks as ran down the stairs, butt bouncing along behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Morgan asked. She was already standing by the front door. Not having to make herself a new thong had saved her some time getting ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Avery replied enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Hunter? Did you make him comfy in your room?\" Morgan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery laughed. \"Oh he's super comfy, don't worry about that.\" At least, he was comfortable for her as a thong. She didn't know what it felt like to be squeezed between her ass cheeks, but considering how sexy her ass was, she imagined Hunter was doing ok back there. He wouldn't have volunteered to help her out if he couldn't handle her booty, right? She walked out to the car chatting with Morgan, and once again Hunter slipped from her mind. He really felt just like panties, which were something she didn't think about as she went about her day. Only when she sat down in the car did she remember him again. When her ass hit the seat, she felt her thong ride up a bit. She sighed. She'd hoped that with Hunter serving as her panties, she wouldn't have to worry about that. Then again, it was his first day on the job. He was probably just still learning how to do his job right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, all Hunter was learning was how much petite little Avery actually weighed when she sat down. Her butt cheeks flattened under the weight of her body, squeezing him upward and inwards, forcing him deeper into her crack. His arms strained as they stretched tighter around her hips, still squeezing her in a forced hug. His struggle went unnoticed though. Above, he could hear the inane conversations between the sisters, unaware of the torment he was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the gym, Avery practically skipped into the locker room, loving the comfort she was getting from her roommate turned panties. The difference between him and regular fabric was night and day, and she knew it would be a big improvement when she got on a bike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when are you excited for a spin class?\" Morgan asked, confused by her sister's pep. Avery wasn't someone who liked to sweat, and would have stuck to yoga if that was enough to keep her body in modeling shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery turned to her sister and smiled before replying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"Well, I have Hunter helping me out today. He makes a super comfy thong.\" (Avery mentions you without even thinking about it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"I just have a lot of energy today!\" (Avery keeps your presence a secret)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

Doesn\u2019t bother me, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a somewhat surprised thumbs up, and inquired. \u201cThen how about you and I hang out the rest of the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, whatever you want.\u201d Quinn replied, placing her palm on the coffee table and motioning for you to climb on. \u201cNormally I\u2019d tell you to carry yourself, but this\u2019ll be quicker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you contemplated Quinn\u2019s still slightly puzzling way of treating you and climbed onto her outstretched hand, you caught sight of Avery\u2019s briefly sullen expression, as well as a subdued frown on Morgan\u2019s face. No doubt Avery had been wanting to spend all day with you, and Morgan was still a bit apprehensive of Quinn\u2019s treatment of you. Still, a moment later, and Avery cheered back up as she began to engage her twin sister in conversation, discussing trips to the beach and the mall that everyone could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone (more-or-less) with Quinn, the black-haired girl stared at you inquisitively. \u201cSo, what specifically did you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \u201cWell, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah, sure.\u201d Quinn answered, surprisingly seeming to wince a bit at your question. Still, she stood up and walked at a steady pace out of the room and upstairs. You nearly jostled off of her palm, and had to grip her thumb to keep steady. However, as soon as you balanced yourself out, you found the short trip quite enjoyable. It made you wonder if Quinn knew she was walking at exactly the right speed to keep you safe, after briefly forcing you to steady yourself. It wasn\u2019t long before the two of you reached her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's room was not at all like you expected, and it really caught you off guard. You anticipated the fact that everything would be mostly colored in black, gray, and purple colors, but what you didn't expect was for it to be so messy. She had plain style bed, dressers, and closet, but the floor of her room was covered with clothes strewn all about. Barely a trace of the carpet could be seen with how cluttered the room was. You'd be hard pressed to believe she had only just moved in hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting you down on the corner of her bed, Quinn put her hands on her hips. \"Yeah, it's a mess, I know. I have a hard time...feeling like I need to tidy up. Still, it's comfy, I guess.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026it probably makes me come off as uncaring. It just doesn\u2019t bother me, usually. I mean, I know where everything is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around her room, taking in the sight of everything looking so messy. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unique style.\u201d You admitted with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean? You DO think I\u2019m lazy, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up your hands, defensively. \u201cNo, no! I didn\u2019t say that! Who am I to judge what your room looks like? My own room fits entirely in a single duffel bag.\u201d You smiled, sheepishly. \u201cI think it\u2019s just fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn paused for a second, then granted you the smallest sliver of a smile. \u201c\u2026thanks.\u201d After that, she turned behind her to pull over a spare chair to sit on. Though you tried to fight it, your eyes were drawn inexorably right to her prodigious backside as she presented it to you. Her ass was unfathomably huge, larger than almost any you\u2019d seen before (granted, your exposure to females was limited mostly to close family). The way were perfectly sculpted derriere pulled tight against her leggings was worthy of worship, even if that same booty had demolished you pretty thoroughly all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished grabbing her chair, Quinn sank down into it, then looked at you thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, you remind me so much of Caleb.\u201d She mused, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou titled your head in confusion. \u201cCaleb? Who\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of my best friends growing up. He was a tiny, just like you. We were inseparable.\u201d She had a distant expression on her face. \u201cIt was crazy how much he looked out for me. Really dependable guy, considering he had to struggle with\u2026everything you tinies go through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say \u2018were\u2019? What happened?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn blinked in surprise. \u201cO-oh, nothing. He just moved away with his family five years ago.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat was the last time I ever saw him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, sympathetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d You said, earning yourself another barely perceptible smile from the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you felt that perhaps you were understanding Quinn just a little bit better. If you reminded her so much of her old tiny friend, you had to wonder if Quinn\u2019s way of treating you came from years of close friendship with tinies. Perhaps she was trying to toughen you up, make you stronger and more dependable by treating you a bit indifferently earlier. Some form of \u2018tough love\u2019?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, there was a lull in the conversation, and you found Quinn looking at you almost expectantly. Realizing that she was waiting for you to suggest something to do, you quickly wracked your brain for any ideas.</span></div></div>",

Hope you don't mind. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could not think of something to continue the conversation to save your life. You just couldn't keep your eyes off Quinn. \"Sigh. I was actually enjoying that conversation, but it's clear you have something else on your mind now. Makes no difference to me.\u201d Quinn said, falling back on to her bed. \" I'm gonna take a nap\", she turned to look you straight in the eyes,  \"DON'T wake me up, and DON'T go perving about, got it <b>Roomie</b>?\" You gulp audibly and nod your head vigorously to get the point across. You're still sore over that little accident earlier, you'd hate her to have a reason to make your new life here difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now you just felt bad. She was just starting to open up a little, and of course you somehow managed to mess it up. By some form of word association, your attention turned to the rest of the room. There was hardly a square inch of space not covered with some article of clothing or other personal belonging. Then a thought hit you, organize the room to apologize and show good will. Your sister used to be a similar situation. Just like Quinn she wasn't lazy, just didn't mind the mess and didn't have a set system. If you could help your sister, you could surely handle this. Just don't touch any unmentionables. Easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For nearly 3 hours you were at it, dragging items back and forth across the room.  You could honestly say you had never worked so hard in your life or that you had really outdone yourself considering how much stuff you moved around, across carpet no less. Now three boxes, ones you tilted on their sides and pulled the now folded clothes into, sat practically full, while things like magazines were stacked against the wall. Surprisingly, Quinn stayed asleep the whole time. All that was left was the closet. You shimmied through the half open door and wonder in. There are a few posters that apparently were never put up, few books, a face down red lifeguard swimsuit that had the writing, \"Sanderson Beach\" which had to have been from a few years ago given it's a bit on the smaller side. You noticed something poking out from under the swimsuit. It was long, thin, about as wide as you, and a deep shade of purple. You pull it out with enough force that when it comes undone, you're flung against the door. You open your eyes and go beet red. It's an amethyst thong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here!\" You thought aloud, but a moment too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing with those, PERV?!\" Quinn shouted. Uh oh. She was awake.</span></div></div>",

As she lifted you up past each part of her monolithic form you couldn\u2019t help but admire how hot she was. You chastised yourself, her thinking you were a perv was exactly why she was so angry with you, proving her right would not help you in the slightest. <br>\r\nAs you were brought up to her eye level you could see that her expression had changed from her usual apathy to cold rage.<br>\r\n\u201cCare to explain yourself Hunter,\u201d her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I was just cleaning up a bit in here, trying to be helpful,\u201d the words you stammered out in fear of your giant roommate were the truth , although the way you said them was not convincing in the slightest if the lack of change in Quinn\u2019s expression was anything to go by.<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, so of all the things in my room you could have thought to \u201chelp\u201d me by tidying up, you chose to go rooting around my underwear. Yeah sure Hunter, totally believe you,\u201d she seemed to be getting angrier as the conversation went on. \u201cYou know Hunter, you seemed like a pretty nice guy earlier, and I was starting to think we could be good friends, but now it just seems like you\u2019re a little perv and a liar, and I hate both of those things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to walk towards the door, roughly opening it. And tossing you outside of her room, the impact with the floor flattening you. <br>\r\n\u201cStay out of my way for the rest of the day, because if your pervy ass gets in my way and I step on you I won\u2019t just not acknowledge you, I\u2019ll actively make your life hell,\u201d and with that she slammed the door closed. You figured you would need to figure out a way of making up with Quinn, but it was probably better to leave it a day or so. Best to just focus on reforming for now.<br>\r\nYou focused your efforts on reforming you quickly managed to make some progress, reforming your arms and torso within a few minutes. However as you were doing this you became aware of the thudding approach of footsteps.<br>\r\nYou looked up just in time to see Avery practically skipping along the hall towards you, not looking down at the floor as she was under the impression you were safe with Quinn. You couldn\u2019t even let out a scream, since your mouth hadn\u2019t reformed yet, as her foot steamrolled you without her even noticing you. Thankfully you didn\u2019t stick to her foot as it lifted off of you, you remained stuck to the floor. Not only was all of your work reforming undone, but you were crushed even worse than before. <br>\r\nYou once again focused your efforts on reforming, much slower than last time but there weren\u2019t any more interruptions until you were almost fully reformed, only your left leg remained flat. You saw a shadow cast over you and looked up to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ... the sole of Avery\u2019s foot again, she still hasn\u2019t noticed you and you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll get away from this one not stuck to the sole of her foot.<br>\r\n2) ... Quinn opening her door, looking directly at you. Has she calmed down since she threw you out or is she going to make good on her threat?<br>\r\n3) ... Morgan\u2019s concerned face looking down at you. Maybe she can help you make up with Quinn after you explain what happened. </span></div></div>",

Or even worse would have been Quinn after her threat. When you looked up and saw that it was Morgan and she was looking straight at you, a wave of relief washed over you.<br>\r\nAs you looked up into the face of Morgan, her brow furrowed in concern and her eyes displaying a compassion that you were glad to see in your current state. <br>\r\n\u201cHunter, what happened? Here let\u2019s get you off the floor and take you to my room.\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan picked at your one deformed leg, almost effortlessly peeling it off the floor, a feat that would have taken you a few minutes at least she managed in a few seconds, before picking you up and placing you in her palm.<br>\r\nAs Morgan carried you into her room, you saw it was very neat and orderly. Very much a contrast from Quinn\u2019s room. There was some exercise equipment in the corner, there was a lot of space in this room and you mentally noted to ask Morgan if you could room with her since there looked to be a lot of space for you in here. Morgan placed you down on her bed and gently sat down next to you, making sure to displace you as little as she could, you appreciated her care when she was dealing with you.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened Hunter? Last I saw you were going to Quinn\u2019s room with her to get to know each other better, how did you end up squished on the floor outside her room?\u201d Morgan looked at you, confused, but also kind of worried.<br>\r\n\u201c...Quinn might be a bit mad at me right now,\u201d you replied, sheepishly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened so we can see if this can be fixed, wouldn\u2019t want any bad blood between any of us on the first day,\u201d Morgan\u2019s reply was empathetic, but also curious. You proceeded to tell her the whole story. Including the accidental grabbing of Quinn\u2019s thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Hunter if that\u2019s all that happened then it sounds like a simple misunderstanding to me,\u201d Morgan looked at you warmly, although there was a hint of scepticism in her eyes, maybe she didn\u2019t 100% believe you but she seemed on board. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to her room, maybe with me there we can get her to hear you out.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that Morgan picked you up carried you back down the hall before knocking on Quinn\u2019s door. After a few seconds the door swung open and Quinn was standing there, changed into a set of pyjamas that looked like they were supposed to be baggy, but on a woman much less endowed than she was. They were stretched tight across her hips and chest, they were baggy around the midsection and legs however so it was a very strange contrast. She seemed slightly confused to see Morgan at her door, but her face shifted to a cold expression when she looked down at her palm and saw you.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the pervert doing here,\u201d she said coldly, not even asking you directly. She was Directing the question to Morgan, not even sparing you a glance after her first look at you.<br>\r\n\u201cNow Quinn, Hunter just told me his side of this and it sounds like a misunderstanding to me, just please hear him out,\u201d Morgan pleaded with her.<br>\r\n\u201cHe already told me his little fiction, but if you want him to waste his time go on,\u201d Quinn shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, seemingly being down with the subject but only really not closing the door on you because of Morgan. She looked down at you impatiently.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, every word I told you was true. I had cleaned up a load of other stuff before I got anywhere near your thong. The problem with how I delivered that information is that I was scared. You\u2019ve got to admit you can be pretty terrifying!\u201d<br>\r\nAs you finished explaining to Quinn, you looked up into her apathetic, neutral expression, hoping for even the slightest shift to show you what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Quinn takes on board what you said, and the two of you make up.<br>\r\n2) Quinn is still on the fence, so you offer to do something for her to help make it up to her.<br>\r\n3) She\u2019s still mad, and slams the door in your face.</span></div></div>",

In your life being a tiny, even though you couldn't be killed, you can easily say you have looked death in the eyes multiple times. Wether it was something like the time the neighbor's dog mistook you for her chew toy for an afternoon or like the time your mother gave you a bath in the sink and forgot to take you out before undoing the drain and you spent nearly three days in city pipes before you were rescued by an employee at the filtration plant. The point is that every thought you had of what Quinn might do to you dwarfed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I seriously can't believe what I'm looking at. Are you serious right now? We met each other and then not even twenty-four hours later your touching my... my... UNDERWEAR! I told you NOT to go perving around and you can't even do that! Oh... If you thought I was a tough before, I plan on making your life <b>UNBEARABLE</b>! I bet you didn't move when I sat on you earlier because you enjoyed every last second of it and when I got up, you just wanted more, didn't you? You only wanted to get to know me to satisfy your own disgusting needs!\" Tears started forming in her eyes. \"I actually thought you and I could become pretty good friends, but now I see you're only interested in <b>literally</b> getting in girl's pants! In the end, you are exactly like Caleb, just a perving wolf in sheep's clothing that never cared about me as an actual person!\" She screamed, tears now streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head down and clench your fist and murmur, \"you're wrong\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn stopped and put her hand to her ear. \"I'm sorry, did you say something, <b>little</b> guy? You'll have to speak up for me to hear you from all the way down there.\" She tried to say in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your head up to look her in the eyes and screamed at the top of your lungs, \"I SAID THAT YOU'RE F***ING WRONG!!! You want to know who I am and see me stand up for myself, then listen to me HERE and NOW!\" <br>\r\nThis snaps her attention straight to you. She takes a deep breath and sits down on the ground to show you have her full attention then gestures you to speak with tears still in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's clear I don't know anywhere near as much about you or your past to fix this problem completely, so I'm just going to focus on what I do know. First off, I need to legitimately apologize to you for staring earlier. It was wrong and degrading considering you want to treat me as an equal despite my faults just for me not to treat you the same. I hope you can forgive me.\" You bow your head but rise back up to see her face had not changed in the slightest. You take this as a sign to continue.<br>\r\n \"Second is yes, yes I am perverted, not to a point of creepiness mind you, but yes I admit that I am a little... perverted.\" Both you and her stumble at this actually being addressed. You blush, but continue. \"I did enjoy what happened earlier for the wrong reasons and then chose to stare regardless of consequences. My entire life up til now was just been my mom and my sister, so I this is honestly the first time I have ever been in a room with no one I'm related to, so I'm still a bit new to these feelings. I felt so terrible for staring after you decided to open up to me a little, that I spent the time you were asleep to help organize your room to apologize.\" You gesture for her to see the room and she is dumbfounded.<br>\r\n \"I did everything but your unmentionables and the closet, which is why I'm in here. I didn't come in here to perv and I may not know the whole story and you may not believe me, but I do care about you even though I barely know you.\" You turned to the door to see Avery and Morgan quickly hide after being caught eavesdropping.<br>\r\n\"I just want you to know, you don't need to forgive me or even acknowledge me after this, just that I'm sorry for any pain and confusion I caused you.\" You pass her and walk out, passing the sisters who barreled into Quinn's room clearly to get the whole story. You walk down the hall, feeling like you want to curl up and cry as you hear Quinn in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He went and did all this.\"</span></span></div></div>",

However, whether it was Morgan's offer of a delicious meal or Avery's sunny disposition, nothing moved you from your spot  They had given up on trying to snap Quinn out of the trance she had been in since the morning afterwards. She would wake up, get ready for work, leave without having breakfast at home, and return to her room the moment she came home. For you, it was disturbingly quiet, and you've turned to talking to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really screwed up this time, idiot. Nothing is available to move into for at least a month, and more importantly, you had the bearings to go through a beautiful girl's personal stuff, but you're not man enough to apologize. She treated you as an equal, and you make her cry. Wonderful.\" You sigh, laying your head down on a dust bunny you had been using as a makeshift pillow. \"She'd probably turn me into a rag doll after what happened.\" You fall asleep with the sensation that you're being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You awaken after the best sleep you've had under the couch. That is until you realize you're no longer under the couch. The ground was soft, there was sun in your eyes, and there was the familiar feeling you were being watched again although it felt nowhere near as cold as before. You're back in Quinn's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About time you decided to wake up.\" A voice called out from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You tense up when you put a name to the voice as a shadow begins to block the sunlight entering through the window. Quinn appears out of your peripheral vision, propping herself up on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emotions and words begin tripping over each other and all that manages to escape your mouth is a very feeble \"Hello.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis evokes a small laugh from the black-haired giantess. \"Calm down, you're not in trouble dude. I was out having a drink and came home late. I realized you were hurting as much as me after our spat and wanted to make peace with you. I came over to the couch and found you asleep, alongside a giant spider set on making you it's midnight snack. Killed it and decided that I could keep an eye on you if you slept in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a heartfelt thanks as well as try and steer the conversation toward your apology. She realizes this and stops you. \"I'm the one who needs to apologize. It's just...when I found you in my closet, it brought back memories of a time I would have rather left to be forgotten.\" She sighed and sank back into the bed, causing you to lose your footing. She chucked at this and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb was a guy that I could've easily called my best friend and my first love, at least on the outside. Well, to make a long and painful story short, I opened my heart to a schmuck and had it broken when the person I would have spent the rest of my life with was never there in the first place. He never cared about me, just my body. He decided to start taking candid photos of me around the house and stealing my underwear because I wasn't ready to go \"all the way\" with him. After I found him out, admittedly, I went ballistic and managed to brake his arm. His parents decided to move after that, and I never heard from him again.\" She finished, wiping tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, hearing this painful story from someone who didn't deserve to be hurt. You walk up to her and place your hands on her arm. This surprised her slightly. \"I closed myself off and gained a bit of weight afterwards so something like that wouldn't happen again. But you're not like Caleb.\" She slowly moved the arm you were hugging towards her body and returned the hug, pushing you up against her right breast. \"I'm sorry Hunter, hope you and I can just hug it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You begin to blush, noticing she wasn't wearing a bra under her t-shirt, \"Sure Quinn, and thanks for trusting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And second, you didn\u2019t want to seem too judgmental of your new roommate\u2019s messy habits so quickly. After all, the clothes being strewn about hadn\u2019t been an issue for you\u2026 at least thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, with every mysterious word that left Quinn\u2019s mouth you felt yourself becoming more and more intrigued by her.

This combined with what she said about her old friend Caleb made you desperately want to get to know this girl on a deeper level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s good to hear you have some experience dealing with tiny guys, Quinn. Not gonna lie, my heart nearly stopped when I first figured out that I had chosen to live with three regular sized girls earlier, but from the looks of it none of you seem like the type to do anything too harsh to me!\u201d You nervously said up to Quinn. Part of you kicked yourself for being so forthright about your fears so quickly, but Quinn\u2019s light chuckle and smirk reassured you that it wasn\u2019t too much information too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, see Hunter, you\u2019re partly right there,\u201d she responded before leaning down, showing you a generous amount of cleavage without even realizing it, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t get too cocky.\u201d You raised an eyebrow suspiciously as she continued, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be looking to do anything to you\u2026 but at the same time I\u2019m not going to be looking to not do anything to you either. Whether I notice you or not, if you find yourself between my foot and somewhere it\u2019s stepping, my butt and somewhere it\u2019s sitting, or anything else like that, you gotta be able to take care of yourself, got it!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of her speech, Quinn was looking directly into your eyes as you returned the gesture. Her tone indicated the usual deadpan sarcasm with which she typically spoke, but despite this you could clearly tell that she meant every one of her words from the bottom of her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to lighten the mood slightly without seeming like you were just avoiding the topic, you retorted, \u201cOh don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve had more than my fair share of experiences with surviving situations like that! I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m pretty tough by now.\u201d You bluffed slightly. While the mere fact that you were alive and free to live a somewhat normal life at that exact moment meant that you hadn\u2019t had it as rough as some other tiny guys, you still knew deep down that your wellbeing was quite often out of your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrowing up it was just me, my mom Helen, and my younger sister Tracy for as long as I can remember.\u201d You began to think back, Quinn relaxing a bit in her seat after her earlier words to you. You could tell from the get go that she at least cared enough about you to listen to you talk, a fact that you made sure to never take for granted when dealing with giant girls. \u201cMy mom was, and still is, in fact, one of the hardest working people I\u2019ve ever known. She took good care of us without a doubt, but she was practically always working. The number one rule we had to follow was to never interfere with her work. Any time that either my sister or I would, she wasn\u2019t afraid to get strict with us\u2026 to say the least. Beyond that, I lost track of how many times that she had to go away on business trips, leaving just Tracy and I to fend for ourselves sometimes, and other times calling on our Aunt Norah to house-sit for some of her longer trips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn looked intrigued, \u201cWell at least you always had your sister to look after one another. You two probably became super close huh? And that stinks that your mom was away so often though\u2026 I would have killed for some space from my mom growing up.\u201d Quinn muttered the last half of her response to herself, just barely loud enough for you to hear. You wanted to ask her more about that, but once more you stopped yourself. You figured that she would tell you whenever she felt comfortable enough, and for that reason you decided not to pry further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, kind of. Tracy and I are good friends now, but throughout middle and high school it\u2019s safe to say she went through a bit of an angsty streak.\u201d You responded, looking down for a moment. Quinn was careful not to express too much emotion like usual, but you could still tell that she truly cared about what you were saying, so you continued. \u201cYeah, for some reason she felt like I was mom\u2019s favorite or something, and was always looking to get me back for that for some reason. As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t buy it. I frequently found myself at the mercy of her pretty mean-spirited pranks, or worse yet when she would try to set me up to get in trouble with our mom\u2026 but either way I always made it out in one piece!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smirked slightly, she knew you were downplaying the severity of what you were telling her without a doubt, but at the same time it seemed like she somewhat respected your attempt to seem tough. She then perked up her head, \u201cWhat about your Aunt then, Norah was her name? Surely she had to have provided a bit of a buffer between you and your sister during those years when she would look after you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back, \u201cOnce again, kind of,\u201d you said with a chuckle. \u201cWhen Tracy would mess with me around my mom, she had to be a little bit more tactical and sly about it, since she too would get in trouble if she was caught doing it. Whenever Norah would look after us, she never felt right punishing either one of us harshly, since we weren\u2019t her kids after all. That meant that almost no matter what Tracy did to me, Norah would let her off no more than a slap on the wrists. On top of that, Norah was a pretty colossal airhead at times, she would frequently forget about me entirely, leave my fate in the hands of my sister, or simply not realize how much damage that she could do to me with her body. Plus, there was the added threat of Norah\u2019s job. She was actually a tiny-specific job recruiter. I think she may even still be now. But either way, she was in charge of seeking out job-hunting guys like myself for positions in all kinds of fields of work. In all honesty I respected her for trying to help us dudes out like that\u2026 I just wished that she would have looked more carefully into some of the jobs that she was hired to do the recruiting for. There were a couple of times where she begged me to fill an emergency job listing when she couldn\u2019t find anyone else, and I don\u2019t think that she knew just what she was sending me into\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyebrows raised at the information that you gave her. From the sound of it, none of the three women who you interacted with most growing up were the type to coddle you or wait on your every need. This made her partly respect you for surviving such an upbringing, but deep down she did empathize with the hardships that you must have faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you felt like again this was a lot to dump on someone you just met, but at the same time you felt an instant connection with Quinn. Deep down you wanted to know more about her, and you figured that if you shared enough of your past with her, then perhaps she would do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Quinn, what out of all that do ya wanna hear about?\u201d You said confidently up to her. Some of these memories were a bit traumatic for sure, but at this point you felt comfortable enough to share them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Quinn ask about?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear a bit more about your immediate family. Tracy and\u2026Helen, right?\u201d Quinn inquired, impressively recalling your mom\u2019s name. \u201cI wonder how much they\u2019re like my own mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded happily. \u201cSure, I can talk about them. Most of the crazy stories from my life are about the two of them anyway, so I\u2019ve got a nearly limitless supply of tales.\u201d You said this last bit in an over-the-top old narrator voice, causing Quinn to roll her eyes and smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dork.\u201d The black-haired giantess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to clear your throat, you began. \u201cWell, as I\u2019ve mentioned, hardly a day went by from the time Tracy was in sixth grade up to senior year where she wouldn\u2019t bully me in some way. It was light teasing one day, and then down-right torment the next. I\u2019ve forgiven her by now, of course\u2026pretty hard not to with Tracy\u2019s ceaseless apologies\u2026but she was directly responsible for a lot of bad memories in the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn raised a finger inquisitively. \u201cHold up. I\u2019m actually curious what brought about her change. Why did she begin treating you differently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quirked your mouth to the side. \u201cWell, I actually didn\u2019t learn that myself for a few years, until Tracy told me herself. Since I\u2019m a year older than her, I graduated and headed off to college when her senior year began. Tracy told me that, without me around, she quickly began to miss me. Then, seeing my mother constantly on edge with worry over my safety while I was at college by myself, Tracy realized how much she missed me for ME, not just to bully me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think some introspection on Tracy\u2019s part made her realize how dumb her perceived mistreatment was. Her persecution complex kinda fell apart as she matured, and this was the final nail in the coffin. I mean, I\u2019m her brother, and somewhere deep inside of her she always loved me as family should. I wish she\u2019d had the realization earlier in her life, as it would\u2019ve saved me a lot of trouble, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trailed off, and Quinn picked up the slack. \u201cYeah, Hunter, that sucks. At least it worked out in the end between you and her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did. She\u2019s pretty much my best friend now.\u201d You nodded. \u201cBut as for past events\u2026uh\u2026I\u2019ll start off with a simple one. When I was in tenth grade, I won an award for math score achievements, but Tracy lost out to one of her classmates to win her own award. As such, her persecution complex convinced her that I was to blame for her missing out on an award, and that meant she felt compelled to bully me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe took an interesting approach though. Grabbing me up when my mom wasn\u2019t looking, Tracy smushed me up into a blob, and then dripped some lemon juice from our kitchen onto me. Popping me into her mouth before heading out to catch the bus, Tracy proceeded to use me as her gum for the entire day. It was a blur of crushing, smashing, and gnashing for hours on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, it didn\u2019t take Tracy long to realize the cruel genius of her plan. Because tiny guys like me are much more absorbent when squished, my body totally soaked in the lemon juice, thus retaining its taste and flavor through the whole day. And\u2026uh\u2026the next day. And the next. Tracy used me as her gum for five straight days, smiling the whole time at how tasty I was to her. It only ended when she slipped up by mentioning me on the phone with her friend when my mom was in earshot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your story was finished, Quinn winced. \u201cGum? That\u2019s awful, Hunter. How could Tracy treat you like that, her own brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced a laugh. \u201cWell, it was hardly the worst thing she ever did to me. Not even close.\u201d Quinn\u2019s eyes narrowed tensely, and you backtracked. \u201cI-I mean, she didn\u2019t get off scot-free. My mom forced her to scrub the bathroom with a toothbrush every night for a week, which caused her to have to cancel a party she was planning on going to.\u201d You paused, and frowned. \u201cOf course, my mom also punished me for missing class, even though it was Tracy\u2019s fault. And, Tracy saw her own punishment as my fault, so she had it out for me the next few weeks too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nuts.\u201d Quinn shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right.\u201d You stated. \u201cThe cycle of bullying and punishment was and endless dance between Tracy, my mom, and I.\u201d You rubbed your chin. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t want you to think we were an awful family either, Quinn. For all the bad memories, there were plenty of times where my family and I all got along great. I\u2019ve got a bunch of treasured memories somewhere in my ol\u2019 noggin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smirked again. \u201cWhat, like vacations and trips? Stuff like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour demeanor faded just a bit. \u201cUh, not always. I meant hanging out at home, or things like that. Not to say our family vacations and trips weren\u2019t great, but\u2026let\u2019s just say the risk of danger to someone like me was increased by about a thousand during those times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyed widened. \u201cOh, shit, really? I guess that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over at Quinn\u2019s clock on the wall, seeing that there was still plenty of time left in the day. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll stop beating around the bush. Guess I can tell you a more specific, longer story.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Realizing that it would be a fairly unique tale to tell your new friend, you proposed the idea. \u201cWell, I actually could tell about this one time where I accidentally ended up tagging along with my mom on one of her business trips.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccidentally? How\u2019d that play out?\u201d Quinn inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled lightly. \u201cAbout as well as you might imagine. Basically\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been pretty much just a normal week of July, of which you\u2019d spent most of that time trying (and frequently failing) to avoid Tracy, and catching up on TV shows you\u2019d missed during the school year. It was the summer between your ninth and tenth grade. Just a day prior, your mother had revealed she was leaving on another sudden business trip, lasting from Friday to Sunday. She\u2019d informed your younger sister that she was in charge of keeping you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy didn\u2019t take that too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut MOM!\u201d Tracy whined, stomping her foot once for emphasis. \u201cI was gonna hang out with Lindsey all weekend! We\u2019ve had these plans for over a month!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie, but this is how it is with my job. As a consultant, I always have to be on call at any moment. I\u2019ll make it up to you when I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister sneered. \u201cBut why can\u2019t Hunter just hang out by himself all weekend? He\u2019s practically an adult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen patted her daughter on the shoulder. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also an inch tall. All it would take is one tiny accident without your supervision, and we could lose him. You need to stay home and look after him. Don\u2019t baby him, but check in on him at least a few times a day.\u201d She paused. \u201cSpeaking of, he\u2019s still asleep, isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout faltering a beat, Tracy nodded. \u201cYeah, I think. Haven\u2019t seen him all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother sighed. \u201cOh well. Tell him I say goodbye. I\u2019m going to run to the bathroom once more, and then I\u2019m off.\u201d She turned from Tracy and gestured to her already packed suitcase. \u201cCould you make sure each pocket is zipped up nice and tight?\u201d<br>\r\nTracy groaned, but nodded. \u201cSure, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen wandered off to the bedroom, and Tracy waited until she heard the door shut before swearing under her breath. Angrily, she tore off the hairtie she\u2019d been wearing, which of course was actually your squished, molded body. Glaring at your flattened form, your giantess sister frowned\u2026until her expression morphed into one of inspiration, her eyes darting back and forth between you and Helen\u2019s suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tracy grinned, and leaned over you. \u201cYa know what, Hunter? I\u2019m not putting my plans on hold just to look after you all weekend. Why don\u2019t you take a nice little trip instead?\u201d Tracy smirked, and mimed blowing you a kiss before angling her palm and letting your papery body roll off her hand and into the main pouch of the suitcase. You couldn\u2019t do a thing to slow your descent, and merely glimpsed a final sight of your sister\u2019s mean-spirited grin before everything became darkness as she zipped up the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reformed fairly quickly, but not enough to do anything about the fate Tracy had bestowed upon you. As your mother returned from the bathroom and grabbed her suitcase to begin rolling it, you toppled over, falling deeper into the piles of clothes all around you. Slipping deeper into the suitcase, your attempts at crying out to get her attention were useless, as your voice was nowhere near loud enough to penetrate outside the mound of clothes and the walls of the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging Tracy goodbye, Helen strolled out to her car, tossing the suitcase into the backseat before driving off. The simple act of tossing her suitcase into the car caused all her clothes inside to bounce around wildly, and your miniscule body was tossed around like a toy, banging into the sides of the suitcase and ending up buried under even more clothes. Your body was squished slightly, but at least the soft fabrics surrounded you comforted your experience somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not to say that you felt mentally comfortable at all. Because of Tracy\u2019s grudge against you, and her general selfishness, you were now ripped from your relaxing home and helplessly being taken along on your mother\u2019s business trip. You had no idea where Helen was heading, how long it would take for her to get there, or if she\u2019d even find you once there. On top of that, you were already fearing whatever punishment Helen would dole out, as you knew from experiencing that her \u201cstrict but fair\u201d nature would take no mercy on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, though, there was nothing you could do but wait. Straining your ears to hear, you could just barely make out the sounds of a typical airport, and from the shaking of your suitcase prison, you knew your mom had just checked in her baggage. Everything around you fell sideways, crushing you more in the shift of the clothes pile, and you guessed you were now on the luggage conveyor belt rumbling along to the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were a blur of noises, motion, and unsettling silence. Your suitcase was eventually loaded onto the plane, tossed inside and stacked. It took over an hour for the plane to board and take off, and then the actual plane flight was a few hours at least. You didn\u2019t know for sure, because you eventually drifted off to sleep (having given up on trying to reform with the weight of the clothes crushing you down), and you regained consciousness right around the time your mom made it to her hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began mentally bracing yourself as Helen rolled the suitcase towards the elevator and up to her room. You needed to prepare to reform and get her attention, lest your situation spiral into even further chaos than it was already shaping up to be. You took a deep breath, and finally felt the entire suitcase shake and tilt as your mom laid it out on her hotel bed, and began to unzip the central pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraces of light shone down from the room into the deepest crevices of the suitcase, where you were currently located. You could hear your mom softly mumbling to herself as she systematically removed one item from her suitcase after another, no doubt taking mental inventory. Craning your head back, you could see some of the clothing around you, which consisted of multiple business blouses and skirts, an alluring formal dress, and a surprisingly revealing one-piece bikini. You tried to ignore the frilly panties and bras you could feel touching you from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, your mom retrieved the pair of panties covering you up, revealing you to the world and momentarily blinding you from the light. Having managed to reform, you blinked rapidly to clear your sight, and soon found yourself staring up at your mother\u2019s giant face. She was peering down at you quizzically, which then morphed into surprise, and finally landed on annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026what are you doing in here, Hunter?\u201d Helen asked, flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. \u201cU-uh\u2026just hanging out, mom. It was\u2026um\u2026comfy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom wasn\u2019t amused by your attempt to lighten the mood, and she pinched your chest and lifted you out of her suitcase. \u201cSo\u2026you thought my lingerie was comfortable? Is that what you\u2019re trying to say, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flushed. \u201cN-no, no! I was just\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sighed. \u201cTrying to lighten the mood, right? Let me guess\u2026Tracy threw you in here to avoid looking after you all weekend. That sound correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened. \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother dropped you onto the desk beside the room\u2019s TV and ran her hands through her hair. \u201cThat girl is grounded for a month when I get back. I really don\u2019t have time to look after you this weekend. I have a meeting tonight with some company managers, and then I\u2019m spending all day tomorrow with our client. Some rich heiress wants a sponsorship with our company, and I have to liaison with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked dumbly, having only caught some of what your mom had just said. Reading your blank expression, Helen groaned. \u201cOh, Hunter\u2026I\u2019m saying that I\u2019m too busy to keep a close eye on you. It just can\u2019t happen\u2026\u201d She paused, and sat back on her bed. \u201cWell, I suppose that I could\u2026hmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I can do anything to help, I will!\u201d You offered enthusiastically, earning an eye roll from your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just want out of punishment, don\u2019t you?\u201d Helen inferred. \u201cStill, I guess I DO have a few options as for what to do with you. Hmm.\u201d Your mom rubbed her chin while staring intently at you, and you felt a small shiver go down your spine. Something about the look in her eyes, while kind and caring and loving, had the same hint of danger you sensed from Tracy frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had the sinking feeling you weren\u2019t getting out of your mom\u2019s business trip unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK CONTINUES)</span></div></div>",

Seems like it might\u2019ve been a mix of good and bad, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed shortly. \u201cYeah, you kind of hit the nail on the head, Quinn. Aunt Norah was really a handful. It\u2019s been about a year now since I\u2019ve last seen her. The last time was when she came over for a surprise visit during Christmas time, and stayed a week. I spent Christmas day sloshing away in her stomach after she swallowed me with her eggnog, and that was hardly the only incident that week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yikes.\u201d Quinn\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou did mention she was pretty airheaded, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was putting it lightly, for her sake.\u201d You groaned. \u201cNorah\u2019s a total scatterbrain. I\u2019ll be sitting on the couch, she\u2019ll see me and say hello, turn around and notice her favorite show is on, and then sit down to watch it for three hours\u2026right on top of me! Even then, I\u2019m lucky if she realizes what she\u2019s done when she finally does stand up, or if I\u2019m glued to her butt for the foreseeable future.\u201d You gave Quinn a sidelong look. \u201cAnd of course, if we\u2019re talking six or more years ago, Tracy would\u2019ve let it all happen with a quiet smirk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn tapped her chin thoughtfully. \u201cNorah and your sister put you through the ringer, huh? Gotta say, it\u2019s impressive you survived through it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cGuess you could say I learned from every experience. Certainly there are some experiences that I wish I could burn from my brain, though.\u201d You forced out a laugh. \u201cIn my worst nightmares, I can still remember Norah believing Tracy back in middle school, when she squished up my body and said I was a \u2018new, special toe cleaner\u2019. Norah used me to pick out lint and toe jam from her disgusting feet for a week\u2026before throwing me in the trash where I barely escaped before being taken out to the curb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn gaped, but said nothing for a moment. Finally, she frowned. \u201cAnd can you tell me more about that\u2026tiny recruiter\u2026thing? Her job, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and it was a cushy one that let her mostly work from home.\u201d You explained. \u201cBasically, Norah was assigned a sheet of tiny-specific job postings, and then needed to recruit tinies to fill the spots as quickly as possible. It wasn\u2019t too hard for her. Tiny-exclusive jobs pay really well, usually because of the danger involved, and Norah\u2019s exuberance was hard to turn down. She\u2019s also\u2026and I mean this from a purely factual standpoint, not anything weird\u2026really attractive given her age. Most tinies would fall head over heels to make her happy by saying yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe trouble was, given her penchant for being forgetful and oblivious, Norah would almost never explain the jobs clearly or fully. She probably just didn\u2019t get how awful some tasks could be when you\u2019re just one inch. She\u2019d also overestimate herself sometimes, and come up short with approaching deadlines. That\u2019s where she\u2019d come and rope me into a job, promising double pay and that they would only be for a week or so.\u201d You paused. \u201cHowever, one week of serving as a head executive\u2019s \u2018stress toy\u2019 felt like an eternity when I did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last statement drew ire from Quinn, and a flash of anger danced in her eyes. \u201cOne of her recruiting jobs was to sell yourself as a stress toy?\u201d The black-haired giantess asked moodily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. And there were plenty that were so much worse. Again, Norah was kind of too dumb to realize what she was coercing so many tinies into, so I can\u2019t be too mad at her specifically. Those are still some bad memories of mine.\u201d You stopped for a second and then smiled wistfully. \u201cThat sums up Norah, actually. A decent bit of good wrapped up in a whole lot of bad. Add in Tracy during her torment years, and you\u2019ve hit peak awful.\u201d You chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head, overwhelmed by the sheer craziness of your life. Even still, you could see the intrigue dancing in her eyes now that her anger had cooled, and sure enough, a minute later, she was ready to hear some more specific stories.</span></div></div>",

Basically\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the summer between tenth and eleventh grade, in the middle of blistering August. By this point of the summer, you\u2019d finished all of your preparatory assigned work for the upcoming school year, so you were totally free for the remaining ten days of your break. As such, you spent most of your time sprawled out on the couch lazily watching TV. It was easy living, perhaps a bit boring, but definitely relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, you\u2019d made sure to avoid the havoc hurricane that was Aunt Norah. She\u2019d arrived the day prior, showing up minutes before your mom headed out on another of her seemingly endless business trips. Norah hadn\u2019t been in the house for more than five minutes before she\u2019d plopped her gargantuan buttocks onto your tiny body, not noticing you on the chair she\u2019d claimed as her own. Of course, Tracy had let her sit there for over an hour before letting slip your whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah had given her trademark quick apology, laughing as she did so, and though you knew she meant well, you knew it was safer for you to just distance yourself from her as much as possible. This morning she was sequestered away in a side room, probably in the middle of one of her daily yoga sessions. She hadn\u2019t crushed or smushed you yet, and you were determined to keep it that way by maintaining a healthy distance from your airheaded aunt, all day if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, your younger sister walking by, sparing a quick sidelong glance at you before she approached the room Norah was in. Opening the door, Tracy was hit by an overwhelming wave of heat, and she gasped for breath. Even from across the room on the couch, you could feel the hot temperatures of the room hit your face, and could hardly imagine what Norah was doing in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Tracy spoke for you, poking her head into the room. \u201cAunt Norah, what are you doing? Why is it so freakin\u2019 hot in here?\u201d Tracy laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re sweating up a storm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah\u2019s hearty laugh floated all the way from the room to your ears. \u201cOh, good morning, Tracy, dear! I wanted to switch up my morning yoga by trying out something I saw online. It\u2019s called hot yoga, I think. The point is to work up a crazy sweat.\u201d<br>\r\nTracy wrinkled up her nose. \u201cReally? That seems kinda gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah laughed again; her voice tinged with a hint of exhaustion. \u201cIt is, but it truly does feel good to get it all out, you know? It\u2019s why I closed all the windows in this room, turned off the AC, and brought in that heater in the corner. The hotter the better\u2026or so I read.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you do you, Aunt Norah.\u201d Tracy giggled, moving to step back and close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait!\u201d Norah called out. \u201cIf you could do one quick thing for me, dear? I forgot a sweat rag, and I sure as heck will need one by the time I\u2019m down. Preferably sooner. Could you get one for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy nodded, not at all surprised her scatterbrained aunt would forget something so crucial for morning exercise. \u201cSure thing, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an angel, Tracy!\u201d Were Norah\u2019s last words before Tracy closed the door and walked back towards you, moving to pass through the living room and towards the bathroom to procure a washcloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way, she glanced over at you again, and stopped in her tracks. Your younger sister paused while staring at you, frowning. An expression danced in her eyes, one of curiosity and inquisitiveness, a look which you failed to notice as you\u2019d gone back to happily watching TV. You didn\u2019t so much as glance the huge grin which began to grow on Tracy\u2019s face, nor the malicious glint in her eyes as she sauntered over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Tracy was directly beside you, towering above you that you noticed her. Taking your eyes off the TV, you craned your neck all the way back to peer up at your giantess sister, her smirk on full display. Feeling incredibly uneasy, you tried to play it cool and hopefully diffuse any situation that may be brewing. You had no idea what her plans were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026hey, Tracy.\u201d You said, as casually as possible, though your voice still wavered. Tracy grinned wider, seemingly pleased that you were so on-edge around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Hunter? Finished all your schoolwork for the first day of class in a week and a half?\u201d Tracy asked, almost friendly, though her unsettling grin remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Doing anything today?\u201d Tracy put her hands on her hips and leaned just a little closer to you. You subconsciously drew into yourself a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy clapped her hands together. \u201cAwesome! Then you\u2019ll be perfect for this!\u201d Your younger sister clapped again\u2026although this time, it consisted of her slapping her palms down onto the couch, and crushing you flat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peeling your squished form off of the couch, Tracy effortlessly picked your clothes off with her fingernail and flicked the remnants of fabric scraps into the trash can. With you naked, she was easily able to stretch and mold your body, contorting your malleable form into a roughly rectangular shape about a foot long. She then used her thumb to press into your face and harshly smear your facial features into an unrecognizable blob, your vision blurring as she did so, and your mouth morphing into a useless lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Tracy strolled back over to Norah\u2019s exercise room, opened the door, and held you out like she was presenting a gift. \u201cGot you that sweat rag, Aunt Norah! Sorry it took me a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s no problem at all, dear. You\u2019re so nice, Tracy.\u201d Norah gushed, stepping off her yoga mat to grab you. As soon as she approached, you could see the blurry image of her smile warmly at your sister, and not even spare you a second glance as she grabbed you with her slimy hand and clenched you tightly. Only Tracy glanced at you for a lightning quick second, smirking as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah threw you over her shoulder as she returned to the center of the room. Looking over her shoulder at Tracy, she cocked her head quizzically to the side. \u201cThis sweat rag feels quite odd, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy, ever quick on her feet, smile easily. \u201cOh, I think it\u2019s one of my mom\u2019s specially ordered rags. Supposed to be comfy but also super absorbent? I think that\u2019s what it is, I grabbed it from a stack in the bathroom.\u201d The lie came out smoothly, and Norah nodded innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d Your aunt chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll put it to the test, then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy grinned, half genuinely and half maliciously. Her plan would\u2019ve been ruined if Norah had called her out on the lie, as excellent as it was. Thankfully for Tracy, her plan was flawless. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it!\u201d Your cruel sister giggled, then excused herself, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah went back to some simple stretches, leaving you lying over her shoulder. The tiny, cramped room was unbelievably hot, the unbearable temperatures nearly searing. You were sweating buckets in seconds, as was your aunt, and Norah\u2019s sweat mixed with your own to create a fearsome bog of disgusting stench. You fought to squirm to alert Norah, but you were too thoroughly crushed by Tracy to move. Similarly, you found reforming equally challenging, and you were still a flat, vaguely washcloth shape five minutes later, when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, goodness. That was very exhausting!\u201d Norah sighed aloud, as she reached for you. Your blood ran cold as her hot fingers touched your body and dragged you off her shoulder. You gave one last, futile attempt to wiggle, but it was no use. All you could do in those last moments was look through smeared eyes at your curvaceous giantess aunt, who was clad in a tight sports bra and form-fitting compression shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, Norah slammed you into her taut abdomen, pressing you firmly into her sweat-slicked skin. You winced from the impact, and double-so once your titanic aunt began scraping you up and down her tummy, using your absorbent body to gather up every remaining bit of sweat from her. You wished you could stop it, but your body\u2019s natural processes greedily sucked up all of Norah\u2019s sweat like a good little sweat rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed at the \u2018specially ordered rag\u2019 Tracy had given her, Norah smiled appreciatively as she continued to rub you all over her body. She wedged you down her cleavage, rummaging you around her sizable tits until you\u2019d sopped up all their collected sweat. Norah then dragged you up and down her toned legs, going so far as to clean between her toes and under her soles with your face, forcing you to taste every inch of her dirty and sweaty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast of all, Norah smiled sheepishly, silently glad that Tracy was in the other room, and stripped out of her compression shorts. It took her a minute to wiggle the skintight shorts off of her booty, but she finally did so, filling the room with an extra pungent odor. Mentally screaming at your aunt, begging her to stop, you braced for impact as Norah slammed your beaten, abused body into her tight butt cheeks (as she had been wearing nothing underneath her shorts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrubbing you dutifully into her cheeks, Norah decimated your body with sweat and stench in equal measure. She rubbed you in methodical circles around her plump cheeks, humming a little tune as she did so. Your body contorted and squished as she did so, amazing Norah even further. She couldn\u2019t believe that this new sweat rag could be stretched into whatever shape best cleaned her at any given moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test this great new sweat rag to its limits, Norah twisted your head and your feet, pulling you taut into a skinnier, lengthier rope-like form. This caught you off guard, until you were hit with an earth-shattering realization, and your world crashed down around you. You fought with every fiber of your being to stop your oblivious aunt, but it was no use at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWielding you like string, Norah proceeded to wedge your body into her sweltering, sweat coated butt crack. Using you like you were nothing more than floss, Norah dragged you up and down the inside of her crack, forcing you deeper into her as she did so. Blushing at the pleasantly ticklish sensation, Norah was none-the-wiser to what she was truly doing as she forced her tiny nephew deep into her meaty ass, forcing your body to soak up every last drop of gross sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally done, Norah retrieved you from the depths of darkness, and daintily held you by two pinched fingers. You were soaked to the point of dripping with Norah\u2019s sweat, your body caked with stench and dirt. You were barely hanging on mentally, fighting the urge to pass out. Through your one barely visible eye you glanced at your aunt, begging her to see you. Instead, she merely crinkled her nose and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did quite a number on you, huh? Goodness!\u201d Norah smiled. \u201cStill, what an amazing rag! I\u2019ll have to use you again sometime!\u201d<br>\r\nWithout another thought, Norah dropped you onto the floor on top of her previously discarded compression shorts. Seconds later, she unhooked her well-worn sports bra and dropped it down over you, squishing you out of sight. A minute later you felt a sense of weightlessness as Norah hefted you and her gross clothes off the ground, and she sauntered out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy, watching TV in the same spot you\u2019d been, gaped at her aunt as she left the room. \u201cAunt Norah! What if Hunter was out here?\u201d Your sister cried with surprise, gesturing to your aunt\u2019s totally naked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah blinked in confusion, and then gasped. \u201cMy goodness, that totally slipped my mind! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She blushed in embarrassment. \u201cWhere is Hunter, if I may ask? Haven\u2019t seen him today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister swore under her breath, not meaning to bring you up. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026uh\u2026still asleep, I think. I haven\u2019t seen him today either.\u201d<br>\r\nNorah puzzled this over in her mind for half a second before nodding, satisfied. \u201cOkay. After I shower, we can just have an aunt and niece day! We\u2019ll let Hunter sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds amazing, Aunt Norah.\u201d Tracy grinned. She then leaned forward eagerly. \u201cHow was that special little rag?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA blessing!\u201d Norah sighed with delight. \u201cNever used such a great rag in my life. I\u2019m throwing it in the wash now with my clothes. If you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019d love to use it more this week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy nodded enthusiastically. \u201cOf course. Put that silly thing through as much as you want to. It is its purpose, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal person might\u2019ve been confused by your sister\u2019s confusingly specific wording, but Norah merely chuckled and shuffled off to the laundry room. Not wasting a second, she tossed you and her workout clothes into the washer, poured in detergent, and went to take her well-deserved shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced. \u201cNorah held true to her hopes. After the wash cycle, I was still the exact same rag-shape, just sparkly clean. Tracy found me first, gloated about how good of a rag I was, then kept me pinned under a box all night so I couldn\u2019t reform. Norah used me just as horribly the next morning, and then for every morning after that. Five straight days of wiping her whole body clean of sweat and grime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, enraptured, was practically whispering. \u201cH-how did you finally stop it all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed a small smile. \u201cI actually managed to, just barely, wiggle myself partially out from under Tracy\u2019s box the final night. Because of that, I could reform my arm. When Norah went to use me the next morning, I waved frantically to her, she noticed, and then that was it. She let me reform, apologized for what she\u2019d unknowingly done, and treated me to ice cream that night. It worked out in the end, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour black-haired roommate ran her hand through her hair. \u201cWow, dude. That\u2019s pretty crazy. You have HOW many stories just like this one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHundreds.\u201d You admitted. \u201cSpeaking of which\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...That story isn't even over yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's mouth hung open as she couldn't believe this awful tale could somehow keep going. Consumed with curiosity, your giantess roommate's expression alone urged you to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I actually made a sincere mistake by being a little too relaxed after the fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback Continued)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting in your room and getting your first good night's sleep not consumed entirely by struggling to reform form under the weight of Tracy's box, that evening Norah had prepared you a nice tiny cup of ice cream as a sort of apology. Or so you had thought it was for an apology...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on your door, your aunt soon let herself in, shot glass of frozen dairy in one hand and a well sized bowl in her other. \"Hey Hunter, you doing okay?\" Norah spoke into the room aimlessly not having spotted you yet. You felt familiar light tremors as she made her way to your bed before promptly turning and presenting her massive ass right in front of you as she prepared to sit. Dodging your way out from under your clueless aunt, you were left panting from the sudden sprint as she plopped herself down heavily onto your mattress, the sudden weight indent causing your tiny body to fling into the air slightly and land up on your pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the speck of movement, Norah actually spotted you and quickly flashed a bright grin, \"Ah, there you are!\" Handing you over your portion of ice cream, she plucked you up and set you down in her warm lap before she began digging into her own and you sat in comfortable silence as you enjoyed your treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks aunt Norah. Mom hardly ever lets us have ice cream. Mostly since Tracy is always acting out though!\" Norah chuckled at your unfortunate truth before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing, sweetie. After all you deserve a nice little reward after working so hard all week!\" To Norah your week as her sweat rag really was just like a bit of work since she usually rented out guys into similar jobs all the time. Usually not as hands on and gross but Norah figured you were family so this was a clear exception where you didn't mind getting a bit dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you'd known this was how her mind was working you could've expressed that that somehow makes it even worse but instead you just happily took your compliment and attempted to kindly retort, \"Ha, I think you unfortunately were the one working Norah. Working out that is...I was just along for the difficult ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting into laughter at your lackadaisical response, Norah lost herself and a globule of ice cream dropped off her spoon into her lap, right onto you. You yelped out from the freezing cold fluid washing over your body as you started to shiver. Norah actually took notice of what had happened however and put her bowl down to try and help you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez, I'm awfully sorry, dear. Looks like I'm a bit clumsy this evening! Let me clean you up!\" Not seeing any napkins, you expected Norah to take you to the bathroom to wash you off when she plucked you from her thigh and dangled you in front of her face. You were shaking from the cold in her grip as you saw her open her mouth. Expecting she would say something, you were distinctly mistaken as her tongue rolled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing her tiny nephew into her soft tongue, Norah couldn't help but release a pleased sigh as she tasted the vanilla goodness. Making sure she thoroughly cleaned you up, she was relentless with her probing tongue as it lapped up the ice cream off you, Norah's soft grip being the only thing stopping you from being flung up with it deep into Norah's humid and hot mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to be thorough for your sake, Norah held you by your feet and wrapped her lips around you. Pulling you through with a smack, your aunt sucked the remaining cream off you before blasting you with sweet smelling hot breath as she let loose an \"Ahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, hon. Anyways, where were we?\" Placing your wet and dizzy form back on her thigh, Norah simply went back to her ice cream as she hummed in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right, your talent! Well listen, sweetie, I really appreciated your help this week. If this ice cream makes up for it then I'm more than happy to trade!\" Smiling warmly down at you, you were still dizzy from your tongue bath and were trying to collect yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, sure aunt Norah...no problem...\" You managed to get out before regaining your composure and setting your focus back on your ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later and after a pleasant and decently normal chat, Norah placed you down on your pillow and gave you a quick kiss goodnight. \"Thanks again, Hunter. It makes me all fuzzy inside knowing I have such a kind and accommodating nephew!\" You blushed dark red as you accepted your praise. You weren't sure why she chose the word accommodating but it was a compliment nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you to sleep, you got your first good night's sleep in a week...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning you awoke as actual light streamed it's way through your window. This was far more preferable than the first light you get being from Norah taking off your weighted box and grabbing you up to \"assist\" her. Hoping down from your bed, you stretched your arms out and pondered that it's a beautiful new day with infinite possibilities. So long as you could avoid Norah's carefree body and Tracy's nonstop tricks. Hearing your stomach growl, you knew it was time to head for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the trek through your homes vast hallway, you soon felt an all too familiar booming coming from right behind you. Looking up right at the last second, you saw the all too familiar malicious face of your sister right before her socked foot blocked it out. You spent an extra long second beneath her musty and honestly somewhat damp foot before she left you behind a flattened sticker on the floor. \"Watch where you're going, bro!\" Tracy mocked as she stuck her tongue out and skipped her way to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuming with anger but more focused on reforming, you struggled against your flattened body as best as you could. Right as you were making some decent progress though, you unfortunately heard the skin-crawling familiar sound of sweat-slicked feet smacking against hardwood. You strained your eyes to see the blurry yet distinct shape of your aunt's curvy form walking right towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Norah!\" You shouted right as her sole compressed down on you. Looking left and right quizzically, Norah could've sworn someone had called out for her. Shrugging, Norah took another step only to feel your most intense screams as a light tickle on the bottom of her foot. Turning her foot over, you were shocked to see not an apologetic, sheepish expression. But rather one of excitement painted onto Norah's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, good morning Hunter! You're up bright and early for yoga as expected!\" Peeling you free from her foot, Norah looked down at your mildly flattened body with discontent. \"Not the best job on getting in shape though, I guess I can help with that!\" Getting to work with a few harsh stretches, Norah easily had returned you into a flat rectangle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, good as new and ready for action!\" Norah was beaming as she let you hang in her grip as she walked on towards your home's empty room, which was quickly becoming Norah's makeshift yoga studio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by Tracy at the dining table munching on her cereal, even Tracy raised an eyebrow at you and couldn't help but call out, \"Uhhh, whatcha got there aunt Norah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you up confused, Norah simply stated matter-of-factly, \"My specialty rag, Hunter of course. You didn't ask this at all the past few days but now you're curious? You can be so silly, Tracy!\" Tracy's jaw fell open as she saw Norah shake her head disapprovingly at her before turning on her heel and heading with you straight into her sweltering studio of doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging you around her neck as usual, Norah headed straight for the room's heater and flipped it on. As it whirred to life you were struggling to reform your mouth to ask what the hell was happening. In response to your thoughts somehow, Norah broke the silence actually speaking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to respect your initiative Hunter, being all flat and waiting for me right outside my bedroom like that. But still, five days in exchange for one tiny shot glass of ice cream? You must weirdly love ice cream to do that!\" You struggled to pop open your flattened mouth as hard as you could but only managed to get out a few muffled moans. Noticing this against her neck, Norah took you in her hands and looked at you puzzled, \"Or you just love being useful for your sweet aunt? I get that I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the room heated up, Norah jumped right into her routine with assistant in tow. You couldn't believe you were somehow in this same situation. You had to find some kind of way to set this straight before Norah made use of you for another grueling five whole days! As sweat began to rain free down Norah's neck onto your exposed form, you cried out for mercy from your oblivious aunt as she lunged through pose after pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your restrained mumbles against her, your aunt retrieved you from her neck only to dunk you into her chest as your first exercise of the day. Swabbing thoroughly, your aunt retrieved you only to jokingly but sternly set you straight. \"Now Hunter I need you to respect my practice. That means no talking,\" she said as she spotted your face and scrubbed it away with her thumb. \"And also no buzzing,\" as she said that she laid you flat on her yoga mat and cast a heart shaped shadow over you. You watched the sky fall as her titanic rear end squashed you under the otherworldly weight of her ass. Rubbing back and forth firmly, Norah had cemented away your ability to speak out against her now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grinding away on your poor body, Norah let out a pleased sigh as she resumed her concentration. With her handy nephew along with her, she could finally enjoy the benefits of hot yoga without the annoying consequence of getting soaked. Not to mention it was a little fun to be able to share the experience with someone else. Maybe you'd even learn a thing or two about yoga in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wasn't wrong as you pretty much knew most of her routine by now. Unfortunately for you, she seemed as carefree as ever to use you as nothing more than a rag all throughout the experience. After Norah had silenced you by taking a seat down on your face, your body quickly stuck to the back of this ditzy broad's butt and you were forced to wiggle and flex along with each subtle movement of Norah's ass as you accompanied her as a second skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worked well for her for a while as she enjoyed the extra cushioning, but eventually she was once again dripping all over her mat. Peeling you free from her ass, Norah casually wiped you along from her forehead down to her waist without needing to interrupt her practice by speaking to you. Finished drying herself as much as she could, which was unfortunately still pretty wet, she dropped your body to the floor where she stood atop you like you were just some addition to the mat itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your plush body squish beneath her soles, Norah was beginning to feel the true benefits to your form. Not only were you naturally absorbent which was ludicrously helpful to her, but you were also extra soft and squishy which was a <i>huge </i>help for something like yoga where you were basically on the floor barring a thin mat of rubber. Grinning with satisfaction, she couldn't help but wiggle her toes excitedly atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt this wiggling as a battering of heavy blows as sweaty balls of flesh drummed into your face. You would gag if you could as you got a full taste of the salty residue they were splashing down onto you. You were forced to look up between the spaces of her toes to see the intimidating full height of Norah, her face easily blocked out by her prestigious chest. You winced through blurred vision as Norah lunged into another pose, her movement allowing a few more sticky droplets to cascade off her body onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished with her routine, Norah was panting and thoroughly soaked even with your assistance. \"Phew, it's never easy, is it honey?\" Norah wasn't exactly expecting a response as she was busy stroking you up and down each underarm before moving on to the next soaked body part. After an eternal five minutes of cleaning up Norah's latest lather, she tried holding you from each side and wringing out her gross sweat, only to have nothing come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling up a storm, Norah laughed out, \"Still thirsty, huh?\" and you were placed on the floor. Watching Norah struggle out of her painted on compression shorts, you knew what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarelessly stripping free from her spandex restraints, Norah let her shorts and bra hit the ground beside you with a squelch. You tried to shield your eyes from your aunt's shining with sweat body as usual, but you noticed her face was extra red this time. \"I'm sorry but the worst is next, Hunter. You probably know this is the spot that I need you the most!\" Picking you up and swinging you around to face her swell of a rear she teased you along her cheeks before running you up and down her crack slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you <i>love </i>to help out, and this spot really is where I need the most help, so actually I guess this spot isn't the worst, it's the best!\" With renewed vigor and a newfound lack of guilt, Norah finally plunged you beneath the surface of her crack to attack her rivers of accumulated sweat directly. You tried to let out a scream as your senses were assaulted by Norah's overwhelming ass sweat but you didn't even let out a peep. Norah had done too much damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally felt your body pop free from the steaming cavern of Norah's walloping booty and tried to heave a sigh of relief. Only to have Norah plunge you back in even deeper than before! Wiping methodically all around, Norah wanted to make sure you got to every last drop she had worked up. After all, what kind of aunt would she be if she didn't allow you to utilize your utmost potential? Finally feeling decently cleaned up, Norah removed your battered and filthy form from her rear before discarding you among her other sopping garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarried through your home in Norah's arms, you feared you knew exactly where Norah was taking you. Even though she knew you were her nephew, was she still going to wash you amongst her clothes? As she dumped you into the washer, you saw her start to close the lid before you saw her appear startled by something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hunter, that's right!\" Thank god she had remembered you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for today! You really are such a godsend! Does today count as like, day one or day zero? Oh well, we'll figure it out!\" With that you saw her turn her back on you and you were cast into blackness as she closed the lid. \"Or maybe I should be saying you're welcome...?\" Norah mumbled as she headed off to the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later and light shone on you as Tracy's bratty face appeared above you. Restraining a chorus of laughter, Tracy just bellowed at you, \"How the hell did you get yourself into this one, Hunter? I mean really, you had your chance, and you blew it!\" Tracy had already picked you up and began placing you under the box once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is all I have to do to keep you out of my hair from now on, I'm much obliged to help!\" Tracy let the box fall with a smack, this time ensuring no loose limbs were sticking free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Norah knew right where to find you! \"Sure is sweet of you to make sure you stay flat by sleeping under this box, hon! That's the kind of attitude that will take you really far in my profession!\" Swinging you in her stride, Norah carried you off towards another day of torture. This time Norah ran you through the usual works, and you felt as helpless and worn out as ever, as did she! However notably Norah simply tossed you into the washer with a \"Thanks!\" before heading about her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Norah just gave you a casual good morning, and after that she seemed to fall silent in focus. Tossed without a care afterwards, you wondered when this would finally stop. The irony of that statement was that Norah seemed to particularly be enjoying these yoga sessions and began throwing in an extra one in the evening. She did have the free time after all since she was just looking after Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days droned on Norah spoke to you less and less. One session went by without even a word, and you worried Norah was beginning to forget you were even a person and not an extra special yoga rag. After a grueling SIX days under Norah she finally seemed to recall who you were and asked Tracy how long it had been with you in towel form. You did have some sort of deal after all, she was just a bit hazy with her memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure it's been about three days, so I'd say you have another seven before he wants some kind of reward.\" Tracy lied through her teeth to which Norah accepted without question. You tried to scream and protest with every fiber of your being, but Norah didn't feel a thing and merely tucked half of you into her waistband to carry. Taking you into the sweltering studio once more, Norah decided she'd really push herself to her limits while she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an excruciating two weeks of nonstop sweat, stench, crushing, and being squished into Norah, Tracy finally popped her head into the steamy studio one day and called out, struggling to restrain her coughing and hold her breath, \"Hey Norah, Mom just called! She'll be back tomorrow and said you can head out whenever!\" Portions of your soaked tan body were splayed out under Norah's thick ass as she responded, \"Thanks, dear, I'll probably get out of here this evening then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a week since Norah had even uttered a word to you, and whenever her eyes laid upon you, they were only filled with a gaze that conveyed her feelings of utility to you and not one of recognition. As Norah scrubbed you against each of her slick, sweaty soles at the end of that day's session, she felt a weird nagging in the back of her head that she was overlooking something. Whatever it was, she had the overwhelming sudden hunger for some ice cream as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after a particularly long and grueling session, Norah was packing her things away when she came upon your tan and flattened form. Gazing up at this uncaring gorgeous face, you prayed for some kind of recognition that this airhead would remember who you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith steadfast resolve, Norah decided your fate by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Norah held you up in front of her face. She had her head cocked slightly to the side and you saw a haze stirring in her eyes as she curiously stared at you. Why was she looking at you like this? If she was heading home it was time for you to be free from this duty as a living sweat rag. Or at the very least she could leave you in the washer, tucked in a drawer, or hell you'd even be fine with her giving you to Tracy; anything was better than having her not recognize you and somehow end up extending this torture. Thankfully she seemed to have a moment of clarity as her expression lit up and she looked at you fondly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, and how could I forget you?\" Norah chuckled to herself, you weren't sure if she was laughing at how she had totally forgotten you a moment ago or if she was just laughing because her own nephew was a towel in the palm of her hand. Unfortunately Norah's next words revealed it was neither: \"I don't know how I'd do yoga without it! Such an absorbent little thing...\". It? A thing?! Sure it had been two whole weeks but it was Norah's job to be looking after the two of you while she was here! All she had done was put you in more trouble! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying you down amongst her clothes, Norah was pressing down on you and all her belongings trying to get the bag to zip shut. You heard her begin cursing under her breath as her palm smooshed you down into a pair of her underwear. \"Stupid thing...everything fit in here on my way over...what gives?!\" Just at that moment, Tracy walked by Norah's guest room and saw her struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Aunt Norah?\" Tracy asked as innocently as ever. Wearing a frilly skirt she truly was as cute as could be, a true angel in the eyes of your aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wiped a droplet of sweat from her forehead, \"I can't close this dang suitcase! I hardly had any trouble getting it closed at home!\" Norah gave it another annoyed push before plopping down on the bed next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy was taping her chin curiously, then she saw your tan form squished and laying amongst a loose sock and a pile of underwear. A vibrant mischievous grin stretched across her supposedly innocent face. As you saw her approach you, you prayed that just this one time she'd show you a little mercy. Instead she did a twirl that lifted her skirt from the gust of wind and fell backwards. You saw nothing but a pair of pink and white striped panties painted on your sister's butt before it splatted down onto you. She huffed while hopping up and down for a moment, knocking the wind clear out of you. Norah was merely giggling watching the small girl make little progress. \"Now there's an idea, but let me show you how it's done!\" you heard Norah boom out and your eyes shot open in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah got up from the bed and let Tracy hop down before presenting her gigantic butt to you. It was wobbling and shaking menacingly even within the confines of Norah's tight leggings as Norah teased it against the suitcase a few times in preparation of something. \"Here goes nothing!\" She called before jumping and falling onto you. Not only was Norah far, far heavier than Tracy, she also had yet to shower or even change since that final yoga session this evening. So when Norah was grabbing the suitcase on each side and pulling herself into it with a determined rub down, you felt the life being squeezed from your body and were forced to endure the toxic taste and smell too. With a little help from Tracy, Norah's butt bomb had truly sealed the deal in trapping you in her suitcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy took one last look at you in the shape of Norah's ass print before taking a gamble and pointing at you. \"Taking mom's special towel home, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah smacked her forehead, \"Oh THAT'S where I got it! Oh, no. You don't think she'll miss it do you, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy pondered how much her mom would investigate your disappearance, and answered Norah's question with complete honesty, \"Probably, but it'll be our secret, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah pinched Tracy's cheek lightly and said \"You're such a sweetheart, you know that. Thank goodness too, I really didn't want to part with this little rag. Nothing like it has been able to keep up with my yoga, it's like it was <i>made</i> for <i>me</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the strong pressure from the suitcase but it wasn't anything you couldn't handle. You sighed a breath of relief to be free from Norah's ass for a moment before you remembered where you were and why you were there. You were headed to Norah's house. And she had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted a new round of struggling and fighting but Norah and Tracy didn't notice a thing as Tracy carried you out to Norah's car. Tossing you into her trunk and brushing her hands from a job well done, Norah gave Tracy a huge hug and kiss before heading towards her car door. \"Oh wait a second, where the heck is Hunter? I feel just <i>awful </i>leaving without giving him a goodbye kiss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy bit her lip nervously, this was exactly what she was afraid of. Luckily she was ready, \"I'm pretty sure he's been away at a friend's or something. Such a shame he's not here to see you off, he <b>loves </b>your kisses!\" Tracy couldn't help but snicker recalling your detailed description of how overpowering and nauseating an Aunt Norah kiss was and how you avoided them at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww that's a shame, I felt like he was <i>right </i>with us these past few weeks but I suppose looking back I can't really place how.\" Norah's face clouded for a moment before she cheered up, \"Oh well! I'll just give him double kisses next time I see him! Love ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could have heard a fraction of that conversation you would have cried out. But all you felt was the vibration of the car as it roared to life and Norah pulled out of your driveway. Tracy waved her car goodbye before breaking into a gut-busting laughing spree. You let loose a blood-curdling scream as every second of Norah's foot on the gas was another bit you were further from your home. From the place people knew who you were. Where people actually looked out for you, checking where they step and sit. Norah had none of these attributes. This could be a long trip from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three quiet hours in the trunk of Norah's car, you felt the engine shut off and a moment later you were hoisted up in her arms. Getting into her home, Norah deposited her suitcase lazily at the foot of her bed before leaving it there to get a midnight snack. She truly left a little too late and after a long drive her stomach was growling. \"Hmmmmmm...want something...sweet!\" Norah mused as she popped open her freezer. Spotting exactly what her stomach was calling for, Norah got a bowl and took a big scoop out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sweet and creamy flavors of the vanilla ice cream danced on her tongue, Norah felt some kind of tickle in the back of her mind. Was she forgetting something? As she took another large glob into her mouth, the tiny form of her nephew popped into her mind. She gushed, sweet ice cream and thoughts of such a sweet and helpful little guy swimming in her head. A hot wave of passion rose up her body as a ridiculous thought rolled through her mind...if only Hunter could come stay with her for some time. Sure her place was smaller than yours, but did it really matter to him? (Of course it did since it increased your chance of run-ins with clueless Norah). Licking the last drops from her bowl with her pointer finger, she sucked off the last of the sweet cream with a final thought that she'd propose the idea to your mom next time she was asked to babysit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing her bowl and putting it away, Norah clicked her tongue savoring the aftertaste and having funny afterthoughts of her last idea. Suddenly Norah's heart beat accelerated at the thought of Hunter joining her for one of her yoga sessions. She bet you'd be so ridiculously accommodating you might even volunteer to wipe the sweat off her. To act as a...sweat...rag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah raced up the stairs. It couldn't really be true, right? Tracy said he had been at a friend's house. But the pieces seemed to fit, the ice cream, the yoga, her thoughts of you. Prying open her suitcase she was feeling a turbulent mix of emotions. She wanted to see her favorite tiny nephew but also was worried he'd be upset if he truly had been her towel all that time. A tiny part of her was actually hoping she didn't have to make that grueling drive back to her sisters house too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight shone on you and Norah practically ripped her suitcase open. \"Hunter?! Are you in here?!\" You saw her face painted with a kind of anxious smile that made you wonder just what she was thinking...</span></div></div>",

If you\u2019re sure, then that\u2019s okay, but\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d Quinn interrupted, though you could tell it was from nervousness and not from being rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your cue, you sat back and smiled at your beautiful giantess roommate. \u201cAlright. Go ahead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl\u2019s lips curled up into a smile that vanished as soon as it appeared. \u201cSure. Well, basically, my childhood was pretty simple. I\u2019m an only child, so it was just me and my mom for\u2026well\u2026as long as I can remember. No clue when dad skipped out, but I must\u2019ve been only a few months old. Mom always said it was because he wanted a boy, not a \u2018weak little girl\u2019, in his words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that, Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged, with only a faint wetness in her eye telling you how she really felt. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever. Anyway, my mom\u2026uh, her name is Becky, by the way. She had to care for me all by herself, but she caught a lucky break when she started up an online retailer website with one of her good friends. She and her friend would buy stuff from all over, and sell it for a few bucks cheaper online. However, they\u2019d ship it all across the country, so they\u2019d earn back a profit from shipping costs added onto the customer\u2019s totals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was rambling by this point, and sensing that she was, she stopped herself to breath and blush ever-so-slightly. You smiled gently, amused by seeing a different side of Quinn from her normally apathetic behavior. It was clear that she held great respect and love for her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming, Quinn cleared her throat. \u201cBasically, it wasn\u2019t long before her store was getting revenue from ads, and gaining traction. Blah blah. It\u2019s now pretty popular, and my mom soon became the manager instead of a direct buyer and supplier. She\u2019s actually got a small team of people who do the daily work. She pretty much just lives her own personal life each and every day, save for a few meetings or phone calls each week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, suitably impressed. \u201cWow, that\u2019s great. What\u2019s the website called?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, called Shipping Hero. The motto is \u2018finding the heroic deals, and shipping them to wherever you may be\u2019. Tacky, right?\u201d Quinn rolled her eyes as she spoke, but you gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. Tracy and I used to use that site all the time. That\u2019s crazy?\u201d You laughed, and Quinn actually chuckled a bit too. A moment later, you motioned for Quinn to continued. \u201cOkay, so, your mom\u2019s job was awesome, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh.\u201d Quinn said, while reaching for her phone. \u201cIt meant she had pretty much everyday free to baby me and dote on me like I was a little kid. I mean, yeah, I guess I was at one point, but she is still way too clingy and lovey-dovey. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d Quinn scrolled around on her phone. \u201cLike, see, look at this, Hunter. Our last vacation to the local amusement park. Can you believe her?\u201d Quinn leaned forward in her seat and shoved the phone towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to take a step back to fully analyze the photo, as it was practically a movie theater screen at your size. Glancing over the photo, you were about to respond to Quinn when your jaw dropped. The picture showed Quinn and a woman who looked startlingly similar to her beside a cardboard cutout of an animal mascot. Quinn was wincing from embarrassment, while the older woman was grinning like a child, while also clad in a t-shirt that read \u201cMy Daughter Is a Sweet Angel\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis humorous aspect contrasted sharply with the woman\u2019s outrageously pronounced curves. Surpassing even Quinn, the woman\u2019s breasts stretched her too-tight top to the extreme, and you could plainly see her abundantly large rear end even from the front. Her hourglass figure was immaculate and hard to look away from, and it now made perfect sense where Quinn had inherited her own blessedly bountiful body from. Some strand of curviness genes clearly ran in the Wallace family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes from Quinn\u2019s mother, you met your roommate\u2019s gaze and laughed. \u201cShe seems like an awesome woman!\u201d<br>\r\nThough intended as a light-hearted remark, Quinn\u2019s face feel. \u201cYou\u2019d actually hate her, Hunter. Or rather\u2026I guess she\u2019d hate you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, confused. \u201cWhat do you mean, Quinn? Does she warm up slowly to strangers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour titanic new friend laughed humorlessly. \u201cNo, I wish. Truthfully, she despises tinies. Finds them distasteful and gross. She\u2019s said so herself, word for word. She never told me why she hated tinies so strongly\u2026but god she made it really damn clear with her actions. The things I\u2019ve seen her do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn trailed off, and your blood ran cold. There was a haunted look in Quinn\u2019s eye, and a part of you didn\u2019t want her to elaborate on whatever memories she was reliving. The other part of you knew that Quinn should, so that she could get it off her chest and allow total transparency between her and yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing, Quinn looked at you and sighed. \u201cSee, I used to have a lot of tiny friends. As in, way more than my normal-sized friends. I spent everyday hanging out with the tinies from my neighborhood and school. Trouble was, my doting and clingy mother was never far off, and when she\u2019d find out about my tiny friends\u2026it wasn\u2019t long before I\u2019d never see them again. And if it wasn\u2019t my mom, it was just fate itself screwing over every single tiny I\u2019ve ever known. Wasn\u2019t long before I had no more friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly knew what to say, and could only gently rest your hand on Quinn\u2019s thumb (as her hand holding the phone was still lying on the bed beside you. Touched by your gesture, Quinn spared you a quick smile before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason I care so much about you guys being strong and capable.\u201d Quinn elaborated. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too many people treat you like, frankly, pieces of shit. It HURTS, watching it happen, but I can\u2019t save every tiny, and god help me if I make things worse by trying. What I CAN do, though, is treat you like equals, with respect and dignity, and help you to get tougher all on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a whole new side of Quinn, and you were floored. Someone who had seemed like a cut-and-dry case of nonchalant emo girl had broken into a million pieces, revealing the caring girl with forward-thinking ideas and a traumatic past dueling inside of her. Your new roommate was the single most incredible and interesting person you\u2019d ever met in your life, and you felt a rush of awe and something a little bit more as you looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment of silence hung in the air, before Quinn coughed and refocused herself. \u201cUm, anyway\u2026ask away, Hunter. I\u2019ll tell whatever stories you want, the good and bad. Shoot.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI was wondering if you could tell me more about what exactly it is that your mom had done to tinies in the past?\u201d <br>\r\nAs you asked this you saw a brief look of confusion flash across Quinn\u2019s face.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know that? I wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to hear about the horrible things she does to people like you,\u201d the look of confusion only lasted a second, going back to her usual neutral expression fairly quickly.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess it just seems like you\u2019re not the kind of person who would talk about this kind of stuff normally. I think it would be good for you to get it out,\u201d what you said to Quinn was true, but since this was Quinn\u2019s mom, you also wanted to get information so you knew what to avoid if she ever came over while you were here. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to keep this sort of stuff to yourself, it would maybe be good for you to talk about it.\u201d<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s cheeks blushed slightly and she showed a faint smile before quietly uttering a soft \u201cthanks\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted uncomfortably, seeming reluctant to talk about it.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, we don\u2019t have to talk about it if you don\u2019t want to. If I overstepped we can talk about something-\u201c you were cut off again as Quinn\u2019s nervous talking interrupted you again.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m good, it\u2019s fine... I\u2019m just trying to think of where to start.\u201d <br>\r\nShe sat there for a few moments, trying to figure out where to start. Suddenly she seemed to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk so... as I said I had a lot of tiny friends growing up. My mom was usually very discreet in how she got rid of them, most of the time I suspected she had done something to them but there was never any evidence,\u201d she sighed, obviously thinking about all the friends she had lost. \u201cUntil one time that I had two friends over, they were brothers, twins. Their names were Jack and Henry. This was when I was around fourteen. We were in my room, just chatting, when I suddenly needed to use the bathroom. On the way out I noticed my mom standing in the hall, in hindsight she was probably eavesdropping on us. I don\u2019t know why, but I noticed at the time that she was standing barefoot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo I go and use the bathroom, I\u2019m only in there for five minutes at most. When I come out my mom was waiting outside. She said that Jack and Harry\u2019s parents had showed up and they had left. I had thought it was strange but I just shrugged and took her word for it. Just as I walked past I happened to glance down and see that she was wearing a pair of tan socks. I had thought it was strange but didn\u2019t realise what had actually happened till after I walked into my room and sat down.\u201d She paused, clearly collecting herself. You put your hand on her thumb reassuringly once again, which got another small smile from her.<br>\r\n\u201cSo I rushed downstairs to confront her about it... but once I got downstairs I saw her pulling on some running shoes over my friends. I actually saw one of their faces on the sole of her foot! I was in so much shock I couldn\u2019t say anything. She turned to look at me and got this huge smile on her face, she said something along the lines of \u201coh my sweet little angel, you look more beautiful every day\u201d before hugging me,\u201d she almost seemed to gag at the thought of her mother\u2019s shower of affection. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to confront her, she was being so doting and loving, I couldn\u2019t start a fight with her about it. She was one of the few people I was really close to at that time, I didn\u2019t want to risk that. So I didn\u2019t do anything, and she went off on a run, she must have ditched them somewhere because I never saw her wearing them again, and I didn\u2019t see them ever again. They could still be out somewhere because I was too afraid to ruin my relationship with my mom, as well as all the other tiny guys she\u2019s gotten rid of over the years.\u201d<br>\r\nA single tear rolled its way down Quinn\u2019s pale cheek, and there was a faint wetness in her eyes. She obviously felt incredibly guilty about it. Still holding your hands on her thumb, you looked up to your giantess roommate.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, none of that was your fault. Your mom made those choices, it\u2019s perfectly understandable to not want to jeopardise your relationship with her since it\u2019s obvious you two were really close. Please don\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d she hung her head low even as you said this. \u201cJust give me a warning whenever she comes over so I can find a good hiding place.\u201d <br>\r\nYou thought ending with a lighthearted joke would be best to cheer her up, and you did get a faint chuckle out of her.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Hunter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you with a slightly more serious face.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you warning before she comes over if she ever does, I haven\u2019t told her where I live yet but I imagine she\u2019ll find out eventually. So I\u2019ll give you a few tips on her behaviour around tiny guys. She will act innocent and sweet when me or any other people her size are around. She usually crushes tinies on purpose but will pass it off as an accident. I\u2019d also guess that she\u2019d try to hide you on herself somewhere the instant she\u2019s alone, because whenever a friend disappeared it was usually after I\u2019d left them alone. I also don\u2019t have any evidence for this but I\u2019m sure she probably used Shipping Hero to get rid of some of them, but I can\u2019t say for sure. So if she ever comes here I\u2019ll make sure either me, Morgan or Avery will be with you at all times,\u201d she didn\u2019t smile down at you, but you could tell from her eyes that she was trying to reassure you. \u201cNormally I\u2019d be inclined to let you fend for yourself, but I\u2019ve lost too many friends to her to let that happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Quinn, and for my part I\u2019ll try to keep a low profile when she\u2019s around,\u201d you smile up to her.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s probably best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n1) You and Quinn continue to talk.<br>\r\n2) Morgan and Avery want to do something as a group.<br>\r\n3) There\u2019s a knock at the door, Becky has tracked Quinn down and come to visit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey, I actually have a question for each of you.\u201d You said after a moment. Seeing each of your new roommates look a bit more intently at you after saying that froze you up for a second, and you coughed awkwardly. \u201cI-it\u2019s a little\u2026strange, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled calmingly. \u201cGo on. You don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to judge you, or anything, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery cheerfully grinned. \u201cAsk away, little buddy! We\u2019d do anything for our tiny new roommate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn motioned with her head for you to continue. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat. \u201cWell, just like you three, I\u2019ve now graduated college. I have a degree in Communications, but honestly, it\u2019s not my passion. I guess I don\u2019t really have a direction in life. I consider myself pretty competent, especially for a tiny, but I don\u2019t have a clue what my future has in store for me.\u201d You paused to shuffle your feet awkwardly. \u201cBasically, I wanted to hear about the jobs that you three have. Maybe that would give me some ideas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh. Is that all? Were you thinking of maybe tagging along with us to our jobs and applying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery practically squealed with delight at the very thought. \u201cEee! That\u2019s so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded approvingly. \u201cMakes sense. Good idea, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You replied to Quinn, before looking at Morgan. \u201cMorgan, could you start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, totally.\u201d The dark brown-haired girl said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been working as an assistant employee at this local gym for a little while now. It\u2019s called \u2018Workout World\u2019. It\u2019s your standard gym, with a whole bunch of exercise machines and weights and what-not. We also have a few rooms in the back for special daily and weekly classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter working at the gym for a while, I was just recently promoted. I now teach a weekly yoga class starting\u2026tomorrow, I guess\u2026and I\u2019m really pumped about that. Might have trouble reigning myself in.\u201d Morgan sheepishly smiled, admitting to her intensive workout routine. \u201cBut yeah, other than that I just do odds and ends jobs at the gym. Cleaning, registering new members, helping people with troublesome machines. That sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d You said, giving her a thumbs up. \u201cThank you for being so thorough. How about you, Avery?\u201d You asked, turning to the pink-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned wildly. \u201cOkay, so like, I have the best job in the world. I\u2019m totally pretty, right?\u201d Avery struck a pose and giggled, earning a nod from you and Quinn, and an eye roll from Morgan. \u201cApparently, other people totes think so too, because I got recruited right out of high school to be a model! And, and, and\u2026\u201d Avery nearly hyperventilated. \u201c\u2026I just landed the biggest gig of my life. I\u2019m going to be a featured model for Starlight Studios!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a nerd and don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Avery stuck out her tongue at Morgan playfully. \u201c\u2026Starlight Studios is a really huge photo agency near here. I\u2019ve been there a few weeks, and it\u2019s uber heaven! I can just wear cute outfits all day, pose for the camera, and come home with so much dough! Best of all, there totes aren\u2019t any tiny models working at the studios, so you\u2019d have a hella easy time getting hired!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to take all that in, then nodded. \u201cUh\u2026thanks Avery. That sounds like a lot of fun. What about you, Quinn?\u201d You inquired, looking at last to your final roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, really. Nothing special. I wanted to get outside and around people a bit more, so I applied as a lifeguard at the beach near here. \u2018Sanderson Beach\u2019, heard of it? Anyway, they picked me. I\u2019ve been working there for a month now. It\u2019s not too bad, I guess, though the sun is hell on my skin. I have to put sunscreen on twice a day, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026yeah, it\u2019s as simple as it sounds. I\u2019m either assigned to sit in one of the lifeguard towers and look out over the beach for any signs of trouble, or I patrol the sands, up and down the beach, and help people that way. Boring, but the right kind of boring.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd it feels good to help people out\u2026sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded appreciatively. \u201cOkay, thank you, Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan leaned forward in her seat, a glimmer of hopefulness shining in her eyes. \u201cRealistically, Hunter, you could only take one job. So, who do you want to go into work with tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery also leaned forward in her seat, though much more dramatically than her twin, and her breasts threatened to spill from her top. It was hard not to look. \u201cYeah, yeah! Who do you wanna tag along with, cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn made no attempt to lean in, but she did raise her eyebrow questioningly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me who you go with.\u201d She said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you could feel that this was a tremendously important moment, and so you really stopped to think about it. Who did you want to go with, and what job were you looking to pursue?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the gym would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s probably a lot I could do there that might help out. And I mean, I\u2019m pretty fit for a tiny. I could help show people how to do stretches and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled warmly. \u201cI agree! \u2018Workout World\u2019 having a tiny fitness instructor helping out would be amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Avery was pretty upset that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Quinn seemed mostly indifferent like normal, but with a twinge of disappointment on her face. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to Morgan standing above you, gently saying your name to ease you out of slumber land. Giggling at your messy hair and bleary expression, Morgan carried you into the bathroom where you freshened up, and then into the kitchen. She fixed herself some cereal, making sure to give you a few crunchy pieces and a bottle cap filled with milk to serve as your own breakfast. It was incredible how good of a caretaker she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you both got changed into fresh sets of clothes, and you had to fight not to stare too much as Morgan returned from her bedroom wearing only a dark blue sports bra and matching compression shorts. Her clothing left most of her smooth, toned body on full display, while also highlighting and accentuating her sculpted curves. She was like a goddess of fitness, the ideal vision of physical perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring did not go unnoticed, and Morgan playfully flicked you for ogling her, before picking you up again. Saying goodbye to Quinn, who was eating her own breakfast (Avery was apparently still asleep upstairs), you and Morgan left the apartment. Morgan only took a small bag of spare clothes and a water bottle with her. She walked straight out to her car, and slid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepositing you gently in the passenger\u2019s seat, you held onto the tethered seat belt to anchor yourself, and then the two of you were off. It was only a twenty-minute drive to \u201cWorkout World\u201d, and you passed the time chatting with Morgan. She was the only girl you\u2019d ever met outside of your family who treated you respectfully and sincerely, and earnestly treated you like a normal human being. It was an amazing feeling, and a flutter went off in your chest each time she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to \u201cWorkout World\u201d, Morgan parked her car, scooped you into her palm, grabbed her bag, and then headed inside. As she approached the gym, you noted that it didn\u2019t look particularly too crazy from the outside. Just a run-of-the-mill gym, but perhaps a bit bigger than normal. It looked like it stretched back for a while, taking up a decent amount of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis observation was explained when Morgan walked through the door. Exercise machines as far as the eye could see stretched in all directions. Bikes, treadmills, rowing machines, elliptical machines, stair walkers, and more. One whole wall was taken up by a wide array of exercise mats, jump ropes, yoga balls, weights, and other assorted workout props. In the far back, you could see the doors leading to those exercise class rooms Morgan had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess carrier approached the front desk, where a brilliantly smiling receptionist was waiting. The receptionist stood as Morgan approached, and you verbally choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist (who appeared to be in her thirties), was dressed in the same attire as Morgan, a sports bra and compression shorts. This indicated she was also a fitness instructor. However, due to being older and more mature, her more developed body strained at the seams of the sports bra and shorts, threatening to snap the fabric at any second. It was an incredibly risqu\u00e9 outfit choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, it would\u2019ve been under normal circumstances. Glancing around the gym, which already had quite a few people in it, you didn\u2019t see a single guy. There were giantesses of all ages, but no men to be seen. Was this a female only gym, or just a random coincidence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Mayfield.\u201d Morgan waved to the receptionist. It was then that you noted the receptionist\u2019s nametag, pinned proudly to her right breast. It read: \u2018Heather Mayfield, Workout World Director\u2019. Apparently, she was the big boss around here, but it was hard to fully believe that. Something about her aforementioned revealing clothing, and her mane of wavy blonde hair and young-looking face felt out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMah stars, Morgan!\u201d Heather clapped her hands together and grinned. \u201cIs that a darlin\u2019 lil\u2019 tiny in yer hand?\u201d She asked, pointing to you. Her southern drawl was unexpected, but her tone was light and airy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Morgan nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s my new roommate, Hunter. He was wondering if he could apply for a job here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather beamed at you and Morgan. \u201cWhy, I reckon\u2019 he can, honey! Shoot, ah\u2019ll draw up the contract fer ya\u2019ll right now!\u201d The buxom woman bent over to dig around in her desk for a paper and pen, and you couldn\u2019t help but notice the pendulum swaying motion of her tits as she did so. It was difficult to imagine this curvy woman leading any fitness classes. She reminded you of your own mother, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stood back up, contract in hand. Placing it proudly on the desk in front of you, you hopped down from Morgan\u2019s hand and read it carefully. Everything seemed to be in order, so with some help from Morgan, it only took you a minute to sign your name. You were now an official member of the \u2018Workout World\u2019 team. That was easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling down at you in a friendly manner, Morgan gave you a thumbs up, then returned her attention to her boss. \u201cSo, Miss Mayfield, what\u2019s on my agenda today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather waved dismissively at Morgan. \u201cMorgan, honey, ah told ya to call me Heather. But, anywho, yer main job today is to teach that yoga class. \u2018Sides that, just help out \u2018til yer shift ends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what should I do Miss\u2026er\u2026Heather?\u201d You spoke up, striking a confident pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather laughed uproariously at your show of bravado, infectiously guffawing for a solid thirty seconds before calming down. \u201cYou, lil\u2019 mister, have a special task fer yer first day. Ready fer it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded enthusiastically, and Heather cleared her throat before continuing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThere are two big thangs every gym employee needs ta know!\u201d Heather smiled warmly at you, but with an earnest and serious look in her eye. \u201cOne: Ya gotta know yer stuff. How else can ya help out? Two: Ya gotta be all comfy-like around strangers. I\u2019m expectin\u2019 ya\u2019ll to help anyone in need, and ya have ta be ready fer that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded vigorously. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I can handle that, Heather!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather\u2019s intensity eased up a little. \u201cI know ya can, little guy. I believe in ya, Hunter. Tha\u2019s why yer first task is ta co-teach with my darlin\u2019 Morgan. Both of ya can work together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised you slightly, but also made a reasonable amount of sense. You just hoped Morgan wouldn\u2019t feel like you were intruding on her personal class. \u201cO-of course, Heather. I\u2019d be glad to help Morgan out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned. \u201cGlad to hear it, honey. Off ya go, now! Reckon\u2019 yer class is startin\u2019 any minute now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, you and Morgan were off. Morgan placed you back in her hand, and you held on nice and tight as she walked quickly towards the back of the Workout World gym, towards one of the side rooms. Slipping inside, you found the room empty of people, but filled with a surplus of exercise gear and supplies. About twenty, tan-colored yoga mats were spread out in rows facing a singular red yoga mat (presumably Morgan\u2019s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hunter, first day on the job! It\u2019s pretty awesome that we\u2019ll be co-teaching.\u201d She said, beaming at you. This alleviated your earlier worry. \u201cThough, you might want to let me field day one, and just copy my movements. Honestly, can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019ll be too much help for people behind the first row.\u201d The dark brown-haired giantess smiled sheepishly at you. \u201cMaybe later on we can have you walk around with the girls for more focused help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused. \u201cThe girls? And the guys too, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan actually blushed, faintly. \u201cUh\u2026no. No, sorry Hunter. This class is entirely female. You\u2019ll be the only guy.\u201d She admitted, and try as you might, you couldn\u2019t help but let your jaw drop open. This brought Morgan\u2019s teasing nature back, and she smirked playfully. \u201cWon\u2019t be a problem, will it, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uh\u2026nope! N-no problem, Miss Sinclair.\u201d You hastily saluted, hoping comedy would detract from your obvious fantasizing about this upcoming class. It apparently worked, as Morgan rolled her eyes at your antics and dropped the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also dropped you, though quite gently, squatting down to the floor and depositing you onto her red yoga mat. The view of the class was significantly different from such an angle, as was the view of your beautifully, revealingly dressed roommate and co-teacher. Half of Morgan\u2019s face was blocked by her breasts from the vantage you were now at. It was very, very hard to not stare at her toned, lithe figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your eye, Morgan motioned to the mats spread across the floor. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious why no one is here, that\u2019s because everyone usually shows up right as the class starts.\u201d Morgan shrugged. \u201cIt makes sense to not show up early. I mean, we stretch and do warm-ups in class, so what could you even accomplish by coming early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose!\u201d You said, raising your voice just a bit so that she could hear you without bending back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t stop me from doing a few quick stretches to limber up!\u201d Morgan smiled, and instantly launched into a few toe-touching and yoga posing warm-ups. You decided to follow suit, copying her movements as best you could, albeit on a one-inch scale. Morgan was a master, but you found her moves so succinct and smooth that even you could keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, it was hard not to notice how close her left foot kept drifting towards your body on some of her stretches. Her toes, sliding along the yoga mat, came quite close to making you uncomfortable, as you knew it would only take a slight shift on Morgan\u2019s part to bury you completely under them. Glancing up at Morgan, you noted a content but focused expression on her face, and realized that she really did zone out while exercising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and the rest of the class arrived almost simultaneously, proving Morgan correct. Your own fantasies were also instantly confirmed, as it seemed that every single woman entering the class was utterly and unfathomably beautiful. Curvy, lean, beautiful, and alluring, each new girl caused your jaw to drop even further. This was to say nothing of how their tight workout clothing drew your eyes to them even more. Some girls wore yoga pants or tank tops, and some had booty shorts and sports bras even skimpier than Morgan\u2019s own revealing attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl in the room closed the door, and noticed that the last empty yoga mat was right in front of Morgan. Cutting through the room, she smiled politely at Morgan and took up position on the mat. However, as she steadied herself, her gaze locked right onto you, your miniscule form still down at Morgan\u2019s feet. You gave her a wave, trying to appear confident. The girl raised her eyebrows, then smiled flirtatiously and gave you a wink. THAT certainly was a little foreboding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had pretty long black hair that was tied back in a messy ponytail, and judging from the shape of her eyes and face, and her tanned skin tone, she was of some Asian descent. She was a fairly curvaceous giantess, but her eye-catching curves were exasperated further by her one-size too small tank top and ludicrously minimalistic booty shorts. At the point they were at, they looked more like panties, revealing her long legs all the way up to her crotch, and most of her ass, if you had to guess. She almost certainly had nothing but a thong on underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept staring at you with a seductive grin, but broke her gaze when Morgan spoke up. \u201cAlright, girls! My name is Morgan Sinclair, but you can just call me Morgan. This marks the first day of our all-encompassing exercise class. Over the next few months, we\u2019re going to be doing everything you\u2019ve ever imagined goes on inside a gym, and much more. Stretches, poses, usage of equipment and machines\u2026you name it. It WILL be exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m not the one who has to lead you through this alone. Joining me in this endeavor of teaching the class is my good friend, Hunter. In case you don\u2019t see him\u2026he\u2019s down by my feet.\u201d As one, all twenty girls taking the class peered down at Morgan\u2019s feet, and locked eyes with you. Any speech you had prepared died on your lips as twenty beautiful, sexily dressed giantesses stared at you intently. Some had looks of surprise, others happy expressions, a few matched the flirtatiousness of the girl in front of you, and a few even looked disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan drew eyes back to her. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a tiny, and by extension, a guy. There will not be any other guys in this class, as Hunter is the exception. He just joined as an employee of this gym, and needs all the experience he can get. He\u2019ll help all of you out, just make sure to treat him nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammered out a welcome. \u201cI-I look forward\u2026to h-helping!\u201d Your feeble reply was so quiet that no one in the class seemed to even hear it, not even Morgan, who was already pushing out with her introductory spiel. Only the girl in front of you, her eyes constantly flicking down to you, seemed to pick up on your pathetic statement. She flashed you a quick smile and another wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan went around the room asking everyone to give their name, their estimated level of exercise experience, and one fun fact about them. You lost track of names almost immediately, even though Morgan demonstrated enviably capability in memorizing everyone\u2019s name. To your credit, you were still distracted by the girl in front of you, who kept doing seemingly absentminded things like adjusting her tank top or picking at her shorts. However, from the way she never tore her gaze from you, you knew all her casually seductive actions were on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was last to enter, she was last to introduce herself, and your flirtatious terrorizer smiled broadly to the class. \u201cSup everyone! My name is Aoi, and I\u2019m stoked for this class. My level of exercise is\u2026probably moderate? I do a lot of stretches and yoga, but not much else. A fun fact would be that I find tinies to be the cutest little things! Lucky me, huh?\u201d Aoi gestured to you, and you flushed bright red. A few other girls, and even Morgan, laughed. It was clear that Morgan took Aoi\u2019s statement as lighthearted teasing and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gave her class a thumbs up. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s all the boring stuff out of the way! Ready to get into it, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of cheers and shouts answered her, and Morgan prepared to launch into the starting warmups. You did so too, but not without catching Aoi\u2019s eye on last time. The flirty and mischievous glint in Aoi\u2019s eye told you everything. Getting a good exercise was now second priority to her. Having fun with you was her only true goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you could only hope that Morgan could keep Aoi and the other girls at bay for this first day. Of course, it she got lost in the rhythm of exercise, you\u2019d be practically gone from her world, and left alone to defend yourself. Truly, what had you gotten yourself into?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to start with a few standard standing exercises. Get the blood flowing in our arms a bit.\u201d Morgan explained to the class, then effortlessly switched into holding her arms by her chest and twisting her torso side-to-side. Her motions were slow but deliberate, stretching her muscles nicely while also serving as any easy example for everyone in the class to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mirrored your giantess co-teacher\u2019s display without a problem, and you could only hope the rest of the class would be this easy. As it was, only the first row of girls actually paid you any mind, and even then, Aoi was the only girl to stare at you consistently, her attention seemingly unable to lock onto anything but you. You faltered a bit, under her flirtatiously predatory gaze, but kept up with Morgan\u2019s pace, determined not to fail at your first ever class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan moved on to arm windmills and shoulder stretches, with you and the rest of the class following suit. One of the girls even asked if some light music could be turned on, and after Morgan agreed, soft peppy rock music filtered through the room, helping everyone to get into the mood. You would\u2019ve considered it fun if it wasn\u2019t for Aoi\u2019s continual sultry winks. Truthfully though, it was pretty much heaven, guiding a group of curvaceous beauties through their exercise routines. You couldn\u2019t complain TOO much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good ten minutes or so, Morgan clapped her hands to draw everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAlright, great job so far, ladies! This is awesome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Morgan clenched her fist excitedly, earning a few smiles and laughs from the class. It was hard for anyone to resist being drawn up into Morgan\u2019s whirlwind of excitement and passion for exercise. \u201cTime for some stretches for our legs, and then the crazy stuff will come next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, without hesitation, plopped down onto her yoga mat, firm buttocks clapping onto the ground. She wasn\u2019t that close to hitting you, but the sight still chilled your blood, and your legs wobbled from the vibrations of her impact. Of course, you straight up fell onto your back as the other giantesses in the class sat down at once, their combined weight hitting the floor causing a veritable earthquake from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up, you caught the eye of Aoi, who was looking at you with a grin, clearly amused by seeing you topple over. Worse still, as Morgan stretched her legs out in front of her to set the example for the class, Aoi did so as well. In a flash, her right foot kicked out towards you, stopping right before coming into contact with your body. You flinched and let out a tiny, almost inaudible cry, and were left with the black-haired girl\u2019s foot hanging precariously over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to crawl back to a safe distance when Morgan spoke up, momentarily distracting you. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s start with some simple stretches. Lean forward and touch your toes, if you can. Some of you more endowed girls might not make it, but any amount of stretching helps.\u201d This statement caused a bit of embarrassed blushing from the aforementioned top-heavy students, but everyone still followed along to the best of their ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being quite abundantly blessed in the chest department herself, Aoi demonstrated unfathomable flexibility by easily leaning all the way forward, bending her back to touch her toes with ease. As she did so, she peered down at you, her smug grin only growing in size as she noticed your horribly failed attempts to avert your gaze from the abyss of her cleavage. Truly, her breasts looked fit to pop right out of her size-too-small top from the simple movements of her leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by Aoi, you missed a girl a little ways to your left, also in the front row, who was visibly struggling with keeping up with Morgan. She\u2019d been one of the girls Morgan had been speaking to earlier, and her astronomically gargantuan breasts were comical in scale, and utterly hindering her movements. Thankfully, Morgan caught sight of her struggle, but you mentally chastised yourself for letting Aoi distract you from your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Morgan said to the girl, focusing all her attention on her. \u201cEasy, slow movements. I know it can be tricky.\u201d Morgan\u2019s tone was soft and soothing, full of encouragement, and the girl (who had looked fit to cry any moment), blushed and gave Morgan a grateful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, mischievous thoughts were spiraling around in Aoi\u2019s head, and seeing Morgan totally absorbed in helping the other girl, she sprang at her golden opportunity. Tilting her foot ever-so-slightly, she was able to press against your head, nearly knocking you off balance. Before you could cry out, Aoi\u2019s bare toes wiggled and lashed out, scrunching your head tightly into a viper-like embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to keep her smile hidden, Aoi methodically massaged her toes against your head, crumpling up your squishy body more and more into the crevices of her toes. You fought fiercely against the busty Asian giantesses unexpected attack, but your pitiful slaps against her soft flesh were futile. Soon, she\u2019d bundled your body into a lump, tucked away under her clenched toes and totally hidden from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo less than a second later, Morgan drew her attention back to the class at large, sparing a smile to Aoi (who in turn grinned innocently at her teacher), and then Morgan finished her reps of toe touching. Utterly oblivious to what had occurred, her exercise-focused brain kept her from remembering you, as it instead devoted all of her mental power to running this class perfectly and helping everyone out. You were the least of her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan cleared her throat. \u201cAlright, girls! One more quick stretch for our backs. Tuck your legs underneath yourselves and sit back on your feet. Then, we\u2019ll be leaning forward to try and touch our heads to the yoga mats. Only a few reps of this!\u201d Morgan gave her class a confident thumbs up and then demonstrated the pose. The endowed class members frowned a bit, but followed instructions best they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flexible girls took eagerly to this stretch, Aoi included. In fact, Aoi was riding on cloud nine, hardly able to believe her luck in landing such a perfect routine. The stars had aligned in such a way that playtime with the adorable tiny teacher she\u2019d just snatched off the floor was going to be oh-so-much fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning fast, Aoi tucked her legs under herself in a kneeling pose, and unfurled her toes. Your mangled body was given only seconds to unfurl a bit from the release of pressure. Spots of dirt and a thing layer of sweat had already rubbed off onto you, and you blinked rapidly to clear your vision. Facing up to the ceiling while lying on Aoi\u2019s foot, you caught a brief glimpse of her gorgeous face displaying a full grin of mischief, before the flirtatious giantess sat back onto her feet\u2026and onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick, meaty ass filled your entire vision as she sat, deeply tanned flesh nearly on full display as her ludicrously immodest booty shorts had wedged up into her butt crack. With the weight of a meteor from the heavens, Aoi\u2019s plump booty crashed down onto her feet, and right onto your defenseless body. Offering no resistance, your malleable form squelched under her, flattening out into a paper-thin disc against the girl\u2019s exposed left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi bit her lip softly as she sat back on her feet, just barely hearing the sound of you squishing to her ass, but also knowing no one else in the class could hear it. She had you all to herself, and she was going to savor every moment she had with the hottie tiny she\u2019d landed as a teacher. Already, her mind was swirling with ideas for how to sneak you back home with her for more fun times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kneeling and bending forward exercise only lasted three minutes or so in total, but it felt like an eternity with Aoi\u2019s immense weight crushing down on you the entire time. Each passing second stuck you more and more to her bare flesh, especially as her continued stretching brought on a fresh layer of sticky sweat to her smooth skin. Smushed face first into her butt, you stuck to her like glue, and began to wonder how hard it\u2019d be to get free once given the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your heart shattered into pieces a moment later, as through a veil of muffled noises, you just barely picked up Morgan declaring, \u201cOkay, class! Legs back out front, we\u2019re moving onto sit-ups!\u201d Your eyes widened and your blood ran cold, and you could\u2019ve sworn you heard your current captor let out a quiet, pleased chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, seconds later and Aoi unfurled her legs and stretched them out in front of her, while simultaneously allowing her bodacious buttocks to clap down onto the yoga mat. If you\u2019d been crushed before, this was three times as hellish. Your body screamed in discomfort as Aoi\u2019s plush cheeks squashed into the yoga mat, spreading out from the pressure, and conformed around your body like a vice. The heat and sweat doubled, and you began sticking to her skin twice as fast. Now, no sounds could be heard from outside this booty prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, as soon as Aoi began her sit-ups, her ass gradually ground against the yoga mat in a methodical back and forth motion. Each sit-up scraped her cheeks against you, smearing you into her doughy ass cheek. You felt your body begin to lose its consistency as you were forcefully ironed onto the Asian giantess\u2019 prodigious derriere. You were quickly reduced to not more than sticker on her butt, and if your predicament continued, you\u2019d be a simple little tattoo on her flesh before long.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright guys just a few more sit-ups and we\u2019re done!\u201d Morgan exclaimed excitedly to her class. Every one of the women in the class appreciated the upbeat energy and reassurance that Morgan offered as a teacher. Well everyone who could hear it at least. You, meanwhile, were decimated underneath the moderately fit girls sizable ass, only capable of hearing muffled words from your roommate. It seemed like each sit-up from Aoi turned up some metaphorical thermostat of the temperature under her buns, as sure enough her sweat continued to build. The combined pressure of this girl\u2019s warm, jiggly flesh from above and the firm, grippy material of the yoga mat beneath you was torturous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright done! Go ahead and stand up ladies! Take 30 seconds to catch your breath then we\u2019re going to face the opposite direction and start on some Good Mornings!\u201d Morgan said exuberantly once more. Aoi breathed a sigh of relief, she wasn\u2019t painfully out of shape by any means but nevertheless the class was tough. As she finished her last rep she let her back fall onto the ground while her whole body compressed into the mat. Momentarily caught up in the actual exercise, Aoi then remembered the tiny cute guy that she snatched up with her feet then united with her buns. She lifted her head to scan her soles, not spotting you, then smiling deeply as she realized that you had to have ended up stuck to her large ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finally standing up, Aoi turned around to check out her nearly entirely exposed buns in the floor-to-ceiling mirror on the opposite wall. There she saw your one-inch frame plastered spread eagle on her skin. Thankfully your clothes hadn\u2019t been ripped off quite yet, as they were typically so prone to destruction underneath a giant girl like this. So in addition to the difference in skin tone between you two, your white workout shirt and black shorts stuck out clear as day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi grinned smugly, just knowing in her mind that you must have been loving every second of this. To anyone else, including yourself,  Aoi\u2019s actions towards you would have been seen as essentially torture, but to the girl herself she honestly believed that this was her idea of flirting. In reality, the giantess had a (somewhat deserved) inflated ego about how irresistible she was to tiny guys like you, and she was simply this forward with her attempts at picking you up. Content with how the situation was progressing, she jiggled her ass ever so slightly to entice you even further. From your perspective, it merely sent waves of nauseating movement through the glutes that you were stuck to, not nearly as attractive as the girl wanted to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this slight moment of showing off from Aoi caught one more person\u2019s eye as well, Morgan! After all, the two were at max a few feet away from each other thanks to her position in the class, so when the Asian giantess spun around to check herself out so clearly, Morgan\u2019s vision locked squarely onto you. Her eyes went wide with realization as she looked down onto her own mat next to her, of course not seeing a thing. She panicked briefly and scolded herself for getting so caught up in the class that she had forgotten all about you. Deciding that she had to be up front and direct for your own safety, Morgan leaned forward and cleared her throat to get the attention of this mischievous student. But just as she did so the door to the workout class swung open, causing Morgan\u2019s view to turn towards it. Standing there was none other than your and her boss, Heather!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot, don\u2019t mind me! I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doin a bang-up job here Morgan, I\u2019m just checkin on our new hire!\u201d Heather exclaimed in her admittedly charming southern accent accent. As she walked up beside Morgan, she expected to see you at the head of the class, but when she didn\u2019t she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion. Scanning the room, it didn\u2019t take her long at all to land on the nearly naked girl in the front row. There she too, saw you plastered to this girl\u2019s bubble butt clearly. She then raised her eyebrows in surprise and exclaimed, \u201cWell butter my buns and call me a biscuit! Did he mean to latch onto those buns right there!?\u201d Your boss practically shouted, pointing you out in front of the entire class. All of the women either looked directly at you or at the girl\u2019s reflection in the mirror. A roar of laughter broke out from some women, others giggling slightly, others still putting on a look of disgust at what they considered to be an invasion of Aoi\u2019s privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless you were incredibly embarrassed. Nine times out of ten you would want as many girls to notice you as possible when you were stuck in a situation like this. But now was not one of those times. You wanted to prove to Morgan and Heather that you could be a capable employee at the gym, but with your current status as butt sticker you weren\u2019t too sure that the message was being sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, meanwhile, was feeling incredibly guilty on her own behalf. She felt like she should have been looking after you, and now thanks to her inattentiveness you were literally the laughing stock of the class. She grimaced visibly, before the gears started to turn in her head. Morgan was no ditz by any means, so thinking on her feet wasn\u2019t much of a challenge to her. In a snap she thought of a way to redirect the situation and hopefully earn you a bit of respect back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! He actually did mean to be there!\u201d Morgan responded enthusiastically, thinking on the fly. Everyone else in the class looked at her incredulously, Heather and Aoi included. \u201cHunter told me before the class started that he would try this technique as a way of teaching the girls to have a mind-muscle connection to specific parts of their body!\u201d She wavered slightly, wondering if the direction she was taking this was actually a good idea or not, but she continued on nevertheless. \u201cHe squished himself against Aoi\u2019s butt so that when we do our Good Mornings next he can wiggle and remind her to activate her glutes, since they\u2019re the most important muscle for the exercise! It\u2019s kind of genius if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clearly didn\u2019t take much to convince Heather, since her eyes lit up with excitement upon hearing Morgan\u2019s explanation. \u201cOh dearie me he is already going above and beyond my high expectations for him, wow! How is it working so far, miss?\u201d She gestured at Aoi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi knew full well that her instructor was lying through her teeth, but nevertheless she knew this was a golden opportunity for her to keep on \u201cflirting\u201d with you without fear of getting in trouble for it. \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s a miracle worker! I never want to take him off! My workout feels so much more efficient with him back there.\u201d She said, flexing each of her cheeks powerfully as she spoke, eliciting a few more giggles from other girls in the class, even from Heather herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if\u2019n ya don\u2019t mind then I\u2019d sure love to stick around and watch him work for a min!\u201d Heather said, already pulling a chair up to sit in. She was overwhelmingly friendly of course, but she was still the boss at the end of the day and knew Morgan wouldn\u2019t have a problem with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh sure, no problem!\u201d Morgan said a bit nervously. She looked at you once again and reconsidered her actions yet again. She had saved your reputation as an employee, yes, but at the cost of subjecting you to further torture at the fate of this sweaty, scantily clad girl. \u201cAlright ladies, break time is over, we\u2019re going for a minute straight of slow, controlled Good Mornings.\u201d All of the girls in the class began to slowly bend over at the waist. Once again, the more well-endowed women of the class had a bit of trouble with their balance, prompting some quick adjustments from Morgan. But all the while she couldn\u2019t help but empathize with you, watching as your sticker-like body stretched as Aoi bent over, and jiggled when she stood up. Hang in there, Hunter she thought to herself, then shifting her focus back to the class as a whole. Your wellbeing was important to her, of course, but she also took great pride in teaching an effective workout class. Especially with her boss watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat befalls you as the class continues?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aoi wrapped up her last few reps of the Good Morning stretch, bending forward while clenching her sizable glutes, relishing in the almost imperceptible feeling of your tiny body clinging to her left butt cheek. Every chance she got, the mischievous Asian giantess glanced at the mirrors lining the walls, looking right at your spread-eagled body stretch and contort as Aoi flexed her ass. It was hilarious and adorable, and Aoi was on cloud nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, meanwhile, found it difficult to keep demonstrating the technique while avoiding staring at you. You looked so diminutive and helpless on the curvaceous girl\u2019s globe-like butt cheek, so much of her ass exposed thanks to her skimpy as hell booty shorts. Your new roommate could tell how sweaty and flattened you were, yet couldn\u2019t do a thing about it. Especially not with Heather watching the class with rapt attention, a happy, na\u00efve smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Good Morning stretches finished, Morgan snapped her attention from Aoi\u2019s bubble butt and your predicament, and addressed the class. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s keep up the pace. You girls are doing amazing, so next up is squats. Let\u2019s see a good thirty or so, at least!\u201d Morgan declared, earning enthusiastic cheers and quiet groans in equal measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Morgan caught sight of Aoi\u2019s triumphant grin that the brown-haired fitness teacher felt a sinking feeling in her gut. Sure enough, the playful Asian giantess began easily conquering the squats, dipping very low to the ground with each one. At the same time, her massive derriere clenched tight as Aoi thrust it out, and Morgan could only watch with a small frown as you were pulled even tighter against your flirtatious captor\u2019s thick ass cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her chair, Heather frowned a tiny bit. \u201cMorgan, darlin\u2019\u2026is lil\u2019 Hunter doin\u2019 the thang? Tha\u2019 mind an\u2019 muscle connector thang you were mentionin\u2019?\u201d The somewhat scatterbrained blonde leaned forward. \u201cAh can\u2019t quite make it out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan winced, and so did you. Exhausted as you were because of Aoi\u2019s treatment of you, you realized that holding up your end of Morgan\u2019s lie was essentially to staying in Heather\u2019s good graces. Mustering what small strength you still had within you, you began twitching and vibrating to the best of your ability. With all your strength, all you could manage was a small jiggle of Aoi\u2019s plump left cheek, but it was enough to catch Heather\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! There it is! What a quaint lil\u2019 idea!\u201d Heather beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan fidgeted with her hands. \u201cUh\u2026yup! Hunter\u2019s pretty smart, isn\u2019t he?\u201d With an internal groan, she forced a smile towards Aoi. \u201cH-how\u2019s he\u2026feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi grinned radiantly. \u201cJust perfect, ma\u2019am! I love the little guy to death! In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this motivated to exercise in my life!\u201d Aoi giggled, and reached and hand back to gently rub your body. To Heather, it looked like a simple show of affectionate acknowledgment. Morgan though, could clearly see Aoi lightly press her fingers into your squished body, jamming your head just a bit more into her doughy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather stood from her chair and moved towards the door. \u201cWell, thanks for lettin\u2019 me into yer class for a bit! You should get \u2018em off their feet for a while, darlin\u2019, after the squats. Maybe some seated splits? Jus\u2019 a thought!\u201d With a parting wave, your boss strolled from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan paled at the suggestion of more seated exercises, her compassionate brain instantly thinking of what that would put you through. However, before she could say anything, Aoi beat her to it. Having just finished her thirty squats, Aoi wiped some sweat from her brow, inconspicuously slapped her hands against her butt (and of course you, by extension), and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI second the seated squats, ma\u2019am!\u201d Aoi stated, taking the initiative by hopping right down onto the ground, plopping her meaty buns into place on her yoga mat. There was a faint but audible squelching noise as her swelteringly sweaty ass cheeks clapped into place, and Morgan couldn\u2019t help but wince, especially as Aoi\u2019s fleshy cheeks jiggled and wobbled before settling. She couldn\u2019t even see you anymore, and could only imagine you buried under all of the Asian giantess\u2019 weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could snap out of her daze, the rest of the class (assuming that Heather\u2019s word was law) followed Aoi\u2019s preemptive beginning by sitting back down and stretching their legs out. Your new roommate, despite being the class teacher, found herself the last person to actually join in the exercise. Glumly, she sank to the floor into a perfect split. Aoi had absolutely outsmarted her, and Morgan knew she couldn\u2019t backtrack now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuck as you were in your own hell, you didn\u2019t know how this mental war going on. Your entire world was Aoi\u2019s ass cheek now, and it was utterly dominating you in every conceivable way. You were caked in a heavy layer of sweat, which was now gluing you firmly to the buttery smooth skin of Aoi\u2019s left cheek. The girl\u2019s full weight bearing down on you flattened your already stretched thin body even more, on top of making it difficult to breathe and utterly impossible to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to reign supreme in the flexibility department, Aoi stretched her legs out as far to the side as possible, only taking a second to match Morgan\u2019s perfect split. However, as she did so, her booty dragged and wiggled across the yoga mat, smearing you incessantly. By the time she held the perfect pose, Aoi\u2019s ass had smudged you into closer to a blobby human shape than a defined spread-eagle pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this torment was taking its toll on you, both mentally but especially physically. Though your clothes were still intact for the moment, they were just about all that remained which distinguished you as human. With all the smearing and grinding Aoi was subjecting you to, your body was so glued to her flesh that you were about fused with it, akin to a living tattoo. Even your skin tone was beginning to match her darker tan color, a byproduct of being engrained into her ass. With a bit more effort on her part, Aoi could permanently entrap you in her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy coincidence or the malice of fate, the entire rest of the class was spent doing seated exercises. You suffered in the sweltering abyss of hell that was being trapped under Aoi for over an hour until the class ended. Your mind was a hazy mess, all of the pounding and grinding Aoi did for that last hour blurring together into an indiscernible torment. By the time Aoi finally peeled her grossly sweaty yet alluring sexy rear end off the yoga mat, you couldn\u2019t feel a difference between your body and her butt cheek at all. The fleshy mound had just about totally claimed you in its warm, doughy embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tragic event had occurred in that last hour, namely Morgan accepting that freeing you from Aoi would be impossible until after the class. However, what this meant was that Morgan allowed herself to push thoughts of worry for you aside, and focus on teaching to the best of her ability. As she embraced her role and got back into the swing of steady exercise, you slipped further and further from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, as class ended, eight different girls rushed up to Morgan, bombarding her with equal measures of praise for her teaching skill, and questions about specific poses. With a confident grin, Morgan answered each of their questions in turn, and didn\u2019t notice a single thing as Aoi, mischievous grin on full display, packed up her belongings and slipped out of the room. Each step she took gratuitously shaking her thick glutes, and bouncing you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi took a moment to catch her breath, and then sped off towards the gym\u2019s exit. Though she desperately wanted a shower, getting home with you in tow was her primary goal. Aoi could hardly wait to get home and play with you further, imaging the wonderful things she could do with her new tiny boyfriend. In her somewhat off-kilter mind, she was still flirting with you, and she justified that an adorable tiny would obviously be thrilled to love her back. It didn\u2019t click in her mind that maybe a tiny wouldn\u2019t like being dominated by sweat and pain for two hours, and end up as a living ass tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she crossed halfway to the exit, the classroom door swung open, and Morgan raced out. Aoi froze hearing the sound, and spun around instantly, trying to hide her gigantic booty and you from Morgan\u2019s gaze. She managed a pleasant smile as Morgan shouted to her from the door, and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAoi!\u201d You felt the cheek you were attached to clench in fear and anticipation as the voice of your roommate and source of salvation rang out. Firmly attached as you were it felt like you were being scrunched up as well, but the pain was well worth it to be saved from whatever this crazy girl had intended for you. Already you could feel your clouded thoughts beginning to clear as you focused on how you would go about separating yourself from the well-padded derriere. Of course you\u2019d probably end up leaving most of the work to Morgan as she- \u201cSee you next week!\u201d \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Morgan was an exercise fanatic through and through, and once she was in the zone, it was difficult for her to focus on anything that wasn\u2019t exercise or exercise related. Her first, and so far only, thought on seeing Aoi slip from the room was that she needed to encourage the girl to come back next week. After all, exercise was a lot of fun by yourself, but it was even better when it was enjoyed together. Although her twin did her part to stay fit, Avery wasn\u2019t the kind to enjoy sweating it up with her big sister, so the brunette was always keen to make and keep the acquaintance of people she could work out with. The Asian girl had caught her interest, though she couldn\u2019t quite remember why, just that it would be great if she kept coming to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Aoi was ecstatic as she smiled widely and waved back at her newfound yoga instructor. \u201cYeah, sure thing! Wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world!\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if the other girl had forgotten about you, or had just come to recognise the special bond that was forming, but either way it didn\u2019t really matter. She got to keep her new little boyfriend with her and couldn\u2019t be any happier about it. Waiting for the extra second it took for Morgan to shoot her a thumbs-up and then turn to address another girl, your would-be girlfriend spun back around and practically skipped out the door into the parking lot beyond, an oblivious Heather too busy on the phone to even notice her passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were devastated as you heard the exchange and felt your captor beginning to move once more. If your face hadn\u2019t been so thoroughly smeared into Aoi\u2019s sweaty skin you would have cried at the sheer injustice of having been forgotten so easily, like you didn\u2019t matter. On the car ride over you had thought that you and Morgan were really beginning to bond. She had seemed so careful with you throughout the morning, and she had even spoken on your behalf with Heather. You had deluded yourself into thinking that the two of you were already friends despite what limited time had passed, and had even dared to think that there could maybe be something more. Yet the foolishness of such thoughts had now been laid bare. The brunette had forgotten you because you were nothing but an acquaintance to her, and now you were left to the whims of Aoi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your morbid thoughts, the reality was that Morgan would remember you. Soon, in fact. And when she did she would do what she could to save you as any friend would. But by then it would be too late and, unable to see anything but the ass before you, you wouldn\u2019t even know she had tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you lamented your fate, Aoi made a beeline for her car, a small two-seater that was her most treasured possession. Well, second most treasured now, after her new little butt buddy. For you the rhythmic clench and unclench of walking paused momentarily as there was the click of the car door unlocking then a quick little jiggle as your curvy tormentor swung around and the grip of gravity as she plopped down into the cushioned seat. The impact wasn\u2019t so bad this time, softer then dropping onto a yoga mat, which would have been a pleasant surprise if only you didn\u2019t feel every undulation of the cheek above travel through own body, indicating the sheer degree to which you had become attached. Worse was the knowledge from years of experience that you were now beneath the driver of a car, which meant that this crazy girl was really going to take you with her to god knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly shutting her door and keying the ignition, Aoi shifted into reverse in the same fluid motion and wasted no time in getting her car into motion. Had she looked back to the gym she would have seen the front doors spring open as Morgan rushed outside and looked around desperately for any sign of the girl who had stolen her roommate, but as it was she spared not a single glance as she pulled out onto the street, just one car among many quickly lost among the late-morning traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident that she had made her escape, the tanned girl allowed herself to relax, giving a happy little bounce in her seat as she celebrated her success. For you these were hammering blows even against the plush fabric of the car seat, each producing a wet squish as Aoi\u2019s sweaty ass squeezed the residue of her workout onto your defenceless body. Ordinarily you might have expected the sweat to help loosen your bond, but hundreds of reps had ironed you on so thoroughly that it felt more like your buxom captor was sweating through you than onto you. It wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d been attached to someone this badly, but remembering how badly those other times had gone for you didn\u2019t exactly put you at ease. You would very much not like to be stuck here for that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to your unhappy thoughts, Aoi took the opportunity to finally address you directly, now that she had finally given the two of you a chance to be alone without that Morgan girl interrupting. \u201cEnjoying yourself back there little guy? I know you are.\u201d Though her words were flirtatious she retained the upbeat tone she had used in class, focused on letting you know that she wanted this as badly as you did. \u201cI know how much guys like you like this sort of thing so don\u2019t even try to hide it okay? Here.\u201d There was a click as she flicked a switch. \u201cLet me give you the full experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream. First, to voice your incredulity that this girl could actually believe that you enjoyed this kind of treatment. Second, to protest as the seat beneath you began to rapidly warm. It seemed Aoi had decided that spending hours being pounded and stretched across her sweating buttocks wasn\u2019t enough of an \u2018experience\u2019 for you, and was now focused on straight-up melting you into a new tattoo as she turned her seat warmer to its maximum setting. Within seconds you could feel your form distorting even more, made all the worse as your misguided paramour began rubbing her buttocks back and forth across the seat, smearing you further as she cooed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest Hunter, you\u2019re not exactly my first experience, though I guess maybe you could tell that already.\u201d Aoi giggled, realising that the nature of her flirtations had probably already made it clear that she knew what guys like you liked. \u201cMy last little boyfriend had to leave unexpectedly, but I know it\u2019s going to be different this time. You\u2019re such an industrious little guy that you even went and got a job. I just know we\u2019re going to get on great.\u201d People often said she was a lot to handle, and Aoi had wondered before if maybe her last boyfriend just hadn\u2019t felt he was adequate enough for her. It would have been a silly thought for him to have. She got just as much joy out of playing with tinies as they inevitably got from playing with her. There was no need for anyone to feel inadequate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been nice if you could dissuade this crazy chick from her flagrant misunderstandings, but you were too busy trying to maintain your sense of self as she continued to wiggle about and smear you between her now even sweatier cheek and the burning seat below. You could feel the fabric of your clothing beginning to catch on the polyester seat covers as your body continued to melt into the undulating flesh of Aoi\u2019s buttocks, and you feared if this continued you really were going to become a tattoo, or even worse, just a slight discolouration on an otherwise flawless ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take nearly fifteen minutes for the tanned girl to reach her home, and by the time she pulled into a park and switched off the heater you\u2019d been reduced to a largely delirious mass of twisted flesh just barely distinguishable from the flesh above. You had dimly perceived Aoi continuing to talk to you throughout the trip, but eventually tuned out her words as she continued to talk as if the two of you were embarking on some joint enterprise, rather than a one-sided kidnapping. There had been mention of introducing you to\u2026 someone, but you hadn\u2019t caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aoi killed the ignition she took a moment to calm herself before opening the door, almost signing in relief as the cool air hit her skin. She was always willing to go the extra mile for a cute guy like you, but she would be glad to be out from the heated car and maybe get a chance for an actual shower. There were, after all, lots of other ways for the two of you to have fun. By now the buxom girl was sweaty enough that she had to practically peel herself from the seat, and if she noticed when a few strips of white cloth were left behind she didn\u2019t mention it, just reaching back to give her now naked friend a firm squeeze and a quick slap for good measure before sauntering to her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist as you are carried along with the bouncing booty of your tormentor, you could only listen in as a door swung open and Aoi called a greeting as she walked in to meet her\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your captor was practically skipping as she strolled into her two bedroom townhouse, happily slamming both her booty and yourself into the door with a wet slap to send it swinging back into place. Momentarily dazed by the sudden impact, you missed the initial exchange as she called out a greeting and was drawn into the living room, the ringing in your ears finally fading to a manageable buzz part way through a sentence. \u201c-never guess what happened at my yoga class today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you able to speak right now you would have screamed out that what had happened was that she had kidnapped you, but your attempts to scream did little but send a small vibration through the flesh that was filling what remained of your mouth. The only response you received was in the form of a minor earthquake as Aoi wiggled in response to what she interpreted as a sign of affection. You would have tried to scream again had you not become aware of another presence in the room, their form obscured from your current vantage point and voice muffled to your ears. \u201cWere you flirting with an instructor again? Or \u2018being friendly\u2019 as you insist on calling it.\u201d That voice. It was familiar to you even through the static at the edge of your hearing, but you couldn\u2019t quite\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loss of your clothes to the fibres of the car seat had removed the last visible sign identifying you as anything other than an off-colour smear across your tormentor\u2019s left butt cheek, and experience had taught you that you now had little hope of reforming without external help or several hours of uninterrupted progress. Which meant that a lot could be riding on the owner of that voice. You\u2019d met your fair share of women thanks both to your myriad experiences through schooling, vacations, and the many \u2018jobs\u2019 that your aunt had recruited you for, but you hadn\u2019t spoken to many in detail, and you knew that this voice was more familiar than that. Which narrowed it down considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of your thoughts, Aoi smiled widely as her roommate stood to greet her, bouncing on her toes a little and setting off another tremor that rippled through your battered form. \u201cWell, you\u2019re part right.\u201d Really, she wasn\u2019t sure why so many people seemed to think she was flirting with them. She was friendly sure, but she had no real interest in normal-sized guys, or girls for that matter. No, her real flirting and affection was reserved for the tiny guys who had long ago stolen her heart. Like the diminutive hunk that was still hugging her ass with everything he had and then some. \u201cI met a little cutie in my yoga class. You could say that we really hit it off, so I\u2019ll be leaving the singles club.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d brought you home, but did reach back to firmly cup her own butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the palm of Aoi\u2019s hand forced your face deeper into her flesh, you could almost hear the eye roll in her roommate\u2019s voice. \u201cFor you to call them that, you must be talking about a tiny right? I thought that class was girls-only, how did you even\u2026\u201d A pause. \u201cWhatever. Just promise me you actually gave the guy a chance to talk this time. We don\u2019t want a repeat of last month\u2019s fiasco.\u201d With each word spoken, the pieces started to fall into place, and all at once you recognised exactly who this was. The cadence. The tone. The lyrical notes of a suppressed laugh. It was a voice which had meant both damnation and salvation for you in years past. The voice of your little sister Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small light of hope began to shine in your mind. If Tracy was here, if you could just get her to notice you, then perhaps you could get out of this situation. Though the two of you had certainly had your issues in the past, ever since you had come home from college that first time she had proven herself to be a reliable ally, and one who was committed to making amends for past wrongs. Even as you thought that, you were brought closer as Aoi giggled and moved forward, her hands moving away as she sought a hug from your larger sibling. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m telling you that guy wanted to play with my toes. Just because his wife got mad about it doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t having fun.\u201d That woman should have been thanking her for showing her how to really handle her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA splayed hand to the face stopped your delusional tormentor in her tracks as Tracy protected herself from the impending assault. \u201cDon\u2019t. You\u2019re dripping all over. Take a shower you duffus.\u201d Her tone was teasing and not without affection, but with an underlying tone of severity that warned of consequences if the sweaty girl tried her luck. A shake of her head sent the brunette\u2019s braids swinging and she sighed at her friend\u2019s usual exuberance. \u201cAnd you know it\u2019s because you talk like that that I don\u2019t want to introduce you to my brother.\u201d Or, more accurately, it\u2019s because she had never been able to shake the feeling that Aoi would run off with you the first chance she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling playfully, Aoi relented her attempts to embrace your sister, though scoffed at the latter statement. \u201cHmph, he would have loved me and you know it.\u201d She sighed wistfully at what could have been, while you were chilled to the bone at the revelation that such a fate had been hanging over you, held at bay by your sister alone. And yet, somehow the universe had delivered you to this crazy girl\u2019s clutches regardless, like it was playing a game with y-. Your thoughts were interrupted as your tormentor\u2019s hand descended from the sky to deliver a powerful slap to her own rear, leaving a temporary imprint of her hand against the cheek and your twisted body as you jiggled in place. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s missing out on all this, while my new little guy is going to get it all to himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently groaned at this latest assault, while simultaneously wishing you could get your would-be paramour to see that neither you, nor any tiny you had ever met, appreciated this kind of treatment. Apparently done with the discussion, Aoi turned to leave, and you got the chance to actually see your sister for the first time as you stared out from the retreating posterior through eyes blurred by hours of endless crushing. For a moment you thought that she might actually see you as her eyes involuntary flicked to your bouncing prison, but they diverted themselves quickly with a slight blush and you were left behind to be carried away from your only immediate hope of salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last glimpse of Tracy was your sister dropping back onto the girls\u2019 tan coloured couch before she was lost to you all together as Aoi turned a corner and bounced into her own room. It was difficult to see from your location but it was a fairly typical room all told, dominated by a bed against one wall and a computer desk against the other, with a dresser sandwiched between. A few stray clothes and knickknacks were spread around, which were quickly added to as your captor slipped off her top and shoes before moving to peel her booty shorts from where they had been practically devoured by her cheeks. For a moment your vision darkened as you were pressed between the sweaty fabric and the warm flesh of the Asian girl\u2019s rear, but any hope of being peeled away with the shorts quickly faded as they dropped to the ground and left your prone form behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow clad only in a thong that was little more than a couple of strings, Aoi bundled up her discarded clothing and dumped them into a nearby laundry basket before gathering a fresh set from her drawers. As she moved she engaged you in a one-sided conversation now that she was confident her roommate was out of earshot. \u201cWe still need some more personal time I think, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll introduce you to Tracy latter. She acts coy about it, but she knows how to treat a tiny properly. Her little brother is a cutie just like you, so she\u2019s had years of proper handling experience.\u201d She giggled at the comparison, unaware of just how close she was hitting to the mark as she bounced her way into the adjoining bathroom, her now barely contained booty jiggling along behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to tell this crazy girl that he wasn\u2019t someone like you, he was you. Aoi\u2019s words made you wonder just what exactly Tracy had told her roommate about your teenage years and what she had done to you. While you knew it would be hypocritical, you did wish that your sister would keep those kinds of stories to herself, and avoid putting any weird ideas in her friends\u2019 heads. As the sound of running water burst into life, you knew from experience what would come next, your last clear view of the room being the sight of a bouncing ass reflected in the room\u2019s mirror, with the discolouration that was you barely even visible to your own eyes. You couldn\u2019t help but reflect that the chance to see an attractive girl in the nude wasn\u2019t remotely worth the price you\u2019d had to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only slim hope you had was that the shower would at least free you from your prison, giving you some small chance to escape or at least explain your plight, but is that even possible anymore?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sudden shock of the water striking your body was like being dunked in an ice bath following an intense workout. After spending hours being ironed on to your captor\u2019s ass by a barrage of heat and pressure, you had some small hope that the sudden change might free you, but alas you remained firmly attached, even as your body began to shiver from the temperature loss. A joyful murmur from above suggested that, if she felt you at all, Aoi assumed you were vibrating in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time you had been carried into a shower attached to a woman, deliberately or otherwise. In the past though, your attachment had been rudimentary at best, and the flow and the pressure of the water had been enough to free you, if not always for the better. This time, even as Aoi turned and a jet of water struck you directly, you could feel the moisture flowing over you, the last tiny pockets of air that had persisted between yourself and the bodacious girl\u2019s skin sealed shut as water flowed through them and adhered you yet further with a wet slurp of bonded flesh. The humming from above grew louder as hands roamed, and you were pressed deep once more as fingers probed your exterior, apparently making sure that you remained where you belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shift freed you from direct assault, though rivulets of water continued to stream across you from high above, flowing down the gentle curves of your tormentor\u2019s back and across the swell of her booty to find your form. Your stomach dropped as you were suddenly launched into motion, and for a heart-stopping moment you almost thought you saw another booty approaching before the truth was rammed home with crushing finality as you found yourself slammed into the glass wall at the back of the shower. Your attempt to groan was smothered by shifting flesh as Aoi fiddled around with the bottles at her feet, unknowingly smearing her little boyfriend across the glass with a soft squeak as she moved side to side. It was over as suddenly as it began as the Asian girl righted herself and poured a generous serving of liquid soap onto her retrieved loafer, ready for a thorough clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough deep down you had known it was coming regardless, the first real warning you had of your looming fate was the few suds that slid across you as Aoi began to lather her upper body, diluted from their trip down her body but still carrying enough of a sting to irritate your flesh. Though skin was skin, yours was significantly thinner than a normal humans\u2019, and you never did react well to the kinds of powerful chemicals that tended to inhabit most products. As the humming above increased in volume and morphed into an off-key rendition of some pop tune, you put your all into attempting to wriggle free, not wanting to face what was to come even though you knew it was a hopeless fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of your fears, Aoi was enjoying herself immensely as she lathered her chest, taking more time then was needed to tease the sensitive flesh as she thought of her newfound little lover and the many things she would be able to do with him from now on. Though she was content to let you keep loving her booty for the time being, she couldn\u2019t wait to introduce you to everything she had to offer. At the gym she\u2019d given you a brief experience of her dexterous toys, but there were so many other things you were yet to experience. Just the thought sent a chill down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold water, as she finally moved away from her chest and quickly washed down her arms and stomach, reminding herself that there was no need to wait to play with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she couldn\u2019t see your location, your delusional captor did remember that you were pressed against her left cheek, ironically displaying a better capacity to keep track of you then most people who were actually concerned with your safety. For you, this meant being given a last few moments to pointlessly struggle as you watched the opposite mound of flesh being lathered up, your prison jiggling in sympathetic motion before the creeping shadow drifted over you as well. For Aoi, a shock ran through her as the loafer finally made contact with your body, the minor difference in sensation enough to break her off-key melody with a soft moan. Pushing deeper, she cleaned with a newfound enthusiasm, massaging her ass as she felt the lingering fatigue of her yoga session draining away. \u201cHmm. Don\u2019t worry little guy, I\u2019m going to make sure both of us get as clean as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were feeling anything but relief as you once again felt the crushing weight of being pressed deeply into your crazy paramour\u2019s bouncing flesh. The last of the sweat that you had been sure would be permanently ingrained into your skin was swept away, only to be replaced with the stinging soap, as it poured into every knock and cranny of your tortured body. The endless scrubbing tinged your skin red as the relentless strokes bombarded you from every direction, while you were forced to squeeze your eyes shut to combat the risk of losing your sight completely. You were deep enough now that you could feel the solid mass of muscle beneath the gelatinous flesh, pressed into the unforgiving surface and ground against it like you were being snuffed out against a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar more time than necessary was spent on this torture until Aoi finally deigned to move to the rest of her body, though not without a displeased noise as she glanced at her loafer and found you had not been carried along. Really, she appreciated a guy who could see the value of her booty, but she did want to get you off of there eventually. Still, there was time yet. Half-blinded and deafened by the abuse you had endured, you were given a precious few minutes to regain your equilibrium, interrupted only by another brief make-out session with the shower wall as Aoi bent over to clean her feet, this time aware enough of your presence to giggle as your prison vibrated against the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the two of you exited the shower your body had at least become somewhat more prominent against the Asian girl\u2019s cheek, a red splotch of stretched skin looking something like an unfortunate friction burn. Despite the blemish on her otherwise flawless posterior, Aoi couldn\u2019t help but giggle slightly at the sight as she looked into the mirror over her shoulder while quickly towelling off. The scrubbing from the towel was thankfully brief as it swept over you, though it likewise did nothing to free you as that joyful voice boomed from above. \u201cHehe. I couldn\u2019t tell too clearly before but you\u2019re really spread-out there huh. What do you think, have you had enough of my booty yet?\u201d Another giggle, as if the very thought was ludicrous. \u201cWell, I know you love it but there is more of me to explore you know. My last boyfriend had a blast exploring all of my mountains and valleys, and I\u2019m sure you will too. Don\u2019t worry though, my booty will always be there for you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. As much as you wanted to protest Aoi\u2019s ideas about your intentions, more than anything you just wanted to get free from her ass. If you could just get the chance to reform a little maybe you could explain to her that you didn\u2019t want this, or better yet maybe get Tracy\u2019s attention. You knew if you could just make yourself known to your little sister that you\u2019d be home free. Whether the brunette would take you back to your roommates or insist on taking you somewhere \u2018safer\u2019 was up in the air, but at the very least she wouldn\u2019t leave you here. Unfortunately, thoughts of freedom were cut short as close-cut nails began to scrape around your edges, passing seamlessly from tanned flesh to red as they failed to catch the seam. Each time you thought they might catch the moment passed and your heart dropped again in concert with a downward twist to your tormentor\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d been ironed onto someone\u2019s flesh like this, though it wasn\u2019t like you\u2019d ever gotten used to it either. When it got this bad you generally required either time to reform or a significant effort from someone who had intimate knowledge of how you worked, something which you suspect Aoi lacked despite her apparent experience with your kind. Sure enough your captor huffed out a breath as she shook her head, and placed a hand on her hip. \u201cGeez, you really are just like Timmy aren\u2019t you? He latched onto me like this sometimes as well. Wouldn\u2019t let go for days even. And like, I appreciate the devotion but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s more fun to play with all of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time you wanted to object to the idea that any of this was your choice, but you remained unable to voice any such concerns. The towel returned to scrub you again, but had no more luck than the probing fingers, only succeeding in reddening you further. At this point you weren\u2019t sure if it was a blessing or a curse that Aoi at least knew where you were. In the past you had been both stuck unaware to women like your mother and aunt, as well as stuck for days by clients who had deliberately abused your form. Honestly, it was hard to say which was worse. At least knowing you were there meant there was some hope of being eventually released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment you were plunged into shadow as a fresh pair of panties were pulled over you, only to be revealed once more as Aoi tugged the underwear up high enough to turn it into a thong, smiling at you once more over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cover you up. You\u2019re a bit of a perv, but I\u2019m still proud of my little boyfriend.\u201d She gave you a little rub in recognition that you assumed was supposed to be comforting rather than another painful crushing. \u201cNow, why don\u2019t we\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

So, with that in mind, ya think yer capable of some one-on-one coachin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201cOne-on-one coaching? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mature woman smiled. \u201cNothin\u2019 too taxin\u2019, mind. Just a bit of helpin\u2019 out. For example\u2026\u201d Heather pointed behind you, and you followed her finger to see a young woman looking around aimlessly. \u201cThat darlin\u2019 jus\u2019 signed up for membership. Said she ain\u2019t nevuh been to a gym \u2018fore today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, understanding. \u201cOh, okay. So, basically, you\u2019d like me to help her with her workout? Lead her through some stretches, explain how the machines work, that sort of thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned. \u201cAbsolutely, Hunter dear. Ya catch on quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan spoke up. \u201cAlright, well, I\u2019ll leave you to it, Hunter. See you when our shifts are over, and have fun!\u201d She waved, and you waved back, and then Morgan was off towards one of the gym\u2019s side rooms, disappearing from sight as she slipped through the door. She figured you could manage on your own. You were a competent, tiny adult, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather lowered you to the floor of the gym. \u201cAlright, Hunter, time\u2019s a wastin\u2019! Get helpin\u2019 that poor lass over there. Ah have full faith in ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you down!\u201d You saluted your new boss, then ran off. It wasn\u2019t necessarily an easy trek, but you made it in under three minutes. The girl was soon firmly in your sights, and you thanked your lucky stars she hadn\u2019t wandered off from where Heather had pointed her out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noted how incredibly attractive the girl was, so much so that you nearly froze in your tracks and stared, wide-eyed. She looked to be in her mid-twenties, and at first guess, was of some sort of Hispanic descent. Her long, dark brown hair was tied back in a somewhat messy but still cute bunch. The girl\u2019s eyes were a deep and alluring brown, and they flicked around the gym anxiously. The girl\u2019s full lips were locked in an adorable, and probably unintentionally, sensual pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer exotically tanned skin looked soft and smooth, and she was showing a whole lot of it. All she was wearing was a low-cut, purple exercise crop top and matching purple short shorts. The outfit would be fine on any girl but this one. She reminded you of Quinn, particularly in the proportion department. Her curves were significant, to say the least, and though she wasn\u2019t wholly on Quinn\u2019s level, she was eye-catchingly curvy, to be sure. As such, her already form-fitting clothing was even tighter, and you found it difficult to not stare. Most of her stomach and abdomen was exposed, as were her long legs from the upper-thigh down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Excuse me, miss! Down here!\u201d You shouted. The girl gasped lightly, glanced around, and then down to the floor, making eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026oh. Oh! Hey there.\u201d The girl said. Catching you off guard, she squatted low to the ground, ostensibly to get a better look at you. Still, it scared you to see her powerful legs fall down, her huge ass looking like it was about to squash you flat. The girl essentially presented her crotch to you by squatting in such a manner, and it was now twice as hard to keep looking her in the eye. You could definitely see the outline of her panties under her ludicrously tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly cleared your throat. \u201cM-my name is Hunter\u2026and I\u2019m a new fitness coach here at Workout World. You looked like you needed some help. Would you like any coaching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl quirked her mouth, raising a coy eyebrow. \u201cHelp? Coaching me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d You nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll help in any way I can. Trust me, I know a lot about working out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Damn!\u201d The girl shook her head ruefully. \u201cIf I knew the gym had hot little tinies like you on staff, I\u2019d have come here years ago.\u201d She laughed, and you had to admit that her words caught you off guard, but she continued before you could speak up. \u201cSounds like an awesome deal to me. As it stands, this is my first time in a gym, so I\u2019m a bit lost on what I should be doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding her \u2018hot little tinies\u2019 comment for the moment, you flashed her a thumbs up. \u201cThen I\u2019m your guy! Hunter, at your service!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl laughed again; her voice silky smooth. \u201cThe name\u2019s Maia. For the next few hours, I\u2019m totally in your hands, Coach!\u201d The girl, Maia, smiled at you and winked, and there was an unabashed hint of playfulness behind her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to push that aside, you pointed to the corner of the gym where there were exercise mats and other such simple equipment laid out. \u201cA good place to start is probably over there. Nice and quick, to ease into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha, Coach!\u201d Maia grinned, and she began leisurely strolling over to where you had pointed. You dashed as fast as your miniscule legs could carry you to even attempt to keep pace with her, and you missed the sly smile on her face as she watched you run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the mats, you gestured for Maia to step on, and the Hispanic giantess happily obliged. Another quick pang of fear struck you, watching her step onto the mat, her giant feet on either side of you. Pushing down your mounting unease over this situation, you focused on the task at hand. After all, if you failed to help one girl with her exercises, you\u2019d be fired from this job for sure. You had to do a good job, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Maia! Try bending down to touch your toes.\u201d You called up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all? Easy!\u201d Maia replied, effortlessly. With ease, the curvy giantess threw her upper body forward and down, arching her back but still keeping her feet firmly on the ground. Demonstrating incredible flexibility, Maia bent all the over forward, easily touching her toes without breaking a sweat. You were impressed by your new student\u2019s capabilities, and looked up to compliment her, but then all rational thought left your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bending over, Maia\u2019s abundant breasts were also now free to wobble, suspended as they were in this arched forward position. Her already low-cut crop top looked even more ridiculous now, and Maia\u2019s boobs threatened to spill out from the top. To make matters worse, the girl began listlessly swaying, shaking her tits side-to-side as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this it, Coach? This is a piece of cake!\u201d Maia said, triumphantly. Mentally smacking yourself out of your trance, you tore your gaze from the girl\u2019s abyss of cleavage and to her alluring face. She had an almost knowing look of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed. \u201cUm\u2026good. Great, actually! Onto the next stretch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t blind enough to notice Maia\u2019s smugly satisfied smile, but she offered no further retort. You were able to successfully guide her through a few more standing stretches, like the tree pose and warrior pose. She almost crushed you under her foot while shuffling around for the warrior pose, and you didn\u2019t think it was possible to turn every simple stretch into a flirty display, but Maia managed it somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to conclude with one more round of toe touching, when Maia spoke up. \u201cYou know what, Coach? It\u2019s hard to hear you down there.\u201d The girl grinned mischievously and bent down. Faster than you could react, she swiped you up into her hand, stood back to full height, and then deposited you into her cleavage. It was so sudden and casual that it was nearly comical. Nearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry or surprised thoughts swirled in your mind, but became muddled as soon as you actually touched Maia\u2019s boobs. Sinking into her cleavage up to your neck, nearly all of your tiny body was buried in her soft, jiggly mounds of flesh. It was like the world\u2019s softest bed, heavenly relaxing. Maia had exercised enough to heat up a bit, but not enough to sweat yet, so her cleavage was like a warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in a flirty manner, Maia clapped her hands together. \u201cAh, see? Better! Now, what\u2019s next, Teach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought hard to push away pleasant thoughts. The Hispanic giantesses\u2019 fragrant body wash scent was overpowering while this close to her. \u201cM-Maia! This is hardly appropriate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s practical. You can give me instructions, and you have a close eye on my technique.\u201d Maia shrugged, appearing nonchalant, but it didn\u2019t take a genius to see the playfulness in her eyes. She knew what she was doing. \u201cUnless\u2026you wanted this to be something more than that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her teasing, and realized that you sadly couldn\u2019t argue with her logic. Sighing, you rolled your eyes. \u201c\u2026okay, fine. Next up is one last toe touch before sitting down for some other stretches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Coach! Can do!\u201d Maia grinned, and spared no more seconds wasting time. Throwing herself forward again, the flexible girl fell into the perfect toe touching pose, nailing the stretch with ease. Sadly, an unexpected hiccup occurred this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same breasts you\u2019d been shamefully admiring during this stretch earlier once more strained against the top that held them. Hung upside-down from between Maia\u2019s massive boobs, gravity took hold of your body. That, combined with the gentle jostling of the girl\u2019s titanic tits, and you slipped free from their grasp. With a startled cry, you fell down to the floor, impacting on her yoga mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall slightly squished you, but not too bad. Sadly, before you could begin reforming, Maia finished toe touching and stood to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s next?\u201d She asked. \u201cOh! That\u2019s right. Sitting!\u201d The giantess grinned excitedly, then began to sit down on her mat\u2026and right on top of you!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the studio would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI feel like it\u2019d be a really unique and interesting experience that would be a lot of fun to try out. Also, if there aren\u2019t any other tiny guys working there, they might really have a use for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned excitedly. \u201cOMG, yes! That\u2019s totes what I was saying! This\u2019ll be awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Morgan was a bit letdown that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Quinn seemed indifferent like normal, but with a twinge of disappointment on her face. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to the sound of Morgan walking through the living room on her way out the door. If she was leaving, then the chances were good that you and Avery would have to head out soon too. So, you changed into clean, simple clothes, then headed off to the kitchen. It took you a few minutes to reach the kitchen and climb up onto the table, but you managed. You\u2019d been doing this all your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was already seated at the table eating her own breakfast, and she nodded in acknowledgement upon noticing you. In the center of the table was an open bag of bagels, so you figured you\u2019d help yourself to a first meal of the day. Graciously, Quinn went out of her way to pour some apple juice into a shot glass for you, and you thanked her for her consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile ripping off chunks of the bagel, Avery came running into the kitchen frantically, dressed in only skimpy, frilly lingerie. She exclaimed hurriedly that she\u2019d overslept and was almost late for work. Unfortunately, Quinn moved away from the table and sauntered out of the kitchen a second later, exactly when Avery, rushing in a blind panic, dug her hand into the bag of bagels for a quick meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing far too quickly and carelessly to ever dream of feeling you, Avery\u2019s fingers squished into your back as she retrieved a bagel and pulled it out. You cried out for her attention as she lifted you up into the air, but the pink-haired girl was already pulling up the fridge and grabbing something to drink, too distracted to hear your pleas. Soon, her luscious lips filled your entire vision, and her mouth parted open, revealing her cavernous maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a burst of strength, you pulled free from the bagel and managed to yank yourself away. Of course, that left the only possible place to go as straight down, and gravity carried you right into Avery\u2019s awaiting bosom. You bounced off her left breast, rolled into her cleavage, and found yourself wedged neatly up to your neck amongst her pillowy soft breasts. Surprisingly, she STILL hadn\u2019t felt you, and merely scarfed down her bagel and drink with a surely unhealthy quickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacing back upstairs, you were jostled like mad as her sizable boobs bounced erratically in her loose, revealing bra. You kept trying to get her attention, but kept failing. You could do nothing but remain stuck, and do your best to brace yourself and avoid slipping so deep between her tits that you disappeared. It dawned on you now that the pink-haired ditzy giantess had totally forgotten about bringing you with her to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery got dressed in record time, and thankfully for you, put on a low-cut crop top which kept most of her perky breasts and cleavage exposed, including you. She was also wearing a flashy pink skirt. Your attempts to get noticed still failed as she cried out a goodbye to Quinn and strolled out to her car, but as she sat in the driver\u2019s seat closed the door, she finally heard your pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Avery spotted you, blinked slowly, and then smiled in a mischievous manner. \u201cOoh, hey there, small stuff. What\u2019cha doing in between my boobs, huh? So cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, you\u2019re taking me to the studio, remember?\u201d You said, in a tone you hope sounded both annoyed and serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery blinked again, before smacking her forehead. \u201cOh yeah! Duh! Totes slipped my mind, Hunter.\u201d She winked at you. \u201cWhat a way to get my attention though, dude. Girl might get some ideas\u2026\u201d She trailed off with a giggle, then plucked you from her cleavage. You were blushing at the whole situation, as well as Avery\u2019s flirty teasing, which prompted another giggle from the giantess. Finally, she set you down on the passenger\u2019s seat and drove off to the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shockingly short, ten-minute drive to \u201cStarlight Studios\u201d, and the building was about as blindingly gaudy as you\u2019d anticipated. It was a bright, sleek, modern designed building. After almost forgetting you again, Avery carried you inside with her, and the inside was just as modern and chic. There were no less than two different coffee shops inside the studio, and endless hallways seemed to stretch out to more photo rooms, prop closets, and specialized sets and stages than you could shake a stick at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was quickly approached by an important looking woman, who the pink-haired girl cheerfully waved to\u2026using the exact same hand she was carrying you in. With a higher-pitched yelp than you thought yourself capable of, you were flung through the air, right towards the woman rapidly approaching your catastrophically forgetful roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the air, you got a brief glimpse of the woman, like time was slowing down. She appeared to be in her late twenties or so, and she was of some Asian descent. Her black hair was pulled back in a ponytail, though a few strands hung loose over her glasses-framed face. She was wearing a tight, white button-up blouse and black miniskirt. There was something about her that emanated importance, like an aura of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further thoughts left you when you splattered down onto the clipboard the woman was carrying in front of her, your squishy body impacting against the hard board and flattening out like an accordion. You groaned at the pain, and began focusing on reforming, even as the woman finished approaching Avery. She\u2019d been locked on Avery, and had not yet taken notice of your landing on her clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery. Almost late.\u201d The woman said, quickly and efficiently. \u201cShoot is coming up in just a few minutes. We can\u2019t fall behind schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery winced, and gave the woman a winning smile. \u201cOverslept, Konomi. Won\u2019t happen again! But at least I brought a surprise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Konomi, adjusted her glasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s the surprise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you\u2019d reformed, and were just standing up on Konomi\u2019s clipboard. You brushed yourself off and waved to her, the movement drawing both women\u2019s eyes to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the surprise!\u201d Avery gushed. \u201cHunter, my new tiny roommate! He wants to try being a model!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi looked at you, then at Avery, then back at you, and frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not really how it works. You need experience to work here at Starlight Studios.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery pouted adorably. \u201cBut boss! He\u2019d be the first tiny model here!\u201d She pleaded, then hesitated. \u201cActually\u2026he\u2019d be the first male model too. Hee hee! That\u2019s awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whirled on Avery, totally floored by her revealing that you\u2019d be the only guy in this entire building. Why hadn\u2019t she told you earlier? Looking back to Konomi, any objection you thought of voicing fell away upon noticing her expression. She was staring at you intently, her eyes flicking rapidly. Millions of thoughts were racing through her head, and you could swear you almost literally saw dollar signs appear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she smiled. \u201cYou know what, Avery. You\u2019re right. Hunter would be perfect here as our first male model AND first tiny model.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cFor an introduction, my name is Miss Konomi, and I\u2019m the studio director. I lead most of the photo shoots. Starlight Studios prides itself on providing high quality photos to all our clients\u2026no matter the difficulty or strangeness of their needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unnerved you a bit, so you folded your arms. \u201cWhat would I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi waved off your concern. \u201cOh, nothing much. Pose for photos all day. Sometimes wear certain outfits. Occasionally act out\u2026things.\u201d Konomi seemed to push down a smile. \u201cReally, it isn\u2019t hard, and it pays extraordinarily well.\u201d In a quieter voice, she continued. \u201cThe things we can do now with a tiny model\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still apprehensive, but Avery shouted with glee. \u201cHe\u2019ll take the job! Lil\u2019 cutie Hunter won\u2019t let you down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi smiled warmly, with a strange aura behind it. \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll get everything signed up, then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, and you were officially a Starlight Studios model, much to Avery\u2019s joy, Konomi\u2019s pleasure, and your cautious optimism. What is your first assignment?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm sorry I was hesitant at first, Avery, but bringing Hunter on as part of the Starlight Studios team is actually a fantastic idea!\" Konomi said to both of you. At this point the two giantesses were strolling down a long hallway, with you sitting precariously on Avery\u2019s hand as she walked. You had spent the last ten minutes on Konomi\u2019s desk signing the necessary paperwork to fill out your modeling contract, and to be quite honest you didn\u2019t read much of it at all. You could have sworn you saw a line or two that said something like \u201czero liability for any workplace injuries\u201d but every time you slowed down to read something more carefully, Avery would lean her enormous cleavage mere inches above you out of excitement. As a 21 year old man you couldn\u2019t help but feel distracted by the proximity of this jiggling beauty, and as a result you ended up simply signing where you needed to sign and that was the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you reached a set of double doors, Konomi leading the way with Avery and yourself in tow. The seemingly work-focused professional manner contrasted harshly with the bubbly exuberance of your current carrier. Konomi walked with intimidating intention and elegance while Avery practically skipped with every step, forcing you to cling on to one of her fingers in fear of flying off yet again. You looked around the room and figured that this must be the primary room where photoshoots were taken; it was enormous. It must have been a large warehouse in the past because there were countless micro stages set up with all kinds of varying decor. To name just a few you saw a suburban living room, a bedroom, an upscale bathroom, a city street, a fake beach, even a fake gym setup. This place was professional, no doubt about that, it seemed like they could whip up whatever environment they needed for a shoot in a moment\u2019s notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi stopped at the bedroom set, located right next to the fake city street, before grabbing a box off of a nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe actually received a shipment of clothes from this new brand, Micro-Flex, just last week! Check it out!\u201d Konomi popped the top off of a box that was probably the size of a deck of cards, but it held countless articles of clothing designed for one inch tall guys like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, that\u2019s so freakin cool! That stuff looks totally cute and Hunter has a great bod, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll rock all of it!\u201d Avery said, peering into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly at your new roommate\u2019s compliment. She was without a doubt quite flirtatious, and her overwhelmingly positive attitude seemed quite endearing to you already. You simply smiled and peered down into the box from your perch on Avery\u2019s hand, seeing a variety of shirts, shorts, and pants. It seemed like every color you could think of was present in that tiny box, and you had to admit you were quite excited to be modeling them! You had some qualms about the dangers of being a tiny model amongst various giantess models, but it seemed like your first shoot was going to be pretty straightforward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching you staring at the clothes, Konomi spoke up, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there and stare! Pick an outfit and try it on!\u201d Looking up at the business casual woman as she spoke, you could practically see dollar signs forming in her eyes. You could tell that she took her work quite seriously, and this contract from Micro-Flex was most likely quite lucrative for the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Avery moved you towards the box and you picked out a matching pair of red shirt and shorts. Wondering briefly if you were going to have any privacy to change, you looked up to meet the piercing stares of both giantesses above you and knew that the answer was no. Shaking your head and chuckling slightly you began to change in plain sight, stripping down to your boxers before sliding the red clothes on. You never considered yourself to be a shy person, and to be honest you were quite proud of your physique, so doing so didn\u2019t seem like a huge deal to you. Unbeknownst to you, Avery looked you up and down, raising her eyebrows in approval. But after a moment you were ready for the shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering you to the ground on the fake sidewalk of the city street set, Avery then backed away and flashed a thumbs up as Konomi set up the camera to focus on you. You stretched a bit and had to admit, the Micro-Flex clothing sure was comfortable. It felt like no matter how you moved, the clothing moved with you and wasn\u2019t restrictive in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Hunter, you ready? Just strike some natural poses! Walk around a bit, pretending you\u2019re just going for a stroll through the city. Whatever\u2019s natural.\u201d Konomi said, looking through the lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan do!\u201d you responded happily. Konomi then set the camera to automatically take photos every second or so. You tried your best to look natural, cycling through a variety of poses and actions to give a bunch of different angles. Avery seemed absolutely elated that you were taking to the job so easily, and Konomi herself even seemed impressed with your capabilities. The asian giantess slowly walked around the set, ending up herself on the far end of the fake sidewalk that you were on. You assumed she was just inspecting your poses from different angles, and you spoke up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey so what\u2019s so special about these Micro-Flex clothes anyway? They feel great and all but what\u2019s the selling point?\u201d You made small talk, asking the giantess standing near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi smiled and simply said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you?\u201d Before you knew it the woman began walking the same powerful, elegant strut that she was earlier, now towards you on the fake sidewalk. It took her no more than a few steps to reach you, as your mind was going haywire trying to process what was happening. Before you could make a single move, Konomi\u2019s black heeled shoe slammed down onto your body, obliterating you into the pavement. Avery gasped and covered her mouth, Konomi simply stood with her weight pressed onto you until she heard the *click* of the automatic camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first click things only got worse. Konomi began to twist and grind her sole onto you, causing you excruciating pain and smearing you flat into the false sidewalk. You couldn\u2019t believe that this photoshoot had taken such a dark and sudden turn into torture for you. After a series of more *clicks* from the camera, Konomi finally stepped off of you, and continued walking forward until she reached the edge of the city set. You heard one final click, no doubt taking a picture of your absolute splattered, two dimensional body stuck to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was still too stunned to act, not knowing how carelessly her boss would treat her new roommate. Part of her was torn between standing up for you, but also part of her knew that this job meant the world to her, and risking it seemed like the last thing she wanted to do. While it didn\u2019t seem like Konomi took joy in what she just did, it definitely seemed like she had little concern for your wellbeing. She simply turned off the automatic picture taking feature of the camera and then looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t been squashed for more than a few seconds, so despite the beatdown you just took you found yourself popping back to normal rather quickly. And just as you did you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck out the clothes.\u201d Konomi said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your outfit, and with one single wipe of your hands to shake off the dirt and grime that came off of the sole of her heel, there wasn\u2019t a trace of the damage that Konomi had just done to you! The clothes looked brand new!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new proprietary fabric from the company, very hush hush and all that. But they said that one of the downsides of the many mishaps that little men like you have with giantesses like us is that the cheap cotton clothes made for you tend to rip off without the slightest bit of effort from us! These clothes promise to stay clean and on your body no matter the way you are twisted or treated! Each article even naturally sticks together if you apply enough pressure!\u201d Konomi explained the benefits of the magical clothing with perhaps a bit of callousness towards the plight of tiny men, but you couldn\u2019t argue with the results. These clothes really were a game changer. You saw even Avery had shifted to her focus, immediately forgetting her worries about you towards fascination towards the brand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow here\u2019s where you come in, Avery.\u201d Konomi turned to the beautiful, giddy girl, and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\"</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s a line for girls too! That\u2019s totes super amazing!\u201d Literally jumping up and down with excitement, you paled at the sight of her hefty chest bouncing in time with her joy. Shaking yourself out of staring, you watched Avery scamper away to the box to get changed. Turning your back on her, you decided that you could at least be a gentleman in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi tapped her clipboard to get your attention. \u201cNow, Hunter, you might\u2019ve picked up that I mentioned certain \u2018sticky qualities\u2019. As this implies, these next set of photos are going to require you being squished or stretched.\u201d She smiled at you, but it didn\u2019t take a genius to see the money-making glint in her eyes. \u201cWill that be a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emphatically shook your head. \u201cNo ma\u2019am! No problem here!\u201d You put on a show of confidence, even though you weren\u2019t entirely looking forward to what was coming. Still, if this was all a test by Konomi, you weren\u2019t going to back down and fail. And, even if it wasn\u2019t a test, the more money that Konomi made, the more you and Avery would rake in. Win-win situation all around, you figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery returned after a minute, and her new outfit was a far cry from the casual ensemble she\u2019d worn to the studio. She was clad from her neck to her toes in a sleek, sporty bodysuit that clung so tightly to her curvy supermodel body it might as well have been her second skin. The bodysuit was black with hot pink stripes racing across it, and looked exceptionally comfortable and maneuverable. The rational part of your brain admired the design of the fabric\u2026while the hormonal part of your brain couldn\u2019t stop ogling every inch of Avery. Ironically, despite literally covering most of her skin, the bodysuit left little to the imagination in practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Avery, who struck a dynamic pose and winked at you. \u201cYou like what ya see, don\u2019tcha, Hunter? Hee hee! It is pretty sick, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and averted your eyes, too embarrassed to mumble an apology or excuse, which only further enriched Avery\u2019s infectious giggles. Konomi was smiling too, but another look into her eyes told you that the gears in her head were spinning. What they were spinning about, only time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you two.\u201d Konomi clapped her hands. \u201cTime to jump into it. These next few photos will involve most of our varying sets, but only for context and lighting purposes. The main point is to highlight how Micro-flex outfits stick and adhere to one another.\u201d She eyed Avery carefully. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to squish Hunter a bit, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned just a little. \u201cOh. I will? On purpose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but he\u2019s okay with that. He already told me that it doesn\u2019t bother him at all.\u201d Konomi said, the lie sliding easily out of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked your head over to her. \u201cW-wait, I didn\u2019t exactly say\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, awesome! Okay then!\u201d Avery exclaimed, her bright and cheery voice cutting off your attempt at clarification. Before you could try again, Konomi picked you up and carried you over to the fake gym set in the studio. A bit callously, she dropped you down onto the floor beside a treadmill, then sauntered over to adjust the camera. You picked yourself up off of the floor, once more amazed at how immaculate and clean your clothes were. Micro-flex was genuinely revolutionary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi steadied the camera, then motioned to Avery. \u201cAlright, Avery. Simple shot first. Step on up and then\u2026well\u2026STEP onto Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently still a little apprehensive, Avery responded with a weak nod, biting her lip in an adorable fashion. Walking over to you, you were momentarily taken aback by just how humongous she was side-by-side with your bug-sized body. She was a gorgeous, heavenly goddess of a giantess, and standing down at her feet made you feel a mix of both awe and fear. You didn\u2019t quite know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe it was fear of the obvious, as, after sparing you a quick smile, Avery stepped down onto you, burying you under her left foot. Your body offered no resistance, flattening out into a paper-thin shape immediately. You were crushed out into a disc against Avery\u2019s heel, and, sure enough, you felt your clothes stick to Avery\u2019s bodysuit instantly. It was a strong adhesion too, not unlike glue, and when Avery lifted her foot a second later, you went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemonstrating her flexibility, Avery twisted her leg up and held her foot in front of her face, spotting the red-colored flat circle that was your body on her heel. Giggling, she lightly poked your body, squishing your face a bit more into her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee hee! One second of squishing, and you\u2019re flat as can be, Hunter. Soooo cute!\u201d Avery gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a business point of view, Konomi was pleased too, but hardly satisfied. \u201cExcellent, Avery. Now, step on him again, but this time grind your heel along the ground. Really work him into your foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough an airheaded ditz most of the time, Avery wasn\u2019t dumb, and she looked at Konomi with shock. \u201cWha? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt the poor cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi shook her head succinctly. \u201cNot at all. I mentioned that Micro-flex reduces sensations of pain for tinies, remember? Hunter will be just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was yet another lie, and you picked up on it right away. However, crushed flat, you had no way of shouting to Avery that Konomi was making things up, so your pink-haired partner simply blinked once to process what Konomi said, then grinned happily. \u201cOh, okay! That\u2019s totes cool. He\u2019s, like, invincible, huh? Wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirheaded Avery was back and in full force, and your current position left you powerless to defend yourself. You could just barely manage a wince in preparation for your next few seconds, as Avery just about slammed her foot back onto the ground. Convinced by Konomi\u2019s words that you couldn\u2019t feel a thing right now, Avery ground her heel against the floor with violent, reckless abandon, genuinely laughing at how loose she was letting herself be. Konomi watched with reserved fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Avery hoisted her foot back up thirty seconds later, you were more of a red stain spread across her entire heel than a simple circle, and were even more adhered to the fabric of her Micro-flex bodysuit than before. This pleased Konomi greatly, and the astute businesswoman eagerly snapped some shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Avery...and Hunter. Excellent jobs so far.\u201d Konomi glanced at her clipboard. \u201cMicro-flex, along with testing their durability and sticky qualities, would really like us to take some publicity photos for their website that focus on tinies being squished and crushed in day-to-day settings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned adorably at this direction, and let her foot fall back down, squishing you into the floor once more. \u201cReally? That\u2019s uber weird. Like, how does that make sense for a company that totes supports tinies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, Avery.\u201d Konomi said gently, almost soothingly. \u201cBy taking fake candid photos, we can supply Micro-flex with data about how their product functions in real-life situations. On top of that, we can provide promotional materials that demonstrate how trapped or squashed tinies can be spotted and rescued, based on how they stick to other Micro-flex materials. Training tools, if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery had been bouncing on her feet during this entire explanation, repeatedly lifting her heels then digging them back down into the floor. Apparently, your current location had fled her vacant mind already. She finally stopped though, and clapped her hands together. \u201cAh, I gotcha! That\u2019s so crazy awesome! I love helping out like this, and I\u2019m sure Hunter does too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi nodded. \u201cOh, he does. He told me while you were changing that he is good to go with these photo shoots for as many hours as we might need them. He said he\u2019ll do anything for Starlight Studios!\u201d A third lie was just as easy as the others. You didn\u2019t hear a word, buried into the floor because of Avery\u2019s heel, but if you had, you would\u2019ve just been even more upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Avery bit her lip again, and looked down at her foot, finally remembering where you were. \u201cSounds like something that little stud would say. OMG, he\u2019s too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, can we continue?\u201d Konomi walked back to the camera, and gestured towards the treadmill. Avery was more than happy to oblige her boss. In her mind, not only was this more fun than she\u2019d had in weeks, but she was determined to not drag down the experience for Konomi and you. As far as she was concerned, you were taking to modeling like it was your calling in life, and Avery would do everything to be the best damn partner for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next twenty minutes, Avery and Konomi took photos around the gym, with you still stuck to Avery\u2019s foot like you belonged there. Each new step further cemented you in place, the fabric of your clothes and your titanic roommates bodysuit meshing tightly, intertwining. It never stop hurting, and you silently begged for anything else but foot shots. Konomi had Avery posing on the treadmill, the bike, and the Stairmaster, each snapshot focusing on your crushed body and Avery\u2019s impressively nonchalant and unaware attitude. These were all meant to be candid, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shooting calmed down, it took Avery and Konomi together to peel you free from Avery\u2019s foot, leaving you as an exhausted flat strip. Konomi scooped you up and held you tightly in her fist as she walked on to the next set, not enough to hurt but enough to keep you flat and unable to yell at her for the way she was tricking Avery into treating you. Powerless, your first day of hellish modeling continued\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the beach would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI love to help people out, and I think that I\u2019m pretty athletic. I don\u2019t know how good I\u2019d be at saving people, but I can help with any other issues, or be on the lookout for people in need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smiled approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s a good attitude to have. You\u2019ll fit in, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Morgan was a bit letdown that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Avery was pretty upset that you hadn\u2019t chosen her either. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to Quinn standing above you, saying your name and lightly pushing the couch cushion with her foot to shake you awake. When you sat up groggily, she seemed to smile somewhat at your disheveled appearance, before switching back to her usual apathetic expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast in the kitchen.\u201d She said, jerking her head to motion towards the kitchen. She then sauntered away, leaving you to fulfill your morning obligations yourself. This way of treatment was still foreign to you, but there was something empowering about a giantess letting you act completely on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed and freshening up, you trekked over to the kitchen, narrowly avoiding Morgan\u2019s pounding feet as she strode to the front door. You would\u2019ve hated to get trampled under her sneakers as she left for the gym, so you were lucky you\u2019d leapt to the side in time. You were doubly lucky Avery was still asleep too, as you had no doubt, she\u2019d find a few to screw this morning up for you in that ditzy, bubbly way of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up onto the kitchen table, you found that Quinn had set you aside some crackers and a shot glass of apple juice to drink from. Giving her an appreciative thumbs up, you dug into your meal, easily satisfying your hunger before you\u2019d even finished off all of the crackers. Quinn didn\u2019t say anything during the meal, but you caught her staring at you twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished eating, Quinn lifted up a duffel bag of her own onto the table, and gestured to an unzipped pocket on the side. \u201cGet in. Easiest way to carry you, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d You nodded, obliging the black-haired giantess. Scrambling up into the pocket, you fit snuggly inside. You watched the outside world disappear as Quinn zipped it up, and then everything began to swing and shake as Quinn shouldered the bag and headed for the door. In almost any other circumstance, this would terrify you, but you felt strangely at peace with placing your trust in your new roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your bag being set down on the passenger\u2019s seat, and then the car start up. It was a bit boring in the bag, but surprisingly comfy, and one hundred percent safe. The drive to the beach took a little over a half hour, but finally you heard the car stop. Quinn picked the bag back up, and gently patted the pocket you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here. Sanderson Beach.\u201d She explained, and if you listened closely enough, you could hear the seagulls and the waves in the distance. \u201cI need to go to the employee locker room to change, and then I\u2019ll take you to the office to meet with Brigitte.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pounded back against Quinn\u2019s hand as a sign of understanding, earning yourself the quietest and quickest of laughs you\u2019d ever heard, before your giantess carrier headed off to the locker room. You couldn\u2019t do much but keep waiting in the pocket, but you obviously knew why. In fact, you began to feel both embarrassed and intrigued by the fact that Quinn was now carrying you into the women\u2019s locker room. You had never in your life been in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes of mostly silence passed, though you heard Quinn give a muffled \u2018hello\u2019 to someone else in the locker room with her. Finally, your pocket was unzipped, and you were quickly grabbed up by Quinn\u2019s giant, soft hand, her fingers enveloping you as she retrieved you. You were taken out of the bag and placed down on one of those hard-wooden benches common in locker rooms, and found yourself staring up at the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll rational thought fled your mind. Your jaw openly dropped, and your knees felt weak. Quinn had been unfathomably attractive upon first meeting her, but this was on a whole other level. While you\u2019d been in the bag, she\u2019d changed into what you could only assume was her lifeguard uniform. Though it was only a simple red one-piece bikini at the end of the day, the very sight of it rocked your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s heavily abundant chest was wildly pronounced, as her gigantic breasts strained against the tight fabric of the bikini. The bikini clung to Quinn\u2019s body like a second skin (at a guess, it was a size too small for the curvaceous girl), and showed off so much of her porcelain smooth flesh. Every time Quinn so much as shifted slightly, her boobs jiggled, and the word \u2018LIFEGUARD\u2019 which was printed across her chest was stretched and distorted to a comical degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your extremely obvious stare, Quinn frowned and crossed her arms, succeeding only in squishing her abundant breasts more prominently. \u201cWow, perv. I thought you were better than that, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily clamped your jaw shut and stammered out a defense. \u201cI-I just didn\u2019t k-know you had changed! Caught me off guard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the only spare uniform close to my size that they had.\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so\u2026\u201d She cut herself off, and a faint color flared up in her cheeks. \u201cA-anyway\u2026it sucks, but whatever. Doesn\u2019t bother me that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you look really great!\u201d You said, smiling (and secretly praying that a compliment was the right course of action here).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn quirked her mouth in a show of disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you look great! Really!\u201d You nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn seemed to debate whether you were being sincere or not for another second, and then finally smiled very softly. The blush had returned to her cheeks. \u201cTh-thanks, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing up her bag, Quinn effortlessly tied her short hair back and out of her eyes, then turned to put her bag into the locker behind her. For the second time in a row, your breath caught in your throat, and your jaw fell back open again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Quinn was impressive from the front, her backside was a heaven all onto itself. Her humongous derriere was impossibly alluring in her one-piece, each plump but doughy cheek perfectly sculpted into a big bubble booty. The one-piece left most of Quinn\u2019s creamy cheeks exposed, and it squeezed her ass so tight that the slightest movement shook it like an irresistible bowl of jelly. You desperately wished for nothing else than to leap into its pillowy embrace, this butt to end all butts bigger and more entrancing than any on the planet, in your books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to your staring, Quinn put her bag into her locker, then turned back to pick you up. Holding you in her hand, she walked out of the locker room and to the office. As she walked, you found it nigh impossible to not stare at her bountiful bosom or bodacious booty bounce and sway as she walked. Quinn was on a whole other level of thickness and beauty, and it was a shame she seemed oblivious to that. You also took note of how her one-piece seemed to keep riding up her butt crack, revealing even more of her ass. That whole \u2018size too small\u2019 issue was causing her a wedgie she had to keep picking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the office, Quinn introduced you to the chief lifeguard of Sanderson Beach, Brigitte. Brigitte was a twenty-five-year-old woman whose standout features were her fiery mane of red hair and her pronounced muscles and defined abs. She was alluringly muscled, fit but still feminine. Her own one-piece fit much more naturally than Quinn\u2019s, but she was still decently curvy under it. Her smile was award-winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little dude, it\u2019s a job you want?\u201d Brigitte asked, still smiling at you. It was a bit intimidating, how closely she was leaning in towards Quinn\u2019s hand to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yes! Yes, ma\u2019am! Any job you need, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d You proudly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte grinned. \u201cLove the attitude, man! I\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d She stood back to her full height of 6\u20192\u201d, and walked out from behind her desk. From what you\u2019d gathered, she spent most days handling office affairs. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026it\u2019s sudden to throw on another new lifeguard. We already have three others on shift today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn mused. \u201cWith three lifeguard towers overlooking the beach, we can always use more eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Brigitte agreed. \u201cTell ya what, Hunter. Do me proud for one whole week, and you\u2019ve got a guaranteed position. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d You said, shaking the red head\u2019s extended finger as a show of signing off on this new job. What\u2019s your first task?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, if testing you is what we\u2019re going with\u2026\u201d Brigitte tapped her chin, and looked at Quinn. Her eyes lit up. \u201cQuinn! Take Hunter with you to the middle tower. He\u2019ll be your partner for today\u2019s shift, and maybe the rest of the week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded, understanding. \u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled broadly. \u201cSounds like a plan to me, boss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte laughed at your bravado. \u201cAlright, then get going, you two! Guard some lives!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Quinn both nodded again, before you hopped up onto Quinn\u2019s palm. Bracing yourself, you held steady as your black-haired roommate strolled out of the office and onto the beach proper. The sun was blisteringly hot, but thankfully you and Quinn had both put on some sunscreen (Quinn in particular had lathered up to the extreme). There was also an occasional breeze that felt quite good, especially on your miniscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn strolled purposefully towards the middle tower, which you could see was not too far away. It was a standard lifeguard lookout post, about twelve feet off the ground. That was only half what you were noticing, however, as your attention had shamefully wandered back to Quinn herself. In full motion, her gigantic breasts were once more bouncing in an eye-catching manner, and her one-piece was again riding up her massive booty, revealing even more of it to the world. You were hardly the only one staring too, as Quinn was drawing the eyes of everyone she walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, she seemed oblivious to the adoration of the beach goers, or her own sex appeal. Your roommate and new partner merely kept sauntering on, eventually reaching the bottom of the lifeguard tower. Without a word to you, she cupped her hand and tossed you into the sky. You screamed out in surprise, flew into the air, and then crashed back down up atop the tower, landing in a slightly squishy heap on the floor of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you reformed, Quinn effortlessly scaled the ladder up onto the tower, and stood atop it seconds later. She spotted you immediately, and scooped you back up into her hand, then placed you on the railing that served as a barrier around the top of the tower. With you in place, she sank down into the lone chair, which looked to be made of uncomfortable hard plastic. You also couldn\u2019t help but note how Quinn\u2019s humongous ass just barely squeezed into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, you spoke up. \u201cSo\u2026this is the tower. What do we do now?\u201d You looked at your new partner eagerly, and though she stared back apathetically at first, your enthusiasm for your new job rubbed off just a bit on her, and she soothed her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, really.\u201d Quinn shrugged. \u201cIf someone asks for help, we help them. If someone starts screaming out in the water, we save them. Otherwise\u2026\u201d She gestured in a circle. \u201cThis is our post for the rest of the shift. Get comfy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at her blunt explanation, and sat down on the wooden railing. It was smooth wood, so no splinters, thankfully. In fact, you bet that you were more comfortable sitting on the railing than Quinn was in her seat. Though it was early in the day, the sun had been bearing down for hours, and the plastic was probably quite broiling, not to mention how the chair pinched and poked at Quinn\u2019s hips and back. You had to believe that it was built for lifeguard\u2019s with much less developed proportions than the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next twenty minutes were fairly uneventful. No one asked for help, no one screamed for a savior. The sounds of the beach were just the crashing of the waves, the laughing of the beach goers, the occasional windy breeze, and the cawing of seagulls. You passed the time with Quinn by asking her about some of her favorite memories working here. She was her usual cagey self for a bit, but she began to open up more as time went by. It was pretty fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the fun came to an end, and a faint voice called out from the bottom of the tower. \u201cHey! Miss! Can you help me find my phone? I swear, I just had it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn hopped to her feet instantly, and walked over to the railing, peering down at the young girl who had asked for help. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d She replied. She then looked back to you, forcing you to quickly clamp your open jaw shut, hoping Quinn hadn\u2019t just caught you watching her bubble butt jiggle and shake due to how fast she had stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way Quinn\u2019s eyes narrowed in annoyance, and the way she reached a hand back to readjust her wedgied one-piece, you knew that she had caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to not address it, you stammered out. \u201cU-uh\u2026want me to come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Quinn shook her head. \u201cNo, not this time. It\u2019ll take too long. Hold down the fort.\u201d She said, and then turned on her heel without another word. In one effortless motion, Quinn flipped around onto the ladder, and descended it out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll alone, you went back to scanning the beach, looking for anything that might be amiss, or anyone who might need help. There were a huge number of people at the beach, laughing, tanning, playing volleyball, swimming, and just generally enjoying themselves. For one blissful moment, you felt that this job was truly the best thing to ever happen to you, or any tiny, for that matter. It was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion of perfection shattered a moment later, when a squawking seagull dive-bombed through the air, coming to a screeching landing on the tower railing right beside you. You screamed and backed away, the giant bird like a mythical creature of death at your size. The seagull eyed you curiously, and took a step closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to end up the meal for some bird, you blindly leapt from the railing towards the inside of the tower, hoping it wouldn\u2019t follow you. You hadn\u2019t exactly looked where you were jumping, though, and you ended up landing right in the lifeguard chair. The fall slightly squished your legs, but the real thing you noticed first was the burning sensation of the hot plastic. It felt like you had landed in lava, it was almost overwhelmingly hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance told you that the seagull had given up and flown away, allowing you to breath a sigh of relief and focus on reforming. Your feet had flattened out and stuck to the plastic, the sticky nature of your body no doubt enhanced by how searingly hot the plastic was. Almost as overbearing as the temperature was the residual scent of Quinn\u2019s body wash mixed with her sweat. It was both gross and appealing, and that fact made it all the weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you had only just reformed one foot when the worst possible thing happened: Quinn appeared, having finished helping the young girl down below. She scaled the ladder with ease, and then approached her chair. You still couldn\u2019t move, and could only look up at her in fear as she towered above you. Nightmare scenarios of her not noticing you and sitting down ran through your mind, but she actually spotted you right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her hips, Quinn frowned. \u201c\u2026what are you doing, Hunter? That\u2019s not your seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up your hands, willing your right foot to stop sticking to the chair. \u201cI-I know, I know! I\u2019m sorry, Quinn. A seagull flew by and scared me off the railing. This is where I fell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s look of contempt told you that she didn\u2019t believe you, but there was a hint of uncertainty in her eyes. \u201cUh huh. You landed right where I\u2019m supposed to sit. Honestly, I should already BE sitting, even if you are there. It\u2019s not where you\u2019re supposed to be, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, honest! Please, Quinn, it won\u2019t happen again!\u201d You pleaded with your giantess lifeguard partner. \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn agonizingly long moment passed before Quinn closed her eyes and sighed. Reaching down, she plucked you up from her seat and returned you to the railing. She then sat back down, her butt audibly clapping against the plastic as she plopped into her chair. A grimace crossed your face, as visions of you being trapped under all of that played out in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Quinn a big, genuine smile. \u201cThank you, Quinn. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head. \u201cNo, I believe you, about the seagull. That isn\u2019t your fault, much. It would\u2019ve been wrong to punish you for it.\u201d She sighed, and you were about to speak again when she held up a finger, shushing you. \u201cBUT, if it happens again, I won\u2019t save you. You have to take care of yourself, Hunter, or you\u2019ll always be as weak and frail as people say that tinies are. You won\u2019t grow more dependable if I baby you every day during this job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took stock of her words, and nodded. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smiled faintly, and then was back to full business mode. \u201cSo if I see you on my chair again before I sit down\u2026\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t let me find you on my chair, is what I\u2019m saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that!\u201d You saluted, earning a barely audible chuckle from the black-haired giantess. Then, the two of you went back to looking out over the beach. Your shift as partners continued.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while of sitting around Quinn perked up hearing a shout from out in the water. Without hesitation she lept of from her chair and made her way out of the guard tower, leaving you behind. Not knowing what to do or being able to really follow Quinn you simply stayed put and waited for Quinn to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out onto the beach towards the direction Quinn ran off to and noticed that she was in the process of rushing out into the water. You looked a little farther out and saw that someone had drifted a little too far out and appeared to not be such a strong swimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated that all you could do is sit back and watch but also amazed at how quickly Quinn was taking care of the situation. Unfortunatley for you as you were distracted by the events unfolding out in the water you failed to notice the return of the seagull circling above you. By the time you noticed it swooping down at you once again all you could do is leap down from your perch and as fate would have it you landed in the worst possibly place, right back on Quinn's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you regained your senses you looked and noticed your legs had been slightly squished from the fall and you frantically tried to reform them before Quinn returned. As if fate was laughing at you, you began to hear someone coming back into the guard tower and you prayed that it wasn't Quinn. Your prayers were not answered as you saw Quinn emerge from the ladder and enter the tower. As she entered she looked forward and instantly noticed you in the seat of her chair once again, a look of annoyance crossing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn approached the chair and you quickly began to plead to her \"wait Quinn, please, it's not what it looks like I-\" you started to say but it fell on deaf ears it seemed. Staying true to her word, Quinn turned her back to you and you could only look up in terror as her massive rear end came crashing down on top of you like a giant meteor, instantly squashing you flat beneath her. She shifted around in her chair to get comfortable, grinding your body underneath her. Once she finally settled you began to realize that you were going to be stuck here for quite a while and should just accept your fate and hope that maybe she would have to get up to help someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck seemed to be against you today as the rest of the shift was completely uneventful and you remained squashed beneath Quinn's enormous backside. Unable to really see or do anything you had lost track of time but suddenly you felt a shift of movement from Quinn as she finally stood up. Unfortunately as Quinn stood you realized you were coming with her as you were now stuck to her butt. Quinn turned to looked down at the chair and when she noticed you were no longer there she simply shrugged and made her way out of the guard tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn made her way across the beach and towards the office building, each step causing her ass to sway and jiggle, which in turn cause you to do the same. Being squashed face first into Quinn's butt meant you really couldn't tell what was going on but you heard a door open and you noticed a drastic change in temprature meaing Quinn had entered the office building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds you heard another door open and Quinn spoke \"hey, my shift is over and heading home, so you'll want to send someone to tower 3\" she said. Bridgette looked up from her work and smiled \"Ok, thanks for the heads up. By the way, how did Hunter do on his first day?\" she asked. Quinn stopped for a second and shrugged \"he did ok I guess, pretty uneventful day\" she told her. \"Oh? Well thats good I guess, don't want to overwhelm him on his first day. Where is the little guy?\" Bridgette asked not seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn reached back and peeled you off of her butt, then held you in front of her. Bridgette laughed at this and shook her head \"and why exactly was he stuck to your ass?\" She questioned Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged \"he kept getting into my chair, so I just sat down\" she told her boss. \"Well, if he is interested in being a seat cushion, I will be here for a bit and sure could you some extra padding in this old chair\" Bridgette laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Quinn respond....</span></div></div>",

It seemed like this was going to be a very easy job, especially if you\u2019re being partnered with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard someone climbing up the ladder and you and Quinn turned to see who was approaching. A giant blonde reached the top of the ladder and she was wearing a red lifeguard swimsuit similar to Quinn\u2019s, only this one was a two-piece, exposing the blonde\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely on the curvy side with a similar build to Quinn, her seemingly luscious blonde locks were tied up in a top-knot bun. She had beautiful blue eyes, plump lips, and slightly tanned skin. Age-wise, she appeared to be in her late 20s, and you had to admit, she was pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Quinn!\u201d The happy blonde rang out. Exhibiting a bubbly, fun personality. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d The blonde\u2019s energy contrasted greatly with Quinn\u2019s as your roommate seemed slightly annoyed with this girl. \u201cOh... hey Bethany...\u201d Quinn bluntly greeted her coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde, evidently named Bethany, seemed unaware of Quinn\u2019s annoyance of her and continued the conversation. \u201cBrigitte told me we have a new member of our team, and I heard he was a tiny! I wanted to come introduce myself!\u201d Bethany said with an eager tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn turned to look at you and saw that you were staring at your new found \u201cdiscovery.\u201d You snapped out of it for a moment and made eye contact with Quinn, embarrassed that she noticed your admiring of Bethany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right over there.\u201d Quinn dryly declared, pointing towards the rail where you resided. Bethany turned her gaze to where Quinn gestured and saw your tiny body in plain sight. She sauntered over to you, her hips swaying and chest slightly bouncing in a hypnotic display as she approached. She stood in front of you, the rail coming up to her waist so you were face-to-face with her soft belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to crane your head upwards, attempting to concentrate on her deep blue eyes to avoid the distraction of her physique. Bethany stared down at you for a moment and smiled. \u201cWell hello there, cutie! My name is Bethany!\u201d Her \u201ccutie\u201d comment definitely caught you off guard as you tried to formulate a response. \u201cUh.. hi. I\u2019m Hunter!\u201d Quinn rolled her eyes at your awkward reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany continued to study the tiny boy below her. Since tinies became a normal part of society, she has always treated them well and enjoyed interacting with them. However, this time it felt different; she had never encountered a tiny so... cute before. Her infatuation with you was growing each passing second as she eyed your cute face and shirtless body, she was going to enjoy working with you. She was a really sweet girl at heart, but not the most self-aware as she can be a tad too affectionate at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to feel slightly uncomfortable as the massive blonde continued her locked gaze on you, the grin she sported doing nothing to calm you down. \u201cWow...\u201d Bethany said. Finally breaking the silence. \u201cI must say, you are incredibly cute! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met a tiny as handsome as you!\u201d She finished her statement with a flirtatious wink causing you to tremble. Something about this girl made you slightly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Umm, thank you! That\u2019s... nice of-Whoa!\u201d You were interrupted as a giant hand reached down and scooped you up off the railing and you were now face-to-face with Bethany as you sat on her palm. The happy blonde giggled before she started to poke and lightly stroke you with her finger, the tickling sensation grew quickly as you tried to fight her off. Quinn took a slight enjoyment at your predicament as she watched you grunt and squirm. \u201cAww! How adorable!\u201d Bethany sang as she continued to tickle your abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Quinn began to grow annoyed with Bethany's obnoxious laugh and decided to come retrieve you. \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough.\u201d Your roommate declared with authority as she grabbed you from her coworker\u2019s hand. \u201cAwww...\u201d Bethany's once joyful expression took a 180. You almost felt bad for her, she seemed nice and probably means well, but you were also relieved to be back in Quinn\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best if we all get back to work\u201d Quinn continued, having no regards of her coworker\u2019s sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... well I\u2019m going to head back to my post then...\u201d Bethany was pretty bummed as she walked towards the ladder... but then she got an idea! \u201cSay, Quinn... would it be okay if I took Hunter for a bit? You know... show him around the beach and stuff?\u201d The sweet smile quickly returned to the blonde\u2019s face. Your heart nearly stopped at her suggestion, and you turned to look at Quinn, subtly trying to shake your head \u2018no\u2019 and use your eyes to communicate that message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn read your message loud and clear, she knew you didn\u2019t want to go with her. On the other hand she was still kinda pissed about the seat incident from earlier and sort of wanted to get back at you somehow. She knew Bethany very well, and the idea of you being stuck in her loving clutches was amusing to her. The thought brought a subtle smirk to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delay of Quinn\u2019s response was unsettling, she obviously had something on her mind... was she considering letting Bethany take you with her??? Your thoughts were interrupted as Quinn opened her mouth and said \u201c______\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYeah sure. Whatever.\u201d Quinn answered. Before you could open your mouth to protest you felt yourself fly in the air as Quinn tossed you towards Bethany. The blonde had no time to react as you sailed towards her, so instead of catching you with her hand, you landed straight on her boobs. You bounced a few times before falling into the ravine that was her cleavage. Your entire body was wedged between the two fleshy mounds, completely out of sight. For a moment you wondered if Quinn purposefully intended for you to land here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn giggled with a satisfied expression. \u201cWow! Looks like he\u2019s already having fun!\u201d Bethany blushed for a moment as she processed what just happened. \u201cOh oops.. my bad Hunter!\u201d The blonde sympathetically expressed. \u201cOh don\u2019t apologize!\u201d Quinn chimed in again. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just where he wants to be! I saw the way he was looking at you earlier, he\u2019s definitely on cloud nine right now!\u201d You tried to shout and explain the truth to Bethany, but your voice was muffled between her huge boobies. \u201cHee hee! That tickles!\u201d The happy blonde giddily announced as she felt your attempts to talk and squirm free, her boobs quivered as she laughed causing you to bounce in a nauseating rhythm with them. \u201cGuess it\u2019s your turn to get tickled now!\u201d Quinn teased. Butterflies excitedly swarmed in Bethany's stomach at the revelation that you seem to like her too! \u201cOmg! This is just FANTABOLOUS!\u201d Bethany squealed like a school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn watched Bethany eagerly descend the ladder and haul you far away towards the other end of the beach, her bikini booty bouncing happily with each step. For a moment she felt kind of bad about what she just did to you, maybe the chair situation really was just an accident... However, she also knew that you having some time with an overbearing girl like Bethany might toughen you up a little more! Pleased with her justification, she turned her attention back towards the beach as you slipped her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried as deep as you were in Bethany's cleavage, there was really nothing you could do to prevent her from carrying you away with her. Your feeble attempts to struggle or protest absorbed into the bouncing of her breasts without even being noticed by the massive blonde. With the warm flesh rubbing against you from all sides, it was difficult just to maintain your basic shape, let alone try to hatch an escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to the thoughts of her little passenger, Bethany was just happy to have her new little friend in tow as she strolled along the beach, her large rear jiggling happily with each step. She\u2019s always been intentional in making sure that tiny men are treated fairly and well, so she takes joy in befriending you! Plus... she hasn\u2019t had a boyfriend in a long time, so she was excited to get to spend the day with such a cute boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Bethany truly is a sweetheart and always tries to be kind to everyone she meets, she severely lacks social awareness. Her overbearing and highly affectionate nature typically acting as a major factor in her actions. This behavior has scared off many in the past, especially men, and little did you know you were about to become the next victim of her tender motivations...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh wait a minute!\" Brigitte exclaimed, raising her finger and eyebrows at the same time as she seemingly remembered something. \"I completely forgot about our tinies only section of our beach! We typically have had one of our normal sized lifeguards watch over it, as its pretty much just a 10x10 foot square of sand leading up to the water. But quite often there are issues that could likely use a bit more precision than our girls can give. I mean you save dozens of tiny guys from drowning without so much as a thank you, but accidentally kidnap a few guys after the waves slide them into the back of your swimsuit and you\u2019ll never live it down.\u201d Brigitte shook her head, part of her chuckling at her quick anecdote, and part actually annoyed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where you come in,\u201d she continued, \u201cThere\u2019s an appropriately sized lifeguard tower towards the edge of the zone, as well as a tiny megaphone for you to yell at any of the tiny guys in there or any normal sized girl trying to enter the zone.\u201d You smiled in return, appreciative of the inclusion of the megaphone. While some strange part about the physiological changes of men allowed your voices to travel to normal girls\u2019 ears most of the time, seemingly if they weren\u2019t paying enough attention then they often still wouldn\u2019t hear you. Being able to bolster your voice even a bit would likely be quite helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte leaned over you once more, her powerfully toned body contrasting the overwhelming softness of your new giantess roommate behind you. \u201cSave people who need saving, help people who need helping, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory. Now get out there, and you too, Wallace, you\u2019ll be manning the station that the tiny section is in. Keep an eye out and help him if he needs it but I don\u2019t want to catch you doing his job for him!\u201d Brigitte\u2019s firmness was accompanied by a level of genuine confidence and enthusiasm that somehow reassured you. While she looked intimidating, you could tell that if you stayed on her good side then she would be a good ally to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, believe me I won\u2019t be babying this guy. He\u2019s gotta survive on his own somehow.\u201d Quinn said to Brigitte, her eyes flicking down to you midway through her sentence. In a way you really appreciated Quinn\u2019s blunt, no nonsense way of speaking to you. You had grown used to women either taking care of your every need in an overbearing way, or actively seeking out to torture you. Either way the fact that you were only an inch tall seemed to almost always be the focus of any woman\u2019s attention towards you. It was quite refreshing to hear Quinn actually talk to you as an equal, even if you were about 1/70th her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn then plucked you up in her hand, readjusting so you could sit on her palm as she turned and walked swiftly out of the office. Making a pitstop back in the locker room, Quinn stopped by her locker, placed you on the bench, and took out a large tube of SPF 100 sunscreen. You could only gawk up at your giant friend as she began to smear the cream over every inch of exposed flesh. You watched her soft hands caressing each of her comically oversized assets, making sure she didn\u2019t miss a single spot. The amount of sunscreen she needed to cover a single gargantuan butt cheek would probably be a lifetime supply for you. In the middle of your deep trance you heard Quinn\u2019s voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStaring again, perv. If you\u2019re going to work as a lifeguard you\u2019re going to have to learn how to keep your composure around regular girls in bikinis.\u201d Quinn\u2019s tone indicated half annoyance, but also half genuine enjoyment that she took from poking fun at you. Either way, you were about to shout back to her that she was far beyond a \u201cregular girl\u201d as she said due to her ludicrously attractive looks, but before you could speak a drop of sunscreen as big as you landed right on you. You quickly dug your way out of the thick substance, reaching the top to catch the tail end of a light chuckle coming from Quinn. By the time you pulled yourself out of the glob you were sufficiently covered head to toe, ensuring that you would neither melt nor burn yourself in the hot sun. Quinn then reached down with a finger, swiping up the remaining sunscreen on the bench and rubbing it into her the last spot on her ass that she hadn\u2019t yet covered. Quinn caught you looking once more and simply rolled her eyes before picking you up yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on let\u2019s get out there\u201d she said as she closed her locker and began powerfully walking out into the blistering sun. It was a scorching day on the beach, happy to be covered in Quinn\u2019s extra strong sunscreen. Since both of your stations were located towards the middle of the beach, it only took you a matter of minutes to reach them. You saw the tinies only section from your perch in Quinn\u2019s hand. It consisted of a number of spikes in the sand, with bright red rope traveling between them, effectively sectioning off the 10x10 foot area that Brigitte had been talking about before. You saw it was fairly crowded too, with a number of guys looking to simply spend a nice day at the beach without fear of being crushed by a roaming giantess. It honestly looked pretty fun to you, briefly making you wish that you had more friends your size. Spending all of your time with giant women had its benefits for sure, but the normalcy of the tiny zone did seem like a welcome change of pace for once. Quinn finally arrived at the edge of the rope, bending over to drop you off in the sand. As she did so you saw each and every head in the zone turn to stare at the hanging mountain of cleavage behind them. Honestly, you couldn\u2019t blame them, you were too. Quinn\u2019s body was a spectacle, even if she didn\u2019t often acknowledge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hunter, do some good work today. I want to make sure you keep this job\u2026 it would be kind of cool to keep working together like this.\u201d Quinn said down to you, once again showing just the slightest crack in her normally apathetic attitude. She then stood back up, returning to her full height, and turned to walk back towards her own normal sized lifeguard tower. Once more you and the sea of tiny guys in the section stared at the ridiculous ass eating up the backside of her lifeguard one piece with each passing step. You shook yourself out of staring and walked a few steps, climbing the lifeguard tower and sitting yourself in the high chair. Sure enough the megaphone was hanging off of the armrest and there was a miniature umbrella casting a nice shadow over you. You looked out beyond the tiny guys\u2019 zone and saw a myriad of beautiful giant women frolicking and having fun on the beach. You breathed a sigh of contentment, maybe your job wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all. After all, you knew from experience that guys were fairly resilient, so you didn\u2019t have much fear of actually needing to save any lives. It seemed like a pretty solid gig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat befalls you as lifeguard of the tinies only section?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was quite crowded that day and most of the open space on the beach was already taken by other women. For that reason when you heard a woman\u2019s voice behind you say, \u201cUgh, finally an open space\u201d you whipped your head around and knew that she was headed straight for you. You watched for a moment as her massive feet kicked sand to and fro, each step getting her closer along her path right towards the tinies only section. Fumbling with your megaphone for a moment you finally raised it to your lips, the woman only a few steps away from steamrolling you under her massive sole and trampling countless guys in front of you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am! This is not an open space, this is an area dedicated to tiny men only!\u201d You shouted up, your voice amplified through the megaphone being clearly loud enough for the woman to hear. She luckily slowed down her pace and looked downward, finally seeming to recognize the mass of tinies laid out in front of her. She grimaced for a moment before looking specifically at you. You kept talking, \u201cI apologize for the inconvenience, but if you could kindly find somewhere else to set up your things I would really appreciate it. Normal sized women are not supposed to go past the red rope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman tapped her chin for a moment in thought, before her eyes lit up with an idea. You were nervous already, you had hoped that the woman would just comply and leave you be. But deep down you knew that whatever idea of authority that you thought the lifeguard job would give you, ultimately meant jack squat when dealing with a woman who could squish you like chewed gum. She finally spoke down to you, \u201cEver heard of Baker\u2019s law?!\u201d the woman said haughtily, pointing confidently at her tan swimsuit bottom. Your heart dropped as you knew immediately what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaker\u2019s law was a Supreme Court decision that had been made nearly 18 months ago at this current point in time. After years of fighting from a student, now graduate, at a college called Middletown University that goes by the name of Amy Baker, a law concerning the usage and rights of tiny men as items had been passed. You heard all about it on the news when it first passed. Amy Baker fought for the idea that men should be able to choose to be used as whatever they wanted, not just forced to live as miniature regular people. They could pursue getting legally licensed for use by a specific woman or in general, as long as all parties involved were willing. The law stated that any licensed man must still be recognized as a human being, no matter what condition they were currently in or what they were being used for. The process in its entirety was quite rare, with a very small percentage of the population actually going through with it, but nonetheless it made nationwide headlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was seen by this Amy Baker herself as a landmark day for tiny men\u2019s rights. She thought that men who were okay with being used should be respected and accepted for doing so. It was a sweet idea, really, but in reality it was easily abused by women who sought far worse fates for the tiny men that surrounded them. A few cases of men who got their Usage License for the right reasons would find their way to news stations every once in a while. A husband signing up for use from his wife and daughter because he didn\u2019t have enough money to buy them Christmas presents would warm the hearts of those who heard of it. But just as often as you heard good stories about Baker\u2019s Law, you also heard the opposite. Men were often threatened into pursuing their Usage License, or outright sold themselves into it in hopes of making a quick buck. You never really understood the point of passing the law in the first place, as you had never once noticed a woman police officer asking to see someone\u2019s Usage License ever. All you knew was that there was no way in hell you would do it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back into reality, you knew that when the woman said those words and pointed to her rather small bikini bottom, that it must have been a small guy just like you. You empathized with the man, having been in his situation more than a few times before. The woman then kept talking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he is a tiny guy just like you and the law says you have to respect his rights even though he is my swimsuit bottom! Since he is wrapped around my ass right now then my ass deserves entry into your stupid tinies only section. Couldn\u2019t you all just scoot over a bit too? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll take up the entire space!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to handle the situation. If you still rejected the woman then she may really be able to pursue legal discourse, suing the lifeguard company for not respecting the rights granted to men by Baker\u2019s Law. You cursed this stupid law, what rights did that guy receive? The right to have his entire body wedged between her butt cheeks? In reality it just granted this giantess woman even more privilege to do as she pleased. Briefly considering standing up to the giantess, you eventually decided against it. However, an idea did spark in your mind about a loophole in the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course we respect his right to be in here, he is a tiny after all. But since he is currently residing around your, erm, backside, then I am afraid your backside is the only part of you that is allowed to be in here with him.\u201d You smirked internally, knowing that at least in some way you had followed the rules and still won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman furrowed her brow in anger for a moment, before lightening up and responding simply, \u201cOkay that works for me!\u201d In an instant she dropped her things just outside of the roped off area, sending a cloud of sand careening over you and countless tiny guys near you. As the cloud of sand cleared you looked up to see the giantess had turned herself around, and had already begun squatting down, right where your lifeguard stand was on the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*crack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive woman\u2019s ass collided with your lifeguard tower and yourself first, absolutely detonating the seat which you were starting to love so much. As it shattered you fell to the sand a few feet, with her planet sized ass following suit. Even in this horrific moment, you couldn\u2019t help but think that this woman\u2019s still sizable ass wasn\u2019t even in the same league as Quinn\u2019s. But you didn\u2019t have time to think as the crushing pressure of the woman rammed you deeper into the sand, displacing the grains around her. When all was said and done the woman\u2019s ass was planted firmly on top of you, with her legs sticking out away from the water and outside of the roped off tiny zone. She had won, you cursed yourself for being so stupid. You could only hope that this woman could show you mercy at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you handle this rude giantess?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The heat and the pressure underneath this woman was nearly too much for you, buried under her butt. With all your might you tried to wriggle and get away from her but being directly under her cheek made it impossible for you to move. You tried to focus on what to do under the heat and pain you were in.<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here, I cant fail on my first task of the day! And what will  my boss and the other lifeguards think of me when property of the beach gets destroyed under my watch?\" You tried again but there was no avail. She was just much too heavy for you and you were much too squashed. Your senses became more and more dull thanks to the immense heat and pressure you were suffering. After sometime.. you coulndt say if it were 10 min or 1h her butt sweat began dripping from her cheek, forming a layer on her butt and yourself. At first you were just disgusted as anyone would, especially when that sweat comes from this bodyregion. Suddenly you remembered the poor guy, who apparently voluntered to experience this and much worse things as her swimsuit bottom.\"Why would someone volunteer for such a horrible  treatment with all the sweat and worse? Especially only for the profit of such an unpleasant woman\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whait SWEAT that's it! I can try to wriggle around the next time she shifts her position and with a little luck I can escape due the layer of liquid around me! Or maybe dig my way out of here, right beside the sand doesnt seem so compressed as it is here\" you thougt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time the woman did shift around for some reason. The silent *plop* of a sunscreen bottle delivered the explanation why luck was on your side. But it didnt matter to you: You wriggled your whole body to move a little forward. Step by step you moved forward like a snail, unfortunatly for you was the fact that you were just as slow as the animal. Finally you arrived at the section of loose sand to dig your way to freedom. When you looked up you could see the huge ass crack of your (former?) captive. You tried to get the fear out of your head, cause it would only lead to freeze you because of that feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets do this\" you said to yourself, trying to motivate you and getting the fear out of your head. Suddenly you heard a quiet but noticable voice:<br>\r\n \"Hello? I mmmpf HELP!\" <br>\r\nYou nearly pissed yourself out of fear until you remembered the thong-guy and that the voice most likely belonged to him.<br>\r\nThe next moment you looked up and saw the butt looming over you. You had to think quickly: \"Ok I dont know what is happening here but first i need to get away from this ground zero, if i make it I can solve the riddle of the thong-mans voice\" you cursed yourself for the term \"thong- guy\" but since that stupid law passed the supreme court it was all around the news and media in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou digged your way away from this dangerous place and made mor progress than you expected yourself. You were in a good physical condition but was helping you the most , was the fact that this woman took her sweet time for putting on her sun lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your work was done and you felt safe enough to look back you realized that you indeed made it out of the danger zone. Exhausted you allowed yourself a moment of rest,celebrating your victory and taking a deep breath of fresh air. <br>\r\nAfter 5 min of resting and reforming more and more you were nearly in your original human form,which filled you with joy and relief. Mostly because it wouldnt be the first time for you getting away from one danger and stumbling in the next.<br>\r\nSpeaking of danger: \" I have to solve this stupid situation with this woman without getting squashed again you \" you told yourself. \"But what about the guy in her back... Was he really calling for help or was it just the pressure and heat which made me hallucinate?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about this occurence under the butt your feet finally plopped back in their normal form and you were able again to walk and solve the problem with the lifeguard stand and maybe solve the riddle of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approached the woman, who seemed to read a book with her sunglasses on and enjoying her time. What angered you additionally to your broken work station was the fact that she does not seem to be concerned about what you two talked about before, now almost her whole body was in the tiny section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00c4hm EXCUSE ME ,MISS?\" you shouted up to her.<br>\r\nConfused she took her sunglasses down a little to see who was talking to her and finally she cought sight of you.<br>\r\n\"You again? What do you want from me again? I'm trying to enjoy me time here at the beach. Wasn't our early talk enough for you to realized that you are not welcome here?<br>\r\nWhat she said was making a very angry and much less careful.<br>\r\n\"I'M THE LIFEGUARD HERE AND YOU ARE A GUEST OF THIS BEACH. I REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE ORDERS OF THE STAFF WITHOUT EXCEPTION!\" you screamed at her full of anger.<br>\r\nAt first she looked shocked at your outburst but soon she just smirked while shrugging her shoulders. She doesnt seem to be impressed and answered with a slight giggle :<br>\r\n\"Well Mr. Lifeguard, of course I follow the orders of the beach. We talked about my rights...aaahm his rights to be in this tiny section.\" <br>\r\nWhen she mentioned the guy in her backside, you suddenly remembered your second goal for this conversation but you had to play your cards smart.<br>\r\n\"Well first of all I have to correct you a little, indeed you followed my orders from before but it seems like you didnt notice that you destroyed property of the firm I'm working for, my Lifeguard- outlook. Which i believe wasnt on purpose but still is a violation.<br>\r\n\"I didnt destroy anything, i would be glad if you showed me proof of these wild accusations\" she demanded.<br>\r\nAfter you told her to stand up and look behind her, her face turned red out of anger or shame you couldnt tell.<br>\r\n\"Well ok , seems like I did, but there was no way for me to see this little match- house.\" Plus it was Brains fault as well\" she said while pointing at her thong, which began to have a deep red colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This brings me to the  next topic i wanted to ask you about...\" you started your sentence dripping of confidence after your last verbal win against this woman. You were disgusted that she tried to blame her thong for this but that was their personal problem. What you were interested in was the usage license<br>\r\nwith both their signatures.<br>\r\n\"May I ask you for your usage license please?\" you asked. <br>\r\n\"Well no , cause that is really none of your damn buisness and besides I only have to show it to a police officer.\" she said offended.<br>\r\n\"Well that is indeed very true but when I was burried with my Outlook -tower under you I could hear a voice shouting out for help, which made me believe It was worth asking why this might be\" you said overconfidently, forgetting about the difference in her and your possibilties.<br>\r\n\"Well, Well, Well we have a very dedicated young lifeguard here it seems, always seeking for the wellbeing of his customers.\" she said while searching in her beach bag. After a little time of searching, she took a very creasy piece of paper out of her bag, which was nearly not readable due of its bad state. On one corner you could see a big coffee spot in the middle there was something which looked like ketchup.<br>\r\n\"This is the Usage License for my little thongy- Tony here\", she said while pulling on her thong to emphazise her power over him and smirking at you.<br>\r\nWhen you looked on it you could only read that her name was Rachel Wood and that her part of the document had a signature as it should be. But the other half of the paper, where his information should be was all dirty and nearly not readable. At first you thought you would have lost again against this woman but fortunatly for you, you realized that there was no signature to see under the coffee spot.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mam it seems there is no signature of a Tony on this license which makes the whole document wortless, legally speaking of course\" you said smiling and drunk of your own self esteem. \" I will have to call my boss to further inspect this anomaly, I'm sure when we ask Tony he will explain everything\" you said <br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye the woman grabed you with light speed and you found yourself right in front of her angry face. <br>\r\n\"Oh I  dont think so my dear. Do you see this woman there?\" she asked pointing at a huge curvy black woman in a skimpy blue bikini walking towards your spot and waiving with her arms to greet. Even from this perspective you could see that her assets , especially her butt were giant in comparison to Rachels<br>\r\n\"This is Isabella, my dearest friend and by coincidence she is a notary which can confirm my story about tonys free choice to be a thong for me. \" she explained to you with a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"She was responsible for all the paper work I had to do before I could get Tony where I wanted. So here is the deal little man either you stay silent about all  of these accusations with the tower and tony, or maybe a new Usage License appears with your name on it and I promise you that the \"For everyone to use\"- Box will be crossed. I'm sure Isabella would gladly be of help for your wish. And the way I see it you would also make a great thong but I guess you will be the wrong size for a woman like me\" she said with a telling expression on her face while turning her eyes to Isabell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were in a double windmill. either you give in and wont have an explanation for the lost tower  or you will have to deal with a corrupt notary and her evil friend leading to a Usage Licence for yourself. \"What shall I do either way I'm fucked up, the question is... is my well being more important than tonys? Noone will investigate his status as a thong without you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But even though it was your first day, it was your duty as a lifeguard to protect the lives of any tiny guys at the beach. It would have weighed heavily on your conscience if you just abandoned him to be imprisoned in this arrogant woman\u2019s ass. Clearly you figured that she, with the help of her friend, had the ability to create counterfeit usage licenses based on the muffled screams of the guy acting as her thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even knowing that fact, you would never be able to forgive yourself if you let this fellow guy Tony suffer in his current predicament. You cursed your stupidly strong sense of empathy, knowing that like always it would only lead you to trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry miss, but I just can\u2019t let this slide. This usage license clearly isn\u2019t official and you know it.\u201d You said up to her, still pretending to find this mysterious panic button that you claimed to have on you. From in between two of her fingers, pinching you like a twig, it was admittedly hard to feign confidence. You saw the malice growing in this giantess\u2019s eyes as you challenged her, strengthening the pit of nerves that you felt in your stomach. You knew firsthand that directly challenging a normal sized girl as a one inch tall guy was consistently the dumbest choice that you could make, but for some reason you just couldn\u2019t let this situation go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your absolute surprise Rachel opened up her fist and simply dropped you onto the sand below! You landed with a thud inaudible to any regular sized people, immediately trying to straighten and reform the legs that she squished in her grip. Nevertheless, it seemed like your plan had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you little tattletale. Messing with you isn\u2019t worth the risk of you actually calling over someone who has real power.\u201d Rachel said while gathering her things! It seemed like you had actually won your battle! Your confidence soared briefly, thinking on your feet actually got you out of a jam for once. But then Rachel continued, \u201cMy friend and I will find somewhere else on this stupid beach to tan, but not before we find another lifeguard and ask allllll about you. I\u2019m sure that my notary friend finding out all of your personal details won\u2019t end up badly for you at all!\u201d Rachel\u2019s indirect threat struck fear further into your heart as she then leaned down, lowered her sunglasses, and looked directly into your eyes. Her enormous breasts threatened to spill out of her bikini top, but you were far too terrified to even pay attention to them at a time like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you think you might have won or something, twerp, but you didn\u2019t. Not only am I not giving up my little thong, but let\u2019s just say your life is going to get a lot more difficult in the near future.\u201d Rachel smirked before finishing, \u201cEven though I may not be the one dishing out the punishment to your tiny ass, you better pray that the other women in your life really like you, because if they don\u2019t\u2026 well you\u2019ll find out!\u201d As she concluded her speech, Rachel stood up and shot you a final wink before spinning around and walking away. She signaled to her friend Isabella that they would need to find a new spot, prompting a quick look of confusion from the woman before she simply shrugged her shoulders and kept walking. As the two women walked further into the distance you cursed the sad life of that guy, Tony, watching as he was chewed up between the callous woman\u2019s butt cheeks. You took another moment to assess your surroundings and you lamented the state of the men\u2019s beach section. The simple action of that jerk of a woman sitting down in the sand practically wiped out everything that was set up to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back once more to make sure that the two menaces of women were actually leaving, you gulped with fear upon remembering Rachel\u2019s threat. If her friend really was a notary like she said, could she really write a usage license for you without your consent?! As you had that thought your eyes found the two, now a good distance away, and they seemed to be talking to Brigitte. Rachel clearly pointed directly at you and the tiny guy\u2019s section, sharing a few words with your boss of all people. Your eyes opened wide, as you finally saw Brigitte split from the two immediately begin walking towards you. Now panicked, you frantically wondered what that malicious woman may have said to your boss. If she bad mouthed you enough you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were fired on the spot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte\u2019s long powerful steps covered the vast stretch of beach between you and her in no time. What may have been a multiple day hike for you was only a minute or so for the strong giantess. Your nerves were about to overwhelm you as Brigitte walked straight up to you, surprisingly noticing you next to the remnants of your shattered lifeguard tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter!\u201d She exclaimed, intimidating you once more. But suddenly she broke into a huge smile, \u201cThose two women over there just raved to me about how helpful you were to them! They said they really appreciated your hard work and were asking all about you! They even asked for your home address which I thought was a bit strange at first, but they said they wanted to send you a gift or something. Either way, keep up the good work. You\u2019ve already surpassed my expectations for you, and the busy part of the day should just about be ending so the rest of the day should be a breeze.\u201d Brigitte shot you a big thumbs up before turning and walking away, presumably to check on Quinn and the other lifeguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe your ears. Not only did Rachel and Isabella not try to get you fired, but they actually praised you. On one hand you were happy, but on the other hand you felt incredibly uneasy with how that whole situation went down. What else did that crazy girl and her friend have in store for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your day went miraculously smoothly. True to Brigitte\u2019s claim, the rush slowed down significantly, a welcome change for you. You sadly had to sit in the sand since your lifeguard tower was destroyed, but somehow no other life-threatening events happened at all until the end of your shift. At the end of the day, Quinn picked you up and took you home, carrying you in the pocket of her bag once more. Part of you wanted to talk to her on the trip back but you didn\u2019t want to push the envelope with your new roommate. She seemed a bit standoffish, even though you could tell that there was more to her than that, but either way risking annoying her didn\u2019t seem like the best move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour luck continued into the evening, as you and your three roommates ordered chinese food and had a remarkably unremarkable dinner. Nobody slurped you up along with their noodles, or threw you into the trash accidentally, or even squashed you at all! You had a genuinely nice night, each telling one another about their respective jobs. It was fantastic to say the least. Even when the three girls left you downstairs without figuring out your sleeping arrangements just like the night before, you didn\u2019t mind one bit. You had hope that you would figure it out soon enough, but until then the cushioned couch was more than sufficient. Eventually, you drifted off into dreamland, thinking about how your one inch tall life might turn out normal just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in the morning to Morgan standing over you, holding a letter with your name on it. You rubbed the sleep out of your eyes and looked closer and saw that it was stamped with the logo of the C.T.C or the Center for Tiny Citizenship! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks serious, Hunter. You want me to open it for you?\u201d Morgan said, with evident concern in her voice. Having just woke up, you simply nodded. Morgan dug her finger into the envelope and gently opened it. When she pulled out the two of you recognized the paper immediately. Tinies and regular sized girls alike knew what it was upon first glance, considering it was likely the single most impactful law that had been passed in the last half century. Both you and Morgan\u2019s eyes went wide, as she read out loud \u201cUsage License for General Use\u2026 Hunter Woods\u201d Morgan spun the paper around immediately you saw a clearly forged version of your signature, along with the words General Use instead of a specific woman\u2019s name on the opposite side. Down at the bottom you saw in fine print, \u201cnotarized by Isabella Brooks\u201d. Your entire world was shattered in an instant. Those crazy women did it. Not only did you have an official usage license, but a General Use one to boot. This meant that any woman could use you without needing documentation of their own. Effectively, if a cruel enough woman found out about this she could destroy your life as a human being in an instant and subject you to a life of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to handle this atomic bomb of news so early in the morning, you felt yourself get light headed and faint!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke soon after, what was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Some/all of the girls all take a sick day and take you straight to the C.T.C. to get to the bottom of your random Usage License)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You wake up in Quinn\u2019s bag, with her taking you to work just like yesterday since she didn\u2019t want to be late. Little did you know but your employer gets automatically notified if a tiny guy acquires a usage license while currently employed. Brigitte may force Quinn to use you as a swimsuit to replace her too-small uniform)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You wake up to a knock on the door and it is a relative who you haven\u2019t seen in a while, eager to use you)</span></div></div>",

This made you take a look around and you and realise that you were currently on a bus, with you and your roommates occupying the back seats.<br>\r\nYou looked back to your roommates in confusion before Avery, noticing the confused look on your face, spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cWe all took the day off to take you to the C.T.C and help you get rid of that general usage license!\u201d Avery\u2019s exuberant personality and loud voice drew the looks of a few of the other women on the bus, many of their eyes drawing to you at the mention of your usage license.

It\u2019s not as if anyone could take Hunter from the three of us, we just need to keep an eye on him,\u201d Avery huffed defensively as she saw the irritated looks on the other girl\u2019s faces because of her outburst.<br>\r\n\u201cSo Hunter, the plan is to walk in to the C.T.C building and demand a meeting with the woman who notarised your license and try to straighten this out. If not we can try and threaten legal action against them, although that might be a difficult route since these usage licenses are kinda hard to get rid of from what I hear. Plus none of us really have that much money to pay a good lawyer, so let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that,\u201d Morgan\u2019s eyes seemed to sadden as she explained how difficult that getting rid of this license could be. You felt yourself falling deeper into panic the more you thought about it as well. The only thing keeping you even slightly calm was the fact that all three of your roommates were here to protect you.<br>\r\n\u201cOur stop should be coming up soon, so sit tight Hunter,\u201d Avery gave you a small smile, which then faded to her usual neutral expression once she realised she was smiling. <br>\r\nThe bus journey passed uneventfully, the chatter between your roommates drifted away from your situation, which helped ease your nerves. However as the girls chatted you couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of several sets of eyes still on you, many of the women on the bus hadn\u2019t taken their eyes off of you since Avery\u2019s outburst, even the bus driver was still stealing glances at you when she wasn\u2019t focusing on the road. Eventually Quinn and Morgan also noticed the stares, both of them giving you a look of reassurance as Avery continued to chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the bus started to approach the stop closest to the C.T.C office building. Quinn, Morgan and Avery stood up, with Morgan at the front holding you. <br>\r\nMany of the women who were watching you lost interest when they saw you leaving the bus, except for one, the driver. <br>\r\nAs your group walked through the isle you saw her glance at you and smirk. Before you could even contemplate what was happening she pressed on the breaks, jolting the bus to a halt in the stop. Morgan stumbled forward with you in her hand as she tried to keep her grip on you. Does she succeed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Yes, Morgan manages to keep a hold of you and you all get off the bus as quickly as possible. Morgan and Quinn glaring at the bus driver as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) No, and you go flying forward towards the bus driver, exactly as she planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) No, you go flying backwards towards one of the other passengers, or towards Quinn or Avery.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you flew from Morgan\u2019s grip time seemed to slow for you. You looked around the bus to see all the women who had been staring at you excitedly when they heard about your usage license begin to shift in their seats in anticipation now that they saw you were separated from your roommates. You saw Morgan\u2019s panicked face as she realised she had lost her grip of you, but didn\u2019t see exactly where in the air you were, or where you were flying towards.<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you turned around to see your destination. You could see the eyes of the bus driver in the rear view mirror tracking your movement, she looked ecstatic that her plan had worked as you were now sailing through the air in a perfect arc towards her. You saw a few of the women in between Morgan and the front of the bus reach up to try to catch you, and a few of them come close, their fingers brushing against you. You yelped every time one of their hands swept past you, but your fear of them seemed misplaced, because the real danger was where you were about to land. The bus driver eagerly watched you arc through the air, sailing over her head and landing with a barely audible splat at her feet, just in front of the pedals her feet were currently resting on. As you took a second to get your bearings you managed to take in the appearance of your new tormentor.<br>\r\nEven from your perspective on the floor you could see she was heavyset, she seemed to be incredibly pear shaped, you could see the sides of her ass peeking out over the sides of her chair, as well as her pudgy stomach hanging over her belt slightly. Her face showed some signs of age, you\u2019d guess she was around 45 or so, and her brown, slightly greying hair was cut short and pulled back in a bun. You managed to catch a glimpse of her name tag, which told you her name was Janice, before your sight of her was blocked by the sole of her shoe. The shoe stomped down on you and she twisted her heel on top of you, grinding you into the treads of her shoes. You silently screamed, your head too mangled for you to actually be able to make any noice, as this cruel woman ground you into the sole of her shoe like a used cigarette. Once she was sure you were stuck in the treads of her shoe she lifted her foot, carrying you with it back onto the break pedal, resting it there while she turned to your roommates as the bus doors swung open.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright girls, this is your stop. I\u2019ve got a schedule to keep so if you could be quick,\u201d Janice spoke with an impatience that could probably be interpreted as her simply being frustrated with her job, but you knew she wanted your roommates off the bus before they discovered your location.<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a minute, I just dropped our tiny guy we had with us, give us a minute to find him please!\u201d You heard the panicked voice of Morgan pleading with Janice. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him on the bus.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry girls but I\u2019m already late as it is. Tell you girls what, I\u2019ll give you a minute or two but after that I really need you guys off here. My boss has been giving me grief about running late all the time, you understand don\u2019t you?\u201d Janice would normally have just driven on if a passenger was refusing to get off the bus, but she really didn\u2019t want the three girls on any longer than they had to be, otherwise they could possibly discover you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that time limit in place, the girls hurried in trying to locate you. Morgan knew you had been thrown forward, she just wasn\u2019t sure exactly where you went. Quinn had saw a few of the women further down reaching up for you, but wasn\u2019t exactly sure if one of them had caught you or not. With those two facts in mind, your roommates began to search for you. Morgan went down to the front of the bus to look for you there, Quinn began interrogating the girls who she saw reaching for you, and Avery began looking on the floor and under the seats for you.<br>\r\nSeeing the girls so organised and efficiently searching for you worried Janice, she expected them to panic and not manage to search the whole are you could have been in. Her nerves caused her to absentmindedly grind her heels into the floor, further compacting you between the grooves of her shoes. She silently prayed that they would run out of time before they started to suspect her. Do they discover you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Yes, and they manage to convince Janice to give you up.<br>\r\n2) Yes, but you are either too crushed into the grooves of her shoe for them to recover you, or Janice uses your usage license as defence to keep you.<br>\r\n3) No, and they have to leave the bus and go to the C.T.C building without you, potentially making removing the license much more difficult.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next two minutes you suffered through being ground further into the treads of the bus driver\u2019s shoes, as she tried to better conceal you from your roommate\u2019s frantic searching which was getting closer and closer to your hiding place under her foot. You silently cried out to them, but your mangled body could make no sounds.<br>\r\nQuinn was the first to finish her job of finding out if any of the girls had managed to catch you. Her deadpan face and annoyed scowls were enough to intimidate most of the women into telling the truth and she determined that none of them had caught you, moving on to help Avery look for you on the floor after that.<br>\r\nTheir search also proved fruitless, and after two minutes they both looked to Morgan, who had been searching the front of the bus for you and only had the area around the driver left to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice had been eying the clock like a hawk, praying for time to move faster. She had began to panic as she saw Morgan get closer to her, but a smile crept up from the corners of her mouth as she saw the clock tick over once again, time was up. She quickly hid her grin, before turning to Morgan with a look of faux concern. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry girls, times up. Sorry but I\u2019ve got a schedule to keep,\u201d she was straining to keep her grin from reemerging, but must have done a bad job at it because Morgan looked at her with confusion. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you in such a rush to have us off this bus? Most drivers would have just shrugged and drove on with us still on board, are you hiding something?\u201d Hearing Morgan say this, Quinn and Avery approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, why? How could I have him?\u201d Janice was not a good lier under pressure, and the tone of her voice was starting to give her away.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you wanted him to fly out of Morgan\u2019s hand. Why else would you have hit the breaks?\u201d Quinn\u2019s flat tone of voice did not match the brimming anger in her eyes, she realised now what was going on. \u201cJust hand him over and we won\u2019t have to report you.\u201d<br>\r\nJanice opened her mouth to respond, but thought better of it, she was already on thin ice with her supervisor and didn\u2019t need any more trouble. She lifted her foot up and began prying you loose with her fingernail. There was a brief moment that you feared she wouldn\u2019t actually be able to get you out, but that fear was placated as you felt your body slip out from between the tight treads.<br>\r\nYour body slipped out as a long, thin piece of string, having been tightly compacted into a single tread of her shoe. One of your eyes was still visible so you could look up at your would be kidnapper. Her face had an expression similar to a child who got caught shoplifting, as she glumly handed your stringy form over to Quinn, who wordlessly grabbed you from the bus driver with a cold glare. <br>\r\nYour three giantess friends exited the bus without another word, and it pulled away, leaving you all to look up at the C.T.C office building. As you were now in the shadow of the building, knowing that the woman who had caused you so much hardship was inside and that you would have to see her soon, you shuddered.<br>\r\nQuinn, feeling your shivering body vibrate against her hand, looked down at you reassuringly before looking up at the building again and walking towards it, determined to help you out of this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour anxiety shot through the roof as Quinn walked through the double doors into the stuffy reception hall of the C.T.C office building. There was a long line to talk to the single, very bored looking receptionist. Quinn let out a heavy sigh and joined the back of the line while you saw Morgan and Avery sit down in the seating area, looking bored already. A few moments after joining the line your body popped back into shape, allowing you to look around.<br>\r\nAs you looked at the other people standing in the line you noticed a similar trend between all of them. All of them either had tiny men with them or had some kind of tan clothing on display. You started considering your own situation and wondered how many of the men here had been assigned usage licenses against their will. Even further how many had their licenses assigned by the very woman you were trying to speak to, Isabella. <br>\r\nBaker\u2019s Law, in your opinion, had done more harm than good. The woman who managed to push it through seemed to have noble intentions, but the law she helped create may very well have ruined your life, and possibly the lives of many of the other guys in this room. <br>\r\nDeep in thought you strangely seemed to blame Amy Baker more than Isabella herself, which you realised was stupid and shook yourself out of it. Looking back around the room you saw that the line had moved up a lot while you were thinking and you and Quinn were almost at the front. Realising this, you began to panic slightly, the thought of seeing Isabella again making you incredibly anxious.<br>\r\nSeeing your distress, Quinn looked down at you.<br>\r\n\u201cListen Hunter, I know you\u2019re worried about this, but you need to get your head in the game here. We\u2019ll be here to back you up but in the end it\u2019s you that\u2019s in this situation so you are going to have to put in the work to get out of it,\u201d Quinn\u2019s small speech knocked you out of your doom and gloom attitude.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you\u2019re right Quinn, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\nQuinn gave a small nod before continuing, \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be in there with you to make sure she doesn\u2019t do anything underhanded... you\u2019re a pretty nice guy and I don\u2019t want to see anything bad happen to you if I can help it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou were about to reply to Quinn, but the line suddenly moved forward and Quinn was called forward to the reception desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn approached the desk, where a young woman sat, appearing bored out of her mind. As Quinn began to speak to her you could see her eyes drifting to the clock on the far wall every now and then, clearly counting the minutes till her shift ends.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here with my friend Hunter Woods, he was issued a general usage license against his will and we need to speak to the notary who issued it, Isabella Brooks.\u201d<br>\r\nThe bored receptionist looked up at Quinn, obviously disinterested in this conversation mere moments into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Ok give me a minute, I\u2019ll check if she\u2019s in right now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) \u201c...Yup she\u2019s got an available slot now, you and your friends can go on in.\u201d You all go in to meet with Isabella.<br>\r\n2) \u201c...Ah yes, she\u2019s expecting you, go on in.\u201d Isabella has had time to prepare, how will this affect your chances of removing the license.<br>\r\n3) \u201c...Sorry she\u2019s not in at the moment, you\u2019ll need to come back at another time.\u201d You and your roommates need to leave and come back later, maybe gives time for them to do some research or writer\u2019s choice.</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, after a minute, your pocket was unzipped, and Quinn lifted you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at you, Quinn noted your shaken expression and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re really worried about this, huh?\u201d She asked, a hint of genuine compassion in her voice. \u201cLook, Hunter, I think that License stuff is bullshit and frustrating. I knew a few tinies once who signed up because they were low on cash, and the last I ever saw them, this bratty cheerleader at our high school had them glued to her boobs like pasties for over four months. Of course, according to law, it was all \u2018legal\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled at Quinn\u2019s story, and began quivering in fear. \u201cY-you don\u2019t think\u2026that\u2026\u201d You began, but Quinn cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no, Hunter. You\u2019re under my care while we\u2019re hear at the beach.\u201d Quinn\u2019s expression was blazing with righteous fury. \u201cUntil this License mess is sorted, I\u2019m telling Brigitte that you WILL NOT leave my sight each day. I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour accelerating panic attack slowed down, and you flashed Quinn a grateful smile. To your surprise, she actually returned it, and it was one of the few times you could recall seeing her actually smile so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn began walking, and resumed talking as she did so. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re headed to Brigitte\u2019s office right now. She requested to speak to us, and told me not to change for some reason. Maybe she finally has a replacement for my too-small bikini. Regardless, I\u2019m letting her know that your safety comes first. She\u2019ll be understanding, count on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for doing all of this, Quinn. It means a lot.\u201d You said to her, and though she didn\u2019t respond with more than a curt nod, you could\u2019ve sworn the lightest trace of pink flushed her cheeks for a split second before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you reached Brigitte\u2019s office, you found your new boss seated at her desk, and frowning at her computer. As Quinn walked in, Brigitte glanced up, and her frown only deepened. As she locked eyes with you, the light in her eyes dimmed a bit. You weren\u2019t totally sure, but it seemed as if she was displaying signs of\u2026anxiety? Apprehension? Guilt, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn took a seat in front of Brigitte\u2019s desk, and placed you down on the edge of her boss\u2019s desk. Noting her superior\u2019s apparent unease, Quinn furrowed her brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Brigitte? You wanted to see us? Truth is, I had something to say to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte\u2019s eyes widened, and she breathed out, seemingly releasing a breath she\u2019d been holding for a while. \u201cO-oh? Is that right? Go ahead, shoot. I\u2019ll\u2026uh\u2026explain myself after you speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged. \u201cOkay, sure. Basically, I just wanted to request Hunter as my partner for the next few weeks. I wanted him up in the lifeguard stand with me, or by my side during patrols.\u201d Your black-haired roommate glanced at you, then back to Brigitte. \u201cHe had a\u2026less than enjoyable first day, and would feel safer as close to me as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the phrase \u2018close to me as possible\u2019 caused Brigitte to shift uncomfortably in her chair, and the redhead seemed to be at a loss for words for a moment until finally composing herself. Looking at her computer, then at you, and finally at Quinn, she spoke again. \u201cWell, that shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem\u2026in a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke up. \u201cThat\u2019s great, thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte bit her lip, and waited an uncomfortably long time before speaking again. \u201cSee, thing is\u2026I actually got an email late last night. I checked again to make sure it was real this morning. From what I can see on my end, Hunter has applied for, and been accepted for a General Use License. All the paperwork is here on the screen, and legit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your fears rising, and you stammered out a reply. \u201cW-well, th-that\u2019s not actually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, unintentionally, cut off your explanation with her own. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, Hunter was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte silenced both of you by raising your hand. \u201cLook, guys. I\u2019m sorry, but it doesn\u2019t matter. From your expressions, it seems like maybe this was all a big mishap, but the paperwork is genuine. This License has to be treated as real and applicable to any foreseeable situation. Until it can be officially revoked\u2026which I hear is a huge pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess partner seethed in her chair, angry at the women from yesterday, not Brigitte, who\u2019s hands were tied. \u201cJust because the License is real\u2026for now\u2026doesn\u2019t mean we have to do anything with\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of that\u2026\u201d Brigitte leaned back in her chair, and pulled an envelope out of a drawer. She dropped the envelope onto her desk in front of Quinn, letting the contents spill out. Inside the envelope were about thirty little slips of folded paper. \u201c\u2026I found notes like these in the Sanderson Beach tips and complaints box all this past week. These thirty are from yesterday ALONE.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn, confused, sifted through the pieces of paper, pausing to read a few. After glancing at them, a full, beet red blush ignited in her cheeks, and her eyes widened. You\u2019d never seen Quinn look so taken aback by anything before. She was utterly speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte sighed. \u201cTen of these paper slips are from beach goers complaining about your risqu\u00e9 uniform, Quinn. Mostly families and older people saying that you\u2019re setting a bad example for children. The other twenty slips are, frankly, quite lecherous. Perverts and the like complimenting your\u2026ahem\u2026\u2018crazy hella fine ass\u2019 and \u2018bouncing bubble butt\u2019. It\u2019s pretty gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your amazement, Quinn actually sank into her seat from embarrassment. \u201cI-I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just shaped this way\u2026AND it\u2019s that dumb suit\u2019s fault. It\u2019s too small!\u201d Quinn was a bit frantic now, probably trying too hard to save face. It was almost cute, if you didn\u2019t have a growing sense of dread building inside of you over what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly my point, Quinn.\u201d Brigitte nodded, and she began to slowly move forward, leaning over her desk. Momentarily distracted by your boss\u2019 huge, firm breasts and lean abdomen, you were caught off guard as the towering redhead scooped you up into her palm and held you tightly. The action also snapped Quinn out of her flustered spiral, and she sat up attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Brigitte, what are you\u2026\u201d You tried to say, before being silenced by Brigitte gently but forcibly smushing your head flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the details here, but this seems like the win-win situation to me. Hunter as a General Use License now, making it perfectly legal for him to serve his position here at Sanderson Beach by being molded into replacement bikini bottoms for you. Just as long as it takes until we get a new, proper fitting suit for you, Quinn. Besides, the General Use License, when used in a work setting, ups his hourly pay. Again, win-win!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was floored. \u201cWha\u2026Brigitte! He\u2019s a living being like us. He doesn\u2019t want to be my bikini bottoms!\u201d Quinn paused, and began blushing again. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to have to wear Hunter for\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, his License says what his License says.\u201d Brigitte frowned. \u201cThis might be weird for you at first, but you just need to change your thinking. By law, he\u2019s property now, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyes nearly bulged from her skull, and she sneered at her boss. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously believe that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte shook her head. \u201cNo, I like that little dude, but it\u2019s factual law. Not only do we need to abide by his License, but this will also solve your dress code issue. No more rude comments or worrying complaints from beach goers, and no more discomfort for you. I mean, I\u2019m sure you know how stretchy tinies are. He\u2019ll fit you well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the end of the day\u2026I\u2019m your boss, Quinn. I\u2019m telling you this is going to happen.\u201d The giantess redhead looked sullen for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but all you could do is quit to avoid this. Even still, Hunter would remain employed here, and I\u2019m sure his License would be useful for other purposes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess roommate looked utterly defeated, and she sank back in defeat. Sparing you a heart wrenching look of dismayed acceptance, she nodded at Brigitte\u2019s proposal. A huge smile came back to the normally energetic redhead\u2019s beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Awesome!\u201d Brigitte smiled. \u201cThis\u2019ll be over before you know it, Quinn. As soon as we get a replacement suit for you, Hunter is off the hook. And, as soon as his License is revoked, if that\u2019s what the little dude wants, he\u2019s free to go back to normal work.\u201d Brigitte began flattening you by clenching her palm. \u201cBesides, you two get what you wanted, right? He\u2019ll be \u2018as close to you as possible\u2019, remember? It\u2019s perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrunched up in Brigitte\u2019s hand, you felt your spirits fall to despairing lows. This day had truly become the nightmare those two evil women from yesterday had promised it would be. Your License in full effect, you were nothing but property by law now. Brigitte\u2019s last statement, innocent as it had been, stung particularly harsh. You had wanted to partner with Quinn to avoid THIS exact scenario, but fate had screwed you over in the end.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brigitte continued to look at Quinn pleasantly, all while mangling your body between her powerful hands. More than muscular enough to easily dominate you, Brigitte reduced you into a paper-thin flat disc in seconds, and was now smearing you into a larger and larger circular shape with an annoying level of casual carelessness. Though she said that she genuinely liked you as an employee (and you believed her deep down) Brigitte was taking to using your License quite quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to have to delay you for a few more minutes, Quinn.\u201d Brigitte explained. Quinn, who could barely stop from wincing at your treatment, slowly pried her gaze away from you and towards her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026what do you mean?\u201d She asked, fighting hard to slip back into her normal apathetic attitude. She hated what was happening to you, but couldn\u2019t think of any way to change it. Brigitte\u2019s points made perfect sense, and the law was the law, as much as Quinn despised it. Your black-haired roommate was also a bit afraid (though she\u2019d never admit it) of disappointing her boss by maintaining a combative or sulky demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte rummaged around on her desk and retrieved her phone, then began typing the number pad before replying to Quinn. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m shit at anything related to design. If I tried to make Hunter into your replacement bikini bottoms myself, it\u2019d be a mess.\u201d Brigitte laughed heartily. \u201cThankfully, Natasha is much more skilled than I am, so let me call her real quick and she\u2019ll drive over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded. \u201cAh, okay.\u201d It took her a second, but Quinn recalled Brigitte mentioning before that she lived with her girlfriend, Natasha, in a spacious apartment not far from the beach. Natasha was, if Quinn was remembering correctly, a part-time fashion designer. After a moment of ringing, Natasha picked up, though Quinn could only hear Brigitte\u2019s side of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte lit up excitedly, presumably from hearing her girlfriend\u2019s voice. \u201cAh, Natasha! Still at home?\u201d A pause. \u201cUh huh, I need your help in the office. Little bit of styling and designing. Got a Usage License tiny for ya to mold into bikini bottoms!\u201d Another pause. \u201cYes, babe, I know, you feel kinda weird about it, but you\u2019re so damn good, baby.\u201d One more pause. \u201cYes, paperwork\u2019s all taken care off. It\u2019ll be easy, and I\u2019ll buy dinner tonight to make it up to you. Love ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte hung up, then laid your pancaked body down on her desk. She then casually dropped a heavy notebook atop you, pressing you down hard onto her desk and ensuring you were unable to reform in the time that passed before Natasha arrived. The redhead giantess then leaned back in her chair and drummed her fingers on her desk. Quinn fought to keep her face neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve got a few ideas for reorganizing volleyball competitions after the west nets broke\u2026\u201d Brigitte began, engaging your roommate in conversation. Able to slip into more normal work patterns, Quinn tried her best to ignore you and conversed rather pleasantly with Brigitte for the next fifteen minutes, passing the time amicably while you fought uselessly to wiggle out from under Brigitte\u2019s notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Natasha arrived, and she swept into the room with a grin on her face, a skip in her step, and about a million art and design supply bags under her arms. Dropping the bags in an empty chair, Natasha giggled as she was swept up into Brigitte\u2019s arms and kissed passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was momentarily taken aback by Natasha. She vaguely noted that Natasha was African American, with curly brown hair that framed her face, and that she was exceptionally pretty. What threw her off was that Natasha was no more than 5\u20192\u201d. Her short height was almost comedic in comparison to Brigitte\u2019s towering form, and as it was, the muscular redhead easily lifted her girlfriend and spun her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting Natasha back down, Brigitte composed herself and then removed the notebook from atop your body. Gesturing to you, Brigitte retook her seat. Sobering up, Natasha approached the desk and gently scooped you up into her hands. Her delicate, artist\u2019s hands rubbed and massaged your body, poking and prodding at you. Natasha bit her lip gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he\u2019ll definitely work just fine. Soft and stretchy enough to fit even Quinn.\u201d Natasha explained, causing Quinn to briefly blush at the offhand reference to her curvaceousness. Natasha didn\u2019t seem to notice, though, and in fact went straight to using her sharp fingernails to tear your clothes off, leaving you totally nude in her hands. \u201cHe\u2019ll need to be naked for the dye to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn furrowed her brow. \u201cDye? What\u2019s that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha pulled a few bottles from her bag, as well as a medium-sized bowl. \u201cFabric dye is needed to dye\u2026uh\u2026this tiny dude\u2026the same red color as all of our lifeguard uniforms.\u201d Natasha glanced at her girlfriend. \u201cThough it should be noted that the dye can permanently affect the tiny\u2019s skin tone. Only the solvent liquid will restore his skin tone to normal. You DO have some in stock, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte nodded vaguely. \u201cUh, definitely. I saw a few bottles in the storage room\u2026last month or something.\u201d She trailed off, and neither Quinn nor Natasha heard her last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough for me.\u201d Natasha smiled, before dumping a red bottle of fabric dye into her bowl. She mixed in a few other liquids, and then finally submerged your body into the bowl. You mentally screamed out as the cool liquid soaked and sloshed all around you, covering you entirely. Crumpled up as you were, you couldn\u2019t do a thing to fight Natasha, and soon you were fully drowned in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses left you to stew in the bowl for ten minutes, Quinn sparing you a glance every so often, but finally Natasha retrieved you. When she did so, you caught a brief glimpse of yourself in the reflection of a mirror on the wall, and found to your utter horror that your body was entirely dyed bright red. Every inch of your skin tone had been changed to a bright red color, with not a trace of your normal tan shade remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, perfect!\u201d Natasha grinned. She hastily plugged in a small blow-dryer into the wall and dried off the remnants of the dye from your body. She then laid you out onto Brigitte\u2019s desk and grabbed some white fabric paint and a brush from her bag. She\u2019d laid you onto the desk face first, so you couldn\u2019t tell what was coming next, but you instinctively winced as you felt the dripping brush dabble white paint onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn leaned forward to watch, morbidly curious. \u201cWhat are you doing, Natasha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha winked at Quinn. \u201cEver wonder who designed that cute little logo that Sanderson Beach uses? It was yours truly!\u201d She beamed brightly. \u201cI\u2019m just sketching it onto these bikini bottoms real quick. The white color will pop out, and the fabric paint will fuse to the bottoms, preventing it from scratching or fading. It\u2019ll also be waterproof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn frowned at hearing the phrase \u2018fuse to\u2019, and your own heart plummeted with despair. Still, both you and she were powerless in this situation, and could only let Natasha do her work. Brigitte looked on proudly as Natasha painted the Sanderson Beach logo onto your back: a cute picture of a sandy beach, volleyball net, and bright sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished drawing, Natasha gently blew on you to dry the paint, along with another go with the blow-dryer. She then turned to Quinn, retrieved a tape measure from her bag, and noted the measurements of Quinn\u2019s prodigious posterior, hips, and thighs for good measure. With all her notes in place, it was time for the final excruciating step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up, Natasha tentatively pulled at your malleable body, a huge smile spreading on her face. \u201cOh, this material is just the BEST for clothing!\u201d She gushed, apparently already forgetting you were a living person at this point, too caught up in the excitement of her craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next fifteen minutes, Natasha worked at a feverish pace, not letting up for an instant. She pushed, pulled, stretched, squished, and molded your tiny body into the world\u2019s most perfect bikini bottoms. Your arms and legs served as the loops for Quinn\u2019s legs to go through, your face made up the inside back of the bottoms, and your lower half the inside front. Natasha sealed the deal with a thin but extra-durable layer of waterproof superglue to seal your limbs in place, completing the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, Natasha sat back and handed you to Brigitte. Brigitte eyed you excitedly, immensely proud at the work of her girlfriend. Satisfied beyond any doubt, Brigitte tossed you to Quinn, who caught you gently. Your black-haired partner spared you a sympathetic look, but you barely noticed. The fabric dye and mushing and mashing from Natasha had really mangled your face, causing your vision to be blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte cleared her throat. \u201cSo, normally, you\u2019d wear the standard one-piece uniform. However, until we get your replacement, use those bottoms every day, and just wear a Sanderson Beach lifeguard t-shirt over whatever top you want. Sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded numbly. \u201cUm\u2026sounds great, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome! Then go get changed and head out, we\u2019re behind schedule! Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t dock you pay for this.\u201d Brigitte laughed, then turned to flirting with Natasha. Apparently, the conversation was over. Knowing she was dismissed, Quinn left the office and headed towards the changing room, you in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Quinn were not at all looking forward to this day\u2026or the foreseeable future.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quinn was at least partially relieved to find the employee changing room empty, as it meant she didn\u2019t have to experience her horrible discomfort at what was about to take place with any prying eyes around. Still, as she found an empty bench and began stripping out of her casual clothes, she was incapable of looking away from her new bikini bottoms\u2026and the poor tiny roommate that used to be just an hour ago. No trace of the funny, if slightly pervy, guy Quinn had come to tolerate was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your blurry vision from the dye and the mashing, you were just barely able to glimpse Quinn from the angle she\u2019d dropped you onto the bench. You could see the fuzzy image of her body as she stripped naked, and then her hand grow closer and closer as she reached for you. Your blood ran cold from fear, while simultaneously your hormones began churning at double time. It was a frustrating situation that was a mix of terror and arousal. Your basic human rights had been ignored in every capacity thanks to that damn General Usage License\u2026but Quinn was also the sexiest girl you\u2019d ever seen in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny lingering attraction faltered as Quinn stepped into the two holes that Natasha had formed by looping your arms and legs. There was no turning back now, save for a quick pause from Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry about this Hunter.\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I possibly can to fix this as quick as possible. No tiny deserves this.\u201d Your black-haired roommate sighed again. \u201cThat said\u2026this is that last I can talk to you until at least this evening when our shift ends. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your fate was one hundred percent sealed, as Quinn\u2019s hands were totally tied. Pulling you up the rest of the way up her legs, Quinn had no choice but to treat you like the bikini bottoms that you currently were. From now until this whole mess was solved, you were a swimsuit, not a normal tiny guy living his life. Your Usage License required you to serve out your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired giantess, predictably, had a little bit of trouble squeezing you past her thick thighs, and especially up and around her utterly massive ass. She finally managed, using your body\u2019s stretchy properties to their absolute limit. Your bikini shaped body was pulled out tight across Quinn\u2019s ass, but you did your duty shockingly well. After Quinn finished fitting you in place, she couldn\u2019t resist glancing at her appearance in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered the expanse of her pale, thick derriere effectively, modestly concealing most of her bubble butt (and a million times more modest than her previous bottoms). You hugged her hips snuggly, but still allowed her to move freely. Her crotch was similarly protected, while also comfortably cradled. In fact, that was what shocked Quinn the most. You were unbelievably smooth and comfortable, distractingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026this is a comfy\u2013\u201d Quinn began, before abruptly cutting herself off. She\u2019d already started rubbing her hand along her butt, tracing her fingers against your back. Caught up in how soft, smooth, and supportive you were, for the faintest of moments the true identity of her new bikini bottoms had slipped her mind. No longer, and Quinn visibly recoiled at the fact that she\u2019d just thought about how nice you felt wrapped around her. The very idea was wrong to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Quinn dug out a fitting and mostly supportive bikini top from her bag, and then threw on a simple Sanderson Beach employee t-shirt over top. Sliding her feet back into her flip-flops, she adjusted her hair, slipped on some sunglasses, and strolled out of the changing room, desperately trying to think of anything but how nice you felt hugging her hips as she walked, and not like her old suit wedging itself into her butt crack every five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed the sandy dunes and reached the middle lifeguard tower, where Brigitte had her stationed today. Scaling the ladder, Quinn took a moment to survey her surroundings, and then she leaned forward against the railing, pressing her hands into the polished wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part, you were just as weirded out by Quinn. You\u2019d been worn as clothing several times in the past, but never anything as thorough as this. Gripped so tightly around Quinn\u2019s silky-smooth skin, it almost felt a little comfortable, her own body heat washing over you. It wasn\u2019t some sort of secret heaven, as your body was still stretched painfully tight to fit Quinn\u2019s meaty thighs and huge ass, but it was almost bearable\u2026save for the humiliatingly close proximity to her womanhood, and the faintest trace of stench from deep inside her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were now, your face was firmly squeezed into Quinn\u2019s plump buttocks, but because you more-or-less fit her like a glove, you weren\u2019t riding up into her ass crack like a wedgie. Your body was merely pressed into her doughy cheeks, like a too-tight hug that you couldn\u2019t escape from. Her slightest movements jiggled her flesh across your face, but it wasn\u2019t unbelievably awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little over an hour, however, Quinn couldn\u2019t last any longer. She\u2019d been purposefully avoiding sitting, but her legs were screaming for relief. Grimacing at what she was about to do, Quinn slowly walked over to her lifeguard chair, took a deep breath, and then turned around and sat down, settling into the constrictive chair a size too small for someone of Quinn\u2019s proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she sat, any illusion of this being a not-so-bad circumstance shattered. Quinn\u2019s sizable derriere took up the entire space of the chair, squeezing into its tight confines. Your body was demolished beneath her ass, with nearly all of Quinn\u2019s weight bearing down on you. Her hot flesh pressed into your swimsuit-shaped body, spilling out around you and utterly enveloping you. Your face was mashed flat by her cheeks, and both the slight stench and trickle of sweat doubled down into an oppressive scent and downpour of sticky sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Quinn had no way of possibly comprehending how terrible this was for you, and could only hope that she was making it as bearable as possible. Subconsciously, she wiggled a bit in her seat to get comfortable, acting totally on habit. It took her a second to realize and then chastise herself for the action, but the damage to you was done. She had smeared even more of her hot flesh across your body, and dumped another load of sweat onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thirty minutes passed uneventfully, and Quinn vaguely wondered why her usually annoying lifeguard chair wasn\u2019t so bad today. The truth was due to your body taking the brunt of most of the searing heat from the plastic instead of Quinn herself, singing your naked backside. You yourself were also still comfy to Quinn, and were acting like an extra layer of soft protection while she sat, like a thin cushion wrapped around her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching her arms, Quinn nonchalantly crossed her legs, her body tired of sitting in the same position for so long. Still conflicting with her years of habits, this time Quinn didn\u2019t think twice about the action. She merely took a sip from her water bottle, unaware to the fact that crossing her legs pushed her thighs into the front of her bottoms, thus shoving your crotch into direct contact with her own womanhood, doubling your embarrassment and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Quinn caught sight of a girl struggling to properly do the butterfly stroke amidst the waves. Not in danger of drowning, but an excuse to get up and move. Taking her chance, Quinn leapt to her feet, jostling her hefty posterior, but before she moved, Quinn was briefly confused by how sweat-free her ass felt. It was normally a factory of swampiness in the intense heat of the sun. Shrugging, Quinn climbed down the ladder, oblivious to the truth that it was your own body that was absorbing all of her sweat, like a sponge. You were involuntarily taking it into yourself and off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWading into the water, the coolness of the liquid hitting you was a splash of relief, but even that quick blessing faded soon. As Quinn submerged up to her stomach, you were entirely under the salty water, stuck there at Quinn\u2019s mercy. All around you was churning and bubbling noises, and freaky reverberations of laughter and chatter. The water flowed all through you and around you, the saltiness stinging your eyes that you couldn\u2019t close due to being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn helped the girl for a solid fifteen minutes, and when she left the water, you were totally wet, and clung to Quinn tighter than before, like a second skin. You gripped her in a clenching hold, and you could so clearly feel every inch of her most sensitive areas touching your naked, swimsuit shaped body. Her cheeks jiggled as she walked back to the lifeguard tower and scaled the ladder, rubbing up and down against you so much it started to chafe your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she reached the top of the tower, Quinn was floored to find herself nearly totally dry, from the waist down, despite having just left the ocean. Once more, your body had acted like a sponge, soaking up all the water droplets from Quinn\u2019s flesh into your own pores, just like a good little swimsuit. Quinn grimaced as she spared a sympathetic glimpse at you before sitting, but even she couldn\u2019t fight that feeling of how great you were as a pair of bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the day went, before finally coming to a close hours later. You suffered, and through your own suffering, you eased Quinn\u2019s. By the time your shift ended, and Quinn strolled off to the changing room, you just wanted it all to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a pair of bottoms sucked.</span></div></div>",

They tossed their wet uniforms in a pile, said their goodbyes to Quinn and each other, and strolled out of the changing room. Finally alone, Quinn hastily pulled you away from her ass and wiggled you down her long legs, stepping out of your makeshift loops and freeing you for the first time in hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough far too mashed, flattened, and compressed to actually gulp in the fresh air, you still mentally sighed with relief as the cool AC of the changing room hit your face. Your vision was still a blurry mess, but you could just barely make out the disfigured image of Quinn staring down at you, something like worry and pity written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Hunter. This is a mess.\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cI promise we\u2019ll end this as soon as possible. Morgan and Avery will help too.\u201d The black-haired giantess rubbed your face softly. \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, you really did help my day go better, being so comfy and absorbent.\u201d As soon as the words left her mouth, Quinn blushed and backtracked. \u201cUh\u2026never mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door swung open, and Brigitte sauntered in, smiling broadly at Quinn. \u201cAh! There you are. Thought maybe you\u2019d left with the other girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head, setting you down on the bench in front of her so she could begin pulling up her panties and shorts to wear home. \u201cI was about to. Same shift tomorrow, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte nodded. \u201cYeah, same shift. Maybe the left tower though? I\u2019ll have to look at coverages. Honestly, we could really use one more lifeguard on staff\u2026\u201d Your red-haired boss trailed off, and then glanced at you. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll take those.\u201d She stated simply, grabbing you casually off the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn paled, and her eyes widened. \u201cW-wait, Brigitte! That\u2019s Hunter, not just bikini bottoms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular giantess folded her arms across her chest, inadvertently squeezing you into her firm breasts. \u201cYes, I suppose. Although technically, he\u2019s a Sanderson Beach uniform right now, not a tiny. His usage license dictates those rules.\u201d<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s face grew devoid of emotion. \u201c\u2026what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Brigitte looked a little sheepish. \u201cWhat I mean is, he legally isn\u2019t Hunter right now. He\u2019s Sanderson Beach property, and as such\u2026\u201d Brigitte trailed off and groaned. \u201cGod, I feel like the bad guy in all of this, but it\u2019s the law! He\u2019s property, and so he can\u2019t leave the beach. He stays here, Quinn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a human being!\u201d Quinn cried, indignant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot according to his license!\u201d Brigitte retorted. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow our staff to take their uniforms home, and Hunter is no exception in his current form. I\u2019m sorry, Quinn, but that\u2019s the way it is. Until your replacement uniform comes in, or his license is revoked, the law is the law.\u201d With a sense of finality, Brigitte tossed you over her shoulder, causing you to fall onto the top of the pile of wet uniforms from the other lifeguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn seethed, but finally took a deep breath, her expression flipping straight to the opposite. Sullenly, Quinn nodded, finished getting changed, and shuffled out of the changing room, but not before Brigitte patted her on the shoulder in a sympathetic motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the locker room, Brigitte rubbed her temples. \u201cDamn\u2026you forgot how emotional that girl can be when she isn\u2019t acting all apathetic. I feel bad for her. Wish she\u2019d just get over this soon.\u201d Shrugging, Brigitte scooped you and the other uniforms up into her arms. \u201cAnyway, time for a good washing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling back into her typically energetic, confident attitude, Brigitte crossed the changing room towards a washing machine in the back, popped open the lid, and tossed you and the other swimsuits inside. You began to panic at this unexpected turn of events, but there wasn\u2019t a thing you could do as Brigitte slammed the lid shut and started the wash cycle after pouring in some detergent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny small hope you held that the fabric dye and paints Natasha used would break apart in the washing machine were shattered within minutes. Your bonds held strong, and after an hour of spinning around and bashing into sopping wet clothes, the wash cycle ended. You were still a perfectly shaped pair of bikini bottoms, looking to all the world like a normal Sanderson Beach employee uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Brigitte didn\u2019t even spare you any special attention as she pulled you out, instead just bunching up all the clothes, carrying them right outside the changing room door, and hanging them up on a clothesline to catch the sun. She dug two sharp metal pinching pins into your eyes as she clipped you to the line, causing you to mentally scream out, but obviously make no sound. Brigitte just kept smiling until the whole line was filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, your employer left, heading home for the night, and you were alone with nothing to do but sway in the breeze and try to ignore the sharp crushing pains from the clothespins. Once more you tried and failed to reform, the binding holding you in your bikini bottom shape. You vaguely recalled Natasha\u2019s words about how permanent her changes to you could be without special sealant, and as you eventually drifted off to sleep, you prayed to anyone who would listen that fate wouldn\u2019t keep you this way permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awoken hours later by the feeling of the clothesline shaking up and down. Though your vision was still blurry, you could make out the other lifeguards as they giggled and gossiped while unpinning their suits all around you. Your blood ran cold, your mind spinning horrible nightmares in which a distracted giantess grabbed you instead of her proper suit, thus separating you from Quinn, your only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, when a hand finally did grab your face, it was Quinn herself. You could just barely make out her grimacing face, and the sight of her lips mouthing the words \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, before you were dropped to the ground and dragged up her legs. You physically and mentally braced yourself as best as you could in the last few seconds you had, and then Quinn hefted you up over her massive cheeks and snapped you into place around her shapely derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was hardly eventful. You continued to experience endless crushing, smushing, and sweat baths as they day prior, and Quinn continued to feel quite comfortable physically, but internally she knew how awful this was for her. Quinn was also frustrated all day, as she\u2019d spent the past night working around the clock to undue your license, only to find that the cruel woman Isabella had thrown every possible legal barricade into Quinn\u2019s path to stall her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the entire rest of the week went by uneventfully. Every day, Quinn would begrudgingly use and abuse you, forcing your services as a tiny-turned-bikini, and you would suffer as a result. Each night, Quinn would tear her hair out trying to remove the license only to make minimal progress. Her mind was becoming so consumed with the legal jargon battle with Isabella that she started to think of you less and less during the day, and therefore treat you less carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own nights also followed a predictable pattern of being washed in the machine with the other suits each evening, and left to hang on the line overnight. Brigitte had long stopped referring to you as a person, and obviously none of the other employee\u2019s knew your true identity. That sort of treatment from everyone around you was soul-crushing, and you started to fall into a bit of a depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one morning, there was a shift in the norm. Brigitte herself grabbed you from the clothesline and carried you limply back to her office. You had no idea what was going on, but as your employer set you down on her desk, you caught a glimpse of a mail package beside you with a label that read \u2018replacement lifeguard suit\u2019. With a release of unbridled joy, you realized that Quinn\u2019s replacement was in, and your time as a bikini was over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly picking up on your silent excitement, Brigitte leaned back in her chair and looked down at you. \u201cGuess your time\u2019s up, Hunter.\u201d Before she could say anything else, the door to her office swung open, and a girl ran in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked harried and out of breath, and in her early-to-mid-twenties. She was average height, and had bright, curly blonde hair and sky-blue eyes. Immediately noticeable to Brigitte though, were the girls abundant curves. Fairly stacked in the chest department, the girl was incredibly developed in her lower half, with a monstrous ass that rivalled Quinn, and equally thick thighs and wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026n-not late\u2026am I?\u201d The girl panted, out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte\u2019s eyes glinted with recognition. \u201cAh. You must be Angeline. Ready for your first day?\u201d Your boss looked over some papers in front of her. \u201cImpressive resume, I must say. Can\u2019t tell you how great it is to have another lifeguard on staff for our busiest days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngeline grinned adorably. \u201cThanks ma\u2019am! When do I get my uniform suit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Brigitte began, but then trailed off. After a moment, she swore under her breath. Impossibly, she was back to square one. Angeline\u2019s curvy figure would, in no way, fit into a normal uniform. The only employee swimsuit that would work would either be the replacement she had literally JUST gotten for Quinn, or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte glanced down at you, and then back at Angeline. She bit her lip in contemplation, and you looked helplessly back up at her, having no idea what was going on but getting a horrible sinking feeling in your chest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awoke to the sight of Avery\u2019s enormous face staring down at you. She had a look of genuine concern on her face which was replaced with her usual exuberance once she saw you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh you\u2019re awake!\u201d She squealed, the volume of her voice in your ear just as you woke up caused you to wince. \u201cYou were out for a whole half hour. I was starting to think you weren\u2019t going to wake up, cutie.\u201d She feigned concern in her usual flirty manner, pouting her lip seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat up on the couch with Avery sitting beside you, you noticed that Morgan and Quinn were both missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery saw you looking around for them and spoke up, \u201cThey both had to go to work, Morgan was almost ready to call in sick but I convinced her to go, told her that I\u2019d be here for another hour before I had to go to work anyway, so we\u2019ve got half an hour together before I need to go to work. I figured after seeing the usage license you\u2019d want some time alone to think, Quinn said she\u2019d tell your manager you were sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usage license! It had totally slipped your mind for a brief blissful moment. Those two girls, Rachel and Isabella, had basically have any girl the opportunity to ruin your life. Luckily your roommates seemed to not be the types to abuse you at this vulnerable time, but there were plenty of women out there who would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your concern at being reminded of this, Avery tried to reassure you, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Hunter, the three of us won\u2019t let anyone find out about this. We won\u2019t let any mean women use you,\u201d you already knew that your roommates would help you through this, but hearing Avery say it reassured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t mind me using you, cutie. I could use a new thong,\u201d Avery\u2019s voice lowered to a seductive whisper, but when she saw your horrified expression at what she said she explained, \u201cnonono I don\u2019t mean permanently! I need a new one for a shoot at work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stammering was cut short by a knock at the door. Both of you looked towards the door as paranoia began to set over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone has to have found out about the usage license and came to use me!\u201d panicked thoughts filled your mind as Avery picked you up and walked towards the door. These thoughts were completely irrational of course, how could anyone have already found out about the usage license? You only got it half an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the frosted glass of the door you could see the outline of a woman, her only features you could make out through the glass was her red hair. Avery opened the door to reveal the familiar beaming face of your Aunt Norah. She was confused seeing a strange woman answer the door but her eyes quickly drifted to Avery\u2019s hand, her eyes lightly up seeing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Hunter! I was in the area and thought I\u2019d stop by to see your new place, this must be one of your roommates?\u201d She looks back up towards Avery. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Hunter\u2019s Aunt, Norah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they introduced themselves to each other, you noticed that Norah had her hair tied back in a ponytail and was wearing a tank top and compression shorts that hugged her curves tightly along with a pair of running shoes. She was also sweating a lot so you guessed that she probably ran here. Her clothes left her midsection exposed, and as you stared at her lean stomach you were reminded of that Christmas you spend inside it sloshing around with all the food and drink she had that day, not an experience you ever wanted to repeat if you could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were reminiscing about the various torments you suffered at the hands, or rather the assets, of your aunt, Avery and Norah finished their introductions and moved back to the living room. The sudden movement jerked your attention back to your current situation as the sudden movement almost threw you from Avery\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women sat down on the couch and Avery placed you down on the coffee table before they went back to their conversation. As Avery described herself and both Morgan and Quinn. Five minutes of this conversation passed and you realised that they hadn\u2019t acknowledged you since Avery placed you on the table. You knew your Aunt was forgetful but you were beginning to realise just how forgetful Avery was as well. This was a bad combination of people to be alone with at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the table edge to try and get their attention when you heard Norah say, \u201cAvery, do you mind if I take my shoes off? I ran here and my feet are killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery said she didn\u2019t mind and without breaking eye contact, Norah slipped her running shoes off with her feet and propped her feet up on the table, right where you were standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her feet rapidly descending towards you and it reminded you of every other time you had gotten trapped under Norah\u2019s feet when she wasn\u2019t looking. This time was different however, you managed to jump out of the way of her socked feet, drenched in sweat, just before they buried you under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leapt out of the way you let out a small yelp that must have grabbed their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry Hunter, didn\u2019t see you there. You should be more careful next time, don\u2019t want to get buried under my big smelly feet,\u201d she said as she wiggles her toes teasingly. Norah lecturing you on being careful was a bit ironic since she usually squashes you from her carelessness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continues for another 20 minutes, with you actually being included in the conversation this time. As it continued you began to wonder why exactly your Aunt Norah was here, your apartment was almost on the other side of town from where she lived, and she ran here. Was this a new jogging route she was trying out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG I\u2019m going to be late!\u201d Avery shrieked after glancing at the clock. \u201cI gotta go guys! Norah, I\u2019m sure you can let yourself out. Hunter, I hope you enjoy your time alone, don\u2019t worry too much about the general usage license, we\u2019ll figure it out tomorrow. Bye, cutie,\u201d she said with a wink and rushed out the door, slamming it closed behind her in her rush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a glint if recognition in Norah\u2019s eyes at the mention of the usage license that worried you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, that reminds me Hunter. I got a letter telling me about that general usage license you applied for, I think the whole family gets one,\u201d your heart sank hearing this. Now your whole family will think you are fine to be used by them whenever they want, what else would they think when in their mind you applied for the usage license?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, since you got that you\u2019d be perfect for this huge favour I need. I know how helpful you\u2019ve been for me in the past and I guess that you got the usage license so you could be even more helpful? I know how much of a sweetie you are so I wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d she looked down at you with that pleading expression you could never refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour got a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, whenever Norah asked you for a favour it usually didn\u2019t end well for you. If it was a job she was going to ask you to fill in it would be unpleasant, especially considering you have a general usage license, so doing work for strangers had a high chance of them deciding to just turn you into clothing and keeping you. Which was something you wanted to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Norah, you know I\u2019d like to help you out if I can, but...\u201d you started to refuse to help her before she interrupted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, thank you so much! You\u2019re such a sweetheart. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re happy to help because I really didn\u2019t know what I was going to do about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ...My thong, it snapped during my run and I need a replacement. In fact a lot of my underwear has been breaking lately, so I\u2019d need you to act as my underwear till I can get a replacement.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) ... This job listing for a tiny with a general usage license. Good thing you applied for one huh? It\u2019s strange though, this particular one has requested like 3 little guys in the last few weeks, guess they keep getting busier?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) ... this letter I got from the C.T.C, it was from the person who notarised it. Said she needed your signature or something and to bring you to her office. I\u2019ve been needing some paperwork done myself so I thought this would be a good way to get ahead of the long wait times.\u201d</span></div></div>",

In fact a lot of my underwear has been breaking lately, so I\u2019d need you to act as my underwear till I can get a replacement,\u201d you opened your mouth to tell her that you didn\u2019t really want to act as her thong, but she continued talking before you could get a word in. <br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because my underwear is so tight usually, I find it comfier that way, but...\u201d she shifted uncomfortably, embarrassed, obviously that wasn\u2019t the only reason, before whispering. \u201c<i>I also have put on a bit of weight</i>.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2019d have thought it was kind of funny that your aunt, who was probably one of the biggest exercise freaks you know, was so worried about putting on a little weight if she wasn\u2019t also talking about using you to replace her broken underwear. She genuinely looked embarrassed about it and it made you feel kind of sorry for her, but that brief moment of pity cost you a chance to clear things up with her.<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem is it all seems to be going to my hips, and I just can\u2019t seem to get rid of it. All of my underwear is way too small for me now so it just snaps when I go on a run. I can\u2019t get as far as I\u2019d like with them snapping constantly, so I can\u2019t lose the weight. So when I got the letter saying that you had got a general usage license I thought it was perfect timing. I get super stretchy underwear that\u2019ll fit me no matter how many pounds I pack on until I get rid of it all, and you get to use that usage license you applied for! Win-win am I right. You\u2019ve always been such a helpful little guy I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s taken you this long to decide to get a usage license,\u201d as Norah finished her speech with a warm, proud smile you were left flabbergasted at her air-headedness, if her underwear didn\u2019t fit her anymore why couldn\u2019t she just but new underwear that would! Where was the need to put you through the torture of filling out that role when there was such a simple solution! Could she not see that buying new underwear was a possibility? Also was this really how she saw all the times you accidentally ended up as her sweat rag or insole, as you being helpful? Her ditzy brain must have misremembered most of those times because most of the time it was because of a mean spirited prank from your sister. Knowing how stubborn your aunt could be it will likely be incredibly difficult to convince her otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Norah, you know I\u2019d help you in any way I can, but,\u201d you began to try and explain the situation, trying to stop this before it escalated<br>\r\n\u201cI know you would, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re the best nephew I could ask for! Anyway Hunter, I need to get back to my run, so I\u2019ll just mould your into my thong now so you can get started helping me lose weight,\u201d with that she slapped her palm down onto the table, flattening you before you could even get a full sentence out. <br>\r\nAs Norah began to stretch your limbs out you wondered to yourself how you even managed to get into these situations most of the time. If you had just minded your own business with those two girls on the beach or had been able to tell Norah that you didn\u2019t want to be her thong none of this would be happening right now. You didn\u2019t even see the point in struggling against Norah stretching your limbs out and tying them together to form straps for your new thong form because she\u2019d probably interpret it in some way that would make your situation worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your time contemplating how awful your luck seemed to be regarding these situations Norah had quickly turned you into a serviceable thong. Your arms and legs were tied to each other to forms the straps, while your body made up the front and back of the thong. You realised with a frustrated sigh that Norah had formed you in a way that your face was facing inwards on the back of the thong, so it would be crammed between her ass cheeks, probably without even realising she had done it.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Hunter, once we get you home I\u2019ll have some stuff that\u2019ll make you hold this shape a bit better. Ohhh maybe I can even paint you! Make you look good as a thong as well as functional!\u201d You began to panic even more, with Norah\u2019s forgetfulness if she did this she\u2019d be liable to forget that her new thong was actually you! <br>\r\nNorah carried you to the bathroom before setting you down on the counter. As Norah turned around to begin untying her shoes you tried your best to reform and break the bonds holding your limbs together, but you realised pretty quickly that it would take more time than you had. Giving up on that and instead deciding to focus your efforts on reforming your face so you could contact Norah and tell her to stop this, after spending the rest of her run being ground between her butt cheeks you weren\u2019t sure that you\u2019d be able to reform your face very easily so this may be your only chance. You looked over to Norah to see that she had gotten her shoes off, you\u2019d have to hurry. <br>\r\nAs you struggled to reform your face you were given pause when you saw Norah struggle to pull down her compression shorts past her hips. With one final tug she managed to get them down and took them off. You could see what she was talking about when she said she had gained weight. Her usually toned buns had taken on a much softer, jigglier quality, and they were much larger than you remembered them. It had been a while since you had last seen Norah but the amount of mass added on to her rear since then was a lot, it wasn\u2019t as large as Quinn or even your mother but for Norah it was large. You thought that it could maybe just be her age catching up with her a bit. If time wasn\u2019t of the essence and you had use of your mouth you\u2019d have told her that she looked fine, but that wasn\u2019t the priority now, you had to reform your face and stop this. Then you saw the straps of her previous thong pathetically fall away from her sides, snapped in half, but her buttocks held the piece between them in place, preventing it from falling to the floor.<br>\r\nYou had made quite a bit of effort, both your eyes and nose had reformed, and your mouth was getting close, when Norah looked over her shoulder at you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou see the problem Hunter? How did this happen?\u201d She grabbed a handful of her cheek, the slight parting of her buns allowing the thong to slip out from between them. \u201cHopefully now I\u2019ll have underwear that will last long enough. Let\u2019s try you on then.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she lifted you off the counter you redoubled your efforts, desperate to reform your mouth to end this. As she started to pull you up her legs towards her monolithic backside your arms got stuck around the base of her ass. Just as that happened you managed to reform your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cNorah wait...,\u201d you were cut off as, with one final tug, Norah rocketed your face up between her cheeks. Your face was immersed in the swampy atmosphere of Norah\u2019s ass, still incredibly sweaty from her run. There was a sudden, crushing pressure on you as Norah clenched her cheeks to get a good feel of how you fit, crushing your face again and undoing your reforming with a simple movement. You could feel your arms and legs straining as they wrapped around her generous hips, but unfortunately for you, they held.<br>\r\n\u201cWow Hunter you feel great! Snug but you don\u2019t feel ready to snap like my previous thong,\u201d as she said this she looked at the poor piece of fabric that had been hugging her hips previously and grimaced. \u201cClearly you\u2019re made of tougher stuff, I think you\u2019re going to be perfect for helping me lose weight. Thank you again for helping me with this, you really are the best nephew I could ever ask for!\u201d<br>\r\nYou only heard part of this from your position between her and the layers of butt meat around you. You could only scream internally as she began to walk out of the apartment, her grinding cheeks mashing you and smearing what visible features you had left, if this kept up you would end up looking like a regular tan thong, and while in this form your general usage license made sure that\u2019s legally what you were, nothing but a thong. Norah stopped in the living room to leave a note for your roommates informing them that you were helping her with something and you\u2019d be back in a few weeks hopefully. With that done, Norah took off running down the street. <br>\r\nBut where was she going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Her house, where she will turn you into a more serviceable thong.<br>\r\n2) Her house, but by the time she gets there she has forgotten that you are her thong!<br>\r\n3) To your mother, Helen\u2019s house. She\u2019s having dinner with your mom and sister, but will she mention you, or even remember you for that matter?</span></div></div>",

The jiggly mounds pummeled you thoroughly enough that you were delirious, an hour and a half later you almost wished that you had the ability to snap like those other thongs at least she'd have to take you off then. You didn't even think that she would remember you by the time she made it home, and that would be bad enough with you so mashed up, but even then you might have enough time of her not wearing you to reform. That hope however was not to pass, you felt some of the pressure release and a rush of cool air hit you, the fingers around your arms pulling you down saw you back at Norah's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job Hunter! I had forgotten how absorbent you could be, and you don't even smell. For the next few weeks I bet I could even go to restaurants without having to worry about leaving sweat stains on the chairs. Good thing I remembered you, I wouldn't want to have to stretch you out again.\" She talked casually but excitedly, walking around her house with nothing below the waist. There was a little desk in one corner that she tossed you onto. \"Anyway, I promised you some stuff that would help you hold shape so you don't have to spend all that effort staying pulled out and here it is! Tada!\" She waved a can in front of your face with a label that said 'Full length' with a picture of a tiny man and then a picture of a bra and had some additional information that you couldn't read before she turned it away and sprayed you with it. It didn't sting or anything or even taste bad but for some reason you felt a bit tingly. \"I have to use this for my Clients sometimes so I always have a bit on hand, plus my laundry detergent has a solvent for it inside. Once I'm done with you I can just pop you in the washer and boom you're back to normal. Until then... what do you like better, Black? or Green?\" She held up two cans of a similar spray paint of the same brand name as the last thing. She seemed to be waiting for an answer but you were still taking in what she had said, she didn't plan on washing you until she was 'done' however long that took! You couldn't talk anyway and she seemed to realize it after a moment. \"Oh, right you're a thong duh, I'll just go with my favorite then.\" She shook the Green can and sprayed you with it, at first you figured that your vision would be obscured but it mostly just gave you a 'overlay' of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for a moment before touching you making sure the paint was dry or soaked in, what a nightmare situation. Norah had not only basically removed your ability to get back in shape, but she also just made you look like any of her other Thongs. Only Norah knew exactly what you were, and if she did manage to loose the weight but forgot about you, you might be lost amongst her things. You were of course, unable to verbalize any of this, merely laying on the desk unmoving just like a real thong as Norah gripped you to put you back on. You barely even made a peep as she snapped you around her hips again. \"Ohh, Nice Hunter! You look exactly like my old Lucky Thong, well I guess not so lucky anymore since it snapped a while back. Oh but now you can fill that position... speaking of positions, it's about time for me to start my Yoga session.\" She chuckled to herself as she went to slip back into her compression shorts...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the compression shorts were stretched over Norah\u2019s hefty rear, your world was once again filled with the oppressive mass of her globular cheeks squeezing the life out of you. After enduring a one and a half hour run crammed into her ass, you would thought that you would be at least somewhat used to serving as your ditsy aunt\u2019s thong but between the oppressive heat, sweat and pressure of her swamp-like ass, you don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever be able to get used to it.<br>\r\nTrue to her word whatever Norah sprayed you with did make your time holding up her rear slightly easier, since your arms and legs weren\u2019t constantly trying to reform back to their normal length, they were only contracting to a length that made sure they fit snugly around her hips.<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, that spray should help make your job a little easier and make you look super good on me!\u201d Your aunt giggled. \u201cAnyway I\u2019m going to go start your favourite exercise to help me out with, hot yoga! Are you excited? Anyway do a good job supporting my big \u2018ole butt and it\u2019ll be back down to it\u2019s usual toned self in no time!\u201d<br>\r\nAs Norah practically skipped into the yoga studio she had specifically set up for hot yoga you were falling into despair. Hot yoga with Norah was bad enough when she was using you as a sweat rag, never mind being crammed into her sweaty ass crack. As you endured the sweat and crushing you begged for anyone to come and save you.<br>\r\nSadly for you, the next week went by with no interruptions. Every day you had to endure Norah going out on a run for almost 3 hours, and then later on deal with the exercises she did in her home. The only respite you got from the constant crushing pressure exerted on you by Norah\u2019s ass was when she took you off to shower. Other than that you got no breaks from her rear, Norah didn\u2019t wear any other underwear for the whole week or even take you off to wash you. It was a whole week of basically nothing but darkness, crushing and sweat. The small respite you got while she showered served only to give you a quick glimpse of the outside world before you were returned to your confinement with a quick smile from Norah. <br>\r\nYou noticed she was talking to you less and less as the week went on and you were becoming increasingly concerned that she was starting to forget that it was you serving as her new stretchy, unbreakable thong and that you weren\u2019t just one of her normal thongs. In the end there was nothing you could do to try and get her attention, whatever Norah sprayed you with was stopping your body from reforming and prevented you from being able to move at all. Your only hope was that someone would come along and save you from your air headed aunt, but no one else knew that Norah had spray painted you green so chances of that happening were slim. <br>\r\nA few times you heard what you thought may have been the voice of your mother, but it was muffled through the mass of flesh around you so it was hard to tell. Nevertheless, you mentally screamed out to her for help, but unsurprisingly your cries were left unanswered. The week also showed no significant change in the weight on Norah\u2019s hips, if anything you were sure they may have gotten a tiny fraction wider, although that my have been your imagination. It did make you wonder exactly how long you were going to be trapped as Norah\u2019s only fitting underwear for, you could be trapped in here for months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of this torture, you felt the familiar grinding of the ass cheeks surrounding you that signalled that Norah was walking somewhere, it was almost like her butt was chewing you. This in itself was not unusual, she walked a lot of places, but it was still something you felt like you\u2019d never get used to. The part that was unusual about this particular incident was when she answered the door and from deep down in her cavernous crack, you heard a muffled voice speaking to your aunt, it was one of your roommates!<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t tell which of the three girls it was but the fact that one of them was even here told you that they had been searching for you. You couldn\u2019t really make out the words that either woman was saying from deep down in your prison, but you did hear your name mentioned a few times, every time they mentioned you, Norah\u2019s buns clenched slightly in reflex, you weren\u2019t sure if it was intentional or not but it was definitely unpleasant.<br>\r\nAfter a brief conversation you felt your surroundings shift as Norah moved to the side to let her visitor in before you heard the sound of the door closing. Your world was once again compressed as you assume Norah sat down on the couch. As the conversation continued you began to wonder, which of your roommates was it who managed to track you down? And did Norah still remember that it was you serving as her thong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) It\u2019s Quinn, and Norah does remember it\u2019s you, but is still reluctant to give you up.<br>\r\n2) It\u2019s Morgan, and Norah has completely forgotten that it\u2019s you.<br>\r\n3) It\u2019s Avery, and Norah remembers you, but can Avery convince her to let you go? </span></div></div>",

Every damn step would cause one of Norah's jiggly mounds to rise up before crashing down and smearing you into its twin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet squishing into her trusty yoga mat, Norah made a deep sigh before instructing, \"Breathe in...\" and bending over at the waist to touch her toes. Her instruction served only to torment you as you could only breathe in the inebriating musk from her sweat filled run that had collected especially in her booty. You wanted to whine out that if Norah was going to force you to be her unwilling thong, the least she could have done was put your face anywhere but buried deep in her ass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sensical complaint didn't even come to your aunt's mind however, after all, it was all the same to her. She was only focused on making you the most comfortable, durable, and most importantly, the most absorbent little thong she could ask for. As she bent deep into her forward fold, Norah felt your body stretching against her hips, releasing her deep breath as a pleased sigh. Your silky smooth and honestly mildly warm form was sliding against her sensitive backside, giving a pleasurable chill down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah's deep bend still only allowed her cheeks to part slightly. Their newly gained jiggly mass barely opening a sliver of light out to see the room even as your body was stretched to extreme lengths by your usual standards. You felt your body try to flinch back in disgust as you actually stretched far enough to touch down at the very base of Norah's ass and you begged Norah wasn't enjoying your feel so she would relieve you of this awful task. As you heard Norah's satisfied sighs and restrained moans, you feared that wasn't happening <i>anytime </i>soon...or maybe <i>ever</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexible Norah had her head by her ankles as she spoke out to you, \"Wow, Hunter you just feel so <i>amazing</i>! I bet when you were signing up for that usage license you had no idea you'd be able to find someone to help you out so fast!\" Norah giggled, even the simple act of that causing her hefty ass to jiggle teasingly. \"Luckily for you, you have such a considerate and loving aunt there to give you a hand! Or should I say a butt!\" Norah's taunting snickers continued, \"I mean really, this is such a great opportunity for you! I'm an excellent yoga teacher, and every pose I do is kinda like making you do it with me! By the end of the month, you'll probably be stretchier and fitter than ever! Oh! And I will be too of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her misguided thought, Norah stood back up, causing her cheeks to clap back together, creating a wet seal that trapped you deeper in her ass than you had been just five minutes ago. Wait, did she just say a month?! You thought this was going to a week long excursion at most! You fought with all your might but you could only feel a light tingling where your arms were. It was as if your body was truly made into one solid piece, taking away any control you should have of your form. Norah's sealant was truly the heavy duty stuff. That laundry detergent she had had better be the real deal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't able to think on that much longer as Norah lunged into another pose requiring your immediate attention as you strained roughly. After a grueling hour Norah was finally finished plopping down onto the mat in an exaggerated stumble of fatigue. You of course were smooshed under her ass as she caught her breath, something you wished you could do with the same fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up and admiring herself in her studio's mirror, Norah stroked the backside of her shorts while peering at them over her shoulder. \"Well...that's day one completed. What a workout...huh, what's this?\" Norah's hand brushed over her crack and felt it was suspiciously more dry than the rest of her juicy butt. Grinning, Norah remembered why and did her best mock tiny impression, calling down with a high-pitched voice while shaking her cheek along, \"Great job, Norah! You're looking sexier already! I can't wait for more fun tomorrow!\" Norah burst into a fit of laughter at her awful imitation of you. \"Oh god, I'm sorry Hunter, I just couldn't help it! You do have to admit it was awfully accurate though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith day one on the books, Norah bounded her way out of the studio making a beeline for the kitchen. She had worked up quite the appetite. Taking a health shake from the fridge, Norah gulped it down before heading off to shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole month passed without a hitch in Norah's program. You were shocked that Norah hadn't forgotten you yet, as she continued to speak to you at least a couple times a day remarking how perfect you were for her or how she bet you were enjoying yourself. While you disagreed on both fronts it seemed Norah keeping you as a personal motivator was stopping her from forgetting you weren't just her old trusty green thong. You never made any progress on getting a word in, that was until the end of the month when Norah actually slid you off and you got a face full of her smiling lips. Dropping you onto a cold sheet of metal, you knew exactly where you were from experience past. Tossing her sweaty clothes on top of you, Norah poured in her solvent and started the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later and Norah had retrieved and dried you. You were left a tanned thong shape for another hour but Norah waited patiently for you to reform while watching TV. You rested at her feet on the coffee table much to your dismay but you didn't care since you were finally reforming. Popping into human shape, Norah noticed immediately and gave you a happy clap of satisfaction. \"Oh, Hunter you're back to normal! And as cute as ever, no worse for wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always got embarrassed from your aunt's praise, even after a month of being complimented on things you didn't even like about yourself. Rubbing the back of your head sheepishly you simply squeaked out a \"Thanks, Norah...So time for me to go home, huh?\" As usual you prioritized getting away over setting the past straight, a strategy that had at least kept you going this far in life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah beamed at your question, standing from the couch and spinning to face her back to you. Her butt hung over you and the coffee table like a menacing moon ready to fall, and being cast in it's shadow made you wince instinctively. \"Well, that depends! What do you think?\" Norah's booty clad in gray-spandex was heaving up and down as she went through different stances trying to show off her stuff to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the level of fitness was clear, Norah wasn't kidding when she said the weight was stuck to her hips. Finished showing off, Norah's face filled your entire vision as she hovered in front of you. Her hot breath practically knocked you over as she excitedly asked, \"Are you seeing the progress?! Well, are ya? Are ya??\" You wiped the light drop of saliva that sprayed you off your face before answering your eagerly awaiting aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Norah, you look fantastic. Truthfully, you always have!\" You knew telling Norah the truth that she looked fine was the only way to get back to normal. I mean, if you told her she had no progress who knows when you'd get this chance again? Not to mention she may forget you next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah gushed, clutching her hands against her face in mock humility, \"Oh, Hunter, of course you'd say that! You are such a little flatterer!\" She tried to cutely pinch your cheek but only succeeded in squashing half your face! \"But really Hunter you don't have to be such a tease! I think you should be able to say first hand that my butt hasn't shrank at all! Grasping at your face rapidly, you were trying to pull your mouth free as Norah lamented, \"Honestly I'm <i>super </i>embarrassed to admit this but...I kinda was drinking these meal replacement drinks by mistake...I <i>kinda sorta </i>thought they were protein shakes...heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped tugging at your face in pure shock at this revelation and you were somehow stunned by Norah's airheadedness even after all these years. Noticing your surprise, Norah continued, \"I'm sorry, okay! They were just so damn tasty I wanted to believe!\" Norah saw you throwing a tantrum stamping your foot and went on damage control, \"Oh come on, don't give me that face! You said I look great anyways...but I understand you're disappointed I didn't meet my own goal...\" Norah sank her head and you thought you heard sniffling from behind the curtain of her shiny red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping your mouth free you felt awful for her and wanted to see her smile return. \"Oh Norah, it's okay! You just need to keep up your training another few months and everything will work out!\" Norah's face shot up and you saw her eyes glimmering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?! Oh thank you, Hunter, I knew you'd be accepting!\" Snatching you up, Norah pelted you in passionate kisses which for once only inspired laughter from you as you remarked on her crazy mood swings. Now with you both joyous and optimistic, Norah changed the mood entirely as she squashed you in between her hands. \"I'm so glad you aren't upset with me Hunter. I thought a month under my big butt would really wear you out; but I should've known better! Hell I thought I could lose the weight in another month but if you want me to keep it up for a few that's soooo nice for me. After all, I do have a <i>few </i>shakes left to finish...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed and fought but Norah had already morphed you expertly into a thong shape and hovered her 'Full Length' spray over you menacingly. \"Hey there's no reason to shake Hunter, I've got <i>plenty </i>of green left, your <i>favorite</i>!\" You winced wondering how she confused her favorite with yours but couldn't do a thing as the spray sealed you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping you up her thick legs, you felt her familiar crushing embrace...</span></div></div>",

She didn't even consider that the big ticket was because most of the money you would be 'working' for was basically siphoned off to her because of your general license and her being the one to bring you in. She had already plucked you off the table and yanked you out into a bracelet she could wrap around her wrist. \"Don't worry Hunter, the place is actually just around the corner from my house, I guess it's a bit of a jog from here but I did already jog here.\" She explained which didn't make you feel any better. What the heck kind of job was this? Why did it want general usage guys and not like... the kind of temp contracts your Aunt usually got. You didn't get any information about it from the jog, that was all blurred together as you flew along on Norah's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you did get there the building she stopped in front of left you flabbergasted, you had heard about this kind of place before but you never realized one was so close to... anything near you. The black tinted windows and the name oof, Tiny Pleasures, it was a 'specialty store' that had only two kinds of clients, Women that wanted a tiny molded into something that they would 'rent out' and the much more expensive 'looking to buy' kind who wanted a tiny guy for themselves and would pay ungodly sums to get a tiny with a general use license. You thought that their existence was a rumor! Some shitty internet horror story but here it was, in your town no less. Norah however did not seem the least bit surprised by this and moved directly into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goth looking girl didn't look up yet \"Sorry mam but-\" She cut herself off as she saw Norah enter \"Oh, Norah. I wasn't expecting you to get back to me so soon. You got a guy? Really?\" the woman seemed almost as surprised as you were about this. \"We kind of blew up in popularity recently I didn't think we'd get more like, from the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah laughed a little. \"Oh Joan, I'm the best you know. This little guy just got his license paperwork filled out yesterday and he was so eager to help.\" Norah was pulling you off of her wrist and dangling you in front of this 'Joan' woman. She was decently attractive as well, but you couldn't tell how big she was because of her cloths, still you didn't want to be just handed over, you ultimately couldn't do anything about it though as you were dropped into the manicured hand which closed around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are, I'll have your commission sent and... want your usual? Two hours, I'll give you this time for free for working on such short notice\" Norah bit her bottom lip. and the Goth gave a sly smile and nodded. You had no idea what that meant but it could not be anything good. \"Like I said, we've been really busy so I'll take just a bit you go wait in room four.\" Joan smiled and Norah walked off towards the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the world shifting as she walked into the back room. \"Alright, Number Four, I get that Norah like talked you into this and whatever but from here on out you are mine. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll see the hot ass red head from time to time but unless some hot shot comes in here with the big bucks you don't leave this building. I know your license is general but this is a JOB and I don't want any random slut thinking she can just walk out with her brand new Tiny guy Thong on the fuckin rental fee.\" As she said this she was pulling you out a bit, you saw some instruments on the table that you couldn't fathom the use for, but then she brought down a little pen on your back. You couldn't tell but it was the type that would stay pretty much no matter what unless the remover was applied. even if it got small, there was a big number four stamped on you. \"If you're wondering how much you make, I don't have to answer to you until your license runs out. Now, this should be good enough to where you don't get confused with someone else. I've gotta get you ready for Norah's order though.\" You tried to squirm, you had to at least let her know you didn't want to get used by Norah but this only seemed to make her mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gonna be difficult with me, that's fine.\" She really wasn't inconvenienced by your struggle at all, she flipped you over and found your semi squished face partially elongated from the stretching your Aunt and her had given you. She had some tweezers prying open your mouth with them and pulling your tongue out. \"Maybe next time don't struggle and I can make this a bit more pleasant. as it is, newbie like you needs breaking in. I'll probably leave you like this for a while... give the other guys a break at least.\" She rolled her eyes as you attempted to struggle again. She placed your tongue in a bit of glass and then shoved the rest of your body in a similar glass. \"now, this is the part that is unpleasant\" She attached a device to the end of your tongue tube and your body tube. Then you felt it, the suctions,  whatever that device was it was like a vacuum or something and it not only pulled out the air but it was forcefully pulling you out as well. Expansion you didn't think was possible felt like it was going to rip you apart except that you knew that you weren't, there was a little mirror on one side you could see your body and tongue slowly expanding to fill the containers. You were vaguely aware of the Goth filing her nails as she waited, nonchalantly paying you no mind as she forced you through the torture device. You thought you were going to pass out but before you could there was a ding and the suctions stopped. You must have expanded at least six times your height and that wasn't even considering half of that was just your tongue. As the goth released you from the containers your flesh felt tender and sensitive. Your tongue immediately started getting little taste bud goosebumps and Joan rubbed the top of it down until it wasn't quite a cylinder anymore and then started brushing you with something, it stunk like chemicals but when it touched your tongue it tasted like lemon. She got the part where you were only connected by a thin strand and coated both sides before pushing you together with your 'other half' holding you together for a moment before letting go to reveal that they were now stuck together. \"That aught to keep you from shrinking half way through. Let's see...\" She set you down 'feet' to the table with one of your eyes on the cylinder facing the mirror. Perhaps you had been blocking it out or just hadn't realized what exactly she was doing, but now like this you couldn't deny it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at you was a pink and flesh colored dildo with a big number four printed on it, you could see your eye on the side as well and some of your features, the top half that was your tongue was like those with the little bumps, your taste buds naturally forming in such a way. Joan came back with a thin metal rod with a cap on the end picking you up a in a gentle hold your pain spiked as she pressed the metal into you slowly slightly displacing you but finally clicking your body into the cap. You whimpered a bit as she turned the dial to test and sure enough your whole body was vibrating. \"perfect, alright number four. Sorry I don't have your actual name yet, Norah will have all that stuff sent to me by tomorrow I'm sure. Whatever your name is, You're finally ready! I bet you're just shaking from excitement now that you finally get to go back to her hmm, I'm sure that's what most of her prospects are after anyway.\" Joan snorted as she closed you into a box that shot you up through a tube and landed you gently on your side. You sit in the dark for a moment as the door opens...</span></div></div>",

You knew you needed to explain the situation to your aunt but as you started to once again try to explain you had been grabbed and squashed immediately by her. You tried to move but your aunt skillfully wrapped your body around her wrist and then headed out of your apartment. You realized she had quickly changed you into a living bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go Hunter,\u201d Norah said with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019ll be much easier to transport and I can finish my jog! Since you did get a general use license that makes things so much easier!

They already had forced a general usage license on you, just what else did they need? You hoped that having Aunt Norah there would be helpful but as you were swung back and forth that hope dwindled further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short 15 minute jog, you and your aunt were passing through the door of Isabella\u2019s office. You heard Norah give greetings and start explaining why she was here and how wonderful having a helpful nephew like you was. Despite the situation, you couldn\u2019t help but smile at the praise your aunt was giving you. By the time she had removed you from her wrist and allowed you to reform on the table you were almost embarrassed from her praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella smiled at you as you popped into shape and slid 3 papers your way. \u201cThis is really very simple Hunter, as we previously discussed I was not sure when I would have the time for your actual usage license to be formally written up and so we settled on the general use so you could be of help in the meantime. I have here three different versions drawn up from what we discussed, all you need to do is sign the version you want the most and we will have no further paperwork to do! Please proceed quickly as you wonderful aunt has some paperwork I need to finish for her,\u201d Isabella said very curtly and you hurried to check the contracts before you picked up the pen to sign....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no way you were going to sign a usage licence of your own free will, what was she thinking you would do. You didn't have to wonder for long actually as you looked around them you noticed a few stamps on the desk, from your perspective it was easy to read them. one was a mark for Isabella's signature as she also needed to sign off on this stuff, it was the other one that caught your eye. An easily replaceable one with a tiny sized stamp, your signature was on it seemingly copied from some other paperwork you had signed in the past, and near that another contract she hadn't slid over to you, one with her own name on it and a big bold permanent on the top if you 'stayed behind' to 'take more time' she would just force your fake signature onto one of her own documents. you could practically hear her saying those exact words to Norah to get her to leave without you, if you didn't want to end up as her Thong for the rest of your life you'd need to bite the bullet and sign one of these documents, she clearly thought you wouldn't even consider it. Norah thankfully could get very distracted trying to go over paperwork so you had some time to consider your options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the contract on the far Right you noticed it was a permanent licence, the kind that could only be cancelled if BOTH party's agreed to end the licence seeing that every single box of 'uses' was checked off including 'other' you tried to find the name. Becky Wallace... you didn't know who that was actually, but Wallace was Quinn's last name so maybe they were related, you couldn't be sure since you hadn't talked to Quinn all that much. There was a possibility that Quinn's mom was as nice as Quinn seemed to be but you couldn't trust a total stranger with listening to your story so that you could revoke the usage licence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind you moved on to the next contract, you were at first excited that this one only had a one year long tenure, the kind that couldn't be annulled until it expired but was immediately cancelled after one year's time. Going down to the boxes of course every single box was filled in even Other, although on this one a few of the 'favorites' were selected which would tell the holder which objects the 'willing' tiny wanted to be used as the most in particular Sex Toy and Insole were highlighted. You were confused as to why this one was so specific in it's marks until you got to the name... Helen Woods, no wonder she thought you wouldn't sign these, this was an even worse option than trusting yourself to a stranger. If Helen got this licence... you couldn't be sure how she would react but you couldn't imagine the 'giving you what you want' version would be any better than the 'how dare you young man' version. Sure it wouldn't last forever but... Helen easily misinterpret this as a 'gift' for her birthday and go wild or be very angry that you would 'take the easy route' in life by being a 'thing'. You had to hope the last one would be the least awful because you would rather go on the off chance a stranger listened to you than face your mother's wrath for a whole year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother permanent, off to a bad start and the boxes weren't any less filled than the last two although on this one everything was marked as a favorite, theoretically that did nothing but it seemed strange that it was like that. Then the name. Norah Woods you couldn't figure out how she had managed to make what you could only consider to be the worst choices in such a short time, did she just spend all of yesterday digging into you for revenge because you bothered her friend at the beach... You couldn't dwell on that now, you could hear the footsteps outside the door, if you didn't sign now it would be that petty girl that owned you, a split second of indecision on what to do but forcing the bad feeling out of your throat you grabbed the pen and scrawled your name on Aunt Norah's contract just as the two women rejoined you in the room. Norah sitting behind you in the guest chair and Isabella taking her seat across from you and snatching the three contracts from the desk before Norah could read them at all. She hummed casually as she flipped through them until she paused at the one you signed, almost fluster by seeing a signature there. but she regained composure and simply shredded the other two smiling as she slid over to her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now normally this would take longer but since Norah has been such a help I think I can print your cards right now since both of you are here\" She gave a sweet smile that was very sinister to you as you slowly watched confusion turn to excitement on Norah's face but she had to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.. you mean the other one is for... me?\" She asked casting nervous glances at you. Isabella nodded and the squeal Norah let out drowned out your plea for her to calm down. You tried to talk but Norah was suddenly asking a bunch of questions \"What duration did he choose? how many things? Do I get to decide? What-\" You could still hear her going on with the endless questions as she had leaned u and smashed you under her boobs to get closer to Isabella but she was soon shushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The card will show everything and his copy will be encased in yours as well as on record.\" She waved a plastic card to cool it off. \"For some reason your approval went through fast enough to get the laminated card so here you go.\" she gave the card over to Norah who then sat back in her chair with you left crushed on the desk. You could see her face getting more excited and turning a bit red as she looked at all of the 'agreed' forms She tucked the card away and peeled you up before you could reform on your own totally pinching you into non-verbal flatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was right when I said you wanted to be more helpful to me, more than I thought even.\" She looked back at Isabella who had a slight smile and she swallowed a little before shuffling off to the bathroom with you. She idly pulled at you as if she still couldn't believe it. \"Wow, wow wow! oh my gosh Hunter, how did you know I always wanted my own tiny man to-gah everything. I was always too nervous to ask guys cause like, duh I forget things and I didn't want to leave some guy where he doesn't want cause I forgot.\" The irony that exact thing had happened to you many times was not lost. \"But you signed up to be my toy <b>forever</b> and do <b>anything</b> cause you want it too. I mean, even when you had that general I wasn't gonna do this since you had places to be but now that I know this is what you want I'm going to do <b>everything</b> you checked off that you wanted. I need to figure something out until I get home so for now you can be...\"</span></div></div>",

You had just signed your body over to your ditsy aunt who apparently was even more enthusiastic about it than you had anticipated at first. The yanking she was doing had managed to pull you out to a good length and width and she giggled when she got a look at your stretched features turning you around and letting you see yourself. She had made a sort of oval with you that looked roughly like an insole but you looked like you had been trying to make a funny face as your tongue was comically pulled out and one of your eyes was half closed with your arm having been crushed right under it giving the impression you had been doing that thing where you pull your face skin down and taunt someone. You tried to make some noise but since your tongue was out so far it barely came out as a whine and some light wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Hunter, I was just finishing up. Since we went off my usual route to come here it's only an hour jog. Only double my typical distance from the house! I bet now that you're with me I could even get my jog distance longer in a shorter time, isn't that great Hunter, maybe we'll make it back even faster.\" She easily misinterpreted your struggles as cries of excitement as she pulled her right foot out of it's shoe you could see that in the AC steam was rising from the shoe the smell hit you as soon as the hot air did. Was she boiling her foot in onions every night! your eyes started to water from the smell, as she slid you into the shoe you noticed your face part was in the heel allowing you to see out but you could feel your legs were bent back so only your crotch was probably under the toes but your stomach took up it's place under the ball of her foot. \"This is gonna be the best, I can't wait to try you out! I wonder what I'll like you best as, I know you put down that you loved <b>everything</b> so I guess I just gotta break you in.\" Hearing her causally talk about how she was excited to use you and 'break you in' was almost as bad as seeing the damp 'white' sock replace her face, the heavy use was evident as the sock had obviously been worn thin around the ball and heel and the dark spots indicating where her toes were. She was moving at normal speed but it almost seemed to slide over you in slow motion, the toes touching down on your tongue and then dragging all the way to the end of the shoe leaving behind a layer of filth and sweat mixed together the salt and dirt taste causing you to convulse slightly until her foot fully filled the shoe and sealed you in. She must have felt it though because she said something you couldn't hear from inside the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with her foot fully inserted the heat started to turn up and the excess sweat from her sock was squeezing out with every step and absorbing directly into your body. You tried to focus on a plan to contact Norah or... anyone to explain what had happened to her, you feared that if you didn't it would take a very long time for you to make any progress. You were floored as soon as she started moving though, every step broke your focus as her heel squashed your head and then she rolled up to the ball and stomped your stomach, and she was just walking out of the office. She stopped moving for a moment and you could hear Isabella's voice, you only got a couple words but then you heard Norah respond \"Insole.\" and then Isabella's full belted laugh as Norah started moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious she was outside immediately, the sauna inside her shoe turned into a full blown steam cooker and then after a small pause, probably to put on music, She took off in a blur of motion to your perspective. There was no more time to think, only brace for the next step as each lift off 'knocked the wind' out of you and you started actively trying to drink the sweat as you were sure it was filling up the shoe somehow. If you could have you'd be screaming your head off, the experience even worse than you had even thought. despite how clumsy she was you had never actually been trapped inside of Norah's shoes before and having it now was not giving you a good feeling about your tenure as Norah's personal tiny if she continued not even trying to listen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was a blur, you were sure that several hours had passed as the steps started to blend together and finally your body had absorbed enough from the socks (even if you couldn't taste anything but foot anymore) that you didn't feel like you were drowning in sweat. In actuality it had only been about fifteen minutes, your delirious stomped on mind was begging for some sort of even futile release. You tried screaming and found that it made your mind feel a little better to shout in frustration and so you continued to do it, causing your body to slightly vibrate against the assaulting foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah was bopping to her favorite workout play list when she felt the little buzz from her shoe, it felt kind of nice like it relaxed her foot a little. \"Aww Hunter, you were already doing such a great job as an insole supporting me and soaking up all my sweat, isn't it exhausting shaking like that just for a little massage? Then again you did gift yourself to me so I guess putting in your full effort to make me satisfied is something you'd do.\" Not that you could hear but Norah was musing to herself. At some point you gave up on screaming having been screamed out but by then Norah had stopped jogging, you looked up at your new Owner... your Aunt as her face hovered about the shoe for a moment, you were already so exhausted from the jog you were  having trouble telling if she was looking at you until she said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gazing up at this carefree giantess you legally belonged to, you expected to see a ceiling indicating she had taken you inside. Instead you saw past her joyous expression only to see the bright blue sky overhead. You wondered why she had stopped if she wasn't home yet but as if reading your mind, correctly for once, she seemed to answer your question calling down, \"Phew, alright Hunter, that's about half way! I've gotta say I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorite things to use you as. I mean, usually I have to stop at this bench to air out and cool down my feet since by now they're usually soaked; but thanks to you I can just change what side you're on and save some time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just gotten to the point where the sweat was manageable within Norah's shoe, and now you were about to be subjected to another one? Your body put up no resistance as Norah pried you off the bottom of the inside of her shoe and shoved you into it's twin. You squeezed into the sweltering tomb with a squelch as the sweat that was already pooling at the bottom sloshed with your addition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your face still tucked in her heel, you saw Norah giving herself a tiny massage with an investigative look. \"Wow! The foot you were with a minute ago is only damp, yet my other one is totally drenched! I mean, really, see for yourself!\" Norah hovered her uncleaned foot over your prison, wiggling her toes for effect as she showcased just how much worse for wear it was without your assistance. Clenching her foot, Norah's sock was squeezed into the crevices of her toes, causing a toxic downpour to fall free from it's fabric, only to land directly onto your exposed face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsie! That was a bit more dramatic flair than I was going for!\" Norah's giggles provided a tormenting backdrop as you fought the salty stinging in your crushed eyes. Actually peering down at you, Norah saw your grimacing expression and issued a response, \"Aww, am I chatting too much? Or do ya just miss my warm foot~? I'm sorry, honey, let's get back on the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting anymore time, Norah tucked her foot back into her shoe and gave it a few good stamps to make sure it was nice and snug. Not needing any approval from the little pad cushioning her foot, the gorgeous redhead went back into her jog down the road, totally oblivious to the torment each and every step was inflicting on her little nephew she loved so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere fifteen minutes later, an eternity when spent bearing Norah's weight and the burden of soaking up her fresh sweat, your aunt was seated on her couch attempting to cool down after such a grueling run. Wanting to get your approval after such a good first use of you legally as hers, Norah untied her shoes and grabbed each heel, pulling them off and letting them thud lazily on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the one she thought housed you, Norah was puzzled to not see a smiling face beaming up at her. Instead she just saw the usual bottom of her shoe. \"I was sure he was in this one...\" Norah mumbled before checking her other shoe. \"Maybe he got jammed inside?\" Norah leaned in to get a closer look towards the front of the shoe only to get hit with a hot wave of her own odor. \"Oh my! Why on Earth would he sign up to be put in <i>there</i>?\" She was blowing away the stench with her hand before a lightbulb went off in her head as she answered herself, \"Wow, he really loves me<i> that much</i> that he'd deal with all this just to make my run a little easier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah was restraining cries of joy at how she must be the luckiest woman to ever live when she felt a familiar tingling against the bottom of her foot. Your feeblest attempts at getting her attention seemed to pay off as her weight came off you. Expecting to be peeled off her dirty sock, you instead heard your aunt's voice speak down in surprise, \"Oh, there you are Hunter! Giving my foot a big ole' hug after the jogs over, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah bit her lip and felt her thighs squeeze together as her mind started to wander with the silence of the room. \"You know, it's just you and me now...I bet you're just dying to be of <i>use </i>to your <i>favorite </i>person in all sorts of ways\" Norah spoke out softly and with a sultry touch as she wiggled herself into the couch. You tried to shout out \"NO!\" but only got a mouthful of sock fuzz in the process. Norah released a light moan as you pressed right up against a sore spot on her sole and decide, \"Alright, <i>fine</i>, you can stay there for a <i>little </i>while longer. I had a lot more <i>fun </i>stuff to experiment with you lined up but this should be fine while I rest up. Whaddya say you give me some more massaging as thanks for being such a good owner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Norah call herself your owner sent a blood chilling shudder through your body. Sure that's what she legally was and you knew that, but hearing the powerful title slip from her plush lips made your heart sink into your stomach. Feeling your body lift into the air, Norah moved her feet to rest on her living room ottoman and you heard the garble of the TV being flipped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you wanted to do was give this misunderstanding broad what she wanted, but you needed to push yourself free from her foot before you could get to work on reforming. Pushing your arms and legs as best as you could against the sole, Norah cooed in satisfaction, unable to stop herself from closing her eyes in bliss. Ignoring her pleased expressions, you kept at prying yourself further and further. As time went on you had to deal with Norah's playful other foot mindlessly rubbing against you, a simple and subconscious act for Norah that spelt disaster for you, but you pressed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the better part of an hour but you finally felt your body popping loose from all the damage Norah had done with her light jog. This time, Norah's other foot actually helped you as it caught the gap between you and her sock and ripped you free. Plopping down a carbon mold the shape of Norah's foot, toes and all, you went to work prying your limbs free and coming back to your human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back at your mighty one inch form, you took in your surroundings to make a plan, only to see that Norah was fast asleep! Her legs were outstretched towards you of course, her tall and menacingly powerful feet still stood right next to you, their wicked stench still lingering all over. You wanted to give Norah the benefit of the doubt and blame the smell on her shoes or maybe her well-worn out socks, but with her tendencies and your history, you sighed in remorse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called out to Norah as well as you could but she didn't have the slightest reaction. You considered shoving or punching at her foot but you figured that was asking to get smeared under her heel if she perceived it as an \"itch\". Your only real option seemed to be to make your way on up to her face and see if you could wake her up with your shouts from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you looked at the long fall to the floor. Scaling this ottoman down didn't seem feasible. That left one real option. Crawling your way up her ankle, you stood atop her shin and looked across her bare legs at the long bridge before you. One step at a time, you journeyed over the gap between the couch and her footrest, Norah's smooth and supple skin being no help in preventing you from falling. You only prayed she didn't move in her sleep, or even wake up and stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your caution to thank, you made it past Norah's knees only to reach a newly ominous sight. Your sleeping aunt's legs were crossed together, her broad and thick thighs pouring over each other as they squished their juicy flesh into one another. You saw beads of sweat pooling together only to roll down and plop on her floor. Gulping at the challenge ahead, not only was it dangerous, but it also led to the intimidatingly embarrassing region of her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Norah's tired murmurs ahead, you just hoped you'd make it to Norah's face okay... </span></div></div>",

Give me some time to think and I\u2019ll come up with something much better.\u201d She bit her lip at that, her eyes twinkling with a combination of child-like joy and a deep-seated desire to make you hers. \u201cAh, but, you did select accessory as a favourite as well, so hopefully this will be fun for you anyway. I know I\u2019ll enjoy just having you with me and knowing you\u2019re mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Really bad. The gentle and affection smile on your aunt\u2019s face made you want to cry out in frustration as her warm hands continued to run across your body, kneading and stretching as she continued to chew at her lip. You knew that if you could just make her understand that you hated this, that you didn\u2019t want to be used, that she would stop. That she loved you enough not to take advantage of Isabella\u2019s cruelty. But you also knew that even if you could speak to her, with the way your luck usually ran she would likely misunderstand. So many times in the past you had been mistaken as a willing little man ready to serve her needs. By now, the idea of her nephew as a boy who would do anything to help her was firmly planted in Norah\u2019s subconscious. A self-reinforcing belief that would have readily seen you used by her even without your new permanent licence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were glad that your initial use would be as something less intense that you had feared, you knew that it was only the prelude for what was to come. Already the blush on the redhead\u2019s face was intense enough that it was reaching her ears, and her breath was coming out in short hot pants as she raised you to her face, bathing you in warmth. You shuddered at what may come as you tried to speak, but already Norah\u2019s fingers were at work on your body, and you didn\u2019t even have the chance to make a peep before her thumb blurred your mouth into uselessness. Grasping hands were slick with nervous sweat as they grasped your limbs and pulled, stretching you out before beginning to twist your arms and legs together as a single mass. The thumb descended once more, and what was left of your face was pushed down into your chest, smoothing out your features until it was no longer clear which end was which, only your eyes remaining intact enough to provide a tiny clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, Norah began to speak again, her voice hushed and intended for you alone. \u201cIt must have taken a lot of bravery to be so honest with what you wanted Hunter. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d She sighed, a self-deprecating sound. \u201cI\u2019ve been such a coward. Even though you were always so helpful to me, I could never admit that I\u2026 that I have always been interested in you. Not just as my darling little nephew, but as a tiny man who has done so much for me and who I\u2026 who I just wanted to have all to myself.\u201d She sucked her lower lip for a moment, leaving it slightly red as her dexterous fingers began to twist and pinch your body into a more cylindrical form. \u201cEvery time you agreed to take on one of my jobs I couldn\u2019t help but think that I didn\u2019t want to share you. That you were just for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Norah\u2019s fingers were working together now, pulling and stretching to form you into a broader circle as she continued to spill her heart to her \u2018willing\u2019 nephew. \u201cI always told myself that I mustn\u2019t. That family was more important than whatever my base instincts might be telling me to do. Even if part of me always knew you wanted it as well.\u201d She smiled again, soft and loving and chilling you to the bone. \u201cThere were so many times when I would find you beneath me, or stuck to something of mine, or replacing something of mine. So many \u2018accidents\u2019.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cI was such a fool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could well remember many of those so-called \u2018jobs\u2019 Norah had sent you on, and had you been given the option back then to go on the job or just stay with your aunt, you would have picked the redhead in an instant. But, you had never realised back then that these kinds of thoughts were being directed towards you, and now you wondered just what could have happened to you back then if things had gone differently. You rapidly began to review years of past discussions, wondering just where you had gone wrong to generate the lingering basis of such an ingrained delusion. Was this the result of Tracy\u2019s actions from back then? Or had these thoughts been there from the start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to wriggle, to pass on some kind of message at least, but Norah was already pulling her hair back into a loose bun with one hand, as the other brought you closer and she placed a single lingering kiss on your stretched-out form. The remains of your face and half your chest where pressed into the pillowy mass of the redhead\u2019s lips as a blast of warm air washed over you from a single shaky breath. Then you were moving again as you were brought around behind your new owner and slipped around the waiting bun, your last view of the outside world being a bird\u2019s eye view of the bulbous booty below before you snapped into place and everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Norah had used her cute nephew as an object, knowingly or otherwise, but this time she felt a pleasant chill run up her spine as she let go and confined you to her hair. Before it had always been a temporary thing. Even when you had agreed to days or weeks of use there had always been a time limit to dread. Now though, there was no longer any need to hold back. More than that, there was a legal imperative for her to act. To not use you would be to violate your rights in accordance with Baker\u2019s Law. To deny you the right to be what you wanted to be. Before, a misguided sense of propriety had held her back. Now better informed, it compelled her to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go so far as to get this licence to make me see Hunter.\u201d Hands now free, your aunt retrieved the licence from her pocket and ran her thumb across it with a sense of reverence, pausing as the digit came to rest on your own tiny card embedded in her own. \u201cBut I promise, from now on I\u2019m going to do everything you want me to do. You\u2019ll come with me everywhere, be with me always, and I\u2019ll use you for everything I can.\u201d Hazel eyes ran down the seemingly endless list once more as warmth filled her at just how much you wanted to be with her. \u201cI swear, we won\u2019t miss a single thing on this list. Even if it takes the rest of my years, I\u2019ll make you as happy as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried desperately to respond, but even as you managed to produce a slight vibration you knew it was hopeless. The cushioning layer of your aunt\u2019s hair rendered such slight movements meaningless, and even had she felt them she would likely have thought you were trembling in joy. Every word she spoke drove you further into despair as you realised there may never again come a time when someone would treat you as an actual person. That as far as the rest of the world, and the law, was concerned, you were Norah\u2019s property now. An object to be used as she saw fit. Even her kind words did nothing to lift your spirits, knowing her fundamental misunderstandings would turn that goodwill against you. The last words spoken by your aunt as she moved to leave was a gentle \u201cI love you\u201d that made you want to cry. After all, the one thing that wasn\u2019t on that list was a request to be human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella raised her head as your aunt stepped back into her office, suppressing a smirk at the blush still colouring the older woman\u2019s face and the fact that you were nowhere to be seen. \u201cAll set? Already putting the little guy to good use?\u201d In response, the redhead turned her head slightly to show off her hair, indicating your location with a shy smile. The corrupt licensing officer was a bit disappointed with such a tame use but smiled slyly as Norah went on to explain that she was keeping you there while she made plans for the future, and that you would get much more use later. To your aunt, it was confirmation that she would follow the law. To Isabella it was music to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would forever surprise you how people could smile so maliciously without being suspected of ill-content. \u201cWe\u2019ll send out a notification to anyone who received a copy of the previous general licence to let them know of the change. Just so there won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d Or, more accurately, to make sure that there was no way you could weasel out of this. Isabella motioned to Norah like she was going to share some deep secret, before speaking again in a more conspiratorial tone. \u201cIf you ask me, you\u2019ve got a great one there. I was a bit worried about him wanting to select everything like that, but he was adamant that you were deserving of his everything. I talked him into accepting a general licence temporarily while he thought about it overnight, but his conviction hadn\u2019t changed.\u201d It took all her self-control to keep from laughing as your aunt\u2019s face lit up with obvious glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you had the strength to kill Isabella in that moment, wondering what kind of monster could do this to someone just for having the gall to call her and her friend on their obvious lies. Her behaviour seemed so practiced. So assured. Who else had she doomed to this fate? How many of the Baker\u2019s Law tinies in these parts were begging for release as they suffered at the hands of their misled tormentors? While you screamed inside, in the world beyond the women were all smiles as they parted, though Norah\u2019s face was still burning red as she stepped outside and took a deep breath. A shaking hand raised to lay against her chest and feel the rapid beat of her heart as she smiled softly and thought of you, and just how much you had gone through to make sure she was happy. To make sure both of you were. The joyous laugh that escaped her then was one of a woman who had found her purpose in life, and there was a skip to her steps as she headed\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt the strong inertia of jogging as your new owner bounded down the road somewhere. If only you weren't sealed to this redhead's hair with your face on the inside, you'd have some idea where you were headed but unfortunately you could only wonder. You gulped, if your aunt was headed straight home that would make her and Isabella the only people on the planet who knew you were legally chained to being Norah's property. Of course Isabella had to cover her tracks and notify everyone of the cancellation of your general use license, now not even your family would think anything of it besides it being a simple paperwork mistake. You could only pray that Norah would be as loud and forthcoming as possible with your family to reveal to them you were in this predicament...that is if they even questioned it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the horrifying thought from your mind you heard Norah's cheery voice call out, \"Oh hey Hunter, let's make a stop at your old apartment; I'd hate for your roommates to wait up when you won't be needing the space anymore!\" Norah giggled to herself as she noted how little space you took up anyway. Still, she wanted to tie up any loose ends she could for you, to make sure there were as few interruptions as possible in fulfilling all of your deep, dark desires. It would be nice to get some more congratulations on her sort of...<i>union </i>as well. A bright red blush filled Norah's cheeks as she thought of how good that sounded to hear you two tied together. With a perky pace, Norah hurried towards your old domicile; wanting to get home both before dark and as soon as possible to have more time with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cheered mentally as you heard Norah's mention of seeing your roommates. With how things went this morning, you knew for sure they'd be able to clear things up. You finally felt a glimmer of hope return to your mind as you imagined responsible Morgan tearing you from your overly attached aunt and letting you feel like a human again. You felt the hair around you grow a bit damp from Norah working up a good sweat on her run, and you winced praying that moment would come as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the steps of the apartment, Norah was panting hard and dripping on the doormat of your(former) apartment. Knocking, Norah waited for a moment before the shining face of Avery filled the frame as she opened the door. \"Norah! Welcome back!\" Avery was as warm and welcoming as ever despite the fact she had just met Norah that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah, despite her fatigue, returned a bright smile and responded, \"Ahhh, Avery! Short shift today? I was worried no one would be home and I'd have to leave a note.\" You winced imagining your very fate laying in the hands of a flimsy scrap-paper-note left on your door. A strong gust of wind would've been the difference between years of serving Norah or a bright future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, nothing too much today. You look exhausted! Why don't you come in and get some water?\" Norah graciously accepted and stepped in, following Avery to the kitchen with you bouncing along behind her. \"You really worked up quite the sweat, you'll have to show me your routine some day!\" Of course these two scatter-brains were getting along swimmingly as they made small talk about yoga and cardio. As Norah caught her breath and re-hydrated, you felt a tug against your leg as Norah grasped at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we can totally do a session someday! I bet yoga could be an amazing help in your modeling with enough effort!\" As Norah spoke she was casually pulling you wider and wider until you went from a band to a wide flat square. Running you along her arms and chest to lap at her dripping perspiration, Norah was continuing to chatter on as Avery interrupted, \"Woah, wasn't that your hairband a second ago? What is that, some new MicroFlex tech?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah nervously giggled, that familiar blush returning to her face as she withdrew her usage license with one hand while getting to rubbing you along her waist methodically with her other. Presenting it proudly to Avery, Avery's jaw dropped in shock as she read the tiny print. \"Oh. My. God. You didn't!\" Hearing Avery's reaction made you sigh in relief even while getting a mouthful of Norah sweat. Wouldn't be long now until this was all straightened out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is <b>amazing</b>! I'm so happy for you two! It's so rare a tiny finds someone they're willing to sign themselves over to. And woah, forever at that!\" Easily excitable Avery wasn't even beginning to think that maybe this was some misunderstanding as she leapt at Norah, enveloping her in a great big hug despite Norah's current soaked state. The girls were giddily jumping in each other's embrace, all while you were mushed between them getting flatter by the second as their overwhelmingly bountiful chests smothered you constantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting their mini party, Morgan and Quinn arrived home from work and walked in on their embrace in the kitchen. \"Woah, what's going on in here? And who's this?\" Quinn asked plainly but with a genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking from her hug, Avery introduced Norah and she happily showed off her new usage license. While Norah peeled you off her chest sheepishly, Morgan and Quinn's jaws dropped but this time for the actual right reasons. Collecting their thoughts, the girls made their way to the living room where Norah was getting a bit more comfortable taking her shoes off and plopping on the couch. Morgan was the first to get to business as she sympathetically had her eyes locked on to your flat form laying in Norah's lap. \"I really think there must be some kind of misunderstanding...Hunter straight up fainted when I told him he had a license this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah merely laughed aloud at the idea of that, she imagined your large smile before toppling over in bliss thinking of her. \"Fainted in excitement of course! You girls really don't know my nephew like I do, he's a quirky little guy like that!\" Norah gave you an affectionate squeeze before she continued, \"I mean really, he's been working up to this his whole life!\" Norah had begun sliding you down her smooth thighs and calves before coming to her damp, not to mention sweltering, socked feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that could possibly be true, he just signed up to move in here after all. He told us all about all these plans he had for the future!\" Quinn stated, actually getting into this seeing as how wrong she thought your aunt was. Norah had begun pressing you firmly into the sole of each foot, forcing you to get a face-full of sweaty fabric that would've dripped onto the carpet if not for your body's desire to soak it all up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really! Ever since he was little he was always disguising himself as all sorts of useful little objects he somehow knew I needed, or magically getting himself stepped on or sat on. He really was like a little magnet for his favorite auntie!\" Norah affectionately rubbed you deeper into her foot before satisfied with her work at drying her feet. Standing, she turned around and laid you flat on the couch before presenting her rotund booty to you. You watched her black spandex shorts stretch to their limit as Norah's ass widened as she sat. You shook feebly as it descended like a meteor onto your helpless body with a 'Whump!'. Norah bounced in place a bit saying, \"Sorry, I really shouldn't have sat my sweaty behind on your nice couch, but don't worry, Hunter will help us out!\" You screamed into an endless abyss that never produced a single sound at both Norah's words and her noxious tasting ass sweat that was seeping from her shorts onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn and Morgan exchanged nervous glances watching you while Avery nodded along approvingly. Truly Avery had no idea why her sisters were acting so investigative. Hunter signed the paperwork, what's their deal? Morgan spoke up again, \"Really, Miss, I think this is all some big misunderstanding...\" But Norah was quick to cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I have dozens or maybe even hundreds of stories that would blow your mind! I'm not surprised you're a little confused but trust me when I say I just want what's best for him!\" She felt a tiny itch in her ass and smeared it away with a wiggle on you before continuing, \"Seriously, there was a time when he was little where he snuck into my dang suitcase masquerading as some kind of funny little rag!\" Norah bellowed in laughter and fond remembrance shaking you beneath her, \"He's sneaky too! I was none the wiser for quite a while, giving him more than enough use! I can't remember <i>exactly </i>how or why he eventually revealed himself but I'm sure he was as sad as I was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems you and Tracy never backtracking with Aunt Norah about her childhood tricks was really coming back to bite you. You swore if you ever got out of this you'd set the record straight. At this point Quinn and Morgan were feeling defeated and Quinn made one last plea, \"If that's the case, why don't we just talk and ask him what he think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my is it getting dark out already! Yikes, I'd better get going girls! Thanks so much for taking care of Hunter for a bit but he's my responsibility now! I hope to see you girls around, maybe we could do that yoga sesh Avery?\" Norah had peeled you from the couch and was out the door before Quinn could finish her thought or Morgan could protest. You swung in her grip as she took off jogging home. \"Don't worry, Hunter. <i>I know you</i>. I won't let <i>anyone </i>take you from me.\" A chill ran down both your spines but for entirely different reasons. You just prayed your roommates wouldn't give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Morgan, we'll figure something out...\" Quinn patted a dejected Morgan on the back as they watched her run off. Morgan was wholly unconvinced. She saw that forged signature this morning and knew something was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah made good on her promises, using you as a shower wash cloth and couch cushion before getting to bed with you tucked deep in her warm and cozy yet suffocating cleavage. Eventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Isabella slid the documents towards you with her well manicured hand, she grinned at you, chewing on the gum in her mouth. She blew a bubble at you teasingly and you swear you could see the faint outline of a face before it burst and she drew it back into her mouth. Her full, plump lips closing and blocking the poor unfortunate man she was tormenting from your view.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry though Hunter, if any of these ones don\u2019t suit you I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be able to find another girl who would suit your needs here,\u201d she said this with a smile to Norah, who smiled back. What you noticed that Norah didn\u2019t was the amused smirk as she looked back to you and continued. \u201cI\u2019ve got some good friends who love tiny guys like yourself and would treat you exactly how you deserve.\u201d<br>\r\nWith her thinly veiled threat in mind, you looked over the three documents that Isabella had laid out in front of you and none of them looked very appealing. <br>\r\nAunt Norah was a bad choice, her forgetfulness and seeming eagerness to use you now that you had the general usage license made you reluctant to sign a license that gives her sole rights to use you. She would be very likely to mould you into something and then forget about it, and you really didn\u2019t want to spend weeks at a time as her insole or underwear. That\u2019s not even including the potential for using this newfound power over you to send you out on tiny guy jobs she\u2019s struggling to fill at her job. The fact that this was also a permanent license, that could only be cancelled if both you and Norah agreed to it, was very off putting.<br>\r\nThe second one you looked at was also a permanent license, not a good start. However, the name was not one you recognised, Becky Wallace. Maybe she was related to Quinn, her last name was Wallace. Maybe this Becky person would be as caring as Quinn seemed to be under her harsh exterior. But that wasn\u2019t something you wanted to risk. You couldn\u2019t sign your life away to a woman you didn\u2019t even know.<br>\r\nThat left the last license. Looking at it, it was only a year, which was better than the other two, although it couldn\u2019t be cancelled even if both parties consented. Speaking of the other party, you began to question how Isabella had managed to make the license with the shortest time so unappealing when you read the name of your mother, Helen Woods. Helen, to put it lightly, would not be pleased to find out you had signed one of these contracts. You couldn\u2019t be sure how she\u2019d react exactly, but you could guess some form of punishment would be involved. She may decide to \u201cgive you exactly what you asked for\u201d for the years duration of your license to teach you a lesson.<br>\r\nIn the end you found it very difficult to choose anyone but your mother, her license was only a year and you were sure you\u2019d be able to get Helen to see the truth of your situation eventually. You hoped.<br>\r\nIsabella raised an eyebrow in surprise when she saw you signing your mother\u2019s license. She had expected you to refuse to sign any of them, you knew that much. She probably had contracts prepared for herself and her friend from the beach stashed somewhere that she\u2019d probably have forced you to sign if you had refused. You were glad to have robbed her of that at least. Although you still felt, and could tell from how she was smirking at you she felt that, she had won. <br>\r\nNorah beamed behind you, \u201cAw Hunter, that\u2019s so sweet of you to want to help out your mom like that.\u201d <br>\r\nYou turned to correct her and hopefully explain the situation as it really was, but before you could Isabella stealthily knocked over her pencil holder, which squished you, leaving you unable to talk.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that Hunter,\u201d she smirked. \u201cAnyway while you\u2019re reforming I\u2019ll explain how this works. Your usage license with your mother will last a year after which it will expire. Your mother will be notified a month before this happens and will have the option to come in and have me extend it. If she chooses not to your general usage license will kick back in and you\u2019ll be available for other women to use to their heart\u2019s content. So I\u2019ll get this registered and send word to your mother via email.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter laminating a card for both you and your mother, Isabella started helping Norah with her paperwork, a temporary usage license for one of the tiny guys she recruited for a job. You couldn\u2019t get a word in over them talking about it to explain to Norah what was really going on and before long she was carrying you out of Isabella\u2019s office, Isabella waving goodbye to you with a sadistic smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wrapped you around her wrist again and jogged back to your apartment.<br>\r\nOnce there you could see two figures looking out the window. You could see Morgan, obviously the first home from work. The second one made your blood go cold, it was your mother, Helen Woods, and she looked angry, very angry.<br>\r\nMorgan looked incredibly nervous as your Aunt approached the apartment with you in her hand, having taken you off her wrist and given you some time to start reforming in her hand. You hadn\u2019t fully reformed as Norah approached the front door and dropped you into Helen\u2019s waiting hand alongside your laminated usage license cards. As Norah said her goodbyes, Helen replied with a goodbye without her eyes leaving your slowly reforming form. She looked deep in thought, her scowl changing to an expression that made it impossible for you to tell what she was thinking. <br>\r\nHelen followed Morgan back into the living room before speaking up,<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan dear, could you give me and my son a moment alone? I need to discuss this with him in private.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, no problem Mrs Woods,\u201d she gave you one last concerned glance before leaving the room. Leaving you, just finished reforming on your mother\u2019s palm as she stared down at you in judgement.<br>\r\n\u201cHunter... would you care to explain to me how you could be so stupid to get yourself into this situation?\u201d You felt like you would crumble under her angry gaze as she spoke to you. You had never seen her this angry before.<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, It all started at my new job...\u201d you started to explain.<br>\r\n\u201c I mean I thought I raised you better than this Hunter!\u201d She shouted, interrupting you. \u201cWhat, was life in the real world too difficult for you? You want to take the easy way out be becoming a thing instead of a person, is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not...\u201d you tried to defend yourself, explain what actually happened before you were interrupted again.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know what we\u2019ll do here, I think I\u2019ll give you exactly what you want. Show you what it\u2019s really like to be someone\u2019s property. After a year of being given exactly what you\u2019ve asked for here maybe you\u2019ll see what a mistake you\u2019ve made here!\u201d Her voice had calmed, changing from high volume shouting into that of a disappointed parent. As she finished speaking her hand closed around you, compacting you into a little ball before you could explain yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019d come up with some sort of half-assed excuse so I don\u2019t even want to hear it,\u201d Helen said coldly.<br>\r\nWithout another word to you she flattened you out while she took off her right shoe and dropped you in. You were facing upwards and were able to see her enormous socked foot, slightly damp with sweat descending and eventually blocking out the light as it entered the shoe and started to compact you even more as it took up all available space within the shoe. You were mostly underneath the heel of her foot, since she had just dropped you in , and you braced yourself as best you could in your flattened form.<br>\r\nYou heard the muffled sound of your mother informing Morgan that she was going to take you home to decide what to do with you and then she took her first step towards the door.<br>\r\nHer first step, and the next few steps afterwards, compacted you further underneath her damp, musty sock. You were steadily spread out under her foot until you started to take a shape similar to her insole. The pressure on your body being exerted by every footfall, along with the constant movement, disorientated you and made you feel slightly nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your mother had left the apartment, she began walking towards her car. She seemed to be purposefully putting extra pressure on you now that she was outside, letting out some of her anger at, as she viewed it, your stupidity. She got in the car and started to drive off home. The car journey wasn\u2019t as bad as her walking, but the increased heat in the car caused Helen to sweat a fair bit. This increased the humidity in her shoe and made the sock resting on top of you grow damper and some of that sweat began to soak through it and drip onto you. Your body greedily absorbed all the sweat that dripped onto you, and even started to leach the sweat from the sock resting on top of you. Helen noted that her right foot felt slightly drier than her left, and smiled faintly.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this next year won\u2019t be so bad for me after all. Although Hunter is going to hate it,\u201d she chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an excruciating car journey you finally felt your mother take a step out of the car, crushing you under her foot once again. After around 10 minutes of her walking to, and then around the house gathering various things to deal with you, you finally saw light as the foot that had been grinding you down into it\u2019s smelly embrace for the last forty minutes was slid out of the shoe, revealing Helen\u2019s slightly frowning face, framed by her long, sandy brown hair.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how did it feel to be my insole? Enjoying yourself yet?\u201d The sarcasm in her voice told you she did not expect an answer. \u201cSo I think I might as well turn you into something now. You signed up to be my property for a year so I might as well get the use out of you.\u201d<br>\r\nAs her hand came down, peeled you off her insole and pulled you out of her shoe you were greeted with the sight of the kitchen table. Arrayed on top of it were various tools to turn you into something she could use.<br>\r\nWhat was she going to turn you into?</span></div></div>",

A year underfoot aught to show you exactly why this was so stupid, and just in case you do for some reason like it I've got some things your Aunt left here to make it just a bit less pleasant.\" You saw what she had on the table, you had seen some of the stuff before just sitting around at Norah's house but the one that caught your attention the most was the 'press' with a shoe size adjuster. Simply put it was a device that would pull you out over the whole insole and then she could 'glue' you into shape so you didn't reform while she wasn't wearing the shoes. You never tried to reform so fast in your life, you were scared sure but you needed to set the record strait with your mom right now or you might not get the chance. She had dropped you down while she fiddled with the device and you hurried yourself focusing on your mouth. On the other hand, your body sort of reformed from the effort you tried to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom listen That No--\" Helen made a face at your mostly reformed body and had pinched you between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I don't want to hear your excuses young man. Honestly, you can't even listen NOW, I hope you get yourself strait in the next year\" She shook her head \"Now don't struggle or you'll make it worse\" She sighed bringing your feet towards the beginning of the device, a sort of double rolling pin or pasta maker thing. You of course tried to resist ending up putting your knees in first instead of your feet, which Helen took note of but instead of reprimanding you again she snickered slightly. Your face of course still flattened could scream out when it flattened and widened your knees doing the work of minutes of pulling in seconds, not to mention the increased pain as it passed your crotch and then your head. You cried a little inside when you realized that because of her cutting you off mid sentence your mouth was basically all the way open. Your cloths of course were long since shredded away. The machine deposited you on a slightly squishy surface, You were looking up through the plastic device, your mother's hand was on a leaver and connected to it a foot shaped press. Your vision was dark as she pulled it squashing you into the material below and pressing it flat. when it lifted you felt you were somewhat pressed around the edges as it reflated. The machine spit you out the other side, Helen holding up a mirror to show you what you looked like. \"I told you not to struggle, if you had just stayed still you'd be positioned a bit better, well not that it makes a difference to your function, it's just more pain for you. Maybe that's what you wanted though hmm.\" She was talking about your crotch, you were in the shape of an insole alright but your crotch had ended up right under the ball of her foot, where as if you hadn't struggled against her it might have been under the arch. \"Either way, I don't want weird looks so I'm going to use the black spray, that way you match my regular Insoles. And remember Hunter, that's all you are for the next year because of your stupid choices, my insole.\" You couldn't scream if you wanted as she sprayed the paint on you. It added a tint to your vision like wearing sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to despair as she got a phone call and stopped paying attention to you. You had always remembered Helen as a fair mother, why was she being so unreasonable! You could only hope that she would calm down after a couple of days but you were not looking forward to even that. She was walking back and you could see her holding it in her hand, it was her work shoes, the raised heel pumps. \"Well it looks like I've got another business trip, time to get you settled in.\" She said lifting you and placing you into the shoe. You now looked up at her as she walked away again to get ready. There was a familiar running around but the anticipation of what was coming was making a pit in your stomach. Once she was done, she slipped her now stocking clad foot into your shoe the crushing weight of it all hit you literally and figurately. The shoes were shaped just so that her resting position was still like standing directly on your crotch and her steps lifted you up only to crash right back down. The swift walk was so much worse than the one that had brought you here, you weren't sure you would last a week of this, let alone the full year of torture. Not only the pain but it was only a few moments before her nylons were just as sweaty as her socks had been, although your body was absorbing her right foot's rather well. You were starting to black out, you couldn't handle it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how much time had passed but when you woke up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Isabella slid the documents towards you with her well manicured hand, she grinned at you, chewing on the gum in her mouth. She blew a bubble at you teasingly and you swear you could see the faint outline of a face before it burst and she drew it back into her mouth. Her full, plump lips closing and blocking the poor unfortunate man she was tormenting from your view.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry though Hunter, if any of these ones don\u2019t suit you I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be able to find another girl who would suit your needs here,\u201d she said this with a smile to Norah, who smiled back. What you noticed that Norah didn\u2019t was the amused smirk as she looked back to you and continued. \u201cI\u2019ve got some good friends who love tiny guys like yourself and would treat you exactly how you deserve.\u201d<br>\r\nWith her thinly veiled threat in mind, you looked over the three documents that Isabella had laid out in front of you and none of them looked very appealing. <br>\r\nOn one hand, choosing your Aunt Norah probably wasn\u2019t a good idea considering how ditsy and forgetful she can be, plus she was seeming too happy with you having a usage license. You feared how her view of you could change, plus it would basically give her free reign to send you out on any jobs she needed you fill in for her own job as a tiny recruiter.<br>\r\nYour mother, Helen, also wasn\u2019t ideal. Even though that license only had a one year limit, the embarrassment of signing your life away to be used by your mother wasn\u2019t something you wanted to deal with, plus you imagine she\u2019d view her year of full control over you as her opportunity to punish you for getting into this situation.<br>\r\nYou had no idea who this Becky Wallace was, she had the same last name as Quinn so she was probably some relation to her. If she was related to Quinn then she\u2019d hopefully be as level headed as she was and would be less likely to abuse the power you were about to hand over and even if she was, Quinn would be likely to step in and speak up on your behalf. <br>\r\nYou contemplated refusing to sign but a brief threatening look from Isabella put those thoughts out of your mind, she already managed to forge a general usage license for you, she could likely do it again. <br>\r\nYou grudgingly signed your name on the form that would leave your life in the hands of Quinn\u2019s mom, hoping she\u2019d be kind enough to not abuse the power you just handed her. <br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! I\u2019ll make sure a copy of these documents reach Mrs Wallace,\u201d Isabella exclaimed as she quickly pulled the document away from you before she filled out the necessary parts. \u201cNow I\u2019ll handle your paperwork Norah.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Isabella handled your aunts request, a temporary usage license for one of her workers. You sat and contemplated what you had just done. You handed your life away to a complete stranger. You were immediately filled with panic and regret, at least if you had chosen one of your family members you\u2019d at least have known what you were dealing with. Why did you take that sort of gamble? It\u2019s not like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your aunt got her paperwork filled out by Isabella she scooped you up and walked out of the office to take you home. As you were leaving Isabella waved to you with a smug grin.<br>\r\n\u201cBye Hunter, feel free to drop in at any time. I\u2019ve got <i>plenty</i> of time for you,\u201d she teased you with a wink.<br>\r\n\u201c I think someone likes you Hunter,\u201d Norah whispered to you with a smile. If only she knew, Isabella seemed to be more of the type to torture a tiny man than date them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah wrapped you back around her wrist and jogged back to your apartment, you were greeted at the door by Morgan. Who thanked your aunt for bringing you back. You chatted with Morgan and told her about what happened at Isabella\u2019s office and she reacted with shock and some confusion.<br>\r\n\u201cHunter, why didn\u2019t you pick your mom or your aunt?\u201d She asked, baffled. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, my mom would probably put me through the worst tories as a sort of punishment for being so stupid, sort of giving me what I asked for to make sure I wouldn\u2019t do it again,\u201d Morgan listened intently to what you said, her face softening out of pity for your situation. \u201cThen with Norah, the possibility of her moulding me into a shape and then forgetting about me was really high. I\u2019d end up spending weeks at a time as her insole or something like that. Plus she\u2019s a recruiter for tiny specific jobs and the ones she could send me out on now that I have a usage license would be just horrible. I didn\u2019t want that future to be my whole life. At least with Quinn\u2019s relative, whoever she is, Quinn might be able to convince her to cancel the usage license, since you need both parties to agree.\u201d<br>\r\nMorgan opened her mouth to respond, but was interrupted by both Avery and Quinn returning home. They both walked into the living room.<br>\r\n\u201cHey cutie, how was your day?\u201d Avery winked at you.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, any word on the license situation?\u201d Quinn asked.<br>\r\nYou explained the situation to them and got as far as signing Becky\u2019s usage license before Quinn interrupted you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou WHAT!\u201d She cried out in shock. This was the first time you had seen Quinn show this much emotion, which worried you. You tried to explain how awful it would have been with your mom or aunt before Quinn interrupted you again. \u201cNonono Hunter you don\u2019t understand! My mom hates tiny guys! She\u2019s made so many of my friends disappear I\u2019ve lost count, and that was without her having sole rights to decide what happens to them. If she find out about this she will have free reign to do whatever she wants with you!\u201d <br>\r\nWith Quinn\u2019s words the reality of exactly who you had signed your rights over to dawned on you. A tense atmosphere descended over the room as everyone came to terms with what Quinn has just said.<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn, is there any way you could get me out of this?\u201d Your voice came out shaky as your panic levels were rising.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019d be half tempted to just let you suffer the consequences of being so stupid!\u201d Quinn snapped, surprising you at how hash she could be. \u201cBut I\u2019ve lost too many friends to her so yeah, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d <br>\r\nHer expression softened as she saw how much she frightened you. She stood up to go get her phone to call her mom to explain the situation and try to convince her mom to spare you. She came back a few moments later saying that her mom wasn\u2019t picking up her phone so she\u2019d have to try again later. So you all decided to try and relax for a while till she could reach her.<br>\r\nLater that night, as you were all watching tv, there was a knock at the door. Everyone froze, all turning toward the hallway leading to the door. Quinn looked at you and gave a look of reassurance before going to the door, you heard the faint sound of her greeting someone before she returned to the living room with a grim look on her face followed by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ... Her mother, Becky Wallace. Holding her copy of the usage license. Can Quinn convince her in person to spare you? <br>\r\n2) ... Isabella and Rachel, both grinning evilly. They are holding the usage license that you signed, but it has one of their names on it! <br>\r\n3) ... No one, it was a pair of kids playing a prank who ran off afterwards.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The woman that followed her was clearly her mother but you hadn't been prepared for just how dead sexy she was, Quinn hadn't shown you any pictures or anything but this was well beyond anything you would have imagined. It was no wonder she could utterly decimate tinies and nobody would come down on her about it, you were sure there would be guys, especially dumb teens, that would totally brush off anything besides blatant outright telling them she was doing something on purpose. You knew better though, because Quinn had told you so any sort of act about doing something accidentally would be wasted, she didn't look unhappy to be here though, clearly Quinn was more uncomfortable with the situation than Becky. You realized that your mouth had dried out as you caught sight of the massive woman and you swallowed. Morgan and Avery were up off of the couch before you could break yourself out of your stupor blocking you from sight from your position on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Wallace, what a surprise, did you come to visit Quinn?\" Morgan tried to go with a bluff but you saw Quinn shake her head from off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my no, While I do love my Quinnie she hadn't told me where she was living yet. Why I was just so surprised when she answered the door I can't wait to spend some more time with her but I found you all in a round about way.\" She smiled at the sisters warmly as she pulled the card out from her back pocket, it was her copy of the usage license, Isabella did not mess around when she said she would make sure that Becky got it. \"I just came over to pick up my things and I'll be out of your hair.\" She didn't even acknowledge that you were a tiny person, just 'one of her things' that sent chills up your spine of what she was capable of. That was when Quinn cleared her throat and stepped up beside Morgan and Avery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let you do that mom, not this time. Hunter is a person and he's been framed, that nasty bitch of a notary basically forced him to sign up for that card. You have to think that's wrong please mom. He just got a job and everything.\" Quinn pleaded knowing that in this situation she was 'technically' in the wrong if anything legal got involved, Denying a Tiny their chosen person who had already agreed to have them was likely to get at least a fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh, plus if you do use him you gotta do all these other things he had before getting a license. He's got a rent contract and work as a lifeguard...\" Avery added but trailed off when she didn't seem to be getting any response out of Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky made a pouty face \"That's all? I already signed on for all of that though. Little angel I love you but this is why I didn't want you to move out, you care to much about these little bugs even when one is so stupid that he signs himself up as a toy just based on looks. He had plenty of chances to avoid this.\" She made no move towards you but her presence, the authority that she stated things as if they were fact was suffocating. You could see the girls flinching trying to find a way to explain things to her so that she wouldn't take you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was the one that had the light of an idea shine in her eyes. \"Actually Hunter had no idea what you looked like,\" She said with confidence. There was an idea working very quickly in her mind and it seemed that the other two might have caught on to it when that actually gave Becky pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan picked up where she left off. \"That's right, hunter was so shocked to learn that you didn't like tiny guys he didn't even ask. Quinn was so worried about you coming and doing something to him. But like he didn't even know before this whole situation got out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were looking hopeful that the situation was turning in your favor as Becky seemed to seriously consider the words. Avery piped up \"Yeh, he choose you because Quinn is so calm and collected that he figured that you had to be the same if you raised her.\" Becky considered those words for a moment. For a moment it looked like she might be considering it but then she seemed to brush the idea aside for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good but I thought you said he was forced into this, and now you said he 'chose' me. I think if he had a choice and he didn't want to get used he should have requested one of you no? I'll tell you what, I'm a generous girl just for you girls and my little Quinnie, I'll look into that Notary, but you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was the first one to have her eyes widen \"Wait really? Having money behind this sort of investigation would be huge mom! What could you be thinking about to stop you?\" Quinn actually seems to have realize that it wasn't just your ass on the line but if Isabella got away with this often it would be a huge scandal. You had to admit for not liking Tinies she was being strangely considerate of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just, If I go to cancel this wouldn't such an <i>evil</i> girl just find some other way to disappear your little guy. and if that happened wouldn't you loose your best evidence?\" Becky reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn opened her mouth to argue but the argument died on her lips. \"That... is true. What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky clapped her hands together. \"Well as long as I don't cancel it then she will be unaware of our little investigation, but well, if I don't use him and he still has the license we could get in trouble. Oh Quinnie I just don't know what to do.\" Your jaw dropped as soon as you realized what was happening, somehow she was convincing them that she had to keep you 'for the better' and fooling them into thinking she didn't want to. Quinn was even wavering and Morgan and Avary seemed to be completely on board with the idea. \"Oh but you're worried about me loosing him... well hmmm.\" She pressed her finger to her lips \"Oh I know, I'll make sure to spend weekends here and Little B-Hunter can be however he wants then. after all he's still got a room here it's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was suffering from whiplash of confusion at how fast Becky was running through her ideas, she was sure that her mother hated tiny guys she was always trying to get rid of them. But for some reason there was no fault in her logic, if she cancelled Isabella would probably instate the general use back and if she had it but didn't use it Becky could get in legal trouble. She looked over at you, wondering how many tiny guys had been put in a similar situation. \"I-i get it but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky cut her off \"Quinn, what is there to 'but' about are you going to tell me all that talk about caring for tiny guys is just lip service and you'd rather keep <b>one</b> little guy out of trouble and let who knows how many just have the fate you are trying to keep him from and you had the chance to prevent it.\" You wanted to speak up but... that was a masterful use of convincing someone using their own ideals and honestly you had no argument either, if this was all an elaborate ruse just to get you it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn looked down \"O-okay but, I'm going to check with him every week. and I'll help the investigation.\" She moved to the side as did the other two girls, Quinn mouthed 'I'm sorry' at you as Becky stepped up to tower over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made the right choice girls, I'll be back next Saturday with all the starting info.\" She said leaning down and pinching you between her fingers, still not talking to you directly. You were tucked into her giant cleavage cutting you off from the rest of the conversation, you didn't even get to say anything. There was a jiggling as you were smothered by the soft melons and in a few minutes you were pulled out, she was standing in front of her car with the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure was a surprise, well I suppose I should thank you but well, I don't need to thank my belongings.\" She didn't stop smiling, as if she didn't think anything differently of talking to you like that and talking sweetly to her daughter. She had started yanking you out, pulling until you were a simple tan square and then pulled you over the seat of her car. The speed she did it didn't give you any time to cope with the pain before her gargantuan cheeks where descending on you, barely contained in the jeans she was wearing. As she started the car you cried out internally for someone to save you from this crazy woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The car journey was unpleasant, to say the least. You spent the whole half hour of the journey smeared over the car seat underneath your cruel new owner. Her massive bubble butt covered every square inch of the seat, and subsequently you, and the rough fibres of her jeans ground against you every time she shifted to get comfortable, or went over a bump in the road, or even when she pressed down particularly hard on a peddle. Any time her glutes tensed, you were pressed hard into the fabric of her seat, which would normally have been a soft cushion that would have made the journey a bit more bearable, but it had been worn down over years of use by Becky and any cushion it had left was compressed down under the weight of the immensely curvy woman on top of it, so it offered you no respite from the crushing weight on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of crushing, you felt the car come to a stop. The crushing weight of Becky\u2019s rear was removed as she stood up and, without even sparing you a glance, began to peel you off the seat. She hadn\u2019t been sat on you long, but her monumental behind had done a lot of damage to your flattened form. It took her several good tugs to free you. After which she finally looked down at you, her plump, full lips curled in a look of mild irritation that made you slightly scared, this was the first time her smile had broken since you had first seen her. The look barely lasted a second before she looked ahead and her beaming smile returned. You tried to turn your attention to what she was looking at, but before you could she stuffed you back into the cramped confines of her cleavage. You were once again immersed in her slightly sweaty cleavage. As she began to walk towards wherever it was she was going, her breasts, seemingly unrestricted by her bra, began to bounce and jiggle, pummelling your flattened form and making you feel almost like you were seasick. You were buried deep down in her cleavage that no part of you was visible to the outside world.<br>\r\nAfter a short walk the jiggling masses seemed to slow their intensity as she appeared to stop moving. You heard her greet someone before a female voice answered her, familiar but you couldn\u2019t place where you knew it from. You were suddenly compressed as the breasts surrounding you met another, smaller than hers but still immense to you, pair of breasts as the two women hugged each other.<br>\r\nYou heard a door close as Becky followed the mystery woman into what you assume was her home.<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of walking you felt a sense of weightlessness as your captor dropped down onto a couch, before the breasts surrounding you slapped together as she landed, smashing you even flatter.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get him,\u201d you heard the mystery woman ask. Who was this woman, and why was she so interested in you?<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I retrieved my property. Quinnie was very reluctant to give it over but I managed to convince her and her little friends by giving a story about me keeping it close and using it being the best way to bring that \u2018evil notary\u2019 to justice,\u201d she said with a laugh. You didn\u2019t like how she was referring to you as an \u2018it\u2019, you realise she still hadn\u2019t referred to you as a person. <br>\r\nAs the two women laughed you heard the muffled sounds of a third person entering the room.<br>\r\n\u201cAh you\u2019re here,\u201d the third woman spoke up as she saw Becky. \u201cCan we see him? I\u2019d love to rub this in.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she said that you felt the fingers of your captor wrap around your flattened form before fishing you out of her cleavage. You were unceremoniously dumped onto the coffee table of the living room that you could now see you were in, and sitting on the couch with Becky, grinning evilly down at you, were the last two people you wanted to see, Isabella and Rachel, the two women who had put you in this situation in the first place! <br>\r\n\u201cSurprised? I\u2019d be surprised if you weren\u2019t,\u201d Rachel smiled down at you with a look of smug satisfaction.<br>\r\n\u201cLet us clue you in,\u201d Isabella had a similar expression to Rachel, but hers was also partially an expression that showed happiness at a job well done. \u201cYou see, after you disrespected Rachel like you did at the beach we were both pissed. So for our little payback to go off without any blowback on us I had to do my diligence. I saw that with just giving you the general usage license you wouldn\u2019t get the full punishment you deserved, since your roommates seem so sympathetic to you little bugs, they don\u2019t see things the way we do.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she said the last part she smiled at the two women beside her.<br>\r\n\u201cSo I looked into who was connected to you in one way or the other to come up with some cruel ways to punish you with the people you know. Your mom and aunt were the front runners until we had a chance reunion with Becky at a local burger joint, Sinclair Sandwiches. We both owe Becky here quite a lot, she gave us jobs in her warehouse that helped put us both through college. So when she said that she was missing her little girl, who hadn\u2019t even told her where she lived yet, we thought we\u2019d have been cruel not to help her out,\u201d Isabella looked to Becky with a friendly smile, which Becky returned. \u201cSo I added her as a third choice for you, knowing you\u2019d jump at any choice that wasn\u2019t your ditsy, tiny recruiter aunt or your disciplinarian mother. That way Becky gets more time with her daughter and you get to spend your life as property.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you fell right into our trap,\u201d Rachel beamed. \u201cWe know your friends are probably thinking of a strategy to get this license revoked but I think you\u2019ll find that Isabella covers her tracks well, little Tony here has been serving as my thong for around a year now and no one has come looking for him yet.\u201d She emphasised this point by tugging the waistband of her underwear out from her hip from under her jeans and letting it snap back into place.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for years, even before Baker\u2019s law came into place we could make tiny guys disappear but thanks to that beautiful airhead Amy Baker we now have the law on our side when we do it,\u201d Isabella laughed. \u201cHell, the amount of tiny guys Becky here made disappear through her shipping company as well, I lost count!\u201d<br>\r\nAs she said this Becky finally spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I made quite a few of my Quinnie\u2019s little bug friends disappear by shipping them to my customers. It was all quite simple really, if a woman wanted a piece of clothing I\u2019d sometimes just take one of them, mould them into the clothing in question, dye them and spray them with something that stops them turning back to their original shape. Then they\u2019d go all the way across the country, far away from my sweet little girl. It was a win-win for me really, I keep those tiny little creatures away from my daughter and also save on buying in products on occasion to boot. Actually when I heard your name I looked through my records and I\u2019m sure that your mother and sister received a few of them,\u201d Becky\u2019s warm smile contrasted so harshly from the words leaving her mouth it made your head spin. You couldn\u2019t believe your ears, this cruel woman had sentenced countless tiny guys to serve as clothing to unaware women, and apparently some of them were even in your mom\u2019s house without anyone\u2019s knowledge!<br>\r\nBy this point in the conversation you had managed to reform yourself. You shakily stood to your feet and looked up at your three giantess tormentors.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this? And for that matter why are you doing this to me, all I did was inconvenience you slightly at the beach!\u201d As you shouted up at them Isabella and Rachel\u2019s smirks grew larger, however Becky\u2019s smile faded to a cold look. Before you could utter another word Becky\u2019s hand slapped down on you, flattening you again.<br>\r\n\u201cAs my property you would do well to remember to not speak unless asked to do so. We don\u2019t want your opinion on anything in the same way I wouldn\u2019t ask my bra it\u2019s opinion on our current situation,\u201d this was the first time you had seen Becky\u2019s warm, motherly personality shift to match the words coming from her mouth and it terrified you. She continued. \u201cAnyway as to why they are telling you this, it\u2019s to torture you with the information. Personally if it wasn\u2019t for these two I probably wouldn\u2019t have said another word to you. Since all you are is my property, an object for me to use as I see fit, after all. You\u2019re no more a person than this couch cushion, and now the law finally sees you the way you should be seen. And if you speak a word of this to my Quinnie, I\u2019ll have you shipped to Europe as a thong before anyone can figure out what happened to you!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter that they stopped acknowledging you and began to talk strategy on how to prevent your roommates from exposing Isabella and undoing all her work. Becky would continue to feign that she was helping with the investigation, while feeding information to Isabella so she could counter them. Meanwhile you were sinking deeper into despair, was this your life now? To be used as nothing more than an object by this cruel person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long series of discussions surrounding covering Isabella\u2019s illegal activities Becky scooped your flattened form up off of the table before depositing you back into her cleavage, returning you to the crushing, slightly sweaty prison between her breasts. <br>\r\nAfter a long drive home she took you out and without a word and, after removing her shirt and bra, freeing her monumental breasts, began stretching you out smearing your top half and bottom half while stretching out your limbs. She then wrapped you around her torso, the two \u201cdisks\u201d she had shaped your body into serving as the cups of the bra she had turned you into. With that she slipped a nightshirt over you and went to bed. This was going to be a long week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the next weekend rolls around, what has happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Isabella has made it difficult for the girls to figure out how to free you.<br>\r\n2) The girls have made some progress but not a lot.<br>\r\n3) Isabella is struggling to keep the girls at bay, freedom may be within sight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Racheal mercilessly squeezed the air out from your soft squishy body for leisure while removing her highly priced designer sunglasses. Her pale blue eyes captured your attention after witnessing them for the first time behind the shades. She stared back, giving an ominous smile of response at how you almost outwitted her. \"That was a clever trick, little guy. You almost had me going there. But I'm done delaying, and we both know it's time for what you're only worthy of,\" Racheal replied arrogantly with a smirk, reminding you of the dominance she held. You were immensely intimidated, struggling harder to escape her grasp. She was way out of your league of expertise to bicker with further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, keep fighting! I adore when you little men think you're capable of escaping. Although, try best to keep some of that feeling for when I have you wrapped around me.\" Racheal moaned softly with pleasure, biting the temple tip of her sunglasses over your exertion. You watched her swiftly stand, body glistening in the sun from sweat. She disregarded Tony's cry of agony being engrossed by her enormous ass from the action. She waved over to Isabella, showing you off as a new trophy to her best friend. Isabella playfully nodded with a humorous sigh accompanied by giggling as you recognized she clearly understood Racheal's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Racheal's mood transformed from serious businesswomen to a cheery teen. \"You see that, little lifeguard! Tomorrow Isabella will fix up a friendly usage license for you privately for my pleasure. But why should I wait when you have a beautiful date with my ass already,\" Racheal expressed snickering, bringing you in front of her big ass to witness as she gave it a jaunty slap. You were terrified, overhearing Tony's sob as her colossal butt jiggled widely against him as she entered the changing area. The room packed with girls undressing as Racheal brought you over towards her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the first thing I need is to smooth you out.\" Racheal gleefully announced, by performing a ruff sculpting of you out with her butt. You felt suffocated as she stretched you by the arms and legs. \"Hold on, do I want you to be facing my ass rather than my pussy?\" Racheal uttered in turmoil as she squished you back up to try again. \"Nah, I liked the way I had you the first time,\" She laughed, halfway finished before starting over a third time. You were in constant agony as Racheal divided your body into sections until finally settling on your design. You tried screaming, lying helpless in your new form. But Racheal put a quick stop by pinching your lips shut before shimmying Tony off her body. You watched her wickedly smile, twirling him around her finger like nothing. \" Well, I won't be needing Tony anymore. But it is a shame for him to go to waste?\"  asked, looking at you, not that she would consider what you lectured to aid him. You watched in horror as Racheal took Tony over to another girl's bikini bottoms laid out and switched him off with them. Racheal was unarguably cruel, showing no tolerance for your kind. \"There we go,\" she grinned, as you both watch a teenage girl pass, sliding Tony on unaware. \"Man, is my ass getting bigger?\" the girl questioned,  striving to fix Tony from being an annoying wedgie in her butt but decided to give up and enjoy the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, he's already found a new owner. I'll leave his license behind so she won't have issues later. But as for you!\" Racheal replied, standing over you, removing her earrings. \"You know, I got this excellent tip from my one of my girlfriend's that bands or rings help keep you guys in a structure better, and since I only have my jewelry, I'll have to use them.\" She said, fastening your arms and legs apart to wrap them tightly on her bangles. Racheal's face showed you she must be loving how you were turning out. She didn't seem to offer much care for your howls of pain in the final process. \"You turned out gorgeous! But what this?\" she screamed, lowering you down in place, seeing your erection. Your eyes widen, wanting to explain. But her massive ass was inches away as she inserted both legs and fastened you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Racheal's ass immediately consumed your face, stretching you out to a thin strip that halted tightly against her butt hole and slid your dick inside her. \"umm, yes, I love it,\" she utters, molding you off. She could feel you helplessly fighting against her as she went back out to the beach, continue tanning. You fought as best you could, feeling her ass sweat trickle down. She even managed to massage your dick with her thighs. You hoped one of the other lifeguards might come looking for you soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your optimistic attitude held for the first hour of your brand-new job. Though the sun was bright and hot, the water rolling in from the sea was cool, and the windy breeze steady. Not a single person\u2019s life came anywhere near danger, and peace reigned in your little tiny section of Sanderson Beach. A few guys wanted pointers on swim techniques, and another tiny accidentally lost his miniature wallet, so you handled those minimal issues with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as time crept past that first hour mark, you kept hearing rumbling sounds in the distance, like an engine blaring. You assumed it was someone\u2019s souped-up motorcycle in the parking lot, until you realized that it was actually coming from the direction of the ocean, not behind you outside of the beach. Leaning forward in your chair, you squinted off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you spotted what appeared to be a rather large speedboat piloted by two wild sorority girls. It was racing up along the shore, bouncing along the waves and splashing water in its wake. Worryingly, the speedboat was quite close to the beach, and in genuine danger of hitting a swimmer or surfer who couldn\u2019t move out of the way in time. Worse still, from what you could spot (your vision was quite good), the driver of the speedboat seemed intoxicated out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to your feet in a panic, you thought frantically about what to do, wondering how someone of your size could possibly make a difference. Still, acting almost without thinking, you leapt from your lifeguard stand down onto the sand, and ran out into the middle of the tiny section. You motioned frantically to all of your fellow tinies, signaling them to group up near the middle of the tiny section. If any disaster struck (though you were still unsure of what that would entail) you would be ready. In minutes, all fifty or so tiny guys had grouped up around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and a loud voice cried out from far off to your left. \u201cHEY! STOP THAT BOAT! STOP THAT BOAT RIGHT NOW!\u201d The voice yelled loudly and forcefully. You jerked to follow the sound of the voice, tracing it all the way to Quinn over at the middle tower, some hundred yards away. She was standing and pointing while holding her megaphone up to her mouth. She looked furious, terrifyingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls in the boat clearly heard her, and thankfully had just enough common sense to stop their drunken antics. However, before powering down their boat, they steered it closer to shore. The driver whipped the boat around in a hairpin turn while haphazardly docking the boat, and the rear end of the speedboat dug into the waves, dredging up a considerably forceful wake. This explosion of water, which took the form of a wave, surged out from behind the boat\u2026and right towards the tiny section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the fifty other tinies did nothing but stare in abject shock and horror as the surging water from the speedboat\u2019s reckless turn surged towards the shore. Though no more than two feet in height in actuality, that scale was more than enough to qualify as a tidal wave disaster, and as the wave hit the beach and pressed on up, it showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to crawl though, and in those final moments, you noted several things. One: you took note of how every normal-sized beach goer around the tiny section had their eyes firmly on the antics of the boat and on Quinn, not on the tiny section crisis. Two: you similarly noted that Quinn was too busy marching towards the drunk girls and their boat, angry beyond belief at their potentially life-threatening joyride, and she didn\u2019t notice what was going on in the tiny section either. Three: you numbly reconsidered that ramifications of clumping all the tinies in the section into one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to unfreeze, the tidal wave hit, and all hell broke loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the other gathered tinies became a confused mess of screaming and panicking as the wave scooped all of you up into its cold, merciless embrace. You were all knocked off your feet and sent spiraling into different directions. Some tinies were tossed aside to relative safety, some coasted along the cusp of the wave, and some were submerged fully in the salty depths. Of course, the only logical course of action for an outgoing wave was to wash back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water was pulled back into the sea, at least forty of the gathered tinies went with it, you included. Your screaming and cries of terror continued, a chorus of horrified tinies echoing out in unison. Sadly, your paltry noises were just about entirely muffled by the simple crashing of the wave, and were definitely imperceptible to anyone close by. Quinn\u2019s fury over at the boat was still the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your superior stamina and skills in swimming, you managed to stay afloat at the crest of the wave, and were finally deposited right on the water\u2019s edge. Coughing and sputtering, you wiped saltwater from your eyes and watched in horror as at least thirty other tinies were swept away into the ocean. Though only a few feet out from shore at most, that distance was miles in terms of a tiny\u2019s perspective. You were stricken with grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat grief gave way to something much more when you heard voices from behind you a minute later. Though faint at first, your ears eventually picked up the distinct sound of laughter. Turning around, your eyes widened, nearly bulging out from your sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of three giantesses, towering high, were strolling directly towards the tiny section, laughing and smiling. You took a step to move towards your lifeguard stand and retrieve your megaphone to yell up at them, assuming that they were also distracted by the boat incident and weren\u2019t noticing the clear signs that signaled the tiny section of Sanderson Beach. However, you only took one step before freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour megaphone wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. For that matter, neither was the entire lifeguard stand itself. For that matter, neither were any of the spikes in the sand, or the bright red rope that cordoned off the tiny section. The wave had picked them all up, dragged them across the sand, and swept them away to sea. Every single discernible marker for the tiny section was gone. Those three girls weren\u2019t ignoring the tiny section\u2026they didn\u2019t know it existed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s never a spot empty this close to the shore!\u201d The oldest giantess, a brunette woman probably around thirty or so, exclaimed, smiling warmly. \u201cWhat a perfect day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl, a blonde roughly twenty years old, shrugged. \u201cJust don\u2019t get me wet while getting out of the water. It\u2019ll ruin my tan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman laughed heartily. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on leaving that water for quite a few hours, sweetheart. I came here to swim, after all.\u201d She gestured proudly to her swimsuit of choice, and you gaped at her body. For a moment, you forgot all about your plight and the fates of the tiny section patrons, and your entire world became ogling the woman\u2019s curvy, hourglass figured body. She was wearing nothing but a skimpy string bikini top and bottom, that looked more like strands of floss pressing against her smooth bronzed flesh than real clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger giantess rolled her eyes and began rolling out a towel to lie down on. As she did so, you watched a tiny get buried under her heel, and then another hidden beneath the towel. As the girl kneeled on her towel, she stripped off her two-piece and lathered tanning lotion on herself. You couldn\u2019t help but watch, though you felt awful at secretly observing a naked giantess stranger. You justified this staring when you spotted an unfortunate tiny be mashed under the girl\u2019s breast as she lied out on her stomach to begin tanning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken from your staring by thunderous footsteps, you dove to the side as the older woman ran into the ocean with glee. Two more tinies found themselves molded into the sand by the woman\u2019s heel as she ran, and then a cascade of water rained down as the thick giantess splashed into the sea. One tiny was left mangled in her aftermath, but with his head above the sand, so you walked over to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reach him, though, the third giantess, a young brown-haired girl about ten years old, skipped happily up towards you, bucket in hand. Without noticing you at all, she swept her bucket through the sand, and scooped up the poor tiny you were going to save right into her plastic bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling gleefully, the girl trotted several steps away. \u201cThis is gonna be the best sandcastle ever!\u201d She laughed, and then dumped the bucket contents out. You could just barely see the tiny fall into the pile of sand, and you could also make out at least three other tinies caught up in the young child\u2019s building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at the curvaceous giantess in the water, your jaw dropped open at the sight before you. The woman had stood up for a second, the water up to her quite massive buttocks. Her stringy, barely-there thong had shifted a bit, revealing her full butt crack to the world. The woman was in the midst of adjusting her wardrobe when a wave washed a frantically paddling tiny right into her ass. You could only watch as the woman snapped her thong back into her crack, smiled, and swam off, totally oblivious to the passenger she was now carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of the world on your shoulders was crushing. One look far down the beach showed Quinn dragging the drunken sorority sisters off to Brigitte\u2019s office, confirming that she would be of no help to you. Saving the tinies now suffering was the sole job for you, and one that you now had to face with steely resolve. You were a tiny lifeguard, dammit. Time to guard the lives of tinies!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking from girl to girl, your mind flip flopped between the decisions that laid before you. None of these tasks would be easy, but you had to pick one. First you ruled out the tiny guys stuck in the sandcastle, unfortunately. You know based on experience that dealing with young girls was one of the riskiest things you could do as a tiny guy. More often than not they didn\u2019t understand the ramifications of messing with you guys, and it was practically impossible to get them to see reason. With a sigh you wrote that off, at least for now. Now looking at the tanning giantess, you briefly considered approaching her. But upon closer inspection you saw that she had put in bluetooth earbuds while you were looking away! Getting her attention would be nearly impossible through sound alone, and digging around underneath her breasts to save another guy seemed like a surefire way to get called a pervert or simply get smashed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back and looking into the water, you saw the older woman had already made it a fair bit off the shore. You knew for certain it was her, as her comically oversized butt was somehow sticking out of the water while she swam. The mere 30 feet or so she had gone may as well have been an entire ocean to you, inducing enough fear in you to give up on the last of the possible rescue operations. But then, fate seemed to smile upon you for the first time that day, as another girl walked up a bit to your side. Turning and looking at the woman, you could tell that she wasn\u2019t the typical beachgoing type. She was wearing a massively oversized t-shirt as well as a shady hat, practically blocking her entire body from the sun. Even so you could tell based on the outlines underneath her shirt that she was seemingly well-endowed. Now typically, another giantess encroaching on what should have been the tiny guys\u2019 section would have struck more fear into your heart. But when you saw what this mystery girl had in your hands, you practically jumped for joy instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hands was a relatively small RC boat and a controller! She approached the water, with the now gentle waves lapping gently at her toes. You knew immediately that enlisting this girl\u2019s help was your only hope. You walked up behind her, and shouted up to her. Without your megaphone, you weren\u2019t as commandingly loud as you wished you were, but nevertheless she turned around. Although it seemed to be completely random when it worked and when it didn\u2019t, the shrinking epidemic still did come with an inexplicable ability for regular sized girls to hear the voices of shrunken guys\u2026 at least when the girls weren\u2019t too distracted. Truth be told nobody knew when it would work and when it wouldn\u2019t, but thankfully this seemed to be one of the times when it worked in your favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey down there little dude, I hope I didn\u2019t step on ya.\u201d The girl noticed you rather quickly, your small but bright red lifeguard uniform standing out among the yellow sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh no you\u2019re fine, but please, I need your help! I\u2019m actually a lifeguard here, there were a ton of guys in this section and we all just got hit by that huge wave caused by those reckless girls a few minutes ago! Long story short, I saw a tiny guy get carried by the wave\u2026 right into that woman\u2019s butt out there.\u201d You rambled on to the girl, not wanting to waste any time trying to explain the existence of the men\u2019s only section of the beach. Every second wasted was another second that guy had to suffer between the swimming giantess\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah that\u2019s crazy\u201d the girl exclaimed, looking out at the woman you pointed at. \u201cYou talking about that lady with the enormous butt?\u201d She said while pointing directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes that one! Please just--\u201d you tried to plead but she interrupted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly it\u2019s kind of absurd how big it is. First that lifeguard down the beach, now this lady. I mean I thought my butt was pretty big but compared to them sheesh. How is it even sticking out of the water like that while she sw--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMISS PLEASE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE\u201d you shouted up to interrupt her tangent. In any other situation you would have joked around with her for sure, but every second counted. \u201cI know this is weird but if I ride in your boat can you drive me up to the woman out there?! If you pull up alongside her maybe I can jump out onto her and rescue the guy!\u201d You explained your plan to the girl, while she put on an amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do once you get there, it seems more likely than not that you\u2019ll just slip between those oversized cheeks and get trapped in there as well.\u201d The girl picked apart your plan easily, causing you to briefly rethink it. But as she talked, she gently placed her boat down into the water, and grabbed you in her now free hand, dropping you off in the driver\u2019s seat. Before you could change your plan, she continued, \u201cBut honestly that plan sounds so rad I have to see it happen! It\u2019s like a real life movie! Let\u2019s hit it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream out at the last second, but the girl hit the throttle at max speed, sending you and her RC boat skimming across the water. The hard plastic of the seat was rough on your body, but you had to admit it felt kind of cool riding in a \u201cvehicle\u201d that fit you for once. You snapped back to reality when you saw the ass of the swimming giantess on the horizon like some sort of bubble-shaped, moving island. In a matter of seconds, the speedy RC boat pulled up alongside the woman. Now seeing up close just how powerful the movement of this woman\u2019s massive legs was, you gulped with fear. Your new friend\u2019s cautionary words against your plan rung in your head as well, but it was too late to turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up you steadied yourself on the edge of the boat precariously. Now praying to every god you knew of you prepared to make the heroic leap, and get this rescue mission underway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does it go?</span></div></div>",

As such, your newfound friend back on the shore had to keep the RC boat stable alongside the oblivious swimming woman, close enough for you to reach her but not so close as to actually smack into the woman and hurt her. Frankly, your partner in all of this was doing an amazing job, and you made a mental note to thank her upon your (hopeful) safe return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the situation at hand was what commanded most of your attention. The woman\u2019s massive derriere was even more gigantic up-close, nearly the size of Quinn\u2019s meteoric rear end. Each cheek was like a globe of tanned, jiggly flesh, the woman\u2019s smooth and supple skin on full display thanks to her ludicrously immodest thong bottoms. Noting them, you realized they had shifted once more, pried a few inches back from the cavernous abyss of her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a final deep breath, and sending some prayers up to whatever deity of fate would listen to you, you leapt from the prow of the RC boat, kicking off with all of your might and flinging out your hands to grab onto the woman. Time seemed to slow to a crawl as you soared through the air towards the woman\u2019s booty, though the distance was a scant few inches, and the actual time it took no more than two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColliding with the woman\u2019s squishy butt cheek almost ended your rescue attempt immediately. Your tiny body bounced off of her plump cheek, ricocheting backwards while rolling along her slick skin. You scrambled like mad, desperately digging your hands into her flesh for any support to stop your momentum. Thankfully, the woman was so well-developed that her doughy cheek was easy to grab, that you soon caught yourself and steadied your position on top of her right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still swimming though, so you couldn\u2019t relax. Her quick speed caused jets of water to spray up into your eyes, and her overall speed threatened to send you flying off behind her if you relaxed your grip too much. This was to say nothing of the up and down motion of the waves rocking the woman like an unending rollercoaster. You felt a bit of nausea in your stomach, but you pushed onward, determined to not leave your fellow tiny trapped and alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to your side, you saw the RC boat peel away and drive back to shore, no doubt returning to its owner who knew you had jumped by now. All alone in your mission from this point on, you began army-crawling across the woman\u2019s thick butt cheek, one fistful of doughy flesh at a time to pull you along. The wetness of her skin helped to slide you faster towards the giantesses\u2019 awaiting butt crack, and in another minute, you were peering over the edge down into the dark canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was no trace of the tiny you\u2019d come to rescue, so that ruled out the possibility of this being a quick and easy rescue. Sighing, and wishing nothing terrible would come of this, you let yourself roll off the top of the woman\u2019s right cheek, sliding down the inside of her ass cheek and plummeting inside of her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the space to move grew smaller and smaller inside of her ass, you were eventually able to brace yourself by pushing your legs into her squishy left cheek and hold your back up against her right cheek. It was significantly darker by now, about halfway into this woman\u2019s ass crack, and you couldn\u2019t immediately see any sign of the guy you\u2019d come so far to rescue. Chances were, if he was really stuck, he\u2019d be blending in quite well with the woman\u2019s fairly neutral tan skin tone. Heaven help him if he\u2019d already been pulled fully inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat. \u201cHey, are you in here? Anyone stuck here?\u201d You called out to the darkness. A particularly rough wave hit the woman then, shaking her and jostling her jiggly butt thoroughly. You yelped and slid in another inch before managing to hold yourself in a bracing stance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet voice answered you. \u201c\u2026yes. I\u2019m in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in surprise and relief. \u201cOh, awesome! In that case, my name is Hunter, and I\u2019m here to rescue you!\u201d Another jostling shake almost toppled you again, but you held steady. \u201cI can\u2019t see you though. How stuck are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply was still quiet. \u201c\u2026only my head is free. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey! It\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019ll try to follow your voice.\u201d You replied, suddenly realizing exactly how\u2026young\u2026the voice you were hearing was. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name? And how old are you, if I can ask that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice took a second to reply, delaying you in following them to their location. \u201cMy name is Brady\u2026and I\u2019m twelve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced. Only twelve? This kid was way too young to be smushed inside of a curvaceous woman\u2019s rear end, smeared so flat only his head could reform. From the trembling in his voice, this was the first time something this drastic had happened to him, a fact you sympathized with but also were a little jealous of (for comparison, fate had it out for you ever since you were a little child).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Brady. I\u2019m coming. We\u2019ll get through this, I promise you.\u201d You kept talking while you followed Brady\u2019s voice, inching your way a bit deeper into the woman\u2019s monumentally sized ass. It grew darker, danker, and a bit smellier, but eventually you felt Brady\u2019s squished body with your hands. You\u2019d made it to him, and as you feared, he was well and truly glued in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get to work on freeing him, you felt the entire world around you shake and rumble. Jamming your hands and feet into the woman\u2019s doughy cheeks, you cried out from the strain of holding yourself as the woman shifted and moved. You quickly realized that she was standing up, but for what reason, you didn\u2019t know yet. All that mattered was keeping from sliding out of her ass and falling out into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything stopped moving, the angle of the woman\u2019s crack had, of course, moved from horizontal to vertical, but the circumstance remained the same. Shifting yourself to keep your balance, you began scratching and pulling at Brady\u2019s mashed body, ever-so-slowly peeling him off of the woman\u2019s skin. The whole time, you assured him all would work out, and he incessantly thanked you for saving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the woman\u2019s ass, in the light of the sun, the woman had stopped because she was finally taking notice of her unruly swimsuit and its tendency to require readjustment. She took care of her top first, pulling the stringy fabric of her barely-there bikini into place so as to fit snuggly around her titanic tits and cover her nipples. Though stopping her swim was a nuisance, the woman couldn\u2019t help but smile at the light and heat of the sun. She loved the ocean so, so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was fixing her bikini, a second woman waded through the waves up to her, catching the first woman\u2019s attention with a friendly wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there! My name is Debbie.\u201d The second woman said, smiling brightly. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help but notice your speed and efficiency while swimming. It was perfect form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who had you and Brady in her ass laughed appreciatively. \u201cThanks. Swimming is my passion, I guess.\u201d She offered her hand to Debbie for a handshake. \u201cMy name is Lisa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Lisa.\u201d Debbie shook her hand. \u201cCare for a race? I consider myself a swimming pro too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess, named Lisa apparently, cocked an eyebrow. \u201cThat so? Heh. Might have to take you up on that offer. No holds barred, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie grinned. \u201cExactly. Fastest one out to that buoy\u2026\u201d Debbie pointed to the marker indicating the end of the safe swimming zone, far out to sea. \u201c\u2026and then back to shore wins. Loser buys ice-cream. That work for you, Lisa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s confident smile grew, and she rolled her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re on, Debbie. Let me just\u2026\u201d Lisa trailed off as she reached a hand behind her back, snagged her unruly thong, and let it snap back into place around her doughy ass, her flesh rippling from the impact. \u201c\u2026alright! All set, on your mark!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the dark confines of Lisa\u2019s ass, you\u2019d been hard at work on Brady, and had just managed to peel all of his body free when you saw the light of the sun (what few traces were visible) vanish completely as Lisa snapped her thong back into its rightful place. The rippling vibrations of her flesh a nanosecond later knocked you loose, and you slipped a few inches deeper into her butt crack before catching yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter! Are you okay?\u201d Brady exclaimed. \u201cShe just sealed us up in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Brady. And yeah, this is looking rough. Just hold in there, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, you had absolutely no idea what to do now that your only exit had been so efficiently covered up. Maybe you and Brady working together could push the thong aside and escape, but with the woman\u2019s constant moving, it\u2019d be tricky. Not to mention, if she started swimming again, it would become a chaotic hell inside of her crack. You couldn\u2019t begin to imagine keeping both yourself and Brady safe in that scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the muffled mounds of butt flesh, you just barely heard a faint voice say <i>\u201cReady? Get set. Go!\u201d, </i>and then your whole world was movement. Uh oh. Looks like you weren\u2019t getting a choice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSimple task for day one, Hunter.\u201d Brigitte explained, crossing her powerful arms in front of her chest. \u201cI need you to walk the beach, up and down. It\u2019s a two mile stretch that comprises Sanderson Beach\u2026so it\u2019ll take a while for someone of your size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but were a little confused. \u201cI can do that. Any particular reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte smiled. \u201cOf course, dude. I need you to help anyone who might be in need. Maybe someone is lost? Maybe someone lost someTHING? Maybe a kid wants a friend to play with for an hour? Maybe someone wants a quick lesson in proper swimming postures?\u201d Brigitte shrugged casually. \u201cIt could really be anything. You never know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay. Thanks for the heads up!\u201d You said. You were about to turn and end the conversation when your new boss held up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! One catch first, man.\u201d She sat back down and leaned forward in her chair, steepling her fingers. \u201cI need to hear you tell me exactly who you helped and what you did for them at the end of today\u2019s shift. If you didn\u2019t help out at least one person\u2026\u201d She made a cutting motion with her hand across her throat. \u201c\u2026the deal\u2019s off. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightest bit nervous, you nodded anyway. \u201cO-of course! Got it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then!\u201d Brigitte beamed, then turned her expression on Quinn. \u201cQuinn, girl, go ahead out. Drop Hunter off when you make it to the middle tower. He\u2019s on his own from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn dipped her head almost imperceptibly. \u201cOf course. See you later.\u201d With that, your black-haired roommate turned on her heel and strode out of the door. You clung to her thumb to avoid falling off her palm, especially as the flat pavement gave way to the sandy dunes of Sanderson Beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beating down like crazy today, and the temperature was quite sweltering. Thankfully, you\u2019d lathered up in a bit of sunscreen earlier, and because of your small size, the slightest breeze felt like a storming wind. Thus, you kept cool relatively easily. Still, you were surprised how packed the beach was for still being before noon. Apparently, everyone else was willing to brave the weather for a nice and relaxing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Quinn reached the base of the middle tower, she gently lowered you to the ground. With relief, you found the sand to be just firm enough to hold your weight without you sinking in. It was still an overwhelming experience to look out from the ground all around the beach. It was like a vast desert wonderland\u2026or perhaps wasteland was the better term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up at Quinn, you shielded your eyes from the sun and gave her a thumbs up. Surprisingly, Quinn returned your thumbs up, before sliding on sunglasses and scaling the ladder up to the top of the middle lifeguard tower. You were momentarily distracted (for the third time in less than an hour) by the sight of Quinn\u2019s magnificently shapely butt bounce as she climbed the ladder, and then you began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it wasn\u2019t much more than a speck in the distance, you could make out the right tower. If you had to guess, it was a little less than a mile away. Once reaching that tower, your plan was to double back, pass the middle tower, and then hit the left tower. You would then have completed one and a half laps across the beach, and taking your size into account, it would probably be time to go home by then. Hopefully you would have helped at least one person by then, and maybe even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first five minutes of walking were simple and easy. Because of your size, walking across the sand was more like walking on normal ground, just with a few small hills and valleys every so often. It wasn\u2019t too bad, all things considered, though it was a little disheartening to turn around and see the comparably small distance you\u2019d covered from the middle tower in that time. Still, your whole life had prepared you for this, and you had more than enough stamina and endurance to keep up a good pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first troubling encounter happened after fifteen minutes. You had been walking in the direction of a woman who seemed nervous, and she was glancing around. Inferring that she was in need of a lifeguard such as yourself, you doubled your speed towards the woman, growing closer by the second. However, this single-minded drive to reach the woman had the obvious downside of blinding you to everything else in your peripheral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, you were caught completely off guard when a young girl came sprinting by, laughing and giggling. Like a truck slamming into you, the little girl\u2019s foot crashed down onto you, her petite heel digging into your body. In the blink of an eye, you were crushed flat. The girl\u2019s weight also indented the sand around your body, leaving a curved imprint in the ground. When she took another step and raced off, you were left stuck to the ground by the pressure, though thankfully not too crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was only slightly relieving, as a second later, the girl\u2019s titanic mother strolled above you, her giant feet on either side of you. She was calling out to her daughter in an amused tone, warning her to slow down. While you were still reforming, the mother, never once looking down, rolled her eyes at her daughter\u2019s antics and then unfurled a towel from her bag. She then began to spread the towel out\u2026directly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on by this horrifying sight, you focused all your efforts and popped back into 3D, but you were a millisecond too late. The towel, a large, fluffy thing decorated in flower patterns, descending, falling over all of the ground around you like a veil from above. It touched the sand, forcing you onto your stomach, but thankfully not squishing you. You were still able to crawl along your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, crawl you did. You dashed madly along the coarse sands, scrambling like a demon-possessed crab. You had no idea where you were going in the darkness, but finally a sliver of light revealed itself. Pushing out into the light, you popped out from under the towel, and basked in the sunlight. A moment of reflection revealed that you had lost your shirt, probably when scrambling under the towel. It must\u2019ve ripped off. At least you still had your red swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, you saw the woman who had inadvertently thrown such a wrench into your day settle down onto her towel and pull out a novel to read. Looking away from her, you glumly saw the woman you had been intending to help all along graciously receiving aid from Quinn, of all people. In reality, you were still no more than fifty yards from the middle tower, and so your roommate had taken it upon herself to help out the nervous woman. She had no clue she\u2019d robbed you of your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also had no clue that you were so close, a fact evidenced by how close she came to stomping on you as she walked back towards the tower. You had tried to call out to her, only for your voice to be drowned out by a cawing seagull. As such, you had dove to the side to avoid her powerful stride, and watched as she sauntered on by, presumably off to help someone else in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beginning to dawn on you that perhaps signing on to be a lifeguard was a bad idea, but you were far from ready to throw in the towel yet. You had to prove yourself to Brigitte and Quinn that you were capable of doing this. You had to prove to YOURSELF that you were a strong and dependable tiny that people could rely on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for another thirty minutes, never once giving up on scanning your surroundings for people in need or threats to your safety. Twice more you spotted someone who looked like they could use assistance, but after having to dodge someone stepping on you, found that Quinn had made it to them first. It was beginning to tick you off, but you were angrier at fate for being cruel than your roommate for just doing her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you came upon a group of college-aged girls rounding up enough volunteers to start a volleyball game. None of them looked like they needed help, so you kept walking, but you were quite distracted by just how beautiful the girls were, and how revealing their swimsuits were too. There were seven gorgeous giantesses gathered on the sandy court by the volleyball net, and they seemed to be looking for one more to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you heard pounding footsteps coming from behind you. Eyes widening in panic, you whirled around to face another girl who was running towards you at top speed. She had an excited expression on her face, and her eyes were locked fully on the volleyball group behind you. You realized that she was probably going to join them as their eighth player. You also realized how oblivious this girl was to your existence, and how close her pounding feet were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing up in a panic, you willed yourself to dodge out of the way of her slamming feet and find safety. How successful are you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(name changed from Becky to Betty to avoid future confusion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, though you only tensed up for a split second, it was exactly that moment of hesitation that cost you. You dove to the side to avoid the girl\u2019s foot, but a bit too late. Her powerful stride carrying her forward at a fast pace, the girl didn\u2019t feel a thing as her big toe slammed into your miniscule body. Already moving to try to avoid her, the impact sent you flying twice as fast and far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around in circles, your limbs flailing, and your cries of shock drowned out by the wind, your bug-sized body sailed through the air with ease. Flying another twenty yards down the beach, a strong breeze carried you an additional distance alongside the oblivious girl\u2019s knockout kick. While she happily joined the other college girls for an exciting game of volleyball, you were quite literally tossed aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you came to a landing, impacting rather roughly onto the plush red towel of some beach goer. The impact flattened your body, but you soon began reforming. Popping back to normal shape, you sat up and took notice of the giantess beside you, who was digging around for something in her bag, her back to you. She looked to be in her thirties, and was quite beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think of speaking up (or before you could decide if you even wanted to speak up, or just keep walking), the woman swore under her breath and turned around. However, her eyes didn\u2019t scan your miniscule body, and were instead behind you. Turning your head, you noted a second bag behind you, and also realized just how large this towel was, spread out to its full length. It was probably accommodating two people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was hardly a pressing concern though, as the woman shuffled over to the second bag, sliding her knees along the towel. Not wanting to be steamrolled by her, you scrambled out of the way, just barely avoiding her. You rolled aside, dodging her knee, but the woman\u2019s foot still slapped into your body, knocking you off balance and onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from that, you vaguely took note of the woman retrieve a pair of sunglasses from the second bag, smile victoriously, and put them on her face. She then shuffled back towards you, but you were far enough away that her legs and feet weren\u2019t close to crushing you. Feeling safe, you rolled onto your back and pushed yourself up to your feet. Clearing your throat in preparation to talk to this woman and ask if she needed help, you paused to catch your breath and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same breath came out in a sputtering gasp, causing you to cough. In the seconds you\u2019d been looking away, the woman had casually undone the straps of her bikini behind her back, and was now lying her top down. She was utterly naked from the waist up, and her gigantic boobs swayed gently as she smiled and stretched. Her perky tits then began to get closer and closer, and some muted part of your brain screamed at you that she was lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat muted part didn\u2019t matter much, and you merely stood there, slack-jawed, as the gorgeous woman laid out on her towel. Her left breast, gargantuan in size, crashed down onto you, smooth pillowy flesh smooshing you flatter than a pancake. The weight crushed you down, molding your miniscule body into a blobby shape beneath her tit. The pain and the pleasure of the situation fought for control over your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain won out, especially as the woman wiggled a bit to get comfortable, her hefty breasts dragging across the soft towel back and forth, copious flesh jiggling substantially. Her left boob ground you to dust beneath her, the weight and pressure easily enough to smear your pathetic little body. In seconds, the woman smudged you into a smear on her flesh, your own body easily sticking to her own, especially with the faint layer of sweat already accumulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you felt the woman stop moving, and knew that she had finally gotten comfortable. By now, your moral and logical senses had returned, but it was far too late now. All you could do was feel immense shame that you\u2019d let yourself be crushed because you were too busy ogling a naked giantess. Of course, you also felt pain and discomfort, but that was to be expected. You were buried entirely beneath her breast, no light or air reaching you. You were just under her nipple, and sticking to her more and more each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate, however, actually decided to throw you some semblance of a bone. At that moment, the woman\u2019s good friend (who you had inferred to exist) returned from the brief errand she\u2019d run off to do. Walking up to the towel, she grinned and waved a modest-sized bottle in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose! I got the suntan oil at the beach shop!\u201d The woman said cheerily. \u201cCan\u2019t believe we forgot our own.\u201d She finally made it to the towel and plopped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of what she had said went unnoticed by you, as the majority of sounds from the outside world were a muffled, muted mess. The woman lying on you, apparently named Rose, had breasts easily heavy and plump enough to bury you so thoroughly that sounds were blocked out. However, you could feel the vibrations of the other woman as she sat, and you were able to hear Rose\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice. Bout time.\u201d Rose replied, sleepily. She yawned. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve needed this day to relax and tan. Stephanie drives me crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman laughed. \u201cReally? I think your daughter is a perfect little angel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose laughed and sighed, the action causing her breasts the vibrate, hot flesh slapping against your body. \u201cYou only say that because your own kid is away at college, Betty. Stephanie can be a monster if she\u2019s throwing a tantrum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman, Betty, smiled, and began shaking the bottle of tanning oil. \u201cIf you say so, Rose. But yes, you\u2019re right. This day will certainly be heavenly for the two of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose, knowing she needed to fully lather up before drifting off to sleep, managed to pull herself back up into a sitting position. Stuck as you were to her tit, all you could see was darkness, but you could once more feel fresh air and the sun on your back. You did have to fight the urge to not vomit though, as the act of Rose sitting up caused her prodigious chest to shake gratuitously, jostling you around as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then! Hit me! Lather me up!\u201d Rose said, spreading her arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty rolled her eyes. \u201cUgh, Rose, what are you? Ten? We\u2019re both adults, and we both know that after I lather you up, you\u2019ll fall asleep before doing me! Don\u2019t you know how hard it is to rub that oil in all the right spots by myself?\u201d Betty, with a faint blush, gestured to her curvy body, comparable in size to Rose\u2019s own hourglass figure. Their developed bodies made sense, as they were both in their thirties, but you couldn\u2019t help but notice how many gorgeous giantesses life kept throwing you at (literally, in this case).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose only grinned, lowered her sunglasses, and winked at Betty. Betty groaned, but knew it was no use arguing with stubborn Rose. Sliding closer to her friend, Betty popped the cap on the tanning oil, but then her eyes zeroed in on you. Rose, having not tanned in a while, had a skin tone that was a shade lighter than your own tanned color. Thus, you stood out, but only as a weird smudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Hold on, Rose. Got something stuck to you. Little sticker, maybe?\u201d Betty suggested, licking her finger for leverage and then jamming it into Rose\u2019s left breast, right above your body. Angling her finger, Betty wedged her fingernail between you and Rose\u2019s hot flesh, and managed to peel you free in one swift movement. Rose bit her lip the whole time, lest she break out into ticklish laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Betty didn\u2019t spare more than a second to flick you off of her finger and down onto the ground. You didn\u2019t drift far, landing by Betty\u2019s leg, but the curvaceous woman had already turned her attention back to Rose. While you lie in a heap on the ground, slowly working on reforming, Betty methodically and tirelessly oiled up all of Rose\u2019s body. The entire process took ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you nearly reformed, Betty finished, and Rose gave her a thumbs up. \u201cThanks, Betty! I\u2019ll be looking sexy in no time!\u201d The woman laughed, and then laid back down on her stomach. Thankfully, you were a far enough distance from her, but the sight of her now oiled-up boobs impacting on the towel still gave you a minor fright. True to Betty\u2019s statement earlier, Rose was totally forcing Betty to do her own oiling, which was a little rude. In moments, Rose was breathing peacefully, seemingly asleep already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026she\u2019s out. Already. Wish <b><i>I</i></b> had some help.\u201d Betty rolled her eyes. Sighing, the giantess unhooked her own bikini top, and then moved to set her top down. As she did so, her eyes finally aligned with your own, and the two of you locked gazes. By this point, you were back on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your frantically prepared speech explaining who you were fell apart because of Betty\u2019s unexpected disrobing. Once more, you found yourself incapable of speech or thought, eyes glued to Betty\u2019s large, perfectly round, and perfectly nude breasts. You fought with every fiber of your being to look Betty in the eye and explain this whole situation, but she beat you to it, opening her mouth to speak.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(name changed from Becky to Betty to avoid future confusion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw! Are you a little tiny lifeguard? How cute!\u201d Betty gushed, her gorgeous face breaking out into a pleasing smile. Her reaction was not at all what you expected, and it threw you off even more than you already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, trying to stammer out a coherent response. \u201cU-uh\u2026um\u2026y-yes. Yes. That\u2019s me\u2026uh\u2026the t-tiny lifeguard.\u201d You fumbled your reply, earning a giggle from the titanic giantess. Your eyes frantically flicked all over the place, from the towel at your feet, to Betty\u2019s radiant face, to her utterly gigantic bare breasts that jiggled just a bit as she laughed at your embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mister Lifeguard\u2026what\u2019s a cutie like you doing here with me? A bit naughty to spy on a woman naked and ready to suntan.\u201d Betty theatrically pouted, curling her sensual lips into a mock frown, and she tsked at you. Your face burned bright red at the remark, and Betty laughed again. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, poor thing. I\u2019m not angry\u2026I\u2019d actually say I\u2019m flattered, if anything. Been a while since an adorable thing like you paid me any mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was referencing her age, but you found her statement hard to believe. Betty was a vision, even if she was in her thirties. Honestly, maturity had only developed her beauty further. Her reddish-brown locks framed her alluring face, her smooth milky white skin free of any blemish or mark. Her aforementioned curves were truly off-the-scale in terms of roundness and bounciness. Though you weren\u2019t perverted enough to spend your days scouring the internet for porn or explicit content, you did know exactly what term Betty would be described as: a milf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you tried to steady yourself. \u201cY-yes, I was just hired by Sanderson Beach. Today, in fact. My first job was to look around the beach for anyone who might need help, and then aid them if I can.\u201d You gave Betty a thumbs-up, causing the giantess woman to smile warmly. \u201cSo, since I\u2019m here, give me a task and I\u2019ll set right to it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired woman\u2019s eyes widened at your bold claim, then settled into a happy look of contentment. She grinned, her perfect teeth nearly shining. \u201cWell, how generous of you, you little stud. I was just lamenting about how I didn\u2019t have anyone to help me with\u2026this!\u201d She said, reaching behind herself to grab the bottle of tanning lotion. That one simple movement along shook her abundant chest wildly, drawing your gaze right back to her naked breasts. You couldn\u2019t help but gape, and this didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness.\u201d Betty smirked playfully, the faintest hint of pink in her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019d think a tiny like you had never seen a woman before!\u201d She laughed as you feebly attempted to clamp your jaw shut and look you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry\u2026for staring. Being here on the beach is\u2026overwhelming, to be honest.\u201d You admitted. \u201cYou ARE very beautiful, too.\u201d You added, hoping that a compliment would smooth things over. The last thing you wanted was to get fired on your first day for perving on the beach goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was unintended, to say the least. Betty\u2019s smile vanished, replaced instead by an open-mouth expression, and the blush in her cheeks burned brighter. She recovered a moment later, easing back into her warm, alluring smile. She also shifted forward, scooping you up into her palm with warning, while simultaneously lying out on the towel on her back. You bit back your cry of surprise, and let her dangle you then place you on the expansiveness of her lean stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t guessed, you adorable charmer, I need you to help lather me up for my tan.\u201d Betty explained, winking at you. \u201cI\u2019ll drop some tanning lotion onto my tummy, then you can spread it all around my body\u2026and I do mean, everywhere. I wouldn\u2019t want any uneven tan, right?\u201d Betty\u2019s angelic face radiated mischief and a hint of sensuality. \u201cSomething tells me that you won\u2019t mind giving me a rubdown, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sort of reply fumbled out of your mouth after a tease like that, and you merely gave the nude goddess a weak nod. Betty laughed once more, her stomach shaking and nearly tossing you off, before she uncapped the lotion bottle and deposited a hefty glob right beside you. After doing so, she slid some sunglasses onto her face, and propped her head up on a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, little guy. Lather me up!\u201d She grinned, and winked again. \u201cCould even be a reward in it for you if you do a good job. I\u2019ll definitely make sure your boss knows that you\u2019re the best, hottest lifeguard on this beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by the brown-haired woman\u2019s words, you gave another pitiful nod, and then approached the glob of lotion. Knowing the quickest way to finish the job was also the grossest, you slapped your whole body into the veritable mountain of lotion, coating your body in the sticky substance. You then began walking across, rolling across, and rubbing your hands across Betty\u2019s smooth stomach, effortlessly gliding over her skin while effectively covering her in tanning lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, you noted the bemused smile on Betty\u2019s face, and figured that she was no doubt satisfied with your work and surprised by your ingenuity. Truthfully, you\u2019d done this exact same thing to your mother plenty of times in the past, though she always had at least SOME clothes on, and of course never teased you about it. Your experience was coming in handy now, though, but you definitely wouldn\u2019t say that you had expected to lather up a sexy, nude, flirtatious woman your first day on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t too long before Betty\u2019s stomach was all done, including along her sides. Of course, that left only her titanic tits in need of a good lotion lathering. Reapplying an almost armor-like coat of lotion onto yourself, you trekked over to Betty\u2019s breasts, and had to pause to stare at the sheer size of them. Twin peaks, massive yet perfectly rounded, with just the right amount of jiggliness. Their incredible size just about blocked out Betty\u2019s face from the angle you were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScaling them proved to be an entirely different beast, and one that your tiny body almost couldn\u2019t complete. As slick as you were, it was nearly impossible to scrambled up Betty\u2019s right breast. Her skin, perfectly smooth and soft as it was, offered nearly nonexistent grip, and a faint sheen of sweat all across her body certainly didn\u2019t help. You only succeeded by dashing up in a quick, desperate burst, sinking your hands and feet into her plump boobs to balance yourself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Betty\u2019s perspective, this was nothing short of adorable hilariousness, and she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Her breasts swayed and shook as she giggled at your plight, and you stumbled backwards. Flailing your arms to keep from falling back down, you pitched forward, but merely ended up falling on your face instead. Well, you fell on your face, but your entire body also fell right onto Betty\u2019s pink nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty\u2019s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced instead by a playful smirk. \u201cOh? Is the little lifeguard getting a facefull while still on the job? Shame on him. What a horrible tiny perv?\u201d Betty\u2019s expression was one of mock indignation, and a faint blush had returned to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to push yourself back up to your feet, when you were suddenly shoved down hard into Betty\u2019s nipple. It was Betty herself, daintily poking your body with her finger. Though she smiled innocently, anyone could see the glint of mischief and something more in her eyes. Lazily, she traced a circle around her nipple, dragging your body around and around while still squeezing you into her doughy breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was maddening for multiple reasons, both the fact that Betty was interfering with the job, and the fact that this naked woman was massaging you into her nipple. The feeling welling up inside you for the past fifteen minutes finally burst forth despite your honest attempts to stop it, and you felt yourself growing aroused. Of course, your hardening crotch was instantly squished flat by the force Betty was applying on your miniscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it had still been quite clearly felt. Betty\u2019s eyes widened, as did her triumphant grin. \u201cAh, so you ARE enjoying this, huh, cutie? My, my! This really might be the best beach day ever!\u201d Betty laughed melodically, and looked over at her friend, Rose. Rose was still sleeping like a rock, and Betty knew she\u2019d remain that way for hours if left undisturbed. Betty was pleased with the knowledge that she truly had you all to herself. Maybe it wasn't proper, but it was so much fun, conduct be damned. You were just irresistibly cute to her, and your own obvious attraction to her naked glory was icing on the flirtatious cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty released you, finally, but only after you felt the ground beneath you harden and begin to poke into you. It only took you a second to grasp the fact that Betty was being aroused by her teasing and playing with you, and that doubled your panic. This naked woman, to put it bluntly, had total control over you in this intimate of a situation. There was no telling what she\u2019d do if her desire to mess with you kept growing. Even still, you weren\u2019t about to quit this job until you\u2019d lathered her up completely. You weren\u2019t the type to give up, no matter the adversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up and trying (and failing) to hide your erection, you avoided looking Betty in the eye and went back to rubbing lotion across her boobs. Your peripheral still caught the sight of Betty\u2019s sensual gaze and her softly biting her lower lip. That image sent shivers down your spine, and you hoped that ignoring it would keep her \u2018playfulness\u2019 at bay.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Given your tiny size, you'd dodged your fair share of giant feet in your life, though running on sand certainly made it harder. As soon as her shadow passed over your body, you dived forward with everything you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash of her foot hitting the sand right next to you rattled your eardrums, but that's all. With another bounding step she was gone, leaving you watching her bouncing ass as she strode to the volleyball court. Still, the volleyball girls were far too busy to try and talk to, and they didn't seem to need any help. With a sigh, you continued down the beach, keeping an eye out for those in need of assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you came to a giant brunette woman laying on her stomach on a beach towel. She looked about your age. Her bronzed skin contrasted sharply with the hot pink color of her bikini. Her bikini bottoms at least seemed to have their work cut out for them, barely containing her large rump. You walked up in front of her face, though her dark brown eyes seemed distracted by her cell phone at the moment, and she didn't see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello miss, can I be of any assistance?\" You asked, trying to sound more confident than you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked up from her cell phone, surprised by your voice. When she saw your tiny body standing in front of her, hands on your hips, she couldn't help but giggle. \"And who might you be little guy?\" She asked, putting her phone down on the towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Hunter, and I'm a newly hired lifeguard.\" This seemed to be going well so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hunter, my name is Dana, and you caught me at a perfect time. I do have a bit of a situation and I could really use some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Whatever you need!\" You were thrilled that you found someone who needed your help, and couldn't accept fast enough. Your job was on the line after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'm so glad, it's very lucky you came along. You're the perfect size for what I have in mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little caught off guard by that. Your tiny size usually caused problems for you, so it was pretty surprising that she thought it would actually help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? What exactly do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana smiled and reached down and picked you up off the sand, bringing you towards her face. She smiled as she whispered her answer to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"I've got a bunch of sand in my ass and it's driving my crazy, I was hoping you could handle it.\" Dana lays on her stomach and slides you into her bikini bottom, demanding that you clean all the sand out of her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"It's too hot today, I could use a sweat rag for my tits.\" Before you can object, she smushes you flat and uses you to mop the sweat off of her breasts before tossing you aside and returning to tanning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"I'm starving, and I think you'll hit the spot.\" Dana shoves you into her mouth and starts to chew on your gummy body. Will Quinn notice?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(Inspired by and set in the world of A Shrunken College Student - <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2178043-A-Shrunken-College-Student\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2178043-A-Shrunken-Colleg...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Backstory (written by Hectic)</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot has changed in the past 25 years since the great shrinking epidemic swept across the world. In an event that some called a medical mystery and others called an act of god, a type of shrinking virus spread to every corner of the earth, affecting part of the population while leaving another part completely fine. Those who fell victim to this virus rapidly shrunk down to one inch tall, but at the same time gained a strange durability and malleability that has baffled scientists and doctors alike. However, the tiny people were not ones to complain about these newfound characteristics, as they were the only things preventing their lives from being taken by a stray step or anything else of that nature. The third most interesting aspect about this inexplicable shrinking is the fact that only men seem to have suffered from it, with women across the world remaining completely unaffected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the first day of the shrinking event it was expected that society would change drastically, and while it definitely did, surprisingly much of it remained the same. There was no evil women\u2019s takeover or forced servitude of the now smaller men. For the most part, many men who had a job that did not require physical labor of any kind were able to continue living somewhat normal lives. Certain laws were put into place which prevented too much malicious behavior from befalling the tiny men, but these were really only enforced when a woman would purposefully try to kill, kidnap, or otherwise torture them. The vast majority of the time women would get away with any accidents between them and the tiny guys with a small slap on the wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Your Story</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 25 years since the shrinking pandemic, and the world has fallen into a pretty standard cycle once more. People have (more-or-less) adapted to the drastic changes in daily life, and the abnormal has become routine. You were born tiny, and have lived your whole life at the measly size of one inch. Life's been rough sometimes, but you're still alive and kicking. You've just graduated from Wentworth University after four years of college life, and have no idea what to do next. Searching for a cheap apartment online, you found a spacious offering in a suburban community called \"Sanderson\", with a deal to spilt the rent four ways, with three other people. Agreeing to these awesome terms, you got caught up in your excitement and forgot to click the <i>\"Apartments for Tinies Only\"</i> button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Main Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hunter Woods (You)</u> - The main character, and 21 years old. You have tanned skin, and are decently muscular due to how often you find yourself climbing/lifting things. You've got a head of sandy brown hair and similarly brown eyes, and you tend to consider yourself fairly attractive. You're good at a lot of things, but never settled on a specific career path and instead went with a basic degree in Communications (how clich\u00e9). You tend to be pretty outgoing and extroverted, which can get you into trouble from time to time. You aren't sure of what your future holds for you, but you're open to all possibilities. You can also be slightly perverted, but not in a truly creepy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Morgan Sinclair </u>- One of your new roommates, and 22 years old. She has dark tanned skin, long and wavy chocolate brown hair worn straight down, and hazel eyes. She stands at 6'0\", and her presence can be a bit intimidating due to her height and her toned, decently muscular body. This, however, is a complete disservice to her personality. Morgan is energetic, friendly, compassionate, and has a good sense of humor. She's willing to help out anyone in need, at any time. She just so happens to also love exercising and playing sports, which has lent itself to her tanned skin and toned physique. It's hard to ignore her physical charms too, as her sizable, firm curves are incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan has just landed a job as an employee at the local gym, \"Workout World\", where she is assigned to help patrons in need, clean up used equipment and the like, and occasionally teach weekly yoga classes. In her spare time, Morgan exercises constantly, and has joined up with the Sanderson community basketball team that plays matches down at the local park. She makes friends easily, and isn't above teasing those closest to her. People can always turn to her for camaraderie and support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Avery Sinclair </u>- One of your new roommates, and 22 years old. She is Morgan's twin sister, though the similarities mostly stop there. While she has the same dark tanned skin tone, her hair is dyed with streaks of bright pink, and often worn in a ponytail. She's a fair bit shorter, standing at 5'8\", though still miles taller than someone like you. Avery possesses Morgan's positive traits, but dialed up to eleven. She's extremely happy-go-lucky, bouncy, and carefree. Prone to fits of laughter and huge smiles, Avery brightens the day of everyone she comes into contact with. She's blessed with the same bountiful body as Morgan, but due to a little less exercise, her curvy chest and butt are a bit heftier and jigglier than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery recently scored a well-paying gig as a model at a local photo agency, \"Starlight Studios\", which has always been a dream of hers. Smiling for the camera while clad in some of the most scandalous and revealing outfits imaginable is nothing to a girl with so much body positivity. This confidence bleeds over into her social life, as Avery can come off as overly affectionate and flirtatious from time-to-time, along with being a bit of a prankster. On top of this, Avery is frequently teased by Morgan for being scatterbrained and oblivious, often at the worst possible times. Avery doesn't let this get her down (and by extension, doesn't try to fix her airheaded tendencies). Heaven forbid someone gives her any alcohol. She is also openly bi-sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Quinn Wallace </u>- One of your new roommates, and 23 years old. Quinn has paler, smooth and milky skin in comparison to the Sinclair sisters, and her dark black hair is cut in a short bob, bangs covering one of Quinn's piercing blue eyes. Quinn is a tad shorter than Morgan, standing at 5'10\", and her demeanor frequently turns people off from her. Quinn is soft-spoken and reserved, with a seemingly apathetic attitude towards life. When she does speak, it's usually biting sarcasm. In reality, Quinn just doesn't know how to fully open up and express herself, and doesn't mean to push others away. Ironically, Quinn still draws in so many people wanting to know her, and for a reason completely out of her control: her body. Quinn won the genetic lottery, and is a very curvaceous young woman in all respects. She thinks of herself as \"fat\", but most people would call her \"thicc\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn applied for a job on a whim in an attempt to get outside more often, and was actually hired. As such, she's the newest lifeguard working at \"Sanderson Beach\", tasked with looking over the beach and helping any one in need. She hasn't had to actually rescue anyone yet, and always lathers up with veritable buckets of sunscreen to keep her pale skin safe in the heat of the day. It takes her a long time to open up to other people, and she can be standoffish until she fully trusts someone. She shares some of Avery's obliviousness, but half the time it is because nothing really bothers her enough for her to take notice. If it involves tinies, she'll often treat them in a manner akin to \"tough love\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Minor Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Tracy Woods</u> - Your younger sister by one year, making her 20 years old. She's got your same nicely tanned skin tone and sandy brown hair, though she wears her hair long and braided. She also has the same pleasant brown eye color as you. Compared to most girls that fate cruelly threw you in the path of all during your life, Tracy's always been on the tamer side of things in the looks department. She stands at 5'6\", and possess a lithe and lean build. Her curves are much more subdued than the other giantesses in your life, but Tracy is no less beautiful. Of course, she's your sister, so you never viewed her in any weird way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she's one of your best friends in the present day, Tracy could be a little bit of a menace when she was younger. From the time Tracy was in sixth grade up until around eleventh grade, she grew a nasty persecution complex, wrongfully believing that you more loved and cared about than she was. This perceived mistreatment spiraled into full-on jealousy, and Tracy began going out of her way to treat you in a mean-spirited manner. Sometimes she'd act callously towards you, sometimes she'd pull some mean or degrading pranks on you (frequently involving other family members without their knowledge), but on truly awful days, Tracy could be a nightmare. She's since apologized profusely for her younger days, but whenever you think back on them you shudder. Tracy is currently a photographer and reporter for a local newspaper, with ambitions to reach a higher position one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Helen Woods</u> - Your mother, who has just recently turned 40. Even reaching the mid-point of her life, Helen has not let her age hamper her good looks. Still quite stunning, Helen has your family's shared tanned skin and sandy brown hair, but she styles and crops her hair to frame her face and fall to her shoulders. Her eyes are a piercing blue color, a stark difference from you and your sister. Perhaps most prominently, Helen is a fairly endowed woman in the chest department, and her derriere is similarly developed. She's put on a bit of weight over the years of busy office work, but that weight seems to feed into all the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriking the perfect balance between compassion and punishment, Helen was the dictionary definition of a strict but fair mother. If you or Tracy acted up, she'd mete out due retribution. If you and Tracy were on good behavior, she'd kiss you goodnight and make breakfast for you the next morning. Contrary to what Tracy believed for years, she treated you no differently despite your tiny size, expecting the same effort from you in all your daily endeavors that she would from a normal person. Maintaining a high-paying job as an international correspondent for a famous tech company, Helen was frequently away on business trips during your childhood, leaving you alone and at Tracy's mercy (or sometimes Helen's sister, and your aunt, Norah).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Aunt Norah</u> - Your mother's older sister, who is 42 years old. Norah lived a few hours away from your childhood home, but due to the nature of her job, she worked from home with a comfortable salary. As such, she could drop everything at a moment's notice to babysit you and Tracy whenever your mom left on one of her frequent business trips. Good looks run all throughout the female members in your family, and Norah is no different. She has tanned skin, medium-length hair usually in a bun (and dyed a soft red color), and hazel eyes. She's a fairly curvaceous woman, but she keeps her developed body toned through daily yoga sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorah's a fun-loving and energetic aunt, but often in a bad way for a tiny like yourself. For one, Norah never considers the consequences of her actions. If Norah accidentally squishes you, you'll get a sheepish wince and a quick apology from her, and then Norah will forget all about the incident entirely. It's like she has a hard time realizing how difficult daily trials are for a tiny like yourself. She also barely punished Tracy for bullying you back in the day, if Norah happens to notice at all. Notoriously airheaded and frequently forgetful, Norah was Tracy's favorite target to humiliate and torment you with in the past. Norah's job as a tiny recruiter didn't help either. Paid a sizable salary for finding willing tinies for occasionally unsavory jobs, Norah's earnest attitude had a way of roping you into some dangerous jobs on last minute notices. You love her as family, but she's a handful when she's around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Becky Wallace</u> - Quinn's mother, and a 42 year old woman. One look at Becky, either in person or through a photograph, is enough to clue anybody into where Quinn got her impressive curves from. Somehow, Becky is even thicker and more developed than her daughter, sporting an hourglass body women around the world would kill for. She has black hair, like her daughter, but she keeps hers long and cascading down her back. She has fair, milky smooth skin and blue eyes. Her measurements are off the charts in all departments, from her perfectly perky chest to her prodigious posterior. She's seemingly oblivious to her overflowing sex appeal, and is blissfully unaware of what people mean when they refer to her as a \"milf\" on her social media comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards Quinn, Becky is as motherly as anyone ever has been before. Devoted and doting to a fault, Becky can come across as clingy due to how lovingly she treats Quinn (who she refers to as her \"sweet angel\" and \"Quinnie\"). Becky is a fun-loving gal always willing to try new things and spoil her only child. However, add a tiny to the equation, and Becky's personality 180s. Whereas she treats all girls (and normal sized guys) with respect, she possess a monumental loathing for tinies. Distasteful of them, she finds tinies nothing more than pests at best, and gross bugs at worst. She won't hesitate to do what she has to do to take care of any tinies she's deemed a nuisance. This includes removing all tinies from contact with her daughter, as she believes them to be beneath her and unworthy of associating with normal people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Lilyana and Mariah Sinclair</u> - The mothers of Morgan and Avery, a lovingly bi-sexual couple, and both 40 years of age. They both have a habit of being filled with optimism and energy, brightening up any situation with their happiness. The couple met in high school, and dated for a few years before marrying. Lilyana was a Russian exchange student, and she still possesses a slight, adorable accent. Her skin is nearly porcelain white and silky smooth, and her blonde hair is so bright its practically sheer white in color. She has an elegant appearance, less curvaceous than other women, but tall and shapely, like a fashion model. Mariah is half-Hispanic, and has the chocolate brown hair that was passed onto their twins (to clarify, Mariah is the one who gave birth to the twins after utilizing a sperm donor). Mariah has a good deal more weight on her than Lilyana, but in all the right places. She frequently draws eyes with her hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilyana is a professional celebration organizer, or \"party planner\". She knows how to have a good time, and knows how to help others do the same. Not a week passes by where she isn't helping to set up birthday parties, bachelorette hangouts, and extravagant weddings. Mariah is the proud owner of a small local burger restaurant called \"Sinclair Sandwiches\". It isn't much, but it turns a profit. Mariah spends most of her time as the head chef in the kitchen, whipping up delicious meals to her valued customers (and sampling quite a bit of the food herself). The two women are as in love with each other as the day they first began dating, and they flirt incessantly. Lilyana finds tinies to be curious and fascinating, and Mariah thinks tinies are adorable little things that just beg to be played with. Though they aren't meanspirited by any stretch of the imagination, neither woman truly views tinies as real human beings, but more like cute pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More to be added in the future!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Quick Rules</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is written in second person (you, your, etc.) Please keep it that way. However, if you want to write a bit from someone else's perspective, third person can work for that when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter cannot die. He can only be squished, squashed, flattened, stretched, and anything else you think of. He will reform in time, given the chance to do so. Keep the story going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry not to write chapters that are exceptionally short. A bridge chapter from time to time is just fine, but too many and the story starts feeling weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, avoid heavily sexual/insertion content and any giant male content. Basically, just don't introduce any other guys into the story, UNLESS they too are tiny. That could be interesting (just make sure Hunter is always the main character). Everything else goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRead, add, and enjoy!</td>",
