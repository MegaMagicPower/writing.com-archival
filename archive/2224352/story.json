            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat back on the couch and let out a big sigh of relief. Finally, the next big step in your life was ready to begin. With the help of your younger sister Tracy, you'd just finished bringing your belongings from your old house into your new apartment in the quiet suburban community of <i>Sanderson</i>. Of course, since you were a tiny from birth, you didn't really have a lot of personal belongings. In fact, all of your clothes, toiletries, and various other belongings fit completely inside of a single duffel bag, which was currently resting on the floor beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new apartment was spacious and clean, and definitely a place you could see yourself living for the foreseeable future. It was a two-floor house, with the first floor having an entry hallway, living room, kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom, and the second floor having three bedrooms. The kitchen and living room came fully supplied with appliances and furniture. Each of the three bedrooms also had a bed and a dresser. On that note, you wondered how you missed the fact that there were only three bedrooms while reading the apartment description. Based on your split-rent deal, there would be four people total in this apartment. You supposed that someone would take the living room as their bedroom then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered when your new roommates would finally arrive, as everyone was scheduled to move in in about the same timeframe on this day. Tracy had left twenty minutes ago after saying her goodbyes, and you hoped you wouldn't be by yourself for much longer. Truthfully, you were nervous to meet the three other guys who would be sharing this place with you, but seeing as how they would be tinies like you (as you were still absolutely sure that you'd clicked the <i>Tinies Only </i>button), you believed that you'd be best friends with Morgan Sinclair, Avery Sinclair, and Quinn Wallace. As it was, all you knew about them were their names and ages, as their profiles had been quite barren on the website.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you'd been reduced to nothing more than twiddling your thumbs while waiting on the living room couch, you heard the unmistakable sound of the front door to the apartment opening. Instantly bolting up at the ready, you quickly brushed your hair a bit neater and straightened your shirt. You weren't sure why you felt this compulsion to appear as neat as possible for your fellow tinies, but first impressions were important, after all. However, you were a bit caught off guard by hearing female giggles after the door opened, and could only assume that your new roommates had also enlisted their sisters for help moving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and all thought fled out of your mind as two titanic giantesses strolled into the room. The first had long, chocolate brown hair, and was a fair bit taller than the second girl, who had the same brown hair dyed with bright streaks of pink. Both girls had deeply tanned, smooth skin, and were unbelievably attractive. Your mind went straight to their rather abundant curves (and you chastised yourself for staring at them even as you kept doing it), and their bodies were shown off brilliantly. The taller girl was wearing tight compression shorts and a trim tank top, and the shorter girl was wearing a quite revealing tank top and barely-there booty shorts. They were like twin angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, this is a comfy living room!\" The shorter girl gushed, her voice bouncy and energetic. She spun around in a circle as she entered the room. \"Don'tcha think so, Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller girl rolled her eyes, but was still smiling. \"Yeah, Avery, it's nice. Lots of space for my workout gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept talking while looking around the living room, but you could only stare at them slack-jawed, your mind racing at a mile a minute. A tiny, unsettling thought had been creeping up into your mind as soon as you heard female voices in the entryway, but hearing the girls confirm their names for you sealed the deal: somehow, you had both managed to join an apartment deal with people who weren't tinies, and people who were giantesses on top of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shaken out of your dumbfounded stupor by the sight of Avery approaching the couch backwards, still engaged in conversation with her sister. The sight of the curvy girl towering above you stunned you into motionless inactivity, at least until she started lying down on the couch, never once making eye contact with you. You let out a startled scream and tried to run, only to trip as Avery's butt plopped down onto the half of the couch furthest from you, shaking the couch cushions and toppling you over. To make matters worse, your scream was drowned out by the titanic girl's infectious giggle, and fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Morgan sighed, and Avery laughed harmoniously again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gettin' comfy! Like, unloading our stuff can wait!\" Avery grinned childishly, utterly oblivious to what she was doing to the living room's third, tiny occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Avery completely laid out on the couch, and with a muffled <i>squelch</i>, her left breast crashed onto you. She was lying on her side, so her sizable boobs had piled right onto your body, squashing your miniscule, one-inch body all the way up to your neck under her copious mounds of flesh. Your weak body flattened into nothing under her tank top covered boobs, and you thrashed your head around in a futile attempt to get free. All you could do was speak, which you hoped was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Please! Please, get off! I'm down here!\" You shouted as loud as you could. Unfortunately, they way Avery's boobs were pinning you down, you had to angle your voice more into the cushion of the couch than up towards the two girls who could actually do something about the humiliating position you'd found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, fate cut you a break, and it was enough. Morgan frowned, and began looking around the room. \"Uh, Avery...do you hear that?\" She began pacing around the room, trying to pick up the location of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery shook her head. \"Nope. Is it someone outside? Are Quinn and that other girl...Hunter...here yet? I hope that they're both super cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smirked for a second. \"You hope everyone is cute. But no, it sounds like...\" Her voice trailed off as she spotted your almost unnoticeable head, sticking out from under her twin sister's tits and buried into the couch cushion. Kneeling in front of Avery, Morgan peered closely at you and gasped. \"Oh! Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery bit her lip adorably. \"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan flicked her eyes up from you to her sister. \"You...uh...sat on a tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, and everything was cleared up. Or, at least, as well as it could be. You had introduced yourself to the twins after being freed from under Avery's boobs, and they had introduced themselves to you in turn. The three of you couldn't believe how crazy the mix-up in the apartment scheduling was, but Morgan and Avery seemed totally fine with rooming with a tiny. Avery in particular seemed quite intrigued by the prospect. From your initial meeting with them, Morgan seemed like the down-to-earth and sensible twin, while Avery was much more flirty and fun-loving. This whole scenario still put you on edge a tiny bit, as (aside from your mother and sister) you'd had very little direct interaction with giantesses your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introductions, Morgan had gone to use the bathroom, leaving you alone with Avery. However, that only lasted a second before the front door opened again. Avery jumped to her feet to greet the newest visitor, and you, back on the couch, turned to watch as a third girl strolled into the room. Presumably, she was Quinn Wallace, and her appearance here practically cemented how dumb you had been to not double-check the apartment website before signing the contract. You'd seen your roommates' names, and as they were fairly gender neutral, you hadn't thought twice about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pre-planned introduction to Quinn fell to pieces as she walked into the room. Her hair was pitch-black and cut in a bob with bangs, and compared to the twin's, her skin tone was much paler and milky smooth. This was hardly the only difference, as you shamefully noted just how large Quinn's proportions were. Morgan and Avery had been a vision, true, but Quinn was on another level of thickness. Her boobs, butt, and thighs were some of the largest you'd ever seen, and they jiggled a bit as she walked. She was heavier than the twins, but in all the right places as far as you were concerned. She was wearing a comfy black sweater and very tight black leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, right as you regained the ability to form sentences, Quinn walked over towards you while looking at Avery. Avery smiled cheerfully at Quinn, then flicked her eyes down to you. A mischievous glint twinkled in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! You must be Quinn!\" Avery beamed. \"My name is Avery, and can I say that you are totes adorable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn huffed out a bit of air. \"Thanks. Name's Quinn Wallace.\" She folded her arms and began to sit down, directly where you were on the couch. You hardly had time to react, and could only look up in surprise. Out of the corner of your eye, you saw Avery smiling with a playful expression that made your heart sink. She was totally letting this happen. That girl was going to be a handful, wasn't she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, not as much of a handful (in the literal sense) as Quinn, as the black-haired giantess plopped down onto the couch, utterly obliterating you beneath her massive derriere with ease. Her incomprehensibly large rear just about swallowed you whole, and your squishy body flattened out into a pathetic little pancake under her shapely, jiggly left cheek. To make matters worse, Quinn wiggled a bit to get comfortable, dragging her butt across your body and smearing you flatter into her leggings-clad ass. Your face was rubbed fully into the fabric of her leggings, the pain of squashing contrasting with the almost pleasant smell of her perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Avery couldn't hold in her mischievous, prankster attitude any longer, and she burst out laughing. Giggling rightly, Avery smiled at Quinn, who merely looked at her with a raised eyebrow. \"You...you sat on a tiny!\" Avery said, between fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn frowned and looked down at the couch, where her big butt took up half of the total sofa. Shrugging, she looked back at Avery. \"Huh. He should've moved, I guess.\" Quinn replied, while taking her phone out of her purse and checking a text she'd just gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery's smile dimmed at that response. \"O-oh, it's actually our fourth roommate, Hunter. We thought he'd be a cute girl, but there was some mix-up, and he's actually an adorable little tiny. Couldn't even tell before meeting him, cuz of his name! Isn't that amazing?\" Avery had to pause a nanosecond to catch her breath. \"Morgan and I have never lived with a tiny before! It's so exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shrugged again. \"Sounds like it.\" She finished typing her text, and then stretched her arms. She continued to make no attempt to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was getting nervous now, and felt the faintest twinge of guilt for putting you into this situation. With each passing second, Quinn's indomitable ass crushed you further flat, and the heat was beginning to build up quite a bit. \"Uh...could you get off of him? I'm sure he didn't mean to be sat on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn rolled her eyes and put down her phone. \"He isn't bothering me where he is. I'll be getting up in a few minutes.\" Quinn stated. \"Anyway, you said your name was Avery? Does that mean Morgan is your sister? Is she here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Avery's face lit back up into full excitement mode, and she launched into a rambling and bouncy conversation about herself and her sister. She told Quinn how she was hoping to become a world famous super model, and that Morgan was a super-fit exercise junkie working at the local gym, <i>Workout World</i>. Quinn responded in turn, saying how she wanted to be more approachable, so she'd applied for a more active job, and landed a position as a lifeguard at Sanderson Beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you heard none of this, as all sounds of the outside world were muffled while under Quinn's hefty buttocks. All of the curvy girl's weight as squeezing you into paste beneath her butt, and you soon began sweating profusely. Your sweat only served to further bond you to her leggings-clad left cheek. Try as you might to struggle or reform, it was quite pointless. You only hoped Avery would save you soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that hope was entirely useless, as you'd slipped Avery's mind the second Quinn had asked her about Morgan. Avery was a mile-a-minute type of girl, but this came with the drawback of her exceptionally forgetful and oblivious mindset. Her airheadedness was unrivalled amongst almost anyone in the world. This ditzy nature could be a detriment to herself and others, but no one could stay mad at Avery for long with her boundless enthusiasm and overflowing optimism towards life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what this meant for you was that you went unnoticed beneath Quinn for the next five minutes as they talked. Then Morgan returned and got caught up in the conversation, and you were stuck for another thirty minutes. Then the girls helped each other unpack their belongings, and move into and set up their new rooms on the second floor. You stayed stuck to Quinn's booty for this entire three hour experience as well, and were pretty much just a sticker on her jiggly cheek by the time everything was said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over to retrieve her water bottle from the floor, Quinn's shapely rear was accentuated for all to see, and Avery's wandering eyes were drawn to the heavenly sight. Taking in all of Quinn's beauty, Avery smiled, but paused when her eyes locked onto you. Confused for a split second, the pink-haired girl finally connected the dots, screamed out almost comically, and pointed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! Hunter, you poor thing!\" She cried, gesturing to you. Morgan followed her sister's finger to you, and gasped, while Quinn merely looked over her shoulder to where they were pointing. She couldn't even see you from that angle, her ass was so massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How did he get there? How long has he been there?\" Morgan exclaimed, looking between her twin and Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally forgot that Quinn sat on him!\" Avery explained. \"When she first came into the living room!\" The carefree girl tactically avoided informing her twin about her involvement in getting you squished to Quinn's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Morgan could berate her sister, Quinn sauntered over to the nearest mirror to help her see you better, then began picking you off of her leggings. \"Yeah, I figured he'd still be stuck. I was sitting on him for a while before getting up, then with all the moving around...\" The black-haired girl shrugged. \"It was probably a bit too much for him to reform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Avery blinked at Quinn, then each other. Morgan then gaped at Quinn. \"Wait...you knew he was there the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded. \"Assumed he was, at least. But, it's not like I could feel him, so he wasn't bothering me enough to get me to peel him off while we were working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan threw up her hands. \"But why would you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn held up a hand defensively. \"Don't misunderstand. I'm not being rude or disrespectful to tinies.\" As she spoke, her fingernail finally slid between your pancaked body and her curvy butt cheek. Peeling you free, Quinn kept talking. \"I've lived my whole life with friends who were tinies, I know about their struggles. Even still, tinies need to learn how to be strong on their own. I left Hunter under me because I wanted him to fight for himself. People won't always be around to save him.\" The girl dropped you into Morgan's warm hands. \"Still, I didn't make it easy on him, I suppose. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she apologized, she looked you right in your squished, slightly smeared eye, and you could tell it was a genuine apology. You didn't know what to make of her and her seemingly apathetic attitude towards life just yet, but there was clearly more to her than you saw at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thirty minutes passed, in which Morgan whisked you off to the bathroom and helped you wash off and tidy yourself up. She'd then carried you to the kitchen and fixed you a small little meal. You couldn't help but feel that, to a small degree, she was babying you a little, but you assumed that this was just her personality. From what you'd gathered, she was a caring, helpful girl who would willingly go out of her way to lend anyone a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that diversion, Morgan had carried you into the living room, where Avery and Quinn were waiting. She sat on the couch beside Avery, and set you down on the coffee table in the middle of the room. Quinn was in a recliner beside the couch. Quinn gave you a small nod of recognition, and Avery winked at you while sticking her tongue out playfully. You rolled your eyes at her, prompting a satisfied giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that it dawned on you, the full weight of what your future held. Here you were, away from home and moved into a brand new building, in a brand new community. You, a one inch tall tiny, and your three new gigantic giantess roommates. Whatever the future held, it was surely going to be wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this is it, then.\" You said, a bit awkwardly. All three of the girls nodded. They'd each moved into the three bedrooms upstairs, unpacking all of their belongings. Actually, if they were upstairs, then...your eyes drifted over to the side of the couch, where your duffel bag packed full of belongings was still sitting. You hadn't unpacked your stuff yet! Now where were you going to sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your eye, Morgan followed your gaze. \"Ah, that's your stuff, isn't it, Hunter?\" She asked. Smiling a bit sheepishly, she continued. \"We kinda took all the rooms upstairs, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved her off, trying to act as confident as possible. It wasn't hard, with your extroverted personality, but the twists and mishaps this day had brought were still trying to settle in your mind. \"Nah, it's no big deal. I can sleep wherever there's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded, in an approving manner. \"That's good. Still, sorry for not asking you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, who was rocking back and forth in her seat, burst out. \"Come on guys! It's barely even four o'clock in the afternoon. Aren't we gonna do something fun today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rubbed her sister's shoulder. \"Let's take it easy for today. Hunter's had quite the time of it, right? If he wants to do anything, let him decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery looked sulky for a second, before cheering up again. \"...Kay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the coffee table, you observed the three jaw-droppingly gorgeous girls who were now your roommates. Well, this was it. Your new life. Better make the most of it!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could think of something to say, Avery piped up with an adorable little exclamation noise. \"Oh! Wait! Where's little cutie Hunter going to sleep? We took all the bedrooms, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed. \"Yes, Avery. That's what we were just discussing.\" She playfully rapped her sister on the forehead with her knuckle. \"Pay attention sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...hee hee!\" Avery giggled, then looked down at you. As she leaned forward, her boobs threatened to spill from her already incredibly revealing top, and they jiggled slightly as they hovered above you. You had to fight to keep looking the pink-haired giantess in the eye instead of at her abyss of cleavage. \"Anyway, we gotta pick out a room for you, don'tcha think, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned up at her. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl <i>tsk tsked</i> you, wagging her finger. \"Well, ya can't sleep in the living room down here all by yourself. That'd be lonely! Plus...\" Avery smirked and winked at you. \"You got all squished twice today already on this couch. Don'tcha think it would happen a lot if you slept in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the ditzy girl's line of thinking was spot on, but her reminder of how you'd been introduced to both her and Quinn still made you blush a bit, earning a grin from Avery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at her sister's reasoning, Morgan laid down her palm in front of you, and motioned with her eyes for you to hop on. You were grateful that she was willing to carry you around like this, so you hopped on. She delicately stood up, careful not to shake her palm too much. She brought you all the way up to her eye level, and smiled at you. Her radiant face, and the way her chocolate brown hair framed her features was a sight to behold. Your breath caught in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Hunter, I know it might be a little weird, but Avery makes a good point. I think you would be safest and more comfortable sharing one of our room's upstairs.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, it did make perfect sense, even though you were embarrassed beyond belief that you'd now be sharing the same room as one of these three total knockout girls you'd only just met. Still, you flashed Morgan a thumbs up. \"Sure thing! Sounds like a plan to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled at your show of acceptance, and moved to leave the living room with you. Avery hopped out of the couch, and Quinn stood as well, the black-haired girl picking up and shouldering your duffel bag of belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Quinn.\" You said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"You couldn't have gotten it yourself.\" She reasoned. Taking the lead, Quinn walked up the stairs, Morgan following after and Avery behind. As the four of you ascended to the top of the stairs, your gaze was entranced by Quinn's perfectly sculpted, humongous rear end swaying side-to-side as she meandered up the stairs. It was an incredible sight, and one you had to literally slap yourself out of gawking at. After slapping yourself, you heard a small chuckle above you, and you turned to see Morgan smirking playfully. Your staring at Quinn had apparently not gone unnoticed by your carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the second floor, Morgan slipped by Quinn and approached the first open door. \"So, this is my room. If we're doing this like some sort of equal debate thing, I guess it's choice number one.\" She said, and you realized that she was right. It would only be fair for you to look at each girl's room first, then decide who you wanted to room with. Really though, that just made all of this even more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan showed off her room, and it was basically what you expected from someone like her. Her bed was tucked in and straightened, her clothes were neatly stored away in dressers and in the closet, and one corner of her room was taken up by a organized collection of exercise weights and training props. One other corner of the room was barren. The entire room was decorated in shades of tan and brown, a very earthy and natural feel. There was also a TV with what looked like a gaming console hooked up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled. \"If you wanted to room with me, you could have that whole empty corner to yourself. That way, we wouldn't be taking up each other's space. I also have a spare pillow I can give you to use for a bed, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was next to show off her room, and once again it was right in the same ballpark as how you would've guessed. It was the same sort of neatness as Morgan, but filled to the brim with personal belongings. There were twice as many dressers and drawers for clothes, a sprawling make-up table, and even a full-size mannequin currently wearing a sparkly white dress. There was hardly any free space, and the whole room was colored in a wide assortment of rainbow hues, though mostly bright pinks, blues, and reds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery spun in a circle excitedly. \"If you wanted to room with me, I have a few empty drawers for all your stuff.\" Avery gestured to one of her dresser cabinets, where two empty drawers were (worryingly, right beside what appeared to be drawers stuffed with lingerie and swimsuits). \"I also figured we could just share the bed, as there's totes enough room for me and a cutie like you!\" Avery giggled, prompting a startled blush from you, a surprised look from Morgan, and a shrug from Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's room was last, and it was the one that caught you off guard the most. You anticipated that everything would be mostly colored in black, gray, and purple, but what you didn't expect was for it to be so messy. She had the same style bed, dressers, and closet as the twins, but the floor of her room was covered with clothes strewn all about. You'd be hard pressed to believe she had only just moved in hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn put her hands on her hips as she talked. \"Yeah, it's a mess, I know. I have a hard time...feeling like I need to tidy up. Still, it's comfy, I guess. If you wanted to room with me, I'm sure you could find space somewhere, like on the floor, or in a drawer, or something. Anything that doesn't bother me is okay. You can do whatever.\" She shrugged again, and you couldn't help but smile. Something about her nonchalant attitude could be so endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour finished, Morgan took you back out into the hall, and the three girls looked at you expectantly, obviously anticipating your answer. You knew this was a pretty big decision, so you thought about it for a second, cleared your throat, then spoke up.</span></div></div>",

She started to walk upstairs, occasionally glancing down at you once or twice to make sure you were still there and hadn't fallen off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would you like to sleep, Hunter? I'm sure we can set up some sort of bed for you on my nightstand that you'll be able to climb up and into?

You couldn't help but stare at the giant pair of breasts in front of you as she said the word squish, thinking maybe you'd enjoy it a bit more than you should let on to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that doesn't sound too appealing. The nightstand bed sounds like a great idea,\" you call up to her, and she smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the top of the stairs and look around into the room, noticing how clean and orderly everything is. All the luggage was off to one corner of the room with no clothes or accessories strewn about anywhere on the floor. The bed was nicely made and you noticed that even the nightstand was spotless, with an alarm clock and lamp to keep you company through the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan set you down on the bed, then sat down gently next to you, making sure that the impact didn't jostle or throw you up into the air. You appreciated the carefulness she showed towards you, and started to feel like you made the right choice choosing Morgan to room with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just gotta change into my pajamas, and then I'll be set for bed. Maybe we can order in dinner or something too to celebrate our first night as roomies,\" said Morgan, breaking you out of the little stupor you were in. \"No peeking while I change though, or else you'll be in trouble,\" she added, with a raised eyebrow and the slightest hint of a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course milady,\" you respond, bowing in an exaggerated manner and grinning up to her, before turning towards the middle of the bed and covering your eyes. \"Don't take too long, or else I might not be able to hold back any longer,\" you joke, feeling the bed around you elevate slightly as Morgan gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be looking, so don't you dare turn around,\" Morgan retorts, and you start to mentally undress your unbelievably attractive roommate. You feel the blood rush down slightly into your nether regions, and you start to wonder if Morgan would really notice if you turned around slightly just to see what she was up to.</span></div></div>",

This is gonna be so fun!\" Avery squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, good luck with that.\" Quinn said, before turning and heading back towards her bedroom. As she did so, you couldn't help but be distracted by the massive butt that had squished you earlier in the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's voice snapped you back to the two sisters. \"Are you sure sharing a bed is a good idea guys? Avery could easily steamroll you in her sleep. She tends to roll around a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupidly, you hadn't even considered this. Your mind flashed with images of you laying down in bed, only to be awoken by an avalanche of boob as Avery rolled over onto you. \"Avery, maybe your sister has-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could continue your objection, Avery snatched you up into her own hand. \"You're always worrying Morgan! It's going to be fine, trust me. And even if I do squish him a little bit, he did fine under Quinn's butt today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna get squished a lot living with us. Might as well get used to it.\" Quinn's voice called out from her bedroom. The three of you were all surprised she had joined the conversation at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I'm not gonna squish him, it'll be fine, you'll see.\" Avery retorted. \"In fact, it's getting late, I think me and the little guy are going to turn in early tonight. Quinn's butt probably tired him out anyway.\" Avery didn't wait for a reply from the other girls. Satisfied with the arrangements, she just walked into her bedroom, your tiny body gripped in her fist as it swung disorientingly at her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to her room, she dropped you down onto the right side of the queen sized bed. From your perspective, it was massive. Morgan must have been worrying too much, you were sure the two of you could share all of this space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get changed little guy. No peeking! Even though we both know you want to.\" Avery teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you turned towards the head of the bed, covering your eyes with your hands for extra measure. Though you couldn't see what was going on behind you, your imagination was happy to mentally undress the giant girl despite yourself. Maybe this whole rooming mixup would turn out for the best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can open your eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turned around, your saw that Avery's penchant for revealing clothing carried over into pajamas. She was wearing a matching pink pajama set that looked like it was a few sizes too small for her. The bottom edge of her butt cheeks peeked out of the tight shorts she was wearing, while her top hugged her breasts tightly and only covered up to her belly button. You could tell she was no longer wearing a bra, as the outline of her nipples was visible through the fabric. She had also put on fluffy pink ankle socks, presumably to keep her feet warm while sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute right?\" Avery asked, striking a little pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah... Very... 'cute'.\" You replied, realizing you hadn't blinked for 30 seconds at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned and flopped down into bed. The impact of her butt on the mattress launched you a few inches into the air, but her soft mattress also was there to break your fall moments later. When you stop up again, Avery was laying in bed on her side, smiling cutely at you. Even when she was a little careless, it was impossible to stay mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get you to your new sleeping spot.\" Avery said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused. You were already on the bed, weren't you? \"I thought you were just going to have me sleep on the mattress next to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my first plan, but I was thinking it'd be better if you slept on my body. That way I don't have to wonder where you are when I wake up in the morning.\" Avery explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. Her body? It's true that Avery was incredibly hot, but this still seemed like a big jump for first day roommates. And where on her body would she put you anyway? Your face reddened as you imagined laying on her chest, using one of her enormous breasts as a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo I can tell by the color of your face that you like this plan.\" Avery said, her grin widening even further. \"Now, let's get you situated. I have a nice.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. soft mattress picked out for you.\" (Avery lays on her chest and tucks you into her pajama bottoms, making her ass cheek your \"mattress\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. comfy room picked out for you.\" (Avery tucks you deep between her tremendous breasts, leaving you unable to move an inch)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. warm sleeping bag picked out for you.\" (Avery decides to tuck you into her socks, figuring sleeping up next to her feet will keep you warm and cozy all night)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up at your three giantess roommates from Morgan\u2019s hand, your eyes traveled from the exuberant energy of Avery, the interested warmth of Morgan, and finally to the complete nonchalance of Quinn. In fact, Quinn wasn\u2019t even looking at you, she was clearly reading something on her phone. The logical side of your brain was screaming at you to pick Morgan. She had an entire corner of her room unused that you could comfortably fit in. Plus she was by far the most reliable out of the three. But some part of you held you back. You thought about it for a moment then realized that if you wanted to be babied then you would have just moved back home after graduating college. You wanted to be an adult, and living on your own meant literally living on your own as much as possible. No doubt about it, even knowing that you lived with a responsible woman like Morgan brought you great peace of mind. But as for the literal room you wanted to live in, you craved a bit more freedom. For this reason once again your gaze turned to the utterly uninterested Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I want to dig out some space in your room, Quinn, if that\u2019s cool with you.\u201d You said up to the three. Avery\u2019s jaw dropped with shock, Morgan\u2019s eyebrows raised as well, and Quinn simply looked up from her phone, looked towards you, and responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure, you don\u2019t take up much space anyway so it works for me.\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI already have your stuff so hop on and we\u2019ll find a spot to set you up.\u201d Quinn held out her hand close to Morgan\u2019s and you rather daringly hopped across the divide. Rather impressed by even this small feat of strength, the three women smiled down at you. Both of the twins had their doubts about your choice of living situation, but they weren\u2019t the boss of you by any means, so they simply let it be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you two go get set up, we\u2019re going to head downstairs and hang out. Come join when you\u2019re all done!\u201d Morgan said, Avery excitedly nodding in agreement. The two then turned and walked down the hallway and down the stairs. Quinn simply walked the two of you back into her mess of a room. There was hardly a square inch of space not covered with some article of clothing. Luckily it seemed like other than being a bit untidy, she didn\u2019t have any really nasty things laying around like trash or food. You could handle some spare clothing no sweat. Reaching a spot smack in between Quinn\u2019s bed, her dresser, and the path to her closet, she peered downward and with one bare foot began kicking articles of clothing to the side. Eventually she cleared a few feet of space and dropped your duffel bag down, lowering you down rather quickly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your space, set up your stuff however you want, makes no difference to me.\u201d Quinn said, already walking towards her queen bed and flopping down on it, pulling out her phone to continue browsing. You hopped up onto your duffel bag and grabbed the zipper that was as big as you were, effortfully unzipping the bag open. Your sister Tracy had packed almost everything herself, an act which took her no more than five minutes. You knew it would take you significantly longer to unpack everything. Once again you thought about how quickly either Avery or Morgan would have set all of your belongings up if you had decided to room with them, but you felt some deep satisfaction going through the arduous process of doing it yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours must have passed of you painstakingly dragging items out of your duffel bag and onto the patch of carpet beside you. Somehow, Quinn stayed laying on her bed the entire time, part of the time browsing social media on her phone, and part of the time napping. By now you were pretty exhausted, you had set up your wardrobe and bed at least. Your bed being a sample square of memory foam given to your family by a salesperson along with a frame made out of popsicle sticks that you had fashioned together. Your wardrobe was a repurposed cracker box, that you fitted with a few tiny shelves to separate your things. In reality there had already been a variety of tiny versions of products made for the shrunken population of men, but you took some pride in making things yourself. Collapsing onto your bed to relax, mirroring your giantess roommate, you closed your eyes and chilled out for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, after hours of immobility from Quinn, this was the exact moment which she stood up to head downstairs and figure out what the girls would do for dinner. Her first step off of her bed pressed down onto a pile of laundry, a feeling she had grown used to over the years. But her second step brought with it a bit of squish, along with a surprisingly loud series of crunches. Quinn casually looked down beneath her, leaving her foot where it was. Standing at 5\u201910\u201d Quinn had appropriately large feet for a woman of her height. For that reason in a single step her heel had obliterated your handmade dresser, while her toes had shattered the frame of your bed, squishing down onto the bit of memory foam on top, as well as your tiny body. She looked down more carefully and saw your tiny body, now eyes wide open, pinched between her second and third toes and staring up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh shit, did I just destroy your stuff? My bad, dude. You probably should have set your stuff up somewhere else in retrospect. We\u2019ll figure somewhere else out for you to sleep after dinner though.\u201d Quinn\u2019s half-assed apology caught you off guard. You could tell part of it was genuine, but at the same time you knew that her intentions of forcing you to \u201cbe strong on your own\u201d were going to lead to many events like this in the future. Case in point, with any other woman you would have expected her to reach down and save you from your current position and toe jam, but not Quinn. She simply lifted the foot you were trapped on, brushed the broken popsicle sticks off of her sole, then returned both you and her toes to the carpeted ground. The top half of your body was sitting pinched between her toes, and the bottom half of your body was smashed under the ball of her foot with every step. You knew this was what you signed up for when choosing to live with Quinn, but man you expected to have at least a bit of a break after the hours of ass squashing earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment she reached the living room and plopped down onto the couch next to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Quinn\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter at?\u201d Quinn simply lifted her feet and plopped them on the ottoman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI stepped on him accidentally in my room, he\u2019s right here between my toes. So what\u2019re we doing for dinner?\u201d Quinn said both these sentences with the exact same inflection, paying no special attention to you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery gasped, \u201cQuinn come on can\u2019t you give the little guy a break? He\u2019s been through a lot today!\u201d Avery looked right at you, and was just about to reach out and save you, but you pried Quinn\u2019s massive toes apart using your upper body strength! Your lower half still being slightly crushed, you fluttered down onto the ottoman beneath you, coming to rest beside Quinn\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m chillin, don\u2019t worry about me ladies!\u201d You said, dragging yourself away from the massive sole next to you while simultaneously putting on a sense of bravado as if you were in control of the situation the whole time. Both Avery and Morgan then chuckled, Quinn giving you a slight but still noticeable nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo really, what are our dinner plans?\u201d You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan spoke up. \u201cAvery and I were thinking of just keeping it simple for our first night of living together. How does the local pizza restaurant sound? I think it\u2019s called Pizza Palace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a thumbs up. \u201cSounds good to me! I can always go for some pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery burst into giggles. \u201cOMG! And, and, I bet you only eat, like, a tiny little bit of a slice! That\u2019s so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, as you really did eat next to nothing compared to everyone around you whenever you went out. You looked back at your black-haired roomie. \u201cIs pizza alright with you, Quinn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Quinn shrugged. \u201cSure, can\u2019t complain. If it\u2019s what everyone else wants.\u201d Though her response had been traditionally apathetic, you caught the faint glint in her eyes and the rising curve in the corners of her mouth. She\u2019d never admit it, but you could tell that Quinn was head-over-heels for pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shuffled away to grab some things, and Morgan followed suit. You moved to do the same, until you felt a soft, delicate hand wrap around you from behind and hoist you up into the air. A short gasp escaped your lips before you were whirled around to face the angelic smile of Avery, a playful expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Pizza Palace it is then, huh, Hunter? Gosh, I can not wait to see your adorbs face stuffed with gooey cheese!\u201d The pink-haired girl grinned from ear-to-ear, and her infectious energy rubbed off on you, just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, it should be great.\u201d You agreed, and then paused. \u201cIs there\u2026uh\u2026any particular reason you picked me up to say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smirked in a mischievous manner. \u201cWell, eating out can be scary for tinies, I beat. Lots of big girls like me walking around everywhere. We need to make sure you don\u2019t get lost, cutie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, I appreciate that, Avery, but\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo! I\u2019ve got a special place for you, dude!\u201d Avery giggled, and then released her grip on you. Another startled cry strained out of your mouth as you fell, but it wasn\u2019t long before you impacted against Avery\u2019s soft, squishy left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking your face up from Avery\u2019s boob, your face blushing deep red, you looked up at her in confusion. \u201cA-Avery! What are you doing? You don\u2019t have to carry me in your clea\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery silenced you by placing her index finger on your head and lightly pushing, smushing your lips flat. She then swiped across her breast, dragging your body forward and knocking you into the absolute abyss of her cleavage. Your limbs sprawled and flailed in a futile attempt to stop yourself from falling in. All you succeeded in doing, however, was uselessly slapping and ticking Avery\u2019s sensitive skin, earning a small smile and faint blush from the flirtatious giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one emphatic shake of her prodigious chest, Avery watched as your tiny body was enveloped in the jiggling of her breasts, and you disappeared from view deep into her cleavage. All that surrounded you was darkness and soft, hot flesh. Your body crumpled in on itself in the tight confines of the busty girl\u2019s cleavage, sounds of the outside world muffled. All you could clearly hear was Avery\u2019s ecstatic heartbeat, and your own troubled thoughts, torn between mild arousal and indignation at Avery\u2019s treatment of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring at her tits, and enjoying the feeling of you between them, Avery almost missed Quinn standing in the corner of the room. Looking up, Avery met Quinn\u2019s eye. The black-haired girl, who had witnessed the entire incident, rolled her eyes and looked back at her phone. Avery merely stuck out her tongue and winked, then strolled over to the front door, relishing the feeling of her new, adorable tiny roommate squeezed so intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was the last to the front door, and she looked at Quinn and Avery with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? One of you carrying him?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn lazily glanced at Avery, who stumbled a bit before recovering. \u201cUm\u2026yes! He\u2019s totes in my pocket. Yep!\u201d The enthusiastic girl gestured to the side pocket of her booty shorts, patting it affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, having no reason to doubt her twin sister, merely nodded. \u201cAh, gotcha. At least he won\u2019t get lost that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three girls (and you) left the apartment and headed out to Morgan\u2019s car. Avery slid neatly into the back seat while Quinn sat beside Morgan up front. Morgan turned on some catchy music and pulled out onto the road, driving off to Pizza Palace. It was a fifteen-minute drive, and the time passed by for the girls pretty easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed much slower for you. With each passing second, more and more sweat accumulated between Avery\u2019s succulent, shapely breasts, and that same sweat rolled right over you. To make matters worse, Morgan accidentally hit a pothole in the road that caused Avery\u2019s boobs to quake like crazy, and they heavy mounds of flesh mashed you tight, reducing you to a flattened smear on her tits. Mentally, you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the girls pulled up to Pizza Palace, surprised to find it so packed. Getting out of the car first, Quinn walked off to request a booth, while Morgan and Avery took their time. Avery was second out of the car, and she was just about to dash off to the main entrance of the restaurant when Morgan grabbed her by the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery. Where is Hunter?\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAbout time to get him out of your pocket, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery paused for a moment, blinked, and then gasped. \u201cOh! Hunter! Totes slipped my mind, hee hee!\u201d She giggled, prompting a groan from Morgan. \u201cForgot he was in my pocket!\u201d Avery reached to her pocket to grab you, but came up empty. She checked her other pocket, but was similarly unsuccessful in retrieving you. Beginning to panic, Avery looked at her sister. Morgan merely raised an eyebrow, wondering what was taking so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short span of the car ride, what Avery had done to you had completely flooded out of the ditzy giantess\u2019 mind. This was in part due to the pothole squashing you so flat between her boobs that she could no longer feel you. Thankfully, when Avery began looking herself over in search of where else she could\u2019ve put you, her scatterbrain reconnected the dots as soon as she glimpsed her abundant cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepishly, Avery grimaced at Morgan and then stuck a hand down her cleavage. Morgan stared, wide-eyed, as her twin sister felt herself up looking for you, and finally hooked you on her fingernail and pulled you free. By this point, annoyance had overtaken surprise, and Morgan yanked you away from Avery. She began wiping you down with her shirt, trying to get the accumulated sweat off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Avery.\u201d Morgan sighed, pushing past her demure-acting sister. \u201cOne day. LESS than one day, and you\u2019re making moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery ran alongside Morgan as they entered Pizza Palace. \u201cHe\u2019s super adorbs, Morgan! How could I help myself with a hot little guy like him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan didn\u2019t dignify that with a response, so Avery grew quiet. The twins met up with Quinn and a harried looking waitress. The waitress was dressed in a red blouse and black slacks, an outfit that wouldn\u2019t have been flattering if it wasn\u2019t a size too small. As it was, the blouse and slacks pressed hard against the girl\u2019s decently curvy body, creating a surprisingly alluring visual. A small nametag pinned to her breast read \u201cLila\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila brushed some of her long, frizzy brown hair out of her face, simultaneously rubbing sleep out of her eyes. \u201cYour table is\u2026*yawn*\u2026this way.\u201d She murmured, and then wandered off, the three girls following dutifully. As they walked, you finally finished reforming in Morgan\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you took in the sights of Pizza Palace. It was pretty big for a pizza restaurant, and it was almost packed to max capacity. Over fifty patrons filled the tables and booths, and five other waitresses bussed busily from customer to customer. You could make out a small play place and a few arcade machines in one corner, as well as the door to the kitchen in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila eventually gestured to an empty booth, and Quinn and Avery slid in, each girl taking a menu from Lila. Morgan was last, but before she sat, she gently dropped you onto the corner of the table. She then settled in, and picked up her own menu, and as you looked at Quinn and Avery, you found them both similarly consumed by reading their menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes for drinks.\u201d Lila explained, and each of your new roommates nodded or uttered an appreciative \u2018thanks\u2019. However, before she stepped back from the table, Lila spotted you, and the brown-haired waitress frowned. Her overwhelming exhaustion was blurring her vision, to say nothing of the fact that she\u2019d forgotten her glasses at home, but she could\u2019ve sworn there was a bug on the table. Frowning, she swatted it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were in no way a bug, but the far-sighted, weary waitress didn\u2019t know that. You couldn\u2019t even cry out before her giant hand slapped you off the table and onto the floor. Your new roommates didn\u2019t notice a thing, too busy scanning their menus. You could only splat down onto the floor, flattening out a bit from the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up, you looked and saw Lila take a step towards you, off to continue her waitress duties without a clue you were beneath her. As her black boot raised itself over you, you fought with all your might to move, before this little dinner excursion became a nightmare all onto itself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sadly, though you possessed the full motor functions needed to escape from Lila\u2019s boot in any other circumstance, the oblivious waitress simply wasn\u2019t giving you enough time to act. You\u2019d barely moved a muscle before her foot slammed down, and your miniscule body was smushed into a flat blob under her heel. Your body squelching barely made a noise, and as Lila walked off, both she and your three new roommates were totally unaware of the fate that had befallen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step Lila took only smashed your body into even more of a blob, and you were left utterly defenseless as you began to stick to the bottom of her boot. You had no idea where she was going, but as the soft carpet crashing into you was replaced with hard, smooth flooring, you had to assume she\u2019d entered the kitchen. This fact alone filled you with fear. A kitchen was never a place that a tiny like you would want to be without supervision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, fate wasn\u2019t giving you much of a choice in the matter, but it did throw you a bone, at the very least. Lila stopped for a second by the chef\u2019s counter, where there was a small, rough floor mat. Grinding her heels across the mat, Lila casually freed dirt and bits of food from the treads in her boots. She did this nearly a hundred times a day, so she spared no extra thought to the almost imperceptible feeling of a squishy blob rolling off her heel and onto the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, you were saved, but in no less dangerous a situation. Lying flat on the ground, you worked overtime on focusing your body to reform, and watched as Lila shuffled away, no doubt headed to get the drink requests from your roommates. She was replaced a moment later by the Pizza Palace chef, a pleasantly attractive redhead who had an apron tied across her blouse. She, too, nearly stepped on you, but thankfully missed by a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping back to normal size, you figured that trying to escape through the kitchen by yourself was a fool-hardy effort. A cursory glance around helped you to spot no less than two other chefs and three other waitresses tromping around the place, heedless to what lie beneath their feet. A single misstep could get you crushed to another girl\u2019s shoe, and if they didn\u2019t wipe their feet like Lila had, you could be stuck for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left getting someone\u2019s attention as your primary choice, and seeing as how one of the chefs was right beside you, you picked her as your target. The only downside was that the kitchen was abuzz with noise, whether it was beeping ovens, hissing steam from grills, or employee\u2019s shouting orders. There was no way you\u2019d be heard from down on the ground, so you took a deep breath and began climbing the counter beside you, the one the chef was standing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood of the counter had a few chips and cracks in it, which was exactly what you knew you\u2019d need to scale it. Using these imperfections as your handholds, you were able to rely on your fairly fit body and high capacity for stamina to scramble up the side of the counter. Eventually, you flopped onto the countertop, took a second to wipe sweat from your brow, and then you hustled over to the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you opened your mouth to speak, you hesitated, and that hesitation ended up costing you quite dearly. The chef had turned away from you, her hand resting right beside you. In her other hand was a gigantic glob of dough. On the counter around you was a rolling pan and a wooden pallet. The scent of dough and flour was overwhelming. Somehow, in all of your panic, you\u2019d yet to truly consider that the counter you were climbing was one where pizza was made. After all, you were smack in the middle of a hectic restaurant kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your same moment of hesitation, the chef turned back to face you, her hand gliding across the counter. As it did so, she accidentally back-handed you, flinging your miniature body backwards towards the center of the counter, beside the rolling pin. You collapsed onto your back, winded from the hit, and gasping for air so you could begin shouting. Looking up at the redheaded chef, you saw her gaze squarely locked on the electronic sign above you, which stated incoming orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026uh\u2026okay! Standard pepperoni! Easy peasy!\u201d The chef grinned with confidence. All while keeping her eyes on the electronic order sign, the hefted the chunky glob of dough up onto the counter, and let it fall from her hands, smacking down heavily. Of course, this also meant that it fell straight where you were, and with nowhere to run or escape to, you could only let out a strangled scream as you were buried under the mountain of dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally looking down, the chef went to work, blissfully unaware of the extra ingredient she\u2019d just added to her pepperoni pizza recipe. With the effortless ease of a professional, the chef kneaded and shaped the dough, using the rolling pin to squeeze it across the counter into the perfect shape of a world-class Pizza Palace pizza. With the application of the rolling pin, your body was mashed and mangled beneath the dough, buried and out of sight. All your attempts at screaming were muffled beyond human hearing capability, and it was far to heavy and pressuring to wriggle free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, with the pizza set in its basic shape, the chef turned to fetch the toppings and ingredients, humming a happy little tune. Desperate to not succumb to this fate, you bit through the dough overtop of you, clawing your way to freedom. It was disgusting, and you felt ready to burst from fullness after just a few bites, but finally you freed your head from the doughy pizza prison. The bright kitchen lights temporarily blinded you, so you squinted and shouted to the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE! HELP M\u2013\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cries were almost immediately silenced, as a heavy downpour of sticky, viscous red sauce rained from above, splattering onto the pizza. The sauce flooded into your mouth and soaked your head and hair, causing you to sputter and gag. It stung your eyes, but your arms were still too stuck to wipe away the sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing applying the sauce, the chef froze, and frowned. She leaned forward, frowned deeper, then glanced around. \u201cHuh\u2026could\u2019ve sworn I heard someone\u2026so weird!\u201d She sighed and laughed, turning to the next topping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving up sauce from your throat, you coughed rapidly and prepared to cry out again, efforts renewed by the knowledge that the chef could actually hear you. If you could just shout out again, you might genuinely be saved. However, before you could finish sputtering out the remnants of sauce clogging your throat, the chef returned with freshly sliced mozzarella, and rained it haphazardly across the surface of the pizza. Your only response was to widen your eyes and gurgle out an unheard cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appeared to be the largest bit of cheese slapped right into your face, shoving you back down into the dough and burying you from view. It also indented the dough a bit, which allowed the swamp of sauce to flood around you, submerging you completely. It was like you were being entombed in sauce, and everything became darkness. Only the knowledge that tinies couldn\u2019t drown kept you from falling into utter despair at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that despair resurfaced a few minutes later, as you felt the chef lift her creation up with the wooden pallet, and carry you across the kitchen. As the humidity of your pizza prison increased tenfold, and you heard a muted metallic bang, you knew that you\u2019d been place inside of the oven. In seconds, the temperature began to rise by extreme degrees, and you couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in agony (which only earned you another mouthful of sauce pouring in).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven was hell; there was really no other delicate way to put it. The pizza remained in for twenty minutes, during which you sweat so much that your whole body felt dried of moisture. Your skin sizzled and had burned bright red, a fact which you only vaguely realized helped your miniscule tiny body to blend in even more with the sauce all around you. Your head was faint and foggy, and you teetered on the edge of passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely took note of the pizza being retrieved from the oven and placed back on the counter. It was hard to remain focus. All desire to break free had left you after the ordeal in the oven, and you wished only to sleep. You had long since lost the strength to claw or eat your way out, especially now that the sauce, cheese, and dough had solidified around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate clearly wanted to prolong this torture, and wasn\u2019t content to merely kill you. The redheaded chef, still humming her happy song, sliced the pizza into nice symmetrical slices, narrowly avoiding bisecting your body. She then grabbed a nearby carton of fries and box of chicken strips, prepared for her by one of the other Pizza Palace chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got my next order?\u201d A voice said, and the chef turned to see Reagan, Pizza Palace\u2019s most experienced delivery worker. She had her motorcycle helmet under her arm, and her delivery bag slung over her shoulder. \u201cJust got back from a delivery, ready for the next one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you just like riding your motorcycle.\u201d The chef teased. \u201cBut, yes, I do have one ready.\u201d She reached for a to-go box, but stopped at the sight of Lila strolling back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila yawned, then spoke. \u201cIs there a pepperoni pizza ready to go for those three girls?\u201d She looked down at your pizza prison. \u201cOh. Yes there is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef held up a hand. \u201cHold on, Lila. Reagan wanted this pizza. Her delivery is also important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReagan shrugged. \u201cActually, give it to whoever. When was each order placed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef tapped her chin. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check. Give me a second\u2026\u201d She said, looking at the electronic order sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you barely heard any of this conversation, some innate part of you knew that your immediate future was hanging in the balance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your reaction was just a bit too slow, unfortunately, and you found your efforts to scramble out of the way useless as Lila\u2019s black boot stomped down onto the ground. Your body was crushed paper thin under her heel, the tiny squelching noise you made inaudible due to the laughter, chatter, and music of the Pizza Palace. Lila didn\u2019t have a clue in the world she\u2019d stepped on you, and even if she had, she genuinely might\u2019ve been too exhausted to stop and peel you free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, the weary waitress trotted off through the restaurant, in the direction of the play area near the back. She\u2019d been asked by her boss to tidy up some spilled snacks, as well as adjust the coin collector for one of the most popular games in Pizza Palace. This annoyed Lila to no end, but she wasn\u2019t about to talk back to her boss, as she needed this job too badly, even if it was a hellish, soul-sucking job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the arcade, Lila bent down and methodically scooped up the crumbs and food pieces left behind by careless patrons, yawning intermittently. You could do nothing but stay squished firmly under her shoe, your body having been squished over and over each time she took a step. Lila was far from a heavy girl, but her giant boot had still done quite a number on you. You still fought to reform, but it was mostly useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, it was useless until Lila approached the faulty arcade machine. It was a simple fix to adjust the coin collector and get the machine back up and running, but was Lila finished, she absentmindedly scraped her boot along the carpeted floor. Because you were flattened but not totally engrained in the treads of Lila\u2019s boot, your malleable body ripped free from her boot and was left behind on the ground as the titanic waitress took another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste your chance, you focused all your efforts on reforming and managed to pop back into normal shape. As you did so, you noted that you were right beside one of those traditional car racing machines with the makeshift driver\u2019s seat and steering wheel. It was partnered with an identical racing machine, no doubt to enable two people to compete against each other in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noted a girl standing right beside the machine, with her back turned to you. With how loud the Pizza Palace was, you doubted she would hear you from the floor, but you guessed that climbing higher would allow her to hear you. You didn\u2019t know this stranger, but you were placing your bets on her being willing to carry you back to your roommates. It beat trying to walk all the way back through the crowded restaurant, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that plan in mind, you hopped up onto the machine and scrambled up into the seat of the driving chair. You then pushed your upper body strength to the limit and scaled the back of the seat, all the way up to the headrest. It was tiring, but you made it in less than two minutes. Taking one split second to catch your breath, you were about to speak when the unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly twisted her hand backwards, and her giant fingers slapped into you. The air was knocked out of your lungs and you fell backwards with a silent cry. Splatting down onto the hard plastic of the seat, your body flattened out. Groaning, you began trying to reform again, even as the girl above you stepped aside to reveal a second girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! They just fixed the machine.\u201d The first girl, the one who had slapped you, said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that awesome, Zoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl (Zoe, apparently) who had yet to fully enter your view, laughed confidently. \u201cSure is! God, I love this game. Ready to get totally wiped?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl rolled her eyes, but smiled. \u201cYou take this way too seriously, Zoe?\u201d Laughing, she walked out of your sight, and you could hear her sit down in the adjacent seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Zoe herself stepped forward, and she was quite the sight. Tall, with nicely tanned skin, and shoulder-length red hair. She was wearing a stylish hoodie and a flashy red miniskirt, both of which accentuated her rather shapely body. You took particular notice of her large, alluring rear end\u2026especially as she stepped with a leg on both sides of you, and you stared right up at her as she began to sit. The reality of your situation finally hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it hit you too late, and a much more tangible and painful force hit you a second after that. Zoe\u2019s big bubble butt pounded down onto the seat, utterly obliterating you. To make matters worse, her miniskirt flared out as she sat, revealing her creamy butt cheeks and barely-there thong to the private audience of one helplessly trapped tiny. Her bare left cheek crashed onto you, slamming your almost reformed body back down flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe\u2019s hefty derriere barely fit in the confines of the racing chair, so the red head wiggled a little to get more comfortable. This had the disastrous consequence of grinding her ass cheeks back and forth across the plastic, smearing your body side-to-side as she wiggled in place. You mentally cried out for her to stop, but your mute pleas fell on deaf ears as Zoe continued to shift around. Her smooth flesh ground into your face, smudging your malleable body into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe eventually settled down, but the damage was done, and you were much flatter and compressed than before. All sounds of the outside world were muffled, but you could distinctly make out Zoe\u2019s confident boasts as she started up a competitive race with her friend. The race lasted five minutes, and each time Zoe jerked the wheel, her whole body twisted, meaty butt cheeks digging into your flesh. Every time she slammed the brakes to drift, her ass clenched, more pressure squeezing into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skilled red head won by a landslide, and gave her friend a cocky grin after it was over. However, as her friend stood up, Zoe herself was stopped from standing by a timid looking girl who had watched the race from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026d-do you think\u2026I-I could race you?\u201d The nervous girl inquired, stammering. \u201cI\u2019ll p-pay for your race\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe raised her eyebrows at the challenge, gave her friend a look, and then smiled at the nervous girl. \u201cHeck, why not? Sure thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anxious girl smiled appreciatively, put in a dollar for her ride and one for Zoe, and then a second round of competition began. Second verse, same as the first, from your perspective. More crushing and squishing from the oblivious red head who had so thoroughly dominated you with her impeccable booty. There was nothing you could do by now to try and fight against her, as you were much to crumpled and pancaked to attempt reforming, let alone speaking or wiggling to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe won the second race as easily as the first, but again before she stood, the timid girl\u2019s mother approached. Caught off guard, Zoe listened to the motherly giantess explain how much she played the game when she was younger, and her confidence in besting Zoe. She even offered up a five-dollar bet. Eyes glinting with the promise of high stakes, Zoe eagerly too up her offer, and a third race began. Zoe\u2019s friend, meanwhile, wandered off to order pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began the reign of the Racing Queen. The third match was the most intense yet, but eventually Zoe came out on top, eking out a first-place win by a hair. By this point, she was working up a hearty sweat from the pressure of maintaining her win streak, and that sweat was pooling around her doughy buttocks, creating a little swamp right where your tiny body was unfortunately wedged. You were thoroughly doused in sweat and the increasing stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her moist ass brought a grimace to Zoe\u2019s face, but she merely lifted her ass off the seat for a moment and then clapped it back down. Her pillowy left butt check utterly demolished you upon landing, squishing your miniscule body firmly into its hot, fleshy embrace. You felt yourself stick to both it and the chair in equal measure, and you began to genuinely fear you\u2019d become a tattoo on either Zoe or the seat if this lasted any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, last longer it did, and for quite a while. Zoe performed twenty flawless races in a row, the stakes for each growing higher and higher as nearly everyone in the Pizza Palace sought out the Racing Queen to challenge her. Her friend stood diligently beside her and supplied her pizza slices in between races, and after an intense but exciting hour, Zoe had raked in one hundred dollars in winnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the restaurant, Morgan was tearing her hair out looking for you, and was on the verge of tears. Trying to soothe her, Quinn and Avery promised that they\u2019d find you, but that Morgan needed to take a break. Apprehensive at first, Morgan eventually agreed, and she wandered off to calm her nerves. By chance, she ended up taking note of Zoe right as the red head was finishing another race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I really like this game.\u201d Morgan said by way of introducing herself. Zoe\u2019s recent victim wandered off sadly, and Morgan ended up sliding into the second seat. Zoe gave her new opponent a wide grin, and once more absentmindedly wiggled her prodigious rear end in her seat. By this point, you were more of a smear than a man, having suffered under this blissfully unaware girl for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp for a competitive race?\u201d Zoe offered to your beautiful roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded, and smiled back. \u201cProbably what I need right now, yeah. Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe caught the confident glint in Morgan\u2019s eye, and realized she had finally met a true rival. Steeling herself, she gripped the steering wheel tighter as the race began. Morgan did the same, totally oblivious as the how close her missing tiny roommate was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the race go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With your connection to the outside world completely cut off due to the crushing weight of your current captor. The only thing you knew about this girl was that her name was Zoe, she had a rather large, soft, butt, and she was evidently great at this stupid racing game. You didn\u2019t even know if your new roommates were looking for you or not. They could have easily gotten caught up in conversation, eaten some delicious pizza, then headed home without you. After all, you hadn\u2019t even lived for these three girls for a single night yet. You couldn\u2019t possibly expect them to keep your wellbeing as their main priority at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, almost as if fate was giving you just a taste of salvation, Zoe just then lifted her ass into the air. For her, she was merely airing out her now overwhelmingly sweaty ass cheeks that were beginning to stick to the firm, plastic seat. But for you it gave you the briefest connection back into the realm of normal people, and as she did though you heard a recognizable voice say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Cruising through California racetrack on the hardest difficulty sound good?\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe your ears, but it was Morgan\u2019s voice! If you could have known how hard she was looking for you before you would have been even more grateful to your hopeful savior, but even being close to someone you knew gave you a flash of positivity in this otherwise depressing situation. However, before you could get too excited, Zoe dropped her rear a few inches back onto the firm seat, obliterating you once more. Once again, reality became muffled and your entire world was sweaty ass above you with unforgiving plastic beneath you. Your fate was in Morgan\u2019s hands entirely, and she didn\u2019t even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Zoe said while grinning. She adjusted her seat forward an inch to make the seat even more tight around her tall and voluptuous frame. This increased the pressure on you yet again, but gave her a bit more control that she felt like she might need to beat Morgan. The two beautiful giantesses watched their respective screens as the countdown to the start flashed, until finally the green light signaled the start and they both slammed their feet onto the pedals. It was clear the two girls were neck and neck in terms of skill with this game, keeping pace with each other almost exactly. Of course, you had no clue about the outcome of the race. Your only way of discerning any information was how harshly Zoe would lean onto one cheek or the other as she took sharp turns, either crushing you worse or giving you the briefest of respites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround two minutes of torture (for you) later and exhilarating fun for the girls, they were reaching the final stretch of the race. Zoe was actually in the lead by a few car lengths, feeling confident that she would keep her tremendous win streak alive. However, out of seemingly nowhere, Morgan took a sharp turn and jumped across an entire out-of-bounds section of the track! Zoe\u2019s jaw dropped as Morgan\u2019s car landed far and away ahead of hers. Zoe shifted gears in desperation, but it was too late. Morgan\u2019s car zoomed across the finish line first, with Zoe a second behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Morgan exclaimed, pumping a fist in front of her, \u201cThat was a great race! I didn\u2019t tell ya this before but I have the console version of this game at home so I know all the shortcuts! You definitely would have had me if not for that!\u201d Having clearly enjoyed the competition, Morgan warmly talked to the girl beside her. Part of Zoe wanted to be mad about losing finally, but the overwhelming warmth and sincerity that Morgan was giving off mere seconds after seeming so competitive won her over. Zoe simply smiled back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed, not a single other person in here could come close to beating me. I\u2019ve gotta give credit where credit\u2019s due, you\u2019re really good at the game.\u201d Zoe then stood up for the first time in over an hour. For a brief moment it felt like you would be torn in half, with your body\u2019s squishy characteristics being stuck equally to the girls damp ass flesh as well as the plastic chair. But after a brief tug, you popped free of the giantess\u2019s derriere and snapped back into being a flat sticker on the seat of the chair. You watched as her red miniskirt fluttered back down, just barely covering the butt cheeks that you had gotten to know so well. Shaking yourself out of the physical distress you felt, you finally realized that Morgan must have won! Looking upwards now, Zoe continued to talk, \u201cHere the Player 1 seat is all yours, you\u2019ve earned it! It\u2019s probably about time for me to get out of here anyway! Hopefully I see you again sometime, I\u2019d love to have a rematch!\u201d You then watched the girl walk away, taking a moment to appreciate how attractive she was. In your head you thought shallowly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be squished left and right throughout time living on my own, I\u2019m at least glad it\u2019s underneath beautiful women like her or my roommates.\u201d You prided yourself upon being a positive person for the most part, despite finding yourself in a myriad of seemingly hopeless situations quite often due to your size. But of course as fate seemed to love to do to you, the second you thought about being thankful to be crushed by good looking girls, you saw Morgan\u2019s equally impressive ass stand up from the seat next to you. You saw that she had changed into ever so slightly less revealing athletic wear from earlier, but they still did nothing to hide her toned curves. You cried internally, assuming that once more you would be decimated under an unaware ass. At the very least this time you would be underneath someone you knew though. Ideally you would stick to her shorts, hitch a ride home, then unstick yourself when she changed later in the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready planning for more hours of pressure, you were confused when it didn\u2019t immediately come. You looked up to see not Morgan\u2019s buns, but her eyes, and they were staring right at you! Her face had a look of utter shock, as did yours. In this exact moment, a wave of relief washed over your body, not just for the current situation, but for the future too. Quinn\u2019s no-nonsense tough-love for tinies and Avery\u2019s overwhelming combination of flirtation and forgetfulness had led you to believe that you were going to end up crushed more often than not. But seeing how Morgan actually checked a seat before dropping her ass into it was a game-changer. Perhaps there was hope for you to live normally amongst these three girls after all! You knew that was a pipe dream, but the thoughtfulness of Morgan gave you just enough hope to keep that dream alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, Hunter!? Were you under that girl the entire time!? Have you been here since we got here!?\u201d Morgan said down to you. You weren\u2019t sure if she actually expected a response, or if she was just thinking out loud. You wished desperately that you could respond to your new friend, but you couldn\u2019t. And at just that moment another relatively younger woman approached the racing game setup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I saw you beat that girl who was beating everyone, you up to race me?\u201d She said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh actually I\u2019m just saving these seats for a moment, sorry. Maybe in a bit though!\u201d Morgan fumbled through her words slightly. In reality she loved competition and honestly did want to race this new girl. But her worry about your wellbeing was far more important at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually we have a policy here to not save seats on the games. You must either play or give the game up to whoever else wants it.\u201d The sleepy waitress from earlier approached the two. She really didn\u2019t want to get involved in a dispute of any kind, but once again she couldn\u2019t afford to lose her job for being caught not policing the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s mind raced with fear, she had no clue what to do. If she sat down and raced this girl, then she knew you would at least be safe, albeit crushed underneath her butt. Maybe she could beat this one girl super quick then work on freeing you. But part of her still would feel terribly guilty about crushing you intentionally. She thought briefly about texting Quinn or Avery to come and take the seat from her. It seemed like either her sister or her new roommate cared far less about squishing you than she did herself, so perhaps she would spare herself the agony of doing it herself. Lastly, her third option was to simply come clean to the waitress and the challenger about you. However she had no idea how Pizza Palace\u2019s policies towards tiny customers were. After so many years of society growing accustomed to tiny men, it was likely that they would be understanding, but some establishments still took advantage of the relatively relaxed policing towards the mistreatment of tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s mind jumped through the options, until finally she decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Morgan may have hated herself for considering it, she really didn't want to put you through the pain and torture of dealing with her ass, Avery might take it too far or even enjoy crushing Hunter, but Quinn on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked up, seeing her sister bouncing about from game to game excitedly, getting along with other people enjoying the arcade, and collecting whatever meager tickets her casual and playful enjoyment won her from each game. Quinn meanwhile, seemed utterly focused on the cyclone arcade game, up against a few other kids who were hoping to claim the now large jackpot waiting to be won. With a deep breath, and a concentrated look, Quinn smacked the button, hitting it right in the center and causing the ticket dispenser to shoot out her jackpot winnings, a small smirk on her face as she collected her winnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quinn!\" Morgan called out to her, prompting her attention, albeit in an uninterested gaze. \"Come try out this racing game! It's really fun!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, Jackpots really low now anyways...\" Quinn motioned to the Cyclone machine, before walking over with her tickets in hand. Morgan glanced down at you apologetically as she made way for Quinn. You did stick to her ass before, so with any luck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's intimidating shadow loomed over your squished frame as she came into your view. handing Morgan her tickets as she scooted into position to sit down, her jiggly ass filling your view before it came crashing down brutally and uncaring of your situation. Morgan couldn't help but frown, watching her curvy new roomie decimate her small new roomie by simply taking a seat, the leather seat giving out an audible, and almost mocking hissing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, beneath the enormous ass of Quinn, you already felt the heat rise dramatically! (Not like it was all that cool from the brief moment of freedom from being beneath anyone's ass) and the heat only amped up further, along with excruciating pain as Quinn shifted her hips back and forth, getting comfy in the seat. Was getting stuck to Quinn's ass really the best option? You couldn't help but wonder if you had better chances staying on the seat... You could just barely hear the outside world as you lay helplessly smashed between the leather seat and the copious amounts of ass flesh above and around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan winced as she saw Quinn shift about, along with the accompanying sounds of her ass dragging against the leather seat of the game. Quinn then paid the obligatory token amount and began racing the challenger. Every now and then, Quinn would readjust her ass as she played, apparently unable to get comfortable in the seat (Probably because it was made with kids in mind) the faint sound of her now sweating ass peeling off the leather could be heard, before it would come crashing back down on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn kept her uncaring demeanor even when racing. Or perhaps it was a look of focus, it was hard to tell with her this early in their friendship, Morgan thought. She just hoped Quinn would be willing to peel you off her ass again like earlier, and not condemn you to a whole night of arcade games before helping you out. Morgan quickly came to determine that it was indeed focus that Quinn was expressing, as during the race, she effortlessly took the lead against the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Quinn beat the girl, crossing the finish line with a healthy lead. Another small smirk flashed on her face before vanishing completely. The challenging girl huffed slightly, Quinn's relaxed attitude and lack of any emotion certainly didn't make her loss any more easier to take. Quinn looked over to Morgan. <br>\r\n\"That was fun. What now?\"<br>\r\nShe put her hand on the armrest, going to lift herself from the now sweaty chair, having just rose from the seat when another girl ran over.<br>\r\n\"That was awesome!\" the new girl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn opted to relax in her seat as she talked, dropping back in, causing the leather seat to hiss again.<br>\r\n\"Can you face me now? I just gotta try to beat you after that!\" She asked, and as she finished her sentence, some other girls, presumably her friends, came over, each seeming just as eager to take on the new Queen of the racing game. Morgan grimaced, this wasn't what she was hoping for at all, what was she going to do now!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shifted her ass in the slightly slick seat, the friction once again burning you and smearing you beneath her ginormous cheeks as she briefly pondered the request before saying:</span></div></div>",

A moment later though, and Avery was back to her normal self, no doubt consoling herself with the fact that she'd hang out with you later. Jumping out of her seat, she grabbed Quinn's arm and practically dragged the black-haired giantess out of the living room. Quinn tried protesting, but the infectious giggles of Avery drowned her out. The two soon disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with Morgan, the brown-haired girl stared at you caringly. \"What did you want to do, Hunter? Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \"Well, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That's a great idea!\" Morgan nodded, and began carefully walking out of the living room and upstairs. You were amazed by how deliberately and slowly she carried you, and it was genuinely hard to tell you were even moving if you closed your eyes and relaxed. Her soft palm was like a floating bed of wonder, whisking you away. Once upstairs, Morgan slipped through the first door and into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan showed off her room, and it was basically what you expected from someone like her. Her bed was tucked in and straightened, her clothes were neatly stored away in dressers and in the closet, and one corner of her room was taken up by a organized collection of exercise weights and training props. One other corner of the room was barren. The entire room was decorated in shades of tan and brown, a very earthy and natural feel. There was also a TV with what looked like a gaming console hooked up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess guardian gently placed you down on the corner of her bed. \"Well, this is it. Nothing too special, but I'm still really looking forward to living here for the next few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around the room. \"Yeah, I mean, it's super well-organized. Very neat. I bet you never lose anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled at your compliment, and moved to sit down. The sight of her descending gave you a brief moment of shock, which was entirely unjustified. Morgan was sitting on the opposite end of the bed, nowhere near you, and she was watching you the whole time. You were just jumpy around giant women, as you'd experienced your very fair share of mishaps over the course of your life. Still, it was a sight to behold, Morgan's firm butt pushing her compression shorts tightly against her as she bent down to sit, her weight displacing the mattress a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stretched her arms after she sat. \"My room is tidy, sure...I only wish Avery and Quinn were the same. Have you looked in the kitchen and bathroom yet? Those places are practically a mess, and we just moved in hours ago.\" She huffed, and stuck out her lower lip in a faux pout. \"It's a little annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you wanted, I could help you clean up.\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks.\" Morgan grinned, the faintest trace of a blush in her cheeks. \"That's super considerate. But...I don't know. Maybe I'll just destress with a good exercise. Nothing helps me more than getting in the groove and sweating out my issues.\" She looked over to where her exercise equipment was stored in the corner. \"Or...you and me could do something else entirely. I have some game consoles and stuff.\" She glanced back at you. \"Honestly, you decide. I'm no good with so many choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took you back a bit, but you didn't want to let your new roommate down, so you thought for a second before replying.</span></div></div>",

That sounds amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a slightly weary thumbs up, and inquired. \"Then how about you and I hang out the rest of the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds totes perfect, Hunter! Hop on!\" She said, slapping her open palm down onto the coffee table, nearly squishing you in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up onto Avery's outstretched hand, you caught sight of Morgan's somewhat reserved expression, as well as Quinn's trademark indifference. No doubt Morgan had a few reservations about you hanging out with her airheaded sister, but she smiled again a moment later. Standing up, Morgan offered her hand to Quinn, helping the black-haired giantess to her feet, and then the two girls strolled away into the kitchen, perhaps to talk for a bit while having a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with Avery, the pink-haired girl looked at you with adoring eyes. \"What'cha wanna do, Hunter? Like, any fun ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \"Well, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Awesome!\" Avery nearly squealed with delight, before sprinting out of her room and up the stairs. For a spilt second, you nearly flew out of her hand, before her palm closed tightly around you, dainty fingers crushing your painfully and flattening you up to your head. You honestly weren't sure if this was any better than flying away, and could only look up uselessly at Avery's sexy, beaming face, as she was holding you too tightly to move. Were you getting in too deep and too fast with her? Hopefully not. Eventually, she reached her bedroom on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery showed off her room, and it was right in the same ballpark as how you would've guessed. It was relatively organized, but filled to the brim with personal belongings. There were a large number of dressers and drawers for clothes, a sprawling make-up table, and even a full-size mannequin currently wearing a sparkly white dress. There was hardly any free space, and the whole room was colored in a wide assortment of rainbow hues, though mostly bright pinks, blues, and reds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the totes cute private quarters of Princess Avery!\" Avery declared dramatically, adopting a silly posh accent as she spoke. She finished with a flourishing spin, in which you finally slipped out of her grasp and fluttered down onto the corner of her bed, still slightly mushed. You sighed at the ditzyness of your new roommate, and began focusing on reforming, your limbs slowly inflating back to normal. As you reformed, you looked up at Avery finishing her twirl, only for the giantess to then back up towards you and begin to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in one day, an ass of meteoric proportions descending towards you from above, shadows falling over you. Though not comparable to Quinn's humongous derriere, Avery's was no less succulent nor threatening, most of the girl's tanned, curvy buttocks revealed because of her barely-there booty shorts. You only just had enough time to reform your arms and scramble away, crawling frantically as her booty plopped down onto the bed right where you had been. Even still, her bare thigh caught your right leg, pinning you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avery! Hey!\" You cried up at her, catching her attention. Glancing down at you, Avery blinked in surprise and then smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! How'd you end up there, cutie?\" Avery smirked, grabbing your upper body and yanking you out from under her thigh. She then held you in front of her beautiful face, leaving you to dangle as she kept smiling at you. Your legs reformed, and you wished she'd put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say so, she spoke first. \"So, like, what's the plan, man? Hee hee. We can do whatevs you want, Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to drop the issue of being dangled like a doll for the moment, you thought about her question. Apparently, you took too long for her mile-a-minute attitude, because she began rambling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, we could pull a prank on someone, that would be so funny!\" Avery smirked mischievously. \"I always pull pranks on Morgan, but now we've got Quinn to mess with! She seems like a totes tough nut to crack, so we need to be uber smart with her.\" Avery winked at you. \"But, you'll help out, right cutie? The pranks we could do with a squishy man like you...ooh!\" Avery looked absolutely ecstatic, and you didn't know whether to find that terrifying or endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Avery glanced over to her closet, and frowned. \"Ah man, totally forgot about my missing box.\" She looked at you sadly, like a pouting puppy dog, and explained. \"One of my boxes of clothes got lost. It had some of my favorite, comfy stuff in it. Like thongs, and bras, and bikinis, and skirts, and stuff. Just the best, most cute outfits. It'll suck to replace those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\" You said, and you sincerely meant it. Losing belongings was always a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smiled genuinely at that, perhaps the first smile that wasn't one of her giddy, energetic ones. A moment later though, and Avery began staring at you intently, her eyes focusing in on you to a degree that almost felt a bit scary. It was like she was analyzing you, and you could nearly make out the gears turning in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Avery's face broke into a huge, playful grin, and she blurted out her plans for spending the day with you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOMG, Hunter! I totes thought of the absolute, best, funniest prank!\u201d Avery gushed excitedly. The pink-haired giantess bounced enthusiastically on her bed, and you really, really wished she would put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to form a coherent thought despite all the shaking, you spoke up. \u201cW-well\u2026what kind of prank is it, Avery?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s Cheshire grin was irresistibly cute, while still possessing a disconcertingly mischievous hint to it. \u201cWe gotta prank Quinn, little dude! You\u2019re totes perfect for it, so I was kinda thinking of some funny stuff to do, and then it hit me!\u201d The bubbly giantess paused for a moment, and bit her lip tentatively. Looking at you with downcast eyes, she curled her sensual lips into a pout. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me\u2026right, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a twenty-one-year-old man with minimal experience with giantesses outside of your immediate family, you were putty in her hands. Almost dreamily, you nodded and smiled. \u201cS-sure thing, Avery. Anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery\u2019s expression burst into joy, and she giggled happily. \u201cAw, thanks, cutie! Love ya so much!\u201d She exclaimed, then rushed you up towards her mouth before you could react. An attempt at crying out left you the instant Avery pressed you into her plush lips, embracing your entire body in an enveloping hug of pleasure. Rational thought left your mind as Avery\u2019s lips caressed your body, easily overtaking your one-inch form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was blissful, and far too short form your perspective, as Avery pulled you away after ten seconds of kissing, ending with a resounding \u2018smack\u2019 noise. You were coated in a bit of moisture from her lips, and practically panting for breath. Noting your obvious enjoyment of her kiss, Avery snickered playfully, a faint blush in her own cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, cutie! Your reward for being such an adorable lil\u2019 trooper!\u201d Avery explained. \u201cBut, enough of messing around. Pranks are serious business, right? We don\u2019t cut corners around here!\u201d Avery wagged her finger. \u201cThis could be a little uncomfy for ya, Hunter, but totes worth it in the end. I hope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout explaining herself further, Avery moved her palms together, angling you between them. Still riding the high of her kiss, you didn\u2019t process what was about to happen until it was too late. The ditzy giantess clapped her hands together, demolishing your tiny body and slamming you flatter than paper. By rubbing her palms in circles afterwards, Avery mashed your malleable body into a circular shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was racing into overtime now at this drastic change in your situation, but Avery wasn\u2019t done yet. Powerless to fight her now that you were crushed, you could only grimace and blush further as Avery smoothed you out into a perfect circle, then effortlessly tore your clothes off with a single swipe of her well-manicured fingernails. You were left stark naked in her hand, a fact that brought a grin to Avery\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for taking this for the team, Hunter.\u201d Avery smiled playfully, flicking her eyes across your body. \u201cOMG, you are a looker, huh? Gawd, so cute!\u201d She winked at you, and then reigned herself back in. \u201cAnyway\u2026time to sneak into Quinn\u2019s room. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019s still downstairs, so we can be all quiet like ninjas! Uber pretty ninjas!\u201d She giggled with a lilt, and then crept out of her room and down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Quinn\u2019s room was empty, allowing Avery to waltz in unobstructed. As she entered the room, carefully maneuvering around the mess of clothes and belongings strewn about, she made her way to a dresser by the wall. On top of the dresser, there was a black bra, pair of panties, t-shirt, and shorts lying out. Avery came to a stop in front of the bra, and the smile on her face sent shivers of fear down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkiedokie, Hunter! Here we are!\u201d Avery whispered excitedly. \u201cWhen we were moving in earlier, I totes saw Quinn set these clothes out all purposefully and stuff. It\u2019s gotta be what she\u2019s wearing tomorrow. SO! I\u2019m gonna stick you to her bra, where you can hide out or whatever, and then when she goes to put it on tomorrow, you can leap out and spook her! Or maybe tickle her! Or, or, or\u2026bite her, or something! Whatever you want, hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, lost in her own imagined enjoyment of your future shenanigans, didn\u2019t feel your frantic, panicked wiggles and squirms of terror. She merely moved her hand over the inside of the left cup of Quinn\u2019s bra, and then dropped you inside. Your body sank into the cup, sliding down to the very bottom of the curve, and coming to rest. The sides of the cup arched up all around you, creating a funnel of vision that just barely revealed Avery\u2019s radiant face out of the top. You were remained of just how utterly massive Quinn\u2019s chest was, which brought equal feelings of anxiety and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner-in-crime, however, frowned. \u201cUgh, wait. Your tone totally clashes with the bra. She\u2019ll she you right away. Plus, you look like you\u2019d slide around easily, not stick.\u201d Avery sighed, demonstrating surprising thoughtfulness. Unfortunately, that thoughtfulness continued, albeit down a dangerous path. \u201cGimme a sec, Hunter. Be back in a jiffy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery skipped away, leaving you all alone in Quinn\u2019s bra. Wanting no part in a prank this ill-conceived and intimate, you tried to reform. Alas, you made no progress by the time Avery returned. Helpless, you couldn\u2019t do a thing as she fished you out of the bra cup and laid you out on the dresser beside Quinn\u2019s delicates. In her hand was a small bottle of some sort of polish liquid, and in her other, a brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you need a touch-up, mister!\u201d Avery giggled, trying and failing to sound serious. With an adorable look of concentration on her face (complete with tongue sticking out), Avery dipped the brush into the bottle, and then proceeded to paint all over your tiny body, vigorously and thoroughly. The polish was chillingly cold, freezing your skin, but you couldn\u2019t do much to stop Avery now. Any opportunity of convincing her to stop this ridiculous prank was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, your entire body, crushed into a small circle as it was, was perfectly and uniformly colored black. Avery hadn\u2019t missed a spot, and had even found polish with the same exact black consistency as Quinn\u2019s bra. Side-by-side, you realized that you matched it entirely, and that realization genuinely made your blood run cold. Did Avery even realize the position she was about to put you in? Probably not, knowing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery picked you up, smiling happily at her good job, then replaced you into the bra cup. This time, she applied extra pressure herself, rubbing you down in place. Her fingers massaged your body into the fabric of the bra cup, until you felt yourself firmly sticking in place. Actually, it felt more like the sticky polish that had painted you black was adhering to the fabric of the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully (or perhaps not), Avery elaborated after she finished molding you into place. \u201cSo, this handy dandy polish stuff is totes super-sticky. Glues itself to pretty much anything. Now, you should be in no danger of slipping out or coming undone.\u201d Avery twirled a strand of her hair. \u201cActually, it could take some extreme measures to even get you out as well. Isn\u2019t that amazing? There\u2019s no way our prank can fail now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shattered at that last remark, as it fully dawned on you that Avery had just painted you to blend into a black bra perfectly, then essentially perma-glued you in place. With the polish already hardening, it sank in that you truly were now incapable of movement. On top of that, the polish coating sealed over your face, keeping you entirely flat and thus incapable of speech. How could you even prank Quinn, at this point? The only visible part of you was your miniscule, beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirheaded Avery was oblivious to this though, and all she did was blow you a kiss, sauntered out of the room, and turn of the lights, leaving you well and truly alone. For the first hour you tried to reform just out of desperation, but it was hopeless. Avery had done far too good a job painting you and ironing you into place. You were locked into this now, whether you wanted to or not. In fact, it\u2019d take help from Avery, or perhaps Quinn, to even get you loose now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed with nothing but silence to keep you company. Meanwhile, Avery spent the rest of the day chatting and hanging out with Morgan and Quinn. She made up a lie about you being tired and resting in her room to cover for your disappearance. Your new roommates bought it, and no one thought twice about you that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate in the night, the lights flicked on as Quinn strolled into the room. You weren\u2019t able to glimpse her, but you could hear her stripping out of her clothes, doing one last check of her phone, and then climbing into bed. The lights went out again, and after a while, you could faintly hear soft breathing. Quinn was asleep. Taking her cue, you gave up your fruitless fights and allowed yourself to slip off to slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awakened around eight o\u2019clock the next morning by the sound of Quinn moving around. The lights were on again, and after blinking to adjust your vision, you saw the utterly enrapturing sight of a topless Quinn standing beside her dresser. Thoughts of panic or unease fled your mind and were replaced by amazement and awe. Quinn\u2019s breasts were massive normally, but towering above you and fully nude, it was like gazing at a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, and Quinn angled herself to peer down at her bra. Miraculously, her eyes actually seemed to snap right onto your body, and a small frown crossed Quinn\u2019s face. At that moment, you suddenly realized that you weren\u2019t so sure you even wanted to be seen by her. How would she react? What would happen if she was annoyed? Or even angry?</span></div></div>",

You wouldn\u2019t mind doing a favor for me, wouldya cutie?\u201d Avery asked with a lilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hanging in the air between her fingers, you kind of felt like you didn\u2019t have much of a choice, but you still asked anyway. \u201cUm\u2026well it depends on what kind of favor, Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, still radiating mischief, but her lip cutely. Apparently even she was a tiny bit apprehensive of what she wanted to ask you. \u201cW-well\u2026basically I was thinking\u2026ya know?\u201d Avery hesitated, and sort of wiggled a little while seated, the dictionary definition of adorable anxiety. Though you were apprehensive of what this flirty, ditzy girl had planned, she was incredibly cute\u2026even if you could still picture yourself lying on the corner of her mattress, stuck under her while she was doing all this squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cListen, Avery. No need to be scared. I am willing to help if you\u2019ll just explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-haired giantess\u2019 cheeks actually flushed red. \u201cO-oh, I\u2019m not scared\u2026just\u2026\u201d She put her finger to her chin. \u201cYou tiny cuties are all squishy and stretchy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you saw that earlier today. When Quinn sat on me.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I mean\u2026like\u2026SUPER squishy and stretchy. Like, you can be molded and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small feeling of dread welled up inside of you, but you pushed on regardless. \u201cSure, yeah. It\u2019s kind of like our defensive mechanism. A tradeoff for being born like this.\u201d You admitted, even if you felt that being squishy and stretchy was often directly the cause of so much trauma and torment throughout your life. You refrained from telling this to Avery, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery perked up. \u201cAh! That\u2019s totes what I thought! So you\u2019d be willing to help me out with my favor then, right cutie?\u201d She leaned a little closer to you, winked flirtatiously, then exhaled. A cool, minty breath brushed past her luscious lips and over your tiny body, lightly blowing you in the wind. You momentarily lost all sense of self, the cool caress of Avery\u2019s breath tickling your body, her minty fresh scent overwhelmingly satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brief moment of lost composure, you nodded without even thinking. \u201cUh\u2026yeah, of course. I\u2019ll help you out, Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery lit up like the night sky twinkling with stars, grinning widely and blissfully. \u201cAw! Thank you so much! You\u2019re a lifesaver, Hunter!\u201d Without warning, she puckered her lips and leaned just an inch closer, but it was enough. No time to brace yourself, Avery\u2019s plush lips made contact with your body, your miniscule frame utterly dwarfed by their magnitude. Though the kiss only lasted a second, it enveloped your entire being in a warm and stimulating embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour affectionate new roommate pulled back with a satisfied smile on her face. You had to take a deep breath after the kiss, both to get your lungs refilled and to calm yourself down. You really didn\u2019t want Avery to take note of what was going on in your pants right now, lest her endless teasing and flirting never cease. You also wiped away a trail of moist saliva left behind on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuirking her mouth to the side, Avery\u2019s blush lit up again. \u201cYa know, I might be falling in love, Hunter. You\u2019re totes my new bestie, that\u2019s for sure!\u201d The giantess giggled, and her harmonious voice filled you with an overwhelming sensation of happiness. It was like her own love and joy was washing over into you. It became harder and harder to want to resist her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were snapped back to reality a second later, as Avery squeezed her palm tightly around your body, mashing you into a flat blob. It happened so quickly you didn\u2019t even process what had happened to you until the deed was done. One moment you were being held, teased, and kissed by your new gorgeous (if not airheaded) roommate, the next you were putty in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Avery in terror, your blood ran cold at the almost casual expression on her face, as if she didn\u2019t care what she had done to you. For a horrible moment, you thought Avery\u2019s nice and cute attitude was all an act, and her true colors were shining forth, but then you remembered that you\u2019d agreed to help with her favor. The favor she\u2019d requested right after asking you about your squish and stretchy nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to mentally scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware to your mute pleas, Avery began to methodically mold and squish your body, kneading you with her fingers. \u201cSo, basically, I gotta use your squishy and stretchiness, lil\u2019 guy! Ya know how I talked about my missing clothes? Some of those are super-duper important over the next few days, like, uber important. I totes can\u2019t buy new clothes this suddenly\u2026but I can absolutely ask my adorable new roommate to replace them! How awesome is that?\u201d Avery giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full weight of her favor dawned on you, and you fought with every fiber of your being to break free from Avery\u2019s grip, or at least get your frustration with her across. She was planning on molding you into clothing, and then wear you! She hadn\u2019t even hinted at this being her end goal from the start, and you felt lied to and cheated. You never would\u2019ve agreed to this otherwise. Sadly, Avery was much to thorough with squashing your malleable body, and your attempts to squirm were useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been molded into clothing only twice before in your life, and both times had been incredibly humiliating and painful experiences. Your younger sister, Tracy, had once gotten angry at you as a kid, and had squished you into a hairband. This was before she\u2019d matured in her attitude, and became the loving sister you cherished so dearly. She was a little demon for a few years in elementary school, and this was during that time. She wore you to keep her hair in a ponytail for a week before your mother caught wind and freed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time was at the hands of your mother, and was three times as bad. After being laid off from her job, she\u2019d come home at midnight from a night of drinking, and stumbled into your room mumbling about needing a new skirt. Drunk out of her mind, and giggling incessantly, your mother had grabbed you and stretched you to your limits, molding you into a simple but cute skirt, despite your protesting screams. Worse still, after collapsing into bed, your mom awoke the next morning with a raging hangover and no memories of the previous night. She\u2019d merely spotted her \"<i>new skirt</i>\", slipped it on, and went about her day. She wore you five times over a two-week period before finally realizing what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in no hurry to repeat these past traumas, but Avery was obviously oblivious to that as she kept working your body. Eventually, she hooked her perfectly manicured fingernails into your chest, and with a small flick of her wrist, tore your clothes right off. You were now fully naked in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery, for the only time since you\u2019d met her, demonstrated surprisingly reasonable (if no less frustrating) logic when speaking up. \u201cSo, your totes naked now. If you\u2019re, like, wondering why, it\u2019s \u2018cuz clothes would give you away to anyone looking at you! I mean, I asked you to be MY clothes, so you don\u2019t need your own! Duh!\u201d She finished with another giggle before clapping her hands together, making your body a perfectly flat shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could convey to her how she had never once specifically asked you to be clothes for her, but it was far too late for that. Unless Morgan or Quinn walked in right now, saw what was going on, and stopped Avery, your fate was entirely in her gorgeous, scatterbrained hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the plan, Hunter. I have a few options for you, so that\u2019s fun! One: I totes need a new thong, and I have a feeling you\u2019ll be an uber soft and comfy replacement for my old one. Two: I\u2019ve been wanting a new skirt. One that shows off my pretty legs and kinda like flows a bit, ya know?\u201d She said all this while stroking your body. As soon as you heard the word \u2018<i>skirt</i>\u2019, your blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then third: I need a sock. And, you\u2019re probs like, what? A single sock? Yeah\u2026I totes ruined my other cute one by ripping it one a loose nail in my old house. Now I just have one little sock. Hee hee! I\u2019m such a klutz!\u201d Avery laughed, then lifted her foot above you and wriggled her toes. Her dainty, smooth foot smelled heavenly, but you had a horrible feeling it wouldn\u2019t be that way for extended periods of time. \u201cSo, yeah! Those are the options!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the ditz she had proven to be, the pink-haired giantess waited a minute, presumably for you to pick your option. It was only after your total inability to talk registered with the girl that she slapped her head and smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you can\u2019t talk, huh? That\u2019s funny! Guess I\u2019ll pick for you!\u201d Avery wistfully tilted her head back and forth in an exaggerated show of thinking. You could only keep trembling with fear in her hand, your fate left fully to her. This favor had spiraled way out of control. Avery spoke up again. \u201cAnd, don\u2019t worry, lil\u2019 cutie. This\u2019ll only be for a few days, maybe a week at most. Then I can go shopping again. Also, this\u2019ll be the last time I talk to you until the favor is done! Can\u2019t be chattin\u2019 up my clothes, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flirty, horribly tone-deaf wink, and a last wave of horror hitting you, Avery reached a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I'll make you into a thong. I figure that one should be the most fun for you.\" Avery said, giving you an exaggerated wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed internally at what you had just heard. You wanted to scream out loud, but Avery's squeezing hands had smushed your mouth away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's try this out...\" Avery's fingers jumped into action, gripping and tugging on your squishy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a tiny person, you'd been stretched countless times, but it never got any easier. Your body desperately wanted to snap back into its natural form, but Avery's fingers easily overpowered your natural elasticity. It was hard to identify individual body parts at this point, but you felt your \"arms\" tugged in either direction, stretched wide like you were going to be hugging someone. Avery tied them together at the ends, ensuring the only thing you'd be hugging was her hips. Your legs came next, dragged down and then up to the arm knot, where they were tied as well. From there, the shape was mostly right, and Avery just went about final adjustments, ensuring you were the right size and smoothing out any bumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada!\" Avery said, presenting your now thongified form to the mirror. As your disorientation from being molded cleared, you got a good look at your new form. You were nearly completely indistinguishable from a real thong. The only giveaway was that your eyes were faintly visible in the spot where what was left of your face had ended up. Your panic only increased when you realized that that spot was right in the middle of the back of the thong, ensuring your face would be buried between her butt cheeks. This fact wasn't lost on Avery either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're going to have a lot of booty in your future. Lucky you.\" Avery said with a giggle, bringing you down towards her feet. She couldn't wait any longer to put you on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as Avery's giant foot swung over you, reflexively terrified by the sight of giant soles after a life as a tiny man. But when her feet slipped through your holes, your priorities shifted to a much more pressing threat: Avery's gigantic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a good look Hunter. This booty is your responsibility now. I hope you can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made one last attempt to scream, but your mouth was still squished. There was no way for you to communicate with Avery as she pulled you upwards, rushing you towards her looming butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision with her cheeks forced your body even thinner to squeeze in between them. The smooth butt flesh rubbed against your face as you were dragged deeper into the abyss of her crack. When she stopped pulling you up, you were in complete darkness. There was nothing butt walls of butt cheek in every direction as they molded around your new thong form. Meanwhile, you could feel a light tickle on your legs as she adjusted the front of the thong, dragging them against the short field of hair up front. Your only consolation was that she hadn't pulled you up any further. The last thing you needed was to be pushed up against your new roommate's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, I was right, you make a super comfy thong Hunter.\" Avery said, completely unaware of how unpleasant this was for you. She looked at her ass in her mirror, eyes tracing along the thong as it disappeared between her butt cheeks. \"Cute too. Too bad no one will be able to see you under my clothes. Maybe when we get a beach day in I'll make you into a bikini bottom and show you off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Avery was already falling in love with your new thong form. Would she even turn you back? You'd decided she was a nice girl when you'd met her, but in truth you barely knew her. For all you knew, she could decide she'd rather have a pair of living underwear than a tiny roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl continued to prattle on: \"And I definitely can't tell Quinn and Morgan about this. If they knew how comfortable you were they'd probably want to wear you too, and then you'd never get a break. Plus, their butts aren't as cute as mine.\" Avery decided to emphasize this point by smacking her ass, causing her cheeks to collide as they reverberated from the impact. Your mouth had reformed enough to scream at this point, but there was nowhere for your screams to go. They just echoed around between Avery's butt cheeks, trapped in the abyss with you. \"Anyway, I'm sure this week before my new clothes arrive is going to fly by for both of us. And I can already tell you that even after my new thongs arrive, I'd be happy to wear you again if you get nostalgic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved at least to hear that Avery still planned to turn you back at the end of the week. But the fact that she thought you might just want to be her thong again for fun showed that she had no idea what you were going through in her butt, which did not bode well for the upcoming week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to stop talking to you now Hunter, it's time for me to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Go out dancing! (Avery is going out dancing with Morgan, maybe they convince Quinn to come as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Go to my exercise class with Morgan! (Spin class or Barre class, I don't want to do yoga since that comes up in Morgan's gym route)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Writer's Choice<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go out dancing!\u201d Avery proudly declared. \u201cMorgan and I have been dying to visit that new night club that opened up a few weeks back.\u201d The pink-haired giantess paused for a moment, then gasped. \u201cOMG! I can ask Quinn to come too! That\u2019d be totes awesome! The three of us\u2026and you, Hunter.\u201d Avery giggled, stroking your taut limbs hugging her hips. \u201cFor real though, last time talking to you, Hunter. See you in a week\u2026or so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word this time, Avery immediately stopped mentioning you, and went about digging out an appropriately sexy outfit from her closet and drawers to wear to the night club. Her slightest shifts in movement caused you immeasurable discomfort, but it was slowly dawning on you that, unless a miracle saved you, your week of suffering with Avery was only going to get significantly worse from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ditzy girl eventually settled on a risqu\u00e9 pink miniskirt and matching halter top that showed off most of her lean stomach. She took another minute to touch up her make-up before dashing out of her room, practically skipping downstairs. You mentally groaned as her thick ass cheeks chewed up your malleable body, each step causing her booty to jiggle and squeeze into your elongated form. This was hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling into the living room, Avery found Morgan and Quinn, and she struck a dramatic pose and winked. \u201cWho's gonna hit up the club with me? Huh?\u201d She asked, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked her twin in the eye for a second before sighing. \u201cOh, I totally forgot about that. You really want to do that tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery nodded happily. \u201cUh huh. It\u2019ll be kinda like a celebration for moving in. It\u2019ll totes be fun, too! Hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan rolled her eyes, but stood up from the couch and stretched. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go. IF ONLY to stay sober and drive your sorry butt home when you get plastered. You drink way too much when we got out to clubs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery gave her sister a mischievous smirk, and didn\u2019t dispute her statement. She merely turned to Quinn and winked. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to come with, Quinn. Have some fun dancing and drinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the mild surprise of the twins, Quinn nodded and also stood. \u201cSure, whatever. Sounds nice, I guess.\u201d She said, and with that being her only explanation, she walked away and up to her room. Morgan followed, and the two girls took about fifteen minutes to get ready. Avery passed the time by looking at her phone and pacing, her constant movement grinding her thick butt cheeks mercilessly against your body. You begged for her to stop, but your silent mental pleas obviously didn\u2019t reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Quinn returned, dressed for a night out. Morgan had changed into a simple but attractive red dress, and seemed to be slightly anxious about wearing one, as it wasn\u2019t too typical of her. On the subject of typical, Quinn had slipped into a black blouse and black skinny jeans. The simplicity of the outfit really fit her, as did the literal FIT of the clothes. Even Avery was ever-so-slightly taken aback by how snuggly Quinn\u2019s jeans hugged her shapely rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA possible flirtatious remark died on Avery\u2019s lips when Morgan cut her off. \u201cHunter is with you, right?\u201d She inquired, while beginning to walk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery paled, but recovered quickly. \u201cUh\u2026no. No. He\u2019s upstairs. Didn\u2019t think a night club would be too safe, and he was really tired. Looked super cute all snuggled up on my bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, approaching her car and not looking back at her twin, shrugged. \u201cAw, that\u2019s a shame. Oh well. Don\u2019t forget him when we get back.\u201d Just like that, Morgan dropped the issue. Had she seen the overtly conspicuous look on Avery\u2019s face, she\u2019d be more concerned, but she hadn\u2019t. As such, she had no reason to not trust her sister\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn gave Avery a look with a raised eyebrow, but said nothing. The three roommates piled into Morgan\u2019s car and were off to the night club. You hadn\u2019t heard a word of any conversation while trapped deep in Avery\u2019s sweltering ass, as most sounds were muffled. However, it didn\u2019t take a genius to guess your surroundings as Avery plopped into the passenger\u2019s seat, her bubble butt compressing as she wiggled to get comfortable. Any spare space you had was gone in an instant, your entire being enveloped in slick ass flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was not more than fifteen minutes, but it practically felt like an eternity to you. The faintest bump in the road caused crazy vibrations in Avery\u2019s doughy buttocks, which of course reverberated right back onto you. Not only was the tightness of your confines painful, the strain on your tiny limbs hugging Avery\u2019s wide hips tiring, and the ever-growing sweat and stench overwhelming, but this entire scenario was humiliating beyond belief. You were furious at Avery for using you like her own personal object, while at the same time acknowledging that she really was just an airheaded girl who didn\u2019t know how horribly she was truly treating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the night club, the three girls hurried inside, and found the club to be packed to the brim with inebriated partiers and over-worked security guards. Avery, utilizing her rather lucrative salary as a model, purchased tickets with ease, and your giantess roommates eventually wormed their way through the crowd and found an empty booth to sit at and take stock of their bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark in the club, and the music was blaring loud and the lights were pulsing constantly. Even inside of Avery\u2019s butt, you could still hear the pounding of the dance music bass. Admittedly though, it was hard to focus on the music, as the more pressing issue was the heat. Inside the packed night club, the temperature had risen substantially, and this was reflected by copious amounts of sweat beginning to roll off Avery\u2019s buttocks and soaked your body. An unpleasant stench also built in intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to all of this, Avery waved to her sister and new friend, and then skipped off on her own, eventually finding her way to the bar. Throwing down some cash granted Avery a succulent alcoholic beverage which she drained in seconds, followed instantly by a refill. Avery was as lightweight as they came, and already feeling the effects of her sobriety flying out the window, Avery giggled and stumbled onto the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy chance, the club had just begun to blare one of Avery\u2019s favorite songs. A dopey grin spreading on her beautiful face, Avery let loose an excited squeal that rang as a chorus with all of the other partiers. She then began to unleash herself on the dance floor, joining the rest of the club\u2019s patrons in jumping around, spinning in circles, and twerking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Avery rocketed into motion, your night became twice as horrible. The miniskirt she was wearing was sexy as hell, but hardly tight on the same level as Quinn\u2019s jeans. Because of this, Avery\u2019s might derriere swung side-to-side with her movements, jiggling and swaying like she did. Her butt cheeks clapped and slammed together in time with the music, crunching up your thong-shaped body and mashing you painfully, over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Avery\u2019s miniskirt had ridden up a bit, leaving a fair bit of her gorgeously eye-catching booty out for all to see (and it did draw quite a few eyes). Still, Avery was too far gone to care, and she merely laughed gleefully as she continued dancing. With each movement, your body was drawn up more and more into the embrace of her buttcheeks, sweat, stench, and darkness becoming your entire world. Your visual human features were also beginning to fade due to the constant smearing and smashing of your battered, bruised form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Avery stumbled in a haze back to the bar and chugged another alcoholic drink. She felt as light as a feather, and happier than she\u2019d been in weeks. Dreamily, she sighed, wishing that her adorable new roommate had come along to the club instead of staying at the apartment (because yes, of course airheaded, scatterbrained Avery had already forgotten what she\u2019d done to you because of her inebriation, believing her own made-up excuse for you instead of remembering the truth).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Avery figured she could just find someone else to flirt with, or else dance until she dropped from exhaustion. Requesting a fourth drink, Avery absentmindedly scratched at her butt, and hiked her thong up just a bit more. It was slick with seat, but still comfy and supportive. Of course, Avery had no clue in the world that adjusting her underwear so casually only truly succeeded in mashing your face up into her asshole, wedging you in the darkest, deepest part of her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her drink, Avery grinned lazily. This was such a great night!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avery finds a platform of tiny guys in the dance club, gets dangerously close to them, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery tilted her glass upside down as she took down the drink in one go. Savoring the sweet flavor of the cocktail, she took an extra beat before lowering the glass from her face. When she did she saw the familiar faces of Morgan and Quinn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyy guys! This place is awesome, right!?\u201d Avery exclaimed, throwing an arm around the neck of both her sister and her new friend. \u201cI love the music and lights, it\u2019s sooooo much fun in here! I wish Hunter could be with us though it would be so cute to dance with the little guy! But a place like this probably wouldn\u2019t be safe for him.\u201d Avery drunkenly lamented not having you with her, having completely forgotten that you were practically vacuumed between her ass cheeks at that very moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan grimaced upon hearing Avery speak. She could tell that her sister wasn\u2019t quite trashed enough to be slurring her speech, but clearly Avery was fairly intoxicated based on how loudly she was talking and how much she was leaning on both Quinn and herself. Knowing that a lecture about trying to remain somewhat sober was futile at this point, Morgan simply chuckled at her sister\u2019s chaotic nature before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, we\u2019ve been trying to find you to tell you that Hunter could have come with us! This is a mixed club designed specially for both tinies and regular sized girls!\u201d Morgan said and Avery opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh shit, really!? I haven\u2019t been paying any attention!\u201d Avery said while lifting her left pump and turning her foot so she could see the sole. Avery was a carefree girl without a doubt, but she still felt remorse as she expected to see the squished bodies of a number of tiny guys underneath her shoe. To her surprise she didn\u2019t see a single one! And as she shifted her weight, now leaning onto Quinn to check the sole of her other shoe, Morgan spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you airhead, they aren\u2019t just walking around on the ground. In what world would they just force the little dudes to dance around the feet of clueless drunk girls like you, huh?\u201d Morgan poked fun at her twin. \u201cThey have elevated dance floors that sit a few feet off of the ground and these cool tubes that the guys can walk through to get in between them! They\u2019re kind of like hamster tubes\u2026 not that I\u2019m saying men are like pets or anything! That\u2019s just what the tubes reminded me of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery took no notice of her sister putting her foot in her mouth at the end, being far too enthralled by the stuff she said before. She finally unlatched her arms from Quinn and Morgan, standing up on her own two feet before scanning the room. She looked closer at what she previously thought were little waist height bar tables, and saw tons of guys dancing on them! Thinking back for a second she definitely remembered dropping off an empty glass of hers on one of those \u201ctables\u201d earlier and hoped that not too many guys were hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ask me I think jumping through all these hoops for tiny guys is kind of lame.\u201d Quinn piped up, slightly more emphatically than she normally talked. Both Morgan and Avery turned to look at the typically apathetic girl as she actually seemed to take a stand on something. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough world for guys nowadays, and don\u2019t get me wrong I wouldn\u2019t wish for anything bad to happen to them, but if they get used to getting special treatment like this\u201d she said while gesturing towards the elevated dance floors, \u201cthen they might not be tough enough to stay safe when have to actually fend for themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked understandingly at her new roommate. Quinn seemed standoffish at first glance, but she could tell that behind that exterior was a caring person at the end of the day. Even if her direct interactions with tiny guys seemed a bit cold and unhelpful at times, they seemed to come from a good place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery on the other hand, had completely zoned out half way through Quinn\u2019s dialogue. Her eyes were locked firmly on the closest table of guys, sparkling with anticipation about the fun she could have with them. If she was flirtatious when she was sober, she basically turned into a wrecking ball of flaunted sexuality when she was drunk. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a closer look!\u201d She exclaimed before skipping off in the direction of the guys. Avery bumped into a number of girls on her way, hardly realizing how clumsily she was moving. Luckily for her nobody took issue with her jostled movements, assuming (correctly) that she was too drunk to know any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reality, meanwhile, was pretty much the same as it had been since the moment that Avery slid your incredibly stretched out body between her jiggly cheeks. The only unfortunate way you could tell the passage of time was by the ever increasing amount of sweat cascading down her crack and being easily soaked up by you. You could only hear the thumping bass line of the night club\u2019s music, or more specifically feel it as it reverberated through Avery\u2019s soft flesh around you. At this point you wished that you could just detach your arms from your legs and come apart just to escape this situation, but the strong knots that connected your limbs as well as the pressure of her cheeks being smashed together by her tight skirt prevented any sort of agency on your part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven considering this possibility made you feel a twinge of guilt, however, knowing that you would feel bad leaving Avery commando when she specifically needed underwear. Catching yourself thinking this, you mentally slapped yourself back to reality. By no means did you want to act as her underwear, but your naturally empathetic and caring nature quite often led you to being forced into situations such as these. Sometimes you wished you could just put your foot down and stand up for yourself, but as a single step taken by Avery mashed your entire body between her cheeks, you reconsidered acting so bold when you had so little power due to your stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, that step that Avery took was the first step in a beeline straight towards the nearest elevated platform for tiny guys. She walked away from Quinn and Morgan without a word, leaving Morgan rolling her eyes at how airheaded her twin could be. Morgan was torn between looking after her clearly hammered sister and hanging out with her new friend, ultimately deciding to stay with Quinn and watch over Avery from afar. Unfortunately, leaving this ditzy bombshell unsupervised was quite the risky choice, as after a moment Avery reached the platform of guys and bent over to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyyy guys, you\u2019ve got quite a nice view from down there huh?\u201d Avery said flirtatiously. \u201cYou guys won\u2019t mind if I dance around you, right?\u201d she concluded before standing back up to her full height. The height of the table left the \u201cdance floor\u201d sitting right below the cheeks of Avery\u2019s moderately tall 5\u20198\u201d frame. As she turned around there wasn\u2019t a single guy who could take his eyes off of the large beauty. Half of them out of attraction to the bubbly goddess, and half out of pure fear upon seeing her round buttocks, having slowly but surely been sliding out of the bottom of her too-small pink miniskirt over the course of the night. She backed up a step more, the backs of her thick thighs now touching the edge of the platform as her bubble butt blocked out half of the light from the ceiling. Without realizing it, even the slightest amount of weight that Avery\u2019s drunken body was putting on the platform had crushed the makeshift railing that ran along the edge, and sent a few guys jumping towards the center for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn on the other hand was slowly sipping her drink while observing the rest of the night club. She didn\u2019t outwardly show it, but she honestly was having fun. As she scanned the club, she slowly took a few steps to the side and found what she assumed to be a railing to rest on behind her. Lifting her butt slightly she leaned most of her weight onto the it, she relaxed and continued to sip her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the comically curvaceous girl, tiny guys were running to each end in absolute fear as their passage tube threatened to collapse at any moment. Two planet sized ass cheeks clad in skin tight black denim caved the top half of the tube inward, threatening to shatter the entire structure without even noticing a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, unfortunately, noticed both conundrums at the same time. First seeing her twin sister clumsily shaking her ass above a mob of tiny at-risk guys sent her into crisis aversion mode. But as she looked back towards Quinn to ask for help in dealing with Avery, she noticed as well the bent passageway that Quinn\u2019s massive ass was threatening to utterly demolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, you were once more cast into a jiggly hell. Avery\u2019s sloppy dance moves were shaking her ass more and more, causing her skirt to ride up until essentially her entire bare butt was visible for all to see. The guys beneath her demonstrated a combined feeling of attraction and utter terror, something you were quite familiar with, knowing that one clumsy movement could lead to the crushing of dozens of them. Some tried to funnel into the tube off of the platform, but they could see the titanic body of Quinn causing their only escape path to crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one and only silver lining to this hellish situation was that with Avery\u2019s whole ass on display for the world, people could clearly see the minuscule tan thong that was struggling to contain the woman\u2019s fantastic curves. Since the approval of Baker\u2019s law and increased usage of guys like you as articles of clothing, tiny men often felt a brotherly obligation to pay attention to the clothing that regular sized women were wearing just in case someone was being used against their will. More often than not the other tiny dude couldn\u2019t do a thing about it, but at the very least they could alert someone with more authority to do so. You could only pray that this would happen to you.</span></div></div>",

Doesn\u2019t bother me, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a somewhat surprised thumbs up, and inquired. \u201cThen how about you and I hang out the rest of the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, whatever you want.\u201d Quinn replied, placing her palm on the coffee table and motioning for you to climb on. \u201cNormally I\u2019d tell you to carry yourself, but this\u2019ll be quicker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you contemplated Quinn\u2019s still slightly puzzling way of treating you and climbed onto her outstretched hand, you caught sight of Avery\u2019s briefly sullen expression, as well as a subdued frown on Morgan\u2019s face. No doubt Avery had been wanting to spend all day with you, and Morgan was still a bit apprehensive of Quinn\u2019s treatment of you. Still, a moment later, and Avery cheered back up as she began to engage her twin sister in conversation, discussing trips to the beach and the mall that everyone could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone (more-or-less) with Quinn, the black-haired girl stared at you inquisitively. \u201cSo, what specifically did you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin. \u201cWell, how about we hang out in your room? You finished decorating it, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah, sure.\u201d Quinn answered, surprisingly seeming to wince a bit at your question. Still, she stood up and walked at a steady pace out of the room and upstairs. You nearly jostled off of her palm, and had to grip her thumb to keep steady. However, as soon as you balanced yourself out, you found the short trip quite enjoyable. It made you wonder if Quinn knew she was walking at exactly the right speed to keep you safe, after briefly forcing you to steady yourself. It wasn\u2019t long before the two of you reached her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn's room was not at all like you expected, and it really caught you off guard. You anticipated the fact that everything would be mostly colored in black, gray, and purple colors, but what you didn't expect was for it to be so messy. She had plain style bed, dressers, and closet, but the floor of her room was covered with clothes strewn all about. Barely a trace of the carpet could be seen with how cluttered the room was. You'd be hard pressed to believe she had only just moved in hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting you down on the corner of her bed, Quinn put her hands on her hips. \"Yeah, it's a mess, I know. I have a hard time...feeling like I need to tidy up. Still, it's comfy, I guess.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026it probably makes me come off as uncaring. It just doesn\u2019t bother me, usually. I mean, I know where everything is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around her room, taking in the sight of everything looking so messy. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unique style.\u201d You admitted with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean? You DO think I\u2019m lazy, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up your hands, defensively. \u201cNo, no! I didn\u2019t say that! Who am I to judge what your room looks like? My own room fits entirely in a single duffel bag.\u201d You smiled, sheepishly. \u201cI think it\u2019s just fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn paused for a second, then granted you the smallest sliver of a smile. \u201c\u2026thanks.\u201d After that, she turned behind her to pull over a spare chair to sit on. Though you tried to fight it, your eyes were drawn inexorably right to her prodigious backside as she presented it to you. Her ass was unfathomably huge, larger than almost any you\u2019d seen before (granted, your exposure to females was limited mostly to close family). The way were perfectly sculpted derriere pulled tight against her leggings was worthy of worship, even if that same booty had demolished you pretty thoroughly all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished grabbing her chair, Quinn sank down into it, then looked at you thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, you remind me so much of Caleb.\u201d She mused, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou titled your head in confusion. \u201cCaleb? Who\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of my best friends growing up. He was a tiny, just like you. We were inseparable.\u201d She had a distant expression on her face. \u201cIt was crazy how much he looked out for me. Really dependable guy, considering he had to struggle with\u2026everything you tinies go through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say \u2018were\u2019? What happened?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn blinked in surprise. \u201cO-oh, nothing. He just moved away with his family five years ago.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat was the last time I ever saw him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, sympathetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d You said, earning yourself another barely perceptible smile from the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you felt that perhaps you were understanding Quinn just a little bit better. If you reminded her so much of her old tiny friend, you had to wonder if Quinn\u2019s way of treating you came from years of close friendship with tinies. Perhaps she was trying to toughen you up, make you stronger and more dependable by treating you a bit indifferently earlier. Some form of \u2018tough love\u2019?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, there was a lull in the conversation, and you found Quinn looking at you almost expectantly. Realizing that she was waiting for you to suggest something to do, you quickly wracked your brain for any ideas.</span></div></div>",

You just couldn't keep your eyes off Quinn. \"Sigh. I was actually enjoying that conversation, but it's clear you have something else on your mind now. Makes no difference to me.\u201d Quinn said, falling back on to her bed. \" I'm gonna take a nap\", she turned to look you straight in the eyes,  \"DON'T wake me up, and DON'T go perving about, got it <b>Roomie</b>?\" You gulp audibly and nod your head vigorously to get the point across. You're still sore over that little accident earlier, you'd hate her to have a reason to make your new life here difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now you just felt bad. She was just starting to open up a little, and of course you somehow managed to mess it up. By some form of word association, your attention turned to the rest of the room. There was hardly a square inch of space not covered with some article of clothing or other personal belonging. Then a thought hit you, organize the room to apologize and show good will. Your sister used to be a similar situation. Just like Quinn she wasn't lazy, just didn't mind the mess and didn't have a set system. If you could help your sister, you could surely handle this. Just don't touch any unmentionables. Easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For nearly 3 hours you were at it, dragging items back and forth across the room.  You could honestly say you had never worked so hard in your life or that you had really outdone yourself considering how much stuff you moved around, across carpet no less. Now three boxes, ones you tilted on their sides and pulled the now folded clothes into, sat practically full, while things like magazines were stacked against the wall. Surprisingly, Quinn stayed asleep the whole time. All that was left was the closet. You shimmied through the half open door and wonder in. There are a few posters that apparently were never put up, few books, a face down red lifeguard swimsuit that had the writing, \"Sanderson Beach\" which had to have been from a few years ago given it's a bit on the smaller side. You noticed something poking out from under the swimsuit. It was long, thin, about as wide as you, and a deep shade of purple. You pull it out with enough force that when it comes undone, you're flung against the door. You open your eyes and go beet red. It's an amethyst thong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here!\" You thought aloud, but a moment too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing with those, PERV?!\" Quinn shouted. Uh oh. She was awake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> <span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">Standing in the closet doorway stood Quinn, hands on her hips and with a look that could kill. In your life being a tiny, even though you couldn't be killed, you can easily say you have looked death in the eyes multiple times. Wether it was something like the time the neighbor's dog mistook you for her chew toy for an afternoon or like the time your mother gave you a bath in the sink and forgot to take you out before undoing the drain and you spent nearly three days in city pipes before you were rescued by an employee at the filtration plant. The point is that every thought you had of what Quinn might do to you dwarfed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I seriously can't believe what I'm looking at. Are you serious right now? We met each other and then not even twenty-four hours later your touching my... my... UNDERWEAR! I told you NOT to go perving around and you can't even do that! Oh... If you thought I was a tough before, I plan on making your life <b>UNBEARABLE</b>! I bet you didn't move when I sat on you earlier because you enjoyed every last second of it and when I got up, you just wanted more, didn't you? You only wanted to get to know me to satisfy your own disgusting needs!\" Tears started forming in her eyes. \"I actually thought you and I could become pretty good friends, but now I see you're only interested in <b>literally</b> getting in girl's pants! In the end, you are exactly like Caleb, just a perving wolf in sheep's clothing that never cared about me as an actual person!\" She screamed, tears now streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head down and clench your fist and murmur, \"you're wrong\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn stopped and put her hand to her ear. \"I'm sorry, did you say something, <b>little</b> guy? You'll have to speak up for me to hear you from all the way down there.\" She tried to say in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your head up to look her in the eyes and screamed at the top of your lungs, \"I SAID THAT YOU'RE F***ING WRONG!!! You want to know who I am and see me stand up for myself, then listen to me HERE and NOW!\" <br>\r\nThis snaps her attention straight to you. She takes a deep breath and sits down on the ground to show you have her full attention then gestures you to speak with tears still in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's clear I don't know anywhere near as much about you or your past to fix this problem completely, so I'm just going to focus on what I do know. First off, I need to legitimately apologize to you for staring earlier. It was wrong and degrading considering you want to treat me as an equal despite my faults just for me not to treat you the same. I hope you can forgive me.\" You bow your head but rise back up to see her face had not changed in the slightest. You take this as a sign to continue.<br>\r\n \"Second is yes, yes I am perverted, not to a point of creepiness mind you, but yes I admit that I am a little... perverted.\" Both you and her stumble at this actually being addressed. You blush, but continue. \"I did enjoy what happened earlier for the wrong reasons and then chose to stare regardless of consequences. My entire life up til now was just been my mom and my sister, so I this is honestly the first time I have ever been in a room with no one I'm related to, so I'm still a bit new to these feelings. I felt so terrible for staring after you decided to open up to me a little, that I spent the time you were asleep to help organize your room to apologize.\" You gesture for her to see the room and she is dumbfounded.<br>\r\n \"I did everything but your unmentionables and the closet, which is why I'm in here. I didn't come in here to perv and I may not know the whole story and you may not believe me, but I do care about you even though I barely know you.\" You turned to the door to see Avery and Morgan quickly hide after being caught eavesdropping.<br>\r\n\"I just want you to know, you don't need to forgive me or even acknowledge me after this, just that I'm sorry for any pain and confusion I caused you.\" You pass her and walk out, passing the sisters who barreled into Quinn's room clearly to get the whole story. You walk down the hall, feeling like you want to curl up and cry as you hear Quinn in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He went and did all this.\"</span></span></div></div>",

Since then, you had been self-loathing underneath the couch in the main room. Avery and Morgan had spent most of their free time trying to coax you out. However, whether it was Morgan's offer of a delicious meal or Avery's sunny disposition, nothing moved you from your spot  They had given up on trying to snap Quinn out of the trance she had been in since the morning afterwards. She would wake up, get ready for work, leave without having breakfast at home, and return to her room the moment she came home. For you, it was disturbingly quiet, and you've turned to talking to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really screwed up this time, idiot. Nothing is available to move into for at least a month, and more importantly, you had the bearings to go through a beautiful girl's personal stuff, but you're not man enough to apologize. She treated you as an equal, and you make her cry. Wonderful.\" You sigh, laying your head down on a dust bunny you had been using as a makeshift pillow. \"She'd probably turn me into a rag doll after what happened.\" You fall asleep with the sensation that you're being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You awaken after the best sleep you've had under the couch. That is until you realize you're no longer under the couch. The ground was soft, there was sun in your eyes, and there was the familiar feeling you were being watched again although it felt nowhere near as cold as before. You're back in Quinn's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About time you decided to wake up.\" A voice called out from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You tense up when you put a name to the voice as a shadow begins to block the sunlight entering through the window. Quinn appears out of your peripheral vision, propping herself up on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emotions and words begin tripping over each other and all that manages to escape your mouth is a very feeble \"Hello.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis evokes a small laugh from the black-haired giantess. \"Calm down, you're not in trouble dude. I was out having a drink and came home late. I realized you were hurting as much as me after our spat and wanted to make peace with you. I came over to the couch and found you asleep, alongside a giant spider set on making you it's midnight snack. Killed it and decided that I could keep an eye on you if you slept in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a heartfelt thanks as well as try and steer the conversation toward your apology. She realizes this and stops you. \"I'm the one who needs to apologize. It's just...when I found you in my closet, it brought back memories of a time I would have rather left to be forgotten.\" She sighed and sank back into the bed, causing you to lose your footing. She chucked at this and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb was a guy that I could've easily called my best friend and my first love, at least on the outside. Well, to make a long and painful story short, I opened my heart to a schmuck and had it broken when the person I would have spent the rest of my life with was never there in the first place. He never cared about me, just my body. He decided to start taking candid photos of me around the house and stealing my underwear because I wasn't ready to go \"all the way\" with him. After I found him out, admittedly, I went ballistic and managed to brake his arm. His parents decided to move after that, and I never heard from him again.\" She finished, wiping tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, hearing this painful story from someone who didn't deserve to be hurt. You walk up to her and place your hands on her arm. This surprised her slightly. \"I closed myself off and gained a bit of weight afterwards so something like that wouldn't happen again. But you're not like Caleb.\" She slowly moved the arm you were hugging towards her body and returned the hug, pushing you up against her right breast. \"I'm sorry Hunter, hope you and I can just hug it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You begin to blush, noticing she wasn't wearing a bra under her t-shirt, \"Sure Quinn, and thanks for trusting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing each of your new roommates look a bit more intently at you after saying that froze you up for a second, and you coughed awkwardly. \u201cI-it\u2019s a little\u2026strange, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled calmingly. \u201cGo on. You don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to judge you, or anything, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery cheerfully grinned. \u201cAsk away, little buddy! We\u2019d do anything for our tiny new roommate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn motioned with her head for you to continue. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat. \u201cWell, just like you three, I\u2019ve now graduated college. I have a degree in Communications, but honestly, it\u2019s not my passion. I guess I don\u2019t really have a direction in life. I consider myself pretty competent, especially for a tiny, but I don\u2019t have a clue what my future has in store for me.\u201d You paused to shuffle your feet awkwardly. \u201cBasically, I wanted to hear about the jobs that you three have. Maybe that would give me some ideas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh. Is that all? Were you thinking of maybe tagging along with us to our jobs and applying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery practically squealed with delight at the very thought. \u201cEee! That\u2019s so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded approvingly. \u201cMakes sense. Good idea, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You replied to Quinn, before looking at Morgan. \u201cMorgan, could you start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, totally.\u201d The dark brown-haired girl said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been working as an assistant employee at this local gym for a little while now. It\u2019s called \u2018Workout World\u2019. It\u2019s your standard gym, with a whole bunch of exercise machines and weights and what-not. We also have a few rooms in the back for special daily and weekly classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter working at the gym for a while, I was just recently promoted. I now teach a weekly yoga class starting\u2026tomorrow, I guess\u2026and I\u2019m really pumped about that. Might have trouble reigning myself in.\u201d Morgan sheepishly smiled, admitting to her intensive workout routine. \u201cBut yeah, other than that I just do odds and ends jobs at the gym. Cleaning, registering new members, helping people with troublesome machines. That sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d You said, giving her a thumbs up. \u201cThank you for being so thorough. How about you, Avery?\u201d You asked, turning to the pink-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned wildly. \u201cOkay, so like, I have the best job in the world. I\u2019m totally pretty, right?\u201d Avery struck a pose and giggled, earning a nod from you and Quinn, and an eye roll from Morgan. \u201cApparently, other people totes think so too, because I got recruited right out of high school to be a model! And, and, and\u2026\u201d Avery nearly hyperventilated. \u201c\u2026I just landed the biggest gig of my life. I\u2019m going to be a featured model for Starlight Studios!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a nerd and don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Avery stuck out her tongue at Morgan playfully. \u201c\u2026Starlight Studios is a really huge photo agency near here. I\u2019ve been there a few weeks, and it\u2019s uber heaven! I can just wear cute outfits all day, pose for the camera, and come home with so much dough! Best of all, there totes aren\u2019t any tiny models working at the studios, so you\u2019d have a hella easy time getting hired!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to take all that in, then nodded. \u201cUh\u2026thanks Avery. That sounds like a lot of fun. What about you, Quinn?\u201d You inquired, looking at last to your final roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, really. Nothing special. I wanted to get outside and around people a bit more, so I applied as a lifeguard at the beach near here. \u2018Sanderson Beach\u2019, heard of it? Anyway, they picked me. I\u2019ve been working there for a month now. It\u2019s not too bad, I guess, though the sun is hell on my skin. I have to put sunscreen on twice a day, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026yeah, it\u2019s as simple as it sounds. I\u2019m either assigned to sit in one of the lifeguard towers and look out over the beach for any signs of trouble, or I patrol the sands, up and down the beach, and help people that way. Boring, but the right kind of boring.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd it feels good to help people out\u2026sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded appreciatively. \u201cOkay, thank you, Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan leaned forward in her seat, a glimmer of hopefulness shining in her eyes. \u201cRealistically, Hunter, you could only take one job. So, who do you want to go into work with tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery also leaned forward in her seat, though much more dramatically than her twin, and her breasts threatened to spill from her top. It was hard not to look. \u201cYeah, yeah! Who do you wanna tag along with, cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn made no attempt to lean in, but she did raise her eyebrow questioningly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me who you go with.\u201d She said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you could feel that this was a tremendously important moment, and so you really stopped to think about it. Who did you want to go with, and what job were you looking to pursue?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the gym would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s probably a lot I could do there that might help out. And I mean, I\u2019m pretty fit for a tiny. I could help show people how to do stretches and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan smiled warmly. \u201cI agree! \u2018Workout World\u2019 having a tiny fitness instructor helping out would be amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Avery was pretty upset that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Quinn seemed mostly indifferent like normal, but with a twinge of disappointment on her face. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to Morgan standing above you, gently saying your name to ease you out of slumber land. Giggling at your messy hair and bleary expression, Morgan carried you into the bathroom where you freshened up, and then into the kitchen. She fixed herself some cereal, making sure to give you a few crunchy pieces and a bottle cap filled with milk to serve as your own breakfast. It was incredible how good of a caretaker she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you both got changed into fresh sets of clothes, and you had to fight not to stare too much as Morgan returned from her bedroom wearing only a dark blue sports bra and matching compression shorts. Her clothing left most of her smooth, toned body on full display, while also highlighting and accentuating her sculpted curves. She was like a goddess of fitness, the ideal vision of physical perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring did not go unnoticed, and Morgan playfully flicked you for ogling her, before picking you up again. Saying goodbye to Quinn, who was eating her own breakfast (Avery was apparently still asleep upstairs), you and Morgan left the apartment. Morgan only took a small bag of spare clothes and a water bottle with her. She walked straight out to her car, and slid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepositing you gently in the passenger\u2019s seat, you held onto the tethered seat belt to anchor yourself, and then the two of you were off. It was only a twenty-minute drive to \u201cWorkout World\u201d, and you passed the time chatting with Morgan. She was the only girl you\u2019d ever met outside of your family who treated you respectfully and sincerely, and earnestly treated you like a normal human being. It was an amazing feeling, and a flutter went off in your chest each time she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to \u201cWorkout World\u201d, Morgan parked her car, scooped you into her palm, grabbed her bag, and then headed inside. As she approached the gym, you noted that it didn\u2019t look particularly too crazy from the outside. Just a run-of-the-mill gym, but perhaps a bit bigger than normal. It looked like it stretched back for a while, taking up a decent amount of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis observation was explained when Morgan walked through the door. Exercise machines as far as the eye could see stretched in all directions. Bikes, treadmills, rowing machines, elliptical machines, stair walkers, and more. One whole wall was taken up by a wide array of exercise mats, jump ropes, yoga balls, weights, and other assorted workout props. In the far back, you could see the doors leading to those exercise class rooms Morgan had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess carrier approached the front desk, where a brilliantly smiling receptionist was waiting. The receptionist stood as Morgan approached, and you verbally choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist (who appeared to be in her thirties), was dressed in the same attire as Morgan, a sports bra and compression shorts. This indicated she was also a fitness instructor. However, due to being older and more mature, her more developed body strained at the seams of the sports bra and shorts, threatening to snap the fabric at any second. It was an incredibly risqu\u00e9 outfit choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, it would\u2019ve been under normal circumstances. Glancing around the gym, which already had quite a few people in it, you didn\u2019t see a single guy. There were giantesses of all ages, but no men to be seen. Was this a female only gym, or just a random coincidence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Mayfield.\u201d Morgan waved to the receptionist. It was then that you noted the receptionist\u2019s nametag, pinned proudly to her right breast. It read: \u2018Heather Mayfield, Workout World Director\u2019. Apparently, she was the big boss around here, but it was hard to fully believe that. Something about her aforementioned revealing clothing, and her mane of wavy blonde hair and young-looking face felt out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMah stars, Morgan!\u201d Heather clapped her hands together and grinned. \u201cIs that a darlin\u2019 lil\u2019 tiny in yer hand?\u201d She asked, pointing to you. Her southern drawl was unexpected, but her tone was light and airy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Morgan nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s my new roommate, Hunter. He was wondering if he could apply for a job here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather beamed at you and Morgan. \u201cWhy, I reckon\u2019 he can, honey! Shoot, ah\u2019ll draw up the contract fer ya\u2019ll right now!\u201d The buxom woman bent over to dig around in her desk for a paper and pen, and you couldn\u2019t help but notice the pendulum swaying motion of her tits as she did so. It was difficult to imagine this curvy woman leading any fitness classes. She reminded you of your own mother, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stood back up, contract in hand. Placing it proudly on the desk in front of you, you hopped down from Morgan\u2019s hand and read it carefully. Everything seemed to be in order, so with some help from Morgan, it only took you a minute to sign your name. You were now an official member of the \u2018Workout World\u2019 team. That was easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling down at you in a friendly manner, Morgan gave you a thumbs up, then returned her attention to her boss. \u201cSo, Miss Mayfield, what\u2019s on my agenda today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather waved dismissively at Morgan. \u201cMorgan, honey, ah told ya to call me Heather. But, anywho, yer main job today is to teach that yoga class. \u2018Sides that, just help out \u2018til yer shift ends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what should I do Miss\u2026er\u2026Heather?\u201d You spoke up, striking a confident pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather laughed uproariously at your show of bravado, infectiously guffawing for a solid thirty seconds before calming down. \u201cYou, lil\u2019 mister, have a special task fer yer first day. Ready fer it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded enthusiastically, and Heather cleared her throat before continuing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThere are two big thangs every gym employee needs ta know!\u201d Heather smiled warmly at you, but with an earnest and serious look in her eye. \u201cOne: Ya gotta know yer stuff. How else can ya help out? Two: Ya gotta be all comfy-like around strangers. I\u2019m expectin\u2019 ya\u2019ll to help anyone in need, and ya have ta be ready fer that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded vigorously. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I can handle that, Heather!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather\u2019s intensity eased up a little. \u201cI know ya can, little guy. I believe in ya, Hunter. Tha\u2019s why yer first task is ta co-teach with my darlin\u2019 Morgan. Both of ya can work together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised you slightly, but also made a reasonable amount of sense. You just hoped Morgan wouldn\u2019t feel like you were intruding on her personal class. \u201cO-of course, Heather. I\u2019d be glad to help Morgan out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned. \u201cGlad to hear it, honey. Off ya go, now! Reckon\u2019 yer class is startin\u2019 any minute now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, you and Morgan were off. Morgan placed you back in her hand, and you held on nice and tight as she walked quickly towards the back of the Workout World gym, towards one of the side rooms. Slipping inside, you found the room empty of people, but filled with a surplus of exercise gear and supplies. About twenty, tan-colored yoga mats were spread out in rows facing a singular red yoga mat (presumably Morgan\u2019s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hunter, first day on the job! It\u2019s pretty awesome that we\u2019ll be co-teaching.\u201d She said, beaming at you. This alleviated your earlier worry. \u201cThough, you might want to let me field day one, and just copy my movements. Honestly, can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019ll be too much help for people behind the first row.\u201d The dark brown-haired giantess smiled sheepishly at you. \u201cMaybe later on we can have you walk around with the girls for more focused help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused. \u201cThe girls? And the guys too, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan actually blushed, faintly. \u201cUh\u2026no. No, sorry Hunter. This class is entirely female. You\u2019ll be the only guy.\u201d She admitted, and try as you might, you couldn\u2019t help but let your jaw drop open. This brought Morgan\u2019s teasing nature back, and she smirked playfully. \u201cWon\u2019t be a problem, will it, Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uh\u2026nope! N-no problem, Miss Sinclair.\u201d You hastily saluted, hoping comedy would detract from your obvious fantasizing about this upcoming class. It apparently worked, as Morgan rolled her eyes at your antics and dropped the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also dropped you, though quite gently, squatting down to the floor and depositing you onto her red yoga mat. The view of the class was significantly different from such an angle, as was the view of your beautifully, revealingly dressed roommate and co-teacher. Half of Morgan\u2019s face was blocked by her breasts from the vantage you were now at. It was very, very hard to not stare at her toned, lithe figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your eye, Morgan motioned to the mats spread across the floor. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious why no one is here, that\u2019s because everyone usually shows up right as the class starts.\u201d Morgan shrugged. \u201cIt makes sense to not show up early. I mean, we stretch and do warm-ups in class, so what could you even accomplish by coming early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose!\u201d You said, raising your voice just a bit so that she could hear you without bending back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t stop me from doing a few quick stretches to limber up!\u201d Morgan smiled, and instantly launched into a few toe-touching and yoga posing warm-ups. You decided to follow suit, copying her movements as best you could, albeit on a one-inch scale. Morgan was a master, but you found her moves so succinct and smooth that even you could keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, it was hard not to notice how close her left foot kept drifting towards your body on some of her stretches. Her toes, sliding along the yoga mat, came quite close to making you uncomfortable, as you knew it would only take a slight shift on Morgan\u2019s part to bury you completely under them. Glancing up at Morgan, you noted a content but focused expression on her face, and realized that she really did zone out while exercising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and the rest of the class arrived almost simultaneously, proving Morgan correct. Your own fantasies were also instantly confirmed, as it seemed that every single woman entering the class was utterly and unfathomably beautiful. Curvy, lean, beautiful, and alluring, each new girl caused your jaw to drop even further. This was to say nothing of how their tight workout clothing drew your eyes to them even more. Some girls wore yoga pants or tank tops, and some had booty shorts and sports bras even skimpier than Morgan\u2019s own revealing attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl in the room closed the door, and noticed that the last empty yoga mat was right in front of Morgan. Cutting through the room, she smiled politely at Morgan and took up position on the mat. However, as she steadied herself, her gaze locked right onto you, your miniscule form still down at Morgan\u2019s feet. You gave her a wave, trying to appear confident. The girl raised her eyebrows, then smiled flirtatiously and gave you a wink. THAT certainly was a little foreboding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had pretty long black hair that was tied back in a messy ponytail, and judging from the shape of her eyes and face, and her tanned skin tone, she was of some Asian descent. She was a fairly curvaceous giantess, but her eye-catching curves were exasperated further by her one-size too small tank top and ludicrously minimalistic booty shorts. At the point they were at, they looked more like panties, revealing her long legs all the way up to her crotch, and most of her ass, if you had to guess. She almost certainly had nothing but a thong on underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept staring at you with a seductive grin, but broke her gaze when Morgan spoke up. \u201cAlright, girls! My name is Morgan Sinclair, but you can just call me Morgan. This marks the first day of our all-encompassing exercise class. Over the next few months, we\u2019re going to be doing everything you\u2019ve ever imagined goes on inside a gym, and much more. Stretches, poses, usage of equipment and machines\u2026you name it. It WILL be exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m not the one who has to lead you through this alone. Joining me in this endeavor of teaching the class is my good friend, Hunter. In case you don\u2019t see him\u2026he\u2019s down by my feet.\u201d As one, all twenty girls taking the class peered down at Morgan\u2019s feet, and locked eyes with you. Any speech you had prepared died on your lips as twenty beautiful, sexily dressed giantesses stared at you intently. Some had looks of surprise, others happy expressions, a few matched the flirtatiousness of the girl in front of you, and a few even looked disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan drew eyes back to her. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a tiny, and by extension, a guy. There will not be any other guys in this class, as Hunter is the exception. He just joined as an employee of this gym, and needs all the experience he can get. He\u2019ll help all of you out, just make sure to treat him nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammered out a welcome. \u201cI-I look forward\u2026to h-helping!\u201d Your feeble reply was so quiet that no one in the class seemed to even hear it, not even Morgan, who was already pushing out with her introductory spiel. Only the girl in front of you, her eyes constantly flicking down to you, seemed to pick up on your pathetic statement. She flashed you a quick smile and another wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan went around the room asking everyone to give their name, their estimated level of exercise experience, and one fun fact about them. You lost track of names almost immediately, even though Morgan demonstrated enviably capability in memorizing everyone\u2019s name. To your credit, you were still distracted by the girl in front of you, who kept doing seemingly absentminded things like adjusting her tank top or picking at her shorts. However, from the way she never tore her gaze from you, you knew all her casually seductive actions were on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was last to enter, she was last to introduce herself, and your flirtatious terrorizer smiled broadly to the class. \u201cSup everyone! My name is Aoi, and I\u2019m stoked for this class. My level of exercise is\u2026probably moderate? I do a lot of stretches and yoga, but not much else. A fun fact would be that I find tinies to be the cutest little things! Lucky me, huh?\u201d Aoi gestured to you, and you flushed bright red. A few other girls, and even Morgan, laughed. It was clear that Morgan took Aoi\u2019s statement as lighthearted teasing and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gave her class a thumbs up. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s all the boring stuff out of the way! Ready to get into it, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of cheers and shouts answered her, and Morgan prepared to launch into the starting warmups. You did so too, but not without catching Aoi\u2019s eye on last time. The flirty and mischievous glint in Aoi\u2019s eye told you everything. Getting a good exercise was now second priority to her. Having fun with you was her only true goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you could only hope that Morgan could keep Aoi and the other girls at bay for this first day. Of course, it she got lost in the rhythm of exercise, you\u2019d be practically gone from her world, and left alone to defend yourself. Truly, what had you gotten yourself into?</span></div></div>",

So, with that in mind, ya think yer capable of some one-on-one coachin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201cOne-on-one coaching? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mature woman smiled. \u201cNothin\u2019 too taxin\u2019, mind. Just a bit of helpin\u2019 out. For example\u2026\u201d Heather pointed behind you, and you followed her finger to see a young woman looking around aimlessly. \u201cThat darlin\u2019 jus\u2019 signed up for membership. Said she ain\u2019t nevuh been to a gym \u2018fore today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, understanding. \u201cOh, okay. So, basically, you\u2019d like me to help her with her workout? Lead her through some stretches, explain how the machines work, that sort of thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned. \u201cAbsolutely, Hunter dear. Ya catch on quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan spoke up. \u201cAlright, well, I\u2019ll leave you to it, Hunter. See you when our shifts are over, and have fun!\u201d She waved, and you waved back, and then Morgan was off towards one of the gym\u2019s side rooms, disappearing from sight as she slipped through the door. She figured you could manage on your own. You were a competent, tiny adult, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather lowered you to the floor of the gym. \u201cAlright, Hunter, time\u2019s a wastin\u2019! Get helpin\u2019 that poor lass over there. Ah have full faith in ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you down!\u201d You saluted your new boss, then ran off. It wasn\u2019t necessarily an easy trek, but you made it in under three minutes. The girl was soon firmly in your sights, and you thanked your lucky stars she hadn\u2019t wandered off from where Heather had pointed her out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noted how incredibly attractive the girl was, so much so that you nearly froze in your tracks and stared, wide-eyed. She looked to be in her mid-twenties, and at first guess, was of some sort of Hispanic descent. Her long, dark brown hair was tied back in a somewhat messy but still cute bunch. The girl\u2019s eyes were a deep and alluring brown, and they flicked around the gym anxiously. The girl\u2019s full lips were locked in an adorable, and probably unintentionally, sensual pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer exotically tanned skin looked soft and smooth, and she was showing a whole lot of it. All she was wearing was a low-cut, purple exercise crop top and matching purple short shorts. The outfit would be fine on any girl but this one. She reminded you of Quinn, particularly in the proportion department. Her curves were significant, to say the least, and though she wasn\u2019t wholly on Quinn\u2019s level, she was eye-catchingly curvy, to be sure. As such, her already form-fitting clothing was even tighter, and you found it difficult to not stare. Most of her stomach and abdomen was exposed, as were her long legs from the upper-thigh down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Excuse me, miss! Down here!\u201d You shouted. The girl gasped lightly, glanced around, and then down to the floor, making eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026oh. Oh! Hey there.\u201d The girl said. Catching you off guard, she squatted low to the ground, ostensibly to get a better look at you. Still, it scared you to see her powerful legs fall down, her huge ass looking like it was about to squash you flat. The girl essentially presented her crotch to you by squatting in such a manner, and it was now twice as hard to keep looking her in the eye. You could definitely see the outline of her panties under her ludicrously tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly cleared your throat. \u201cM-my name is Hunter\u2026and I\u2019m a new fitness coach here at Workout World. You looked like you needed some help. Would you like any coaching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl quirked her mouth, raising a coy eyebrow. \u201cHelp? Coaching me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d You nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll help in any way I can. Trust me, I know a lot about working out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Damn!\u201d The girl shook her head ruefully. \u201cIf I knew the gym had hot little tinies like you on staff, I\u2019d have come here years ago.\u201d She laughed, and you had to admit that her words caught you off guard, but she continued before you could speak up. \u201cSounds like an awesome deal to me. As it stands, this is my first time in a gym, so I\u2019m a bit lost on what I should be doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding her \u2018hot little tinies\u2019 comment for the moment, you flashed her a thumbs up. \u201cThen I\u2019m your guy! Hunter, at your service!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl laughed again; her voice silky smooth. \u201cThe name\u2019s Maia. For the next few hours, I\u2019m totally in your hands, Coach!\u201d The girl, Maia, smiled at you and winked, and there was an unabashed hint of playfulness behind her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to push that aside, you pointed to the corner of the gym where there were exercise mats and other such simple equipment laid out. \u201cA good place to start is probably over there. Nice and quick, to ease into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha, Coach!\u201d Maia grinned, and she began leisurely strolling over to where you had pointed. You dashed as fast as your miniscule legs could carry you to even attempt to keep pace with her, and you missed the sly smile on her face as she watched you run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the mats, you gestured for Maia to step on, and the Hispanic giantess happily obliged. Another quick pang of fear struck you, watching her step onto the mat, her giant feet on either side of you. Pushing down your mounting unease over this situation, you focused on the task at hand. After all, if you failed to help one girl with her exercises, you\u2019d be fired from this job for sure. You had to do a good job, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Maia! Try bending down to touch your toes.\u201d You called up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all? Easy!\u201d Maia replied, effortlessly. With ease, the curvy giantess threw her upper body forward and down, arching her back but still keeping her feet firmly on the ground. Demonstrating incredible flexibility, Maia bent all the over forward, easily touching her toes without breaking a sweat. You were impressed by your new student\u2019s capabilities, and looked up to compliment her, but then all rational thought left your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bending over, Maia\u2019s abundant breasts were also now free to wobble, suspended as they were in this arched forward position. Her already low-cut crop top looked even more ridiculous now, and Maia\u2019s boobs threatened to spill out from the top. To make matters worse, the girl began listlessly swaying, shaking her tits side-to-side as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this it, Coach? This is a piece of cake!\u201d Maia said, triumphantly. Mentally smacking yourself out of your trance, you tore your gaze from the girl\u2019s abyss of cleavage and to her alluring face. She had an almost knowing look of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed. \u201cUm\u2026good. Great, actually! Onto the next stretch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t blind enough to notice Maia\u2019s smugly satisfied smile, but she offered no further retort. You were able to successfully guide her through a few more standing stretches, like the tree pose and warrior pose. She almost crushed you under her foot while shuffling around for the warrior pose, and you didn\u2019t think it was possible to turn every simple stretch into a flirty display, but Maia managed it somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to conclude with one more round of toe touching, when Maia spoke up. \u201cYou know what, Coach? It\u2019s hard to hear you down there.\u201d The girl grinned mischievously and bent down. Faster than you could react, she swiped you up into her hand, stood back to full height, and then deposited you into her cleavage. It was so sudden and casual that it was nearly comical. Nearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry or surprised thoughts swirled in your mind, but became muddled as soon as you actually touched Maia\u2019s boobs. Sinking into her cleavage up to your neck, nearly all of your tiny body was buried in her soft, jiggly mounds of flesh. It was like the world\u2019s softest bed, heavenly relaxing. Maia had exercised enough to heat up a bit, but not enough to sweat yet, so her cleavage was like a warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in a flirty manner, Maia clapped her hands together. \u201cAh, see? Better! Now, what\u2019s next, Teach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought hard to push away pleasant thoughts. The Hispanic giantesses\u2019 fragrant body wash scent was overpowering while this close to her. \u201cM-Maia! This is hardly appropriate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s practical. You can give me instructions, and you have a close eye on my technique.\u201d Maia shrugged, appearing nonchalant, but it didn\u2019t take a genius to see the playfulness in her eyes. She knew what she was doing. \u201cUnless\u2026you wanted this to be something more than that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her teasing, and realized that you sadly couldn\u2019t argue with her logic. Sighing, you rolled your eyes. \u201c\u2026okay, fine. Next up is one last toe touch before sitting down for some other stretches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Coach! Can do!\u201d Maia grinned, and spared no more seconds wasting time. Throwing herself forward again, the flexible girl fell into the perfect toe touching pose, nailing the stretch with ease. Sadly, an unexpected hiccup occurred this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same breasts you\u2019d been shamefully admiring during this stretch earlier once more strained against the top that held them. Hung upside-down from between Maia\u2019s massive boobs, gravity took hold of your body. That, combined with the gentle jostling of the girl\u2019s titanic tits, and you slipped free from their grasp. With a startled cry, you fell down to the floor, impacting on her yoga mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall slightly squished you, but not too bad. Sadly, before you could begin reforming, Maia finished toe touching and stood to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s next?\u201d She asked. \u201cOh! That\u2019s right. Sitting!\u201d The giantess grinned excitedly, then began to sit down on her mat\u2026and right on top of you!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the studio would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI feel like it\u2019d be a really unique and interesting experience that would be a lot of fun to try out. Also, if there aren\u2019t any other tiny guys working there, they might really have a use for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery grinned excitedly. \u201cOMG, yes! That\u2019s totes what I was saying! This\u2019ll be awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Morgan was a bit letdown that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Quinn seemed indifferent like normal, but with a twinge of disappointment on her face. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to the sound of Morgan walking through the living room on her way out the door. If she was leaving, then the chances were good that you and Avery would have to head out soon too. So, you changed into clean, simple clothes, then headed off to the kitchen. It took you a few minutes to reach the kitchen and climb up onto the table, but you managed. You\u2019d been doing this all your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn was already seated at the table eating her own breakfast, and she nodded in acknowledgement upon noticing you. In the center of the table was an open bag of bagels, so you figured you\u2019d help yourself to a first meal of the day. Graciously, Quinn went out of her way to pour some apple juice into a shot glass for you, and you thanked her for her consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile ripping off chunks of the bagel, Avery came running into the kitchen frantically, dressed in only skimpy, frilly lingerie. She exclaimed hurriedly that she\u2019d overslept and was almost late for work. Unfortunately, Quinn moved away from the table and sauntered out of the kitchen a second later, exactly when Avery, rushing in a blind panic, dug her hand into the bag of bagels for a quick meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing far too quickly and carelessly to ever dream of feeling you, Avery\u2019s fingers squished into your back as she retrieved a bagel and pulled it out. You cried out for her attention as she lifted you up into the air, but the pink-haired girl was already pulling up the fridge and grabbing something to drink, too distracted to hear your pleas. Soon, her luscious lips filled your entire vision, and her mouth parted open, revealing her cavernous maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a burst of strength, you pulled free from the bagel and managed to yank yourself away. Of course, that left the only possible place to go as straight down, and gravity carried you right into Avery\u2019s awaiting bosom. You bounced off her left breast, rolled into her cleavage, and found yourself wedged neatly up to your neck amongst her pillowy soft breasts. Surprisingly, she STILL hadn\u2019t felt you, and merely scarfed down her bagel and drink with a surely unhealthy quickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacing back upstairs, you were jostled like mad as her sizable boobs bounced erratically in her loose, revealing bra. You kept trying to get her attention, but kept failing. You could do nothing but remain stuck, and do your best to brace yourself and avoid slipping so deep between her tits that you disappeared. It dawned on you now that the pink-haired ditzy giantess had totally forgotten about bringing you with her to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery got dressed in record time, and thankfully for you, put on a low-cut crop top which kept most of her perky breasts and cleavage exposed, including you. She was also wearing a flashy pink skirt. Your attempts to get noticed still failed as she cried out a goodbye to Quinn and strolled out to her car, but as she sat in the driver\u2019s seat closed the door, she finally heard your pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Avery spotted you, blinked slowly, and then smiled in a mischievous manner. \u201cOoh, hey there, small stuff. What\u2019cha doing in between my boobs, huh? So cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery, you\u2019re taking me to the studio, remember?\u201d You said, in a tone you hope sounded both annoyed and serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery blinked again, before smacking her forehead. \u201cOh yeah! Duh! Totes slipped my mind, Hunter.\u201d She winked at you. \u201cWhat a way to get my attention though, dude. Girl might get some ideas\u2026\u201d She trailed off with a giggle, then plucked you from her cleavage. You were blushing at the whole situation, as well as Avery\u2019s flirty teasing, which prompted another giggle from the giantess. Finally, she set you down on the passenger\u2019s seat and drove off to the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shockingly short, ten-minute drive to \u201cStarlight Studios\u201d, and the building was about as blindingly gaudy as you\u2019d anticipated. It was a bright, sleek, modern designed building. After almost forgetting you again, Avery carried you inside with her, and the inside was just as modern and chic. There were no less than two different coffee shops inside the studio, and endless hallways seemed to stretch out to more photo rooms, prop closets, and specialized sets and stages than you could shake a stick at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was quickly approached by an important looking woman, who the pink-haired girl cheerfully waved to\u2026using the exact same hand she was carrying you in. With a higher-pitched yelp than you thought yourself capable of, you were flung through the air, right towards the woman rapidly approaching your catastrophically forgetful roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the air, you got a brief glimpse of the woman, like time was slowing down. She appeared to be in her late twenties or so, and she was of some Asian descent. Her black hair was pulled back in a ponytail, though a few strands hung loose over her glasses-framed face. She was wearing a tight, white button-up blouse and black miniskirt. There was something about her that emanated importance, like an aura of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further thoughts left you when you splattered down onto the clipboard the woman was carrying in front of her, your squishy body impacting against the hard board and flattening out like an accordion. You groaned at the pain, and began focusing on reforming, even as the woman finished approaching Avery. She\u2019d been locked on Avery, and had not yet taken notice of your landing on her clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAvery. Almost late.\u201d The woman said, quickly and efficiently. \u201cShoot is coming up in just a few minutes. We can\u2019t fall behind schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery winced, and gave the woman a winning smile. \u201cOverslept, Konomi. Won\u2019t happen again! But at least I brought a surprise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Konomi, adjusted her glasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s the surprise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you\u2019d reformed, and were just standing up on Konomi\u2019s clipboard. You brushed yourself off and waved to her, the movement drawing both women\u2019s eyes to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the surprise!\u201d Avery gushed. \u201cHunter, my new tiny roommate! He wants to try being a model!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi looked at you, then at Avery, then back at you, and frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not really how it works. You need experience to work here at Starlight Studios.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery pouted adorably. \u201cBut boss! He\u2019d be the first tiny model here!\u201d She pleaded, then hesitated. \u201cActually\u2026he\u2019d be the first male model too. Hee hee! That\u2019s awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whirled on Avery, totally floored by her revealing that you\u2019d be the only guy in this entire building. Why hadn\u2019t she told you earlier? Looking back to Konomi, any objection you thought of voicing fell away upon noticing her expression. She was staring at you intently, her eyes flicking rapidly. Millions of thoughts were racing through her head, and you could swear you almost literally saw dollar signs appear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she smiled. \u201cYou know what, Avery. You\u2019re right. Hunter would be perfect here as our first male model AND first tiny model.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cFor an introduction, my name is Miss Konomi, and I\u2019m the studio director. I lead most of the photo shoots. Starlight Studios prides itself on providing high quality photos to all our clients\u2026no matter the difficulty or strangeness of their needs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unnerved you a bit, so you folded your arms. \u201cWhat would I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi waved off your concern. \u201cOh, nothing much. Pose for photos all day. Sometimes wear certain outfits. Occasionally act out\u2026things.\u201d Konomi seemed to push down a smile. \u201cReally, it isn\u2019t hard, and it pays extraordinarily well.\u201d In a quieter voice, she continued. \u201cThe things we can do now with a tiny model\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still apprehensive, but Avery shouted with glee. \u201cHe\u2019ll take the job! Lil\u2019 cutie Hunter won\u2019t let you down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi smiled warmly, with a strange aura behind it. \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll get everything signed up, then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, and you were officially a Starlight Studios model, much to Avery\u2019s joy, Konomi\u2019s pleasure, and your cautious optimism.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm sorry I was hesitant at first, Avery, but bringing Hunter on as part of the Starlight Studios team is actually a fantastic idea!\" Konomi said to both of you. At this point the two giantesses were strolling down a long hallway, with you sitting precariously on Avery\u2019s hand as she walked. You had spent the last ten minutes on Konomi\u2019s desk signing the necessary paperwork to fill out your modeling contract, and to be quite honest you didn\u2019t read much of it at all. You could have sworn you saw a line or two that said something like \u201czero liability for any workplace injuries\u201d but every time you slowed down to read something more carefully, Avery would lean her enormous cleavage mere inches above you out of excitement. As a 21 year old man you couldn\u2019t help but feel distracted by the proximity of this jiggling beauty, and as a result you ended up simply signing where you needed to sign and that was the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you reached a set of double doors, Konomi leading the way with Avery and yourself in tow. The seemingly work-focused professional manner contrasted harshly with the bubbly exuberance of your current carrier. Konomi walked with intimidating intention and elegance while Avery practically skipped with every step, forcing you to cling on to one of her fingers in fear of flying off yet again. You looked around the room and figured that this must be the primary room where photoshoots were taken; it was enormous. It must have been a large warehouse in the past because there were countless micro stages set up with all kinds of varying decor. To name just a few you saw a suburban living room, a bedroom, an upscale bathroom, a city street, a fake beach, even a fake gym setup. This place was professional, no doubt about that, it seemed like they could whip up whatever environment they needed for a shoot in a moment\u2019s notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi stopped at the bedroom set, located right next to the fake city street, before grabbing a box off of a nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe actually received a shipment of clothes from this new brand, Micro-Flex, just last week! Check it out!\u201d Konomi popped the top off of a box that was probably the size of a deck of cards, but it held countless articles of clothing designed for one inch tall guys like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, that\u2019s so freakin cool! That stuff looks totally cute and Hunter has a great bod, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll rock all of it!\u201d Avery said, peering into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly at your new roommate\u2019s compliment. She was without a doubt quite flirtatious, and her overwhelmingly positive attitude seemed quite endearing to you already. You simply smiled and peered down into the box from your perch on Avery\u2019s hand, seeing a variety of shirts, shorts, and pants. It seemed like every color you could think of was present in that tiny box, and you had to admit you were quite excited to be modeling them! You had some qualms about the dangers of being a tiny model amongst various giantess models, but it seemed like your first shoot was going to be pretty straightforward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching you staring at the clothes, Konomi spoke up, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there and stare! Pick an outfit and try it on!\u201d Looking up at the business casual woman as she spoke, you could practically see dollar signs forming in her eyes. You could tell that she took her work quite seriously, and this contract from Micro-Flex was most likely quite lucrative for the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Avery moved you towards the box and you picked out a matching pair of red shirt and shorts. Wondering briefly if you were going to have any privacy to change, you looked up to meet the piercing stares of both giantesses above you and knew that the answer was no. Shaking your head and chuckling slightly you began to change in plain sight, stripping down to your boxers before sliding the red clothes on. You never considered yourself to be a shy person, and to be honest you were quite proud of your physique, so doing so didn\u2019t seem like a huge deal to you. Unbeknownst to you, Avery looked you up and down, raising her eyebrows in approval. But after a moment you were ready for the shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering you to the ground on the fake sidewalk of the city street set, Avery then backed away and flashed a thumbs up as Konomi set up the camera to focus on you. You stretched a bit and had to admit, the Micro-Flex clothing sure was comfortable. It felt like no matter how you moved, the clothing moved with you and wasn\u2019t restrictive in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Hunter, you ready? Just strike some natural poses! Walk around a bit, pretending you\u2019re just going for a stroll through the city. Whatever\u2019s natural.\u201d Konomi said, looking through the lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan do!\u201d you responded happily. Konomi then set the camera to automatically take photos every second or so. You tried your best to look natural, cycling through a variety of poses and actions to give a bunch of different angles. Avery seemed absolutely elated that you were taking to the job so easily, and Konomi herself even seemed impressed with your capabilities. The asian giantess slowly walked around the set, ending up herself on the far end of the fake sidewalk that you were on. You assumed she was just inspecting your poses from different angles, and you spoke up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey so what\u2019s so special about these Micro-Flex clothes anyway? They feel great and all but what\u2019s the selling point?\u201d You made small talk, asking the giantess standing near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi smiled and simply said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you?\u201d Before you knew it the woman began walking the same powerful, elegant strut that she was earlier, now towards you on the fake sidewalk. It took her no more than a few steps to reach you, as your mind was going haywire trying to process what was happening. Before you could make a single move, Konomi\u2019s black heeled shoe slammed down onto your body, obliterating you into the pavement. Avery gasped and covered her mouth, Konomi simply stood with her weight pressed onto you until she heard the *click* of the automatic camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first click things only got worse. Konomi began to twist and grind her sole onto you, causing you excruciating pain and smearing you flat into the false sidewalk. You couldn\u2019t believe that this photoshoot had taken such a dark and sudden turn into torture for you. After a series of more *clicks* from the camera, Konomi finally stepped off of you, and continued walking forward until she reached the edge of the city set. You heard one final click, no doubt taking a picture of your absolute splattered, two dimensional body stuck to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery was still too stunned to act, not knowing how carelessly her boss would treat her new roommate. Part of her was torn between standing up for you, but also part of her knew that this job meant the world to her, and risking it seemed like the last thing she wanted to do. While it didn\u2019t seem like Konomi took joy in what she just did, it definitely seemed like she had little concern for your wellbeing. She simply turned off the automatic picture taking feature of the camera and then looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t been squashed for more than a few seconds, so despite the beatdown you just took you found yourself popping back to normal rather quickly. And just as you did you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck out the clothes.\u201d Konomi said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your outfit, and with one single wipe of your hands to shake off the dirt and grime that came off of the sole of her heel, there wasn\u2019t a trace of the damage that Konomi had just done to you! The clothes looked brand new!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new proprietary fabric from the company, very hush hush and all that. But they said that one of the downsides of the many mishaps that little men like you have with giantesses like us is that the cheap cotton clothes made for you tend to rip off without the slightest bit of effort from us! These clothes promise to stay clean and on your body no matter the way you are twisted or treated! Each article even naturally sticks together if you apply enough pressure!\u201d Konomi explained the benefits of the magical clothing with perhaps a bit of callousness towards the plight of tiny men, but you couldn\u2019t argue with the results. These clothes really were a game changer. You saw even Avery had shifted to her focus, immediately forgetting her worries about you towards fascination towards the brand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow here\u2019s where you come in, Avery.\u201d Konomi turned to the beautiful, giddy girl, and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\"</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s a line for girls too! That\u2019s totes super amazing!\u201d Literally jumping up and down with excitement, you paled at the sight of her hefty chest bouncing in time with her joy. Shaking yourself out of staring, you watched Avery scamper away to the box to get changed. Turning your back on her, you decided that you could at least be a gentleman in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi tapped her clipboard to get your attention. \u201cNow, Hunter, you might\u2019ve picked up that I mentioned certain \u2018sticky qualities\u2019. As this implies, these next set of photos are going to require you being squished or stretched.\u201d She smiled at you, but it didn\u2019t take a genius to see the money-making glint in her eyes. \u201cWill that be a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emphatically shook your head. \u201cNo ma\u2019am! No problem here!\u201d You put on a show of confidence, even though you weren\u2019t entirely looking forward to what was coming. Still, if this was all a test by Konomi, you weren\u2019t going to back down and fail. And, even if it wasn\u2019t a test, the more money that Konomi made, the more you and Avery would rake in. Win-win situation all around, you figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery returned after a minute, and her new outfit was a far cry from the casual ensemble she\u2019d worn to the studio. She was clad from her neck to her toes in a sleek, sporty bodysuit that clung so tightly to her curvy supermodel body it might as well have been her second skin. The bodysuit was black with hot pink stripes racing across it, and looked exceptionally comfortable and maneuverable. The rational part of your brain admired the design of the fabric\u2026while the hormonal part of your brain couldn\u2019t stop ogling every inch of Avery. Ironically, despite literally covering most of her skin, the bodysuit left little to the imagination in practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Avery, who struck a dynamic pose and winked at you. \u201cYou like what ya see, don\u2019tcha, Hunter? Hee hee! It is pretty sick, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and averted your eyes, too embarrassed to mumble an apology or excuse, which only further enriched Avery\u2019s infectious giggles. Konomi was smiling too, but another look into her eyes told you that the gears in her head were spinning. What they were spinning about, only time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you two.\u201d Konomi clapped her hands. \u201cTime to jump into it. These next few photos will involve most of our varying sets, but only for context and lighting purposes. The main point is to highlight how Micro-flex outfits stick and adhere to one another.\u201d She eyed Avery carefully. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to squish Hunter a bit, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned just a little. \u201cOh. I will? On purpose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but he\u2019s okay with that. He already told me that it doesn\u2019t bother him at all.\u201d Konomi said, the lie sliding easily out of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked your head over to her. \u201cW-wait, I didn\u2019t exactly say\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, awesome! Okay then!\u201d Avery exclaimed, her bright and cheery voice cutting off your attempt at clarification. Before you could try again, Konomi picked you up and carried you over to the fake gym set in the studio. A bit callously, she dropped you down onto the floor beside a treadmill, then sauntered over to adjust the camera. You picked yourself up off of the floor, once more amazed at how immaculate and clean your clothes were. Micro-flex was genuinely revolutionary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi steadied the camera, then motioned to Avery. \u201cAlright, Avery. Simple shot first. Step on up and then\u2026well\u2026STEP onto Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently still a little apprehensive, Avery responded with a weak nod, biting her lip in an adorable fashion. Walking over to you, you were momentarily taken aback by just how humongous she was side-by-side with your bug-sized body. She was a gorgeous, heavenly goddess of a giantess, and standing down at her feet made you feel a mix of both awe and fear. You didn\u2019t quite know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe it was fear of the obvious, as, after sparing you a quick smile, Avery stepped down onto you, burying you under her left foot. Your body offered no resistance, flattening out into a paper-thin shape immediately. You were crushed out into a disc against Avery\u2019s heel, and, sure enough, you felt your clothes stick to Avery\u2019s bodysuit instantly. It was a strong adhesion too, not unlike glue, and when Avery lifted her foot a second later, you went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemonstrating her flexibility, Avery twisted her leg up and held her foot in front of her face, spotting the red-colored flat circle that was your body on her heel. Giggling, she lightly poked your body, squishing your face a bit more into her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee hee! One second of squishing, and you\u2019re flat as can be, Hunter. Soooo cute!\u201d Avery gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a business point of view, Konomi was pleased too, but hardly satisfied. \u201cExcellent, Avery. Now, step on him again, but this time grind your heel along the ground. Really work him into your foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough an airheaded ditz most of the time, Avery wasn\u2019t dumb, and she looked at Konomi with shock. \u201cWha? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt the poor cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi shook her head succinctly. \u201cNot at all. I mentioned that Micro-flex reduces sensations of pain for tinies, remember? Hunter will be just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was yet another lie, and you picked up on it right away. However, crushed flat, you had no way of shouting to Avery that Konomi was making things up, so your pink-haired partner simply blinked once to process what Konomi said, then grinned happily. \u201cOh, okay! That\u2019s totes cool. He\u2019s, like, invincible, huh? Wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirheaded Avery was back and in full force, and your current position left you powerless to defend yourself. You could just barely manage a wince in preparation for your next few seconds, as Avery just about slammed her foot back onto the ground. Convinced by Konomi\u2019s words that you couldn\u2019t feel a thing right now, Avery ground her heel against the floor with violent, reckless abandon, genuinely laughing at how loose she was letting herself be. Konomi watched with reserved fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Avery hoisted her foot back up thirty seconds later, you were more of a red stain spread across her entire heel than a simple circle, and were even more adhered to the fabric of her Micro-flex bodysuit than before. This pleased Konomi greatly, and the astute businesswoman eagerly snapped some shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Avery...and Hunter. Excellent jobs so far.\u201d Konomi glanced at her clipboard. \u201cMicro-flex, along with testing their durability and sticky qualities, would really like us to take some publicity photos for their website that focus on tinies being squished and crushed in day-to-day settings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery frowned adorably at this direction, and let her foot fall back down, squishing you into the floor once more. \u201cReally? That\u2019s uber weird. Like, how does that make sense for a company that totes supports tinies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, Avery.\u201d Konomi said gently, almost soothingly. \u201cBy taking fake candid photos, we can supply Micro-flex with data about how their product functions in real-life situations. On top of that, we can provide promotional materials that demonstrate how trapped or squashed tinies can be spotted and rescued, based on how they stick to other Micro-flex materials. Training tools, if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery had been bouncing on her feet during this entire explanation, repeatedly lifting her heels then digging them back down into the floor. Apparently, your current location had fled her vacant mind already. She finally stopped though, and clapped her hands together. \u201cAh, I gotcha! That\u2019s so crazy awesome! I love helping out like this, and I\u2019m sure Hunter does too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonomi nodded. \u201cOh, he does. He told me while you were changing that he is good to go with these photo shoots for as many hours as we might need them. He said he\u2019ll do anything for Starlight Studios!\u201d A third lie was just as easy as the others. You didn\u2019t hear a word, buried into the floor because of Avery\u2019s heel, but if you had, you would\u2019ve just been even more upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Avery bit her lip again, and looked down at her foot, finally remembering where you were. \u201cSounds like something that little stud would say. OMG, he\u2019s too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, can we continue?\u201d Konomi walked back to the camera, and gestured towards the treadmill. Avery was more than happy to oblige her boss. In her mind, not only was this more fun than she\u2019d had in weeks, but she was determined to not drag down the experience for Konomi and you. As far as she was concerned, you were taking to modeling like it was your calling in life, and Avery would do everything to be the best damn partner for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next twenty minutes, Avery and Konomi took photos around the gym, with you still stuck to Avery\u2019s foot like you belonged there. Each new step further cemented you in place, the fabric of your clothes and your titanic roommates bodysuit meshing tightly, intertwining. It never stop hurting, and you silently begged for anything else but foot shots. Konomi had Avery posing on the treadmill, the bike, and the Stairmaster, each snapshot focusing on your crushed body and Avery\u2019s impressively nonchalant and unaware attitude. These were all meant to be candid, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shooting calmed down, it took Avery and Konomi together to peel you free from Avery\u2019s foot, leaving you as an exhausted flat strip. Konomi scooped you up and held you tightly in her fist as she walked on to the next set, not enough to hurt but enough to keep you flat and unable to yell at her for the way she was tricking Avery into treating you. Powerless, your first day of hellish modeling continued\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually, I think that working at the beach would be a pretty easy job for me to handle.\u201d You reasoned. \u201cI love to help people out, and I think that I\u2019m pretty athletic. I don\u2019t know how good I\u2019d be at saving people, but I can help with any other issues, or be on the lookout for people in need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smiled approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s a good attitude to have. You\u2019ll fit in, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Morgan was a bit letdown that you hadn\u2019t picked her, and Avery was pretty upset that you hadn\u2019t chosen her either. However, there really was no way around it. It\u2019d be impossible for you to balance three jobs at once. You just decided that you would need to hang out with them later to make it up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by fairly uneventfully. The four of you spend time hanging around and chatting in the living room, eventually transitioning into watching a movie. The movie came after dinner, which was efficiently prepared by Morgan and served by Quinn. It was really just a few frozen meals heated up, but it was still a meaningful gesture and a tasty experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie finished, it was nearing ten o\u2019clock at night, and each of the girls meandered upstairs to their rooms. Surprisingly, they each seemed to have forgotten about you, and left you all by yourself on the couch in the living room. You couldn\u2019t really blame them, as this was only the first night for the three girls living under the same roof as a tiny like yourself. Your existence hadn\u2019t become fully routine for them yet. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too cold in the living room, and the couch cushion was nice and comfy, so you easily fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to Quinn standing above you, saying your name and lightly pushing the couch cushion with her foot to shake you awake. When you sat up groggily, she seemed to smile somewhat at your disheveled appearance, before switching back to her usual apathetic expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast in the kitchen.\u201d She said, jerking her head to motion towards the kitchen. She then sauntered away, leaving you to fulfill your morning obligations yourself. This way of treatment was still foreign to you, but there was something empowering about a giantess letting you act completely on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed and freshening up, you trekked over to the kitchen, narrowly avoiding Morgan\u2019s pounding feet as she strode to the front door. You would\u2019ve hated to get trampled under her sneakers as she left for the gym, so you were lucky you\u2019d leapt to the side in time. You were doubly lucky Avery was still asleep too, as you had no doubt, she\u2019d find a few to screw this morning up for you in that ditzy, bubbly way of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up onto the kitchen table, you found that Quinn had set you aside some crackers and a shot glass of apple juice to drink from. Giving her an appreciative thumbs up, you dug into your meal, easily satisfying your hunger before you\u2019d even finished off all of the crackers. Quinn didn\u2019t say anything during the meal, but you caught her staring at you twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished eating, Quinn lifted up a duffel bag of her own onto the table, and gestured to an unzipped pocket on the side. \u201cGet in. Easiest way to carry you, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d You nodded, obliging the black-haired giantess. Scrambling up into the pocket, you fit snuggly inside. You watched the outside world disappear as Quinn zipped it up, and then everything began to swing and shake as Quinn shouldered the bag and headed for the door. In almost any other circumstance, this would terrify you, but you felt strangely at peace with placing your trust in your new roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your bag being set down on the passenger\u2019s seat, and then the car start up. It was a bit boring in the bag, but surprisingly comfy, and one hundred percent safe. The drive to the beach took a little over a half hour, but finally you heard the car stop. Quinn picked the bag back up, and gently patted the pocket you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here. Sanderson Beach.\u201d She explained, and if you listened closely enough, you could hear the seagulls and the waves in the distance. \u201cI need to go to the employee locker room to change, and then I\u2019ll take you to the office to meet with Brigitte.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pounded back against Quinn\u2019s hand as a sign of understanding, earning yourself the quietest and quickest of laughs you\u2019d ever heard, before your giantess carrier headed off to the locker room. You couldn\u2019t do much but keep waiting in the pocket, but you obviously knew why. In fact, you began to feel both embarrassed and intrigued by the fact that Quinn was now carrying you into the women\u2019s locker room. You had never in your life been in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes of mostly silence passed, though you heard Quinn give a muffled \u2018hello\u2019 to someone else in the locker room with her. Finally, your pocket was unzipped, and you were quickly grabbed up by Quinn\u2019s giant, soft hand, her fingers enveloping you as she retrieved you. You were taken out of the bag and placed down on one of those hard-wooden benches common in locker rooms, and found yourself staring up at the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll rational thought fled your mind. Your jaw openly dropped, and your knees felt weak. Quinn had been unfathomably attractive upon first meeting her, but this was on a whole other level. While you\u2019d been in the bag, she\u2019d changed into what you could only assume was her lifeguard uniform. Though it was only a simple red one-piece bikini at the end of the day, the very sight of it rocked your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s heavily abundant chest was wildly pronounced, as her gigantic breasts strained against the tight fabric of the bikini. The bikini clung to Quinn\u2019s body like a second skin (at a guess, it was a size too small for the curvaceous girl), and showed off so much of her porcelain smooth flesh. Every time Quinn so much as shifted slightly, her boobs jiggled, and the word \u2018LIFEGUARD\u2019 which was printed across her chest was stretched and distorted to a comical degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your extremely obvious stare, Quinn frowned and crossed her arms, succeeding only in squishing her abundant breasts more prominently. \u201cWow, perv. I thought you were better than that, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily clamped your jaw shut and stammered out a defense. \u201cI-I just didn\u2019t k-know you had changed! Caught me off guard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the only spare uniform close to my size that they had.\u201d Quinn sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so\u2026\u201d She cut herself off, and a faint color flared up in her cheeks. \u201cA-anyway\u2026it sucks, but whatever. Doesn\u2019t bother me that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you look really great!\u201d You said, smiling (and secretly praying that a compliment was the right course of action here).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn quirked her mouth in a show of disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you look great! Really!\u201d You nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn seemed to debate whether you were being sincere or not for another second, and then finally smiled very softly. The blush had returned to her cheeks. \u201cTh-thanks, Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing up her bag, Quinn effortlessly tied her short hair back and out of her eyes, then turned to put her bag into the locker behind her. For the second time in a row, your breath caught in your throat, and your jaw fell back open again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Quinn was impressive from the front, her backside was a heaven all onto itself. Her humongous derriere was impossibly alluring in her one-piece, each plump but doughy cheek perfectly sculpted into a big bubble booty. The one-piece left most of Quinn\u2019s creamy cheeks exposed, and it squeezed her ass so tight that the slightest movement shook it like an irresistible bowl of jelly. You desperately wished for nothing else than to leap into its pillowy embrace, this butt to end all butts bigger and more entrancing than any on the planet, in your books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to your staring, Quinn put her bag into her locker, then turned back to pick you up. Holding you in her hand, she walked out of the locker room and to the office. As she walked, you found it nigh impossible to not stare at her bountiful bosom or bodacious booty bounce and sway as she walked. Quinn was on a whole other level of thickness and beauty, and it was a shame she seemed oblivious to that. You also took note of how her one-piece seemed to keep riding up her butt crack, revealing even more of her ass. That whole \u2018size too small\u2019 issue was causing her a wedgie she had to keep picking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the office, Quinn introduced you to the chief lifeguard of Sanderson Beach, Brigitte. Brigitte was a twenty-five-year-old woman whose standout features were her fiery mane of red hair and her pronounced muscles and defined abs. She was alluringly muscled, fit but still feminine. Her own one-piece fit much more naturally than Quinn\u2019s, but she was still decently curvy under it. Her smile was award-winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little dude, it\u2019s a job you want?\u201d Brigitte asked, still smiling at you. It was a bit intimidating, how closely she was leaning in towards Quinn\u2019s hand to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yes! Yes, ma\u2019am! Any job you need, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d You proudly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte grinned. \u201cLove the attitude, man! I\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d She stood back to her full height of 6\u20192\u201d, and walked out from behind her desk. From what you\u2019d gathered, she spent most days handling office affairs. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026it\u2019s sudden to throw on another new lifeguard. We already have three others on shift today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn mused. \u201cWith three lifeguard towers overlooking the beach, we can always use more eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Brigitte agreed. \u201cTell ya what, Hunter. Do me proud for one whole week, and you\u2019ve got a guaranteed position. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d You said, shaking the red head\u2019s extended finger as a show of signing off on this new job. What\u2019s your first task?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, if testing you is what we\u2019re going with\u2026\u201d Brigitte tapped her chin, and looked at Quinn. Her eyes lit up. \u201cQuinn! Take Hunter with you to the middle tower. He\u2019ll be your partner for today\u2019s shift, and maybe the rest of the week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded, understanding. \u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled broadly. \u201cSounds like a plan to me, boss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte laughed at your bravado. \u201cAlright, then get going, you two! Guard some lives!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Quinn both nodded again, before you hopped up onto Quinn\u2019s palm. Bracing yourself, you held steady as your black-haired roommate strolled out of the office and onto the beach proper. The sun was blisteringly hot, but thankfully you and Quinn had both put on some sunscreen (Quinn in particular had lathered up to the extreme). There was also an occasional breeze that felt quite good, especially on your miniscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn strolled purposefully towards the middle tower, which you could see was not too far away. It was a standard lifeguard lookout post, about twelve feet off the ground. That was only half what you were noticing, however, as your attention had shamefully wandered back to Quinn herself. In full motion, her gigantic breasts were once more bouncing in an eye-catching manner, and her one-piece was again riding up her massive booty, revealing even more of it to the world. You were hardly the only one staring too, as Quinn was drawing the eyes of everyone she walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, she seemed oblivious to the adoration of the beach goers, or her own sex appeal. Your roommate and new partner merely kept sauntering on, eventually reaching the bottom of the lifeguard tower. Without a word to you, she cupped her hand and tossed you into the sky. You screamed out in surprise, flew into the air, and then crashed back down up atop the tower, landing in a slightly squishy heap on the floor of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you reformed, Quinn effortlessly scaled the ladder up onto the tower, and stood atop it seconds later. She spotted you immediately, and scooped you back up into her hand, then placed you on the railing that served as a barrier around the top of the tower. With you in place, she sank down into the lone chair, which looked to be made of uncomfortable hard plastic. You also couldn\u2019t help but note how Quinn\u2019s humongous ass just barely squeezed into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, you spoke up. \u201cSo\u2026this is the tower. What do we do now?\u201d You looked at your new partner eagerly, and though she stared back apathetically at first, your enthusiasm for your new job rubbed off just a bit on her, and she soothed her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, really.\u201d Quinn shrugged. \u201cIf someone asks for help, we help them. If someone starts screaming out in the water, we save them. Otherwise\u2026\u201d She gestured in a circle. \u201cThis is our post for the rest of the shift. Get comfy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at her blunt explanation, and sat down on the wooden railing. It was smooth wood, so no splinters, thankfully. In fact, you bet that you were more comfortable sitting on the railing than Quinn was in her seat. Though it was early in the day, the sun had been bearing down for hours, and the plastic was probably quite broiling, not to mention how the chair pinched and poked at Quinn\u2019s hips and back. You had to believe that it was built for lifeguard\u2019s with much less developed proportions than the black-haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next twenty minutes were fairly uneventful. No one asked for help, no one screamed for a savior. The sounds of the beach were just the crashing of the waves, the laughing of the beach goers, the occasional windy breeze, and the cawing of seagulls. You passed the time with Quinn by asking her about some of her favorite memories working here. She was her usual cagey self for a bit, but she began to open up more as time went by. It was pretty fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the fun came to an end, and a faint voice called out from the bottom of the tower. \u201cHey! Miss! Can you help me find my phone? I swear, I just had it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn hopped to her feet instantly, and walked over to the railing, peering down at the young girl who had asked for help. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d She replied. She then looked back to you, forcing you to quickly clamp your open jaw shut, hoping Quinn hadn\u2019t just caught you watching her bubble butt jiggle and shake due to how fast she had stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way Quinn\u2019s eyes narrowed in annoyance, and the way she reached a hand back to readjust her wedgied one-piece, you knew that she had caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to not address it, you stammered out. \u201cU-uh\u2026want me to come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Quinn shook her head. \u201cNo, not this time. It\u2019ll take too long. Hold down the fort.\u201d She said, and then turned on her heel without another word. In one effortless motion, Quinn flipped around onto the ladder, and descended it out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll alone, you went back to scanning the beach, looking for anything that might be amiss, or anyone who might need help. There were a huge number of people at the beach, laughing, tanning, playing volleyball, swimming, and just generally enjoying themselves. For one blissful moment, you felt that this job was truly the best thing to ever happen to you, or any tiny, for that matter. It was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion of perfection shattered a moment later, when a squawking seagull dive-bombed through the air, coming to a screeching landing on the tower railing right beside you. You screamed and backed away, the giant bird like a mythical creature of death at your size. The seagull eyed you curiously, and took a step closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to end up the meal for some bird, you blindly leapt from the railing towards the inside of the tower, hoping it wouldn\u2019t follow you. You hadn\u2019t exactly looked where you were jumping, though, and you ended up landing right in the lifeguard chair. The fall slightly squished your legs, but the real thing you noticed first was the burning sensation of the hot plastic. It felt like you had landed in lava, it was almost overwhelmingly hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance told you that the seagull had given up and flown away, allowing you to breath a sigh of relief and focus on reforming. Your feet had flattened out and stuck to the plastic, the sticky nature of your body no doubt enhanced by how searingly hot the plastic was. Almost as overbearing as the temperature was the residual scent of Quinn\u2019s body wash mixed with her sweat. It was both gross and appealing, and that fact made it all the weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you had only just reformed one foot when the worst possible thing happened: Quinn appeared, having finished helping the young girl down below. She scaled the ladder with ease, and then approached her chair. You still couldn\u2019t move, and could only look up at her in fear as she towered above you. Nightmare scenarios of her not noticing you and sitting down ran through your mind, but she actually spotted you right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her hips, Quinn frowned. \u201c\u2026what are you doing, Hunter? That\u2019s not your seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up your hands, willing your right foot to stop sticking to the chair. \u201cI-I know, I know! I\u2019m sorry, Quinn. A seagull flew by and scared me off the railing. This is where I fell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn\u2019s look of contempt told you that she didn\u2019t believe you, but there was a hint of uncertainty in her eyes. \u201cUh huh. You landed right where I\u2019m supposed to sit. Honestly, I should already BE sitting, even if you are there. It\u2019s not where you\u2019re supposed to be, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, honest! Please, Quinn, it won\u2019t happen again!\u201d You pleaded with your giantess lifeguard partner. \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn agonizingly long moment passed before Quinn closed her eyes and sighed. Reaching down, she plucked you up from her seat and returned you to the railing. She then sat back down, her butt audibly clapping against the plastic as she plopped into her chair. A grimace crossed your face, as visions of you being trapped under all of that played out in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Quinn a big, genuine smile. \u201cThank you, Quinn. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head. \u201cNo, I believe you, about the seagull. That isn\u2019t your fault, much. It would\u2019ve been wrong to punish you for it.\u201d She sighed, and you were about to speak again when she held up a finger, shushing you. \u201cBUT, if it happens again, I won\u2019t save you. You have to take care of yourself, Hunter, or you\u2019ll always be as weak and frail as people say that tinies are. You won\u2019t grow more dependable if I baby you every day during this job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took stock of her words, and nodded. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn smiled faintly, and then was back to full business mode. \u201cSo if I see you on my chair again before I sit down\u2026\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t let me find you on my chair, is what I\u2019m saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that!\u201d You saluted, earning a barely audible chuckle from the black-haired giantess. Then, the two of you went back to looking out over the beach. Your shift as partners continued.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed as you and Quinn continued to relax and chat on your shift. It seemed like this was going to be a very easy job, especially if you\u2019re being partnered with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard someone climbing up the ladder and you and Quinn turned to see who was approaching. A giant blonde reached the top of the ladder and she was wearing a red lifeguard swimsuit similar to Quinn\u2019s, only this one was a two-piece, exposing the blonde\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely on the curvy side with a similar build to Quinn, her seemingly luscious blonde locks were tied up in a top-knot bun. She had beautiful blue eyes, plump lips, and slightly tanned skin. Age-wise, she appeared to be in her late 20s, and you had to admit, she was pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Quinn!\u201d The happy blonde rang out. Exhibiting a bubbly, fun personality. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d The blonde\u2019s energy contrasted greatly with Quinn\u2019s as your roommate seemed slightly annoyed with this girl. \u201cOh... hey Sydney...\u201d Quinn bluntly greeted her coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde, evidently named Sydney, seemed unaware of Quinn\u2019s annoyance of her and continued the conversation. \u201cBrigitte told me we have a new member of our team, and I heard he was a tiny! I wanted to come introduce myself!\u201d Sydney said with an eager tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn turned to look at you and saw that you were staring at your new found \u201cdiscovery.\u201d You snapped out of it for a moment and made eye contact with Quinn, embarrassed that she noticed your admiring of Sydney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right over there.\u201d Quinn dryly declared, pointing towards the rail where you resided. Sydney turned her gaze to where Quinn gestured and saw your tiny body in plain sight. She sauntered over to you, her hips swaying and chest slightly bouncing in a hypnotic display as she approached. She stood in front of you, the rail coming up to her waist so you were face-to-face with her soft belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to crane your head upwards, attempting to concentrate on her deep blue eyes to avoid the distraction of her physique. Sydney stared down at you for a moment and smiled. \u201cWell hello there, cutie! My name is Sydney!\u201d Her \u201ccutie\u201d comment definitely caught you off guard as you tried to formulate a response. \u201cUh.. hi. I\u2019m Hunter!\u201d Quinn rolled her eyes at your awkward reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney continued to study the tiny boy below her. Since tinies became a normal part of society, she has always treated them well and enjoyed interacting with them. However, this time it felt different; she had never encountered a tiny so... cute before. Her infatuation with you was growing each passing second as she eyed your cute face and shirtless body, she was going to enjoy working with you. She was a really sweet girl at heart, but not the most self-aware as she can be a tad too affectionate at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to feel slightly uncomfortable as the massive blonde continued her locked gaze on you, the grin she sported doing nothing to calm you down. \u201cWow...\u201d Sydney said. Finally breaking the silence. \u201cI must say, you are incredibly cute! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met a tiny as handsome as you!\u201d She finished her statement with a flirtatious wink causing you to tremble. Something about this girl made you slightly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Umm, thank you! That\u2019s... nice of-Whoa!\u201d You were interrupted as a giant hand reached down and scooped you up off the railing and you were now face-to-face with Sydney as you sat on her palm. The happy blonde giggled before she started to poke and lightly stroke you with her finger, the tickling sensation grew quickly as you tried to fight her off. Quinn took a slight enjoyment at your predicament as she watched you grunt and squirm. \u201cAww! How adorable!\u201d Sydney sang as she continued to tickle your abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Quinn began to grow annoyed with Sydney\u2019s obnoxious laugh and decided to come retrieve you. \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough.\u201d Your roommate declared with authority as she grabbed you from her coworker\u2019s hand. \u201cAwww...\u201d Sydney\u2019s once joyful expression took a 180. You almost felt bad for her, she seemed nice and probably means well, but you were also relieved to be back in Quinn\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best if we all get back to work\u201d Quinn continued, having no regards of her coworker\u2019s sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... well I\u2019m going to head back to my post then...\u201d Sydney was pretty bummed as she walked towards the ladder... but then she got an idea! \u201cSay, Quinn... would it be okay if I took Hunter for a bit? You know... show him around the beach and stuff?\u201d The sweet smile quickly returned to the blonde\u2019s face. Your heart nearly stopped at her suggestion, and you turned to look at Quinn, subtly trying to shake your head \u2018no\u2019 and use your eyes to communicate that message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn read your message loud and clear, she knew you didn\u2019t want to go with her. On the other hand she was still kinda pissed about the seat incident from earlier and sort of wanted to get back at you somehow. She knew Sydney very well, and the idea of you being stuck in her loving clutches was amusing to her. The thought brought a subtle smirk to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delay of Quinn\u2019s response was unsettling, she obviously had something on her mind... was she considering letting Sydney take you with her??? Your thoughts were interrupted as Quinn opened her mouth and said \u201c______\u201d</span></div></div>",

Before you could open your mouth to protest you felt yourself fly in the air as Quinn tossed you towards Sydney. The blonde had no time to react as you sailed towards her, so instead of catching you with her hand, you landed straight on her boobs. You bounced a few times before falling into the ravine that was her cleavage. Your entire body was wedged between the two fleshy mounds, completely out of sight. For a moment you wondered if Quinn purposefully intended for you to land here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn giggled with a satisfied expression. \u201cWow! Looks like he\u2019s already having fun!\u201d Sydney blushed for a moment as she processed what just happened. \u201cOh oops.. my bad Hunter!\u201d The blonde sympathetically expressed. \u201cOh don\u2019t apologize!\u201d Quinn chimed in again. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just where he wants to be! I saw the way he was looking at you earlier, he\u2019s definitely on cloud nine right now!\u201d You tried to shout and explain the truth to Sydney, but your voice was muffled between her huge boobies. \u201cHee hee! That tickles!\u201d The happy blonde giddily announced as she felt your attempts to talk and squirm free, her boobs quivered as she laughed causing you to bounce in a nauseating rhythm with them. \u201cGuess it\u2019s your turn to get tickled now!\u201d Quinn teased. Butterflies excitedly swarmed in Sydney\u2019s stomach at the revelation that you seem to like her too! \u201cOmg! This is just FANTABOLOUS!\u201d Sydney squealed like a school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn watched Sydney eagerly descend the ladder and haul you far away towards the other end of the beach, her bikini booty bouncing happily with each step. For a moment she felt kind of bad about what she just did to you, maybe the chair situation really was just an accident... However, she also knew that you having some time with an overbearing girl like Sydney might toughen you up a little more! Pleased with her justification, she turned her attention back towards the beach as you slipped her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried as deep as you were in Sydney\u2019s cleavage, there was really nothing you could do to prevent her from carrying you away with her. Your feeble attempts to struggle or protest absorbed into the bouncing of her breasts without even being noticed by the massive blonde. With the warm flesh rubbing against you from all sides, it was difficult just to maintain your basic shape, let alone try to hatch an escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless to the thoughts of her little passenger, Sydney was just happy to have her new little friend in tow as she strolled along the beach, her large rear jiggling happily with each step. She\u2019s always been intentional in making sure that tiny men are treated fairly and well, so she takes joy in befriending you! Plus... she hasn\u2019t had a boyfriend in a long time, so she was excited to get to spend the day with such a cute boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sydney truly is a sweetheart and always tries to be kind to everyone she meets, she severely lacks social awareness. Her overbearing and highly affectionate nature typically acting as a major factor in her actions. This behavior has scared off many in the past, especially men, and little did you know you were about to become the next victim of her tender motivations...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh wait a minute!\" Brigitte exclaimed, raising her finger and eyebrows at the same time as she seemingly remembered something. \"I completely forgot about our tinies only section of our beach! We typically have had one of our normal sized lifeguards watch over it, as its pretty much just a 10x10 foot square of sand leading up to the water. But quite often there are issues that could likely use a bit more precision than our girls can give. I mean you save dozens of tiny guys from drowning without so much as a thank you, but accidentally kidnap a few guys after the waves slide them into the back of your swimsuit and you\u2019ll never live it down.\u201d Brigitte shook her head, part of her chuckling at her quick anecdote, and part actually annoyed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where you come in,\u201d she continued, \u201cThere\u2019s an appropriately sized lifeguard tower towards the edge of the zone, as well as a tiny megaphone for you to yell at any of the tiny guys in there or any normal sized girl trying to enter the zone.\u201d You smiled in return, appreciative of the inclusion of the megaphone. While some strange part about the physiological changes of men allowed your voices to travel to normal girls\u2019 ears most of the time, seemingly if they weren\u2019t paying enough attention then they often still wouldn\u2019t hear you. Being able to bolster your voice even a bit would likely be quite helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte leaned over you once more, her powerfully toned body contrasting the overwhelming softness of your new giantess roommate behind you. \u201cSave people who need saving, help people who need helping, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory. Now get out there, and you too, Wallace, you\u2019ll be manning the station that the tiny section is in. Keep an eye out and help him if he needs it but I don\u2019t want to catch you doing his job for him!\u201d Brigitte\u2019s firmness was accompanied by a level of genuine confidence and enthusiasm that somehow reassured you. While she looked intimidating, you could tell that if you stayed on her good side then she would be a good ally to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, believe me I won\u2019t be babying this guy. He\u2019s gotta survive on his own somehow.\u201d Quinn said to Brigitte, her eyes flicking down to you midway through her sentence. In a way you really appreciated Quinn\u2019s blunt, no nonsense way of speaking to you. You had grown used to women either taking care of your every need in an overbearing way, or actively seeking out to torture you. Either way the fact that you were only an inch tall seemed to almost always be the focus of any woman\u2019s attention towards you. It was quite refreshing to hear Quinn actually talk to you as an equal, even if you were about 1/70th her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn then plucked you up in her hand, readjusting so you could sit on her palm as she turned and walked swiftly out of the office. Making a pitstop back in the locker room, Quinn stopped by her locker, placed you on the bench, and took out a large tube of SPF 100 sunscreen. You could only gawk up at your giant friend as she began to smear the cream over every inch of exposed flesh. You watched her soft hands caressing each of her comically oversized assets, making sure she didn\u2019t miss a single spot. The amount of sunscreen she needed to cover a single gargantuan butt cheek would probably be a lifetime supply for you. In the middle of your deep trance you heard Quinn\u2019s voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStaring again, perv. If you\u2019re going to work as a lifeguard you\u2019re going to have to learn how to keep your composure around regular girls in bikinis.\u201d Quinn\u2019s tone indicated half annoyance, but also half genuine enjoyment that she took from poking fun at you. Either way, you were about to shout back to her that she was far beyond a \u201cregular girl\u201d as she said due to her ludicrously attractive looks, but before you could speak a drop of sunscreen as big as you landed right on you. You quickly dug your way out of the thick substance, reaching the top to catch the tail end of a light chuckle coming from Quinn. By the time you pulled yourself out of the glob you were sufficiently covered head to toe, ensuring that you would neither melt nor burn yourself in the hot sun. Quinn then reached down with a finger, swiping up the remaining sunscreen on the bench and rubbing it into her the last spot on her ass that she hadn\u2019t yet covered. Quinn caught you looking once more and simply rolled her eyes before picking you up yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on let\u2019s get out there\u201d she said as she closed her locker and began powerfully walking out into the blistering sun. It was a scorching day on the beach, happy to be covered in Quinn\u2019s extra strong sunscreen. Since both of your stations were located towards the middle of the beach, it only took you a matter of minutes to reach them. You saw the tinies only section from your perch in Quinn\u2019s hand. It consisted of a number of spikes in the sand, with bright red rope traveling between them, effectively sectioning off the 10x10 foot area that Brigitte had been talking about before. You saw it was fairly crowded too, with a number of guys looking to simply spend a nice day at the beach without fear of being crushed by a roaming giantess. It honestly looked pretty fun to you, briefly making you wish that you had more friends your size. Spending all of your time with giant women had its benefits for sure, but the normalcy of the tiny zone did seem like a welcome change of pace for once. Quinn finally arrived at the edge of the rope, bending over to drop you off in the sand. As she did so you saw each and every head in the zone turn to stare at the hanging mountain of cleavage behind them. Honestly, you couldn\u2019t blame them, you were too. Quinn\u2019s body was a spectacle, even if she didn\u2019t often acknowledge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Hunter, do some good work today. I want to make sure you keep this job\u2026 it would be kind of cool to keep working together like this.\u201d Quinn said down to you, once again showing just the slightest crack in her normally apathetic attitude. She then stood back up, returning to her full height, and turned to walk back towards her own normal sized lifeguard tower. Once more you and the sea of tiny guys in the section stared at the ridiculous ass eating up the backside of her lifeguard one piece with each passing step. You shook yourself out of staring and walked a few steps, climbing the lifeguard tower and sitting yourself in the high chair. Sure enough the megaphone was hanging off of the armrest and there was a miniature umbrella casting a nice shadow over you. You looked out beyond the tiny guys\u2019 zone and saw a myriad of beautiful giant women frolicking and having fun on the beach. You breathed a sigh of contentment, maybe your job wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all. After all, you knew from experience that guys were fairly resilient, so you didn\u2019t have much fear of actually needing to save any lives. It seemed like a pretty solid gig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat befalls you as lifeguard of the tinies only section?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was quite crowded that day and most of the open space on the beach was already taken by other women. For that reason when you heard a woman\u2019s voice behind you say, \u201cUgh, finally an open space\u201d you whipped your head around and knew that she was headed straight for you. You watched for a moment as her massive feet kicked sand to and fro, each step getting her closer along her path right towards the tinies only section. Fumbling with your megaphone for a moment you finally raised it to your lips, the woman only a few steps away from steamrolling you under her massive sole and trampling countless guys in front of you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am! This is not an open space, this is an area dedicated to tiny men only!\u201d You shouted up, your voice amplified through the megaphone being clearly loud enough for the woman to hear. She luckily slowed down her pace and looked downward, finally seeming to recognize the mass of tinies laid out in front of her. She grimaced for a moment before looking specifically at you. You kept talking, \u201cI apologize for the inconvenience, but if you could kindly find somewhere else to set up your things I would really appreciate it. Normal sized women are not supposed to go past the red rope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman tapped her chin for a moment in thought, before her eyes lit up with an idea. You were nervous already, you had hoped that the woman would just comply and leave you be. But deep down you knew that whatever idea of authority that you thought the lifeguard job would give you, ultimately meant jack squat when dealing with a woman who could squish you like chewed gum. She finally spoke down to you, \u201cEver heard of Baker\u2019s law?!\u201d the woman said haughtily, pointing confidently at her tan swimsuit bottom. Your heart dropped as you knew immediately what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaker\u2019s law was a Supreme Court decision that had been made nearly 18 months ago at this current point in time. After years of fighting from a student, now graduate, at a college called Middletown University that goes by the name of Amy Baker, a law concerning the usage and rights of tiny men as items had been passed. You heard all about it on the news when it first passed. Amy Baker fought for the idea that men should be able to choose to be used as whatever they wanted, not just forced to live as miniature regular people. They could pursue getting legally licensed for use by a specific woman or in general, as long as all parties involved were willing. The law stated that any licensed man must still be recognized as a human being, no matter what condition they were currently in or what they were being used for. The process in its entirety was quite rare, with a very small percentage of the population actually going through with it, but nonetheless it made nationwide headlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was seen by this Amy Baker herself as a landmark day for tiny men\u2019s rights. She thought that men who were okay with being used should be respected and accepted for doing so. It was a sweet idea, really, but in reality it was easily abused by women who sought far worse fates for the tiny men that surrounded them. A few cases of men who got their Usage License for the right reasons would find their way to news stations every once in a while. A husband signing up for use from his wife and daughter because he didn\u2019t have enough money to buy them Christmas presents would warm the hearts of those who heard of it. But just as often as you heard good stories about Baker\u2019s Law, you also heard the opposite. Men were often threatened into pursuing their Usage License, or outright sold themselves into it in hopes of making a quick buck. You never really understood the point of passing the law in the first place, as you had never once noticed a woman police officer asking to see someone\u2019s Usage License ever. All you knew was that there was no way in hell you would do it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back into reality, you knew that when the woman said those words and pointed to her rather small bikini bottom, that it must have been a small guy just like you. You empathized with the man, having been in his situation more than a few times before. The woman then kept talking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he is a tiny guy just like you and the law says you have to respect his rights even though he is my swimsuit bottom! Since he is wrapped around my ass right now then my ass deserves entry into your stupid tinies only section. Couldn\u2019t you all just scoot over a bit too? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll take up the entire space!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to handle the situation. If you still rejected the woman then she may really be able to pursue legal discourse, suing the lifeguard company for not respecting the rights granted to men by Baker\u2019s Law. You cursed this stupid law, what rights did that guy receive? The right to have his entire body wedged between her butt cheeks? In reality it just granted this giantess woman even more privilege to do as she pleased. Briefly considering standing up to the giantess, you eventually decided against it. However, an idea did spark in your mind about a loophole in the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course we respect his right to be in here, he is a tiny after all. But since he is currently residing around your, erm, backside, then I am afraid your backside is the only part of you that is allowed to be in here with him.\u201d You smirked internally, knowing that at least in some way you had followed the rules and still won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman furrowed her brow in anger for a moment, before lightening up and responding simply, \u201cOkay that works for me!\u201d In an instant she dropped her things just outside of the roped off area, sending a cloud of sand careening over you and countless tiny guys near you. As the cloud of sand cleared you looked up to see the giantess had turned herself around, and had already begun squatting down, right where your lifeguard stand was on the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*crack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive woman\u2019s ass collided with your lifeguard tower and yourself first, absolutely detonating the seat which you were starting to love so much. As it shattered you fell to the sand a few feet, with her planet sized ass following suit. Even in this horrific moment, you couldn\u2019t help but think that this woman\u2019s still sizable ass wasn\u2019t even in the same league as Quinn\u2019s. But you didn\u2019t have time to think as the crushing pressure of the woman rammed you deeper into the sand, displacing the grains around her. When all was said and done the woman\u2019s ass was planted firmly on top of you, with her legs sticking out away from the water and outside of the roped off tiny zone. She had won, you cursed yourself for being so stupid. You could only hope that this woman could show you mercy at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you handle this rude giantess?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The heat and the pressure underneath this woman was nearly too much for you, buried under her butt. With all your might you tried to wriggle and get away from her but being directly under her cheek made it impossible for you to move. You tried to focus on what to do under the heat and pain you were in.<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here, I cant fail on my first task of the day! And what will  my boss and the other lifeguards think of me when property of the beach gets destroyed under my watch?\" You tried again but there was no avail. She was just much too heavy for you and you were much too squashed. Your senses became more and more dull thanks to the immense heat and pressure you were suffering. After sometime.. you coulndt say if it were 10 min or 1h her butt sweat began dripping from her cheek, forming a layer on her butt and yourself. At first you were just disgusted as anyone would, especially when that sweat comes from this bodyregion. Suddenly you remembered the poor guy, who apparently voluntered to experience this and much worse things as her swimsuit bottom.\"Why would someone volunteer for such a horrible  treatment with all the sweat and worse? Especially only for the profit of such an unpleasant woman\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whait SWEAT that's it! I can try to wriggle around the next time she shifts her position and with a little luck I can escape due the layer of liquid around me! Or maybe dig my way out of here, right beside the sand doesnt seem so compressed as it is here\" you thougt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time the woman did shift around for some reason. The silent *plop* of a sunscreen bottle delivered the explanation why luck was on your side. But it didnt matter to you: You wriggled your whole body to move a little forward. Step by step you moved forward like a snail, unfortunatly for you was the fact that you were just as slow as the animal. Finally you arrived at the section of loose sand to dig your way to freedom. When you looked up you could see the huge ass crack of your (former?) captive. You tried to get the fear out of your head, cause it would only lead to freeze you because of that feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets do this\" you said to yourself, trying to motivate you and getting the fear out of your head. Suddenly you heard a quiet but noticable voice:<br>\r\n \"Hello? I mmmpf HELP!\" <br>\r\nYou nearly pissed yourself out of fear until you remembered the thong-guy and that the voice most likely belonged to him.<br>\r\nThe next moment you looked up and saw the butt looming over you. You had to think quickly: \"Ok I dont know what is happening here but first i need to get away from this ground zero, if i make it I can solve the riddle of the thong-mans voice\" you cursed yourself for the term \"thong- guy\" but since that stupid law passed the supreme court it was all around the news and media in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou digged your way away from this dangerous place and made mor progress than you expected yourself. You were in a good physical condition but was helping you the most , was the fact that this woman took her sweet time for putting on her sun lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your work was done and you felt safe enough to look back you realized that you indeed made it out of the danger zone. Exhausted you allowed yourself a moment of rest,celebrating your victory and taking a deep breath of fresh air. <br>\r\nAfter 5 min of resting and reforming more and more you were nearly in your original human form,which filled you with joy and relief. Mostly because it wouldnt be the first time for you getting away from one danger and stumbling in the next.<br>\r\nSpeaking of danger: \" I have to solve this stupid situation with this woman without getting squashed again you \" you told yourself. \"But what about the guy in her back... Was he really calling for help or was it just the pressure and heat which made me hallucinate?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about this occurence under the butt your feet finally plopped back in their normal form and you were able again to walk and solve the problem with the lifeguard stand and maybe solve the riddle of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approached the woman, who seemed to read a book with her sunglasses on and enjoying her time. What angered you additionally to your broken work station was the fact that she does not seem to be concerned about what you two talked about before, now almost her whole body was in the tiny section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00c4hm EXCUSE ME ,MISS?\" you shouted up to her.<br>\r\nConfused she took her sunglasses down a little to see who was talking to her and finally she cought sight of you.<br>\r\n\"You again? What do you want from me again? I'm trying to enjoy me time here at the beach. Wasn't our early talk enough for you to realized that you are not welcome here?<br>\r\nWhat she said was making a very angry and much less careful.<br>\r\n\"I'M THE LIFEGUARD HERE AND YOU ARE A GUEST OF THIS BEACH. I REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE ORDERS OF THE STAFF WITHOUT EXCEPTION!\" you screamed at her full of anger.<br>\r\nAt first she looked shocked at your outburst but soon she just smirked while shrugging her shoulders. She doesnt seem to be impressed and answered with a slight giggle :<br>\r\n\"Well Mr. Lifeguard, of course I follow the orders of the beach. We talked about my rights...aaahm his rights to be in this tiny section.\" <br>\r\nWhen she mentioned the guy in her backside, you suddenly remembered your second goal for this conversation but you had to play your cards smart.<br>\r\n\"Well first of all I have to correct you a little, indeed you followed my orders from before but it seems like you didnt notice that you destroyed property of the firm I'm working for, my Lifeguard- outlook. Which i believe wasnt on purpose but still is a violation.<br>\r\n\"I didnt destroy anything, i would be glad if you showed me proof of these wild accusations\" she demanded.<br>\r\nAfter you told her to stand up and look behind her, her face turned red out of anger or shame you couldnt tell.<br>\r\n\"Well ok , seems like I did, but there was no way for me to see this little match- house.\" Plus it was Brains fault as well\" she said while pointing at her thong, which began to have a deep red colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This brings me to the  next topic i wanted to ask you about...\" you started your sentence dripping of confidence after your last verbal win against this woman. You were disgusted that she tried to blame her thong for this but that was their personal problem. What you were interested in was the usage license<br>\r\nwith both their signatures.<br>\r\n\"May I ask you for your usage license please?\" you asked. <br>\r\n\"Well no , cause that is really none of your damn buisness and besides I only have to show it to a police officer.\" she said offended.<br>\r\n\"Well that is indeed very true but when I was burried with my Outlook -tower under you I could hear a voice shouting out for help, which made me believe It was worth asking why this might be\" you said overconfidently, forgetting about the difference in her and your possibilties.<br>\r\n\"Well, Well, Well we have a very dedicated young lifeguard here it seems, always seeking for the wellbeing of his customers.\" she said while searching in her beach bag. After a little time of searching, she took a very creasy piece of paper out of her bag, which was nearly not readable due of its bad state. On one corner you could see a big coffee spot in the middle there was something which looked like ketchup.<br>\r\n\"This is the Usage License for my little thongy- Tony here\", she said while pulling on her thong to emphazise her power over him and smirking at you.<br>\r\nWhen you looked on it you could only read that her name was Rachel Wood and that her part of the document had a signature as it should be. But the other half of the paper, where his information should be was all dirty and nearly not readable. At first you thought you would have lost again against this woman but fortunatly for you, you realized that there was no signature to see under the coffee spot.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mam it seems there is no signature of a Tony on this license which makes the whole document wortless, legally speaking of course\" you said smiling and drunk of your own self esteem. \" I will have to call my boss to further inspect this anomaly, I'm sure when we ask Tony he will explain everything\" you said <br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye the woman grabed you with light speed and you found yourself right in front of her angry face. <br>\r\n\"Oh I  dont think so my dear. Do you see this woman there?\" she asked pointing at a huge curvy black woman in a skimpy blue bikini walking towards your spot and waiving with her arms to greet. Even from this perspective you could see that her assets , especially her butt were giant in comparison to Rachels<br>\r\n\"This is Isabella, my dearest friend and by coincidence she is a notary which can confirm my story about tonys free choice to be a thong for me. \" she explained to you with a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"She was responsible for all the paper work I had to do before I could get Tony where I wanted. So here is the deal little man either you stay silent about all  of these accusations with the tower and tony, or maybe a new Usage License appears with your name on it and I promise you that the \"For everyone to use\"- Box will be crossed. I'm sure Isabella would gladly be of help for your wish. And the way I see it you would also make a great thong but I guess you will be the wrong size for a woman like me\" she said with a telling expression on her face while turning her eyes to Isabell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were in a double windmill. either you give in and wont have an explanation for the lost tower  or you will have to deal with a corrupt notary and her evil friend leading to a Usage Licence for yourself. \"What shall I do either way I'm fucked up, the question is... is my well being more important than tonys? Noone will investigate his status as a thong without you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though the sun was bright and hot, the water rolling in from the sea was cool, and the windy breeze steady. Not a single person\u2019s life came anywhere near danger, and peace reigned in your little tiny section of Sanderson Beach. A few guys wanted pointers on swim techniques, and another tiny accidentally lost his miniature wallet, so you handled those minimal issues with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as time crept past that first hour mark, you kept hearing rumbling sounds in the distance, like an engine blaring. You assumed it was someone\u2019s souped-up motorcycle in the parking lot, until you realized that it was actually coming from the direction of the ocean, not behind you outside of the beach. Leaning forward in your chair, you squinted off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you spotted what appeared to be a rather large speedboat piloted by two wild sorority girls. It was racing up along the shore, bouncing along the waves and splashing water in its wake. Worryingly, the speedboat was quite close to the beach, and in genuine danger of hitting a swimmer or surfer who couldn\u2019t move out of the way in time. Worse still, from what you could spot (your vision was quite good), the driver of the speedboat seemed intoxicated out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to your feet in a panic, you thought frantically about what to do, wondering how someone of your size could possibly make a difference. Still, acting almost without thinking, you leapt from your lifeguard stand down onto the sand, and ran out into the middle of the tiny section. You motioned frantically to all of your fellow tinies, signaling them to group up near the middle of the tiny section. If any disaster struck (though you were still unsure of what that would entail) you would be ready. In minutes, all fifty or so tiny guys had grouped up around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and a loud voice cried out from far off to your left. \u201cHEY! STOP THAT BOAT! STOP THAT BOAT RIGHT NOW!\u201d The voice yelled loudly and forcefully. You jerked to follow the sound of the voice, tracing it all the way to Quinn over at the middle tower, some hundred yards away. She was standing and pointing while holding her megaphone up to her mouth. She looked furious, terrifyingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls in the boat clearly heard her, and thankfully had just enough common sense to stop their drunken antics. However, before powering down their boat, they steered it closer to shore. The driver whipped the boat around in a hairpin turn while haphazardly docking the boat, and the rear end of the speedboat dug into the waves, dredging up a considerably forceful wake. This explosion of water, which took the form of a wave, surged out from behind the boat\u2026and right towards the tiny section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the fifty other tinies did nothing but stare in abject shock and horror as the surging water from the speedboat\u2019s reckless turn surged towards the shore. Though no more than two feet in height in actuality, that scale was more than enough to qualify as a tidal wave disaster, and as the wave hit the beach and pressed on up, it showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to crawl though, and in those final moments, you noted several things. One: you took note of how every normal-sized beach goer around the tiny section had their eyes firmly on the antics of the boat and on Quinn, not on the tiny section crisis. Two: you similarly noted that Quinn was too busy marching towards the drunk girls and their boat, angry beyond belief at their potentially life-threatening joyride, and she didn\u2019t notice what was going on in the tiny section either. Three: you numbly reconsidered that ramifications of clumping all the tinies in the section into one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to unfreeze, the tidal wave hit, and all hell broke loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the other gathered tinies became a confused mess of screaming and panicking as the wave scooped all of you up into its cold, merciless embrace. You were all knocked off your feet and sent spiraling into different directions. Some tinies were tossed aside to relative safety, some coasted along the cusp of the wave, and some were submerged fully in the salty depths. Of course, the only logical course of action for an outgoing wave was to wash back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water was pulled back into the sea, at least forty of the gathered tinies went with it, you included. Your screaming and cries of terror continued, a chorus of horrified tinies echoing out in unison. Sadly, your paltry noises were just about entirely muffled by the simple crashing of the wave, and were definitely imperceptible to anyone close by. Quinn\u2019s fury over at the boat was still the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your superior stamina and skills in swimming, you managed to stay afloat at the crest of the wave, and were finally deposited right on the water\u2019s edge. Coughing and sputtering, you wiped saltwater from your eyes and watched in horror as at least thirty other tinies were swept away into the ocean. Though only a few feet out from shore at most, that distance was miles in terms of a tiny\u2019s perspective. You were stricken with grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat grief gave way to something much more when you heard voices from behind you a minute later. Though faint at first, your ears eventually picked up the distinct sound of laughter. Turning around, your eyes widened, nearly bulging out from your sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of three giantesses, towering high, were strolling directly towards the tiny section, laughing and smiling. You took a step to move towards your lifeguard stand and retrieve your megaphone to yell up at them, assuming that they were also distracted by the boat incident and weren\u2019t noticing the clear signs that signaled the tiny section of Sanderson Beach. However, you only took one step before freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour megaphone wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. For that matter, neither was the entire lifeguard stand itself. For that matter, neither were any of the spikes in the sand, or the bright red rope that cordoned off the tiny section. The wave had picked them all up, dragged them across the sand, and swept them away to sea. Every single discernible marker for the tiny section was gone. Those three girls weren\u2019t ignoring the tiny section\u2026they didn\u2019t know it existed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s never a spot empty this close to the shore!\u201d The oldest giantess, a brunette woman probably around thirty or so, exclaimed, smiling warmly. \u201cWhat a perfect day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl, a blonde roughly twenty years old, shrugged. \u201cJust don\u2019t get me wet while getting out of the water. It\u2019ll ruin my tan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman laughed heartily. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on leaving that water for quite a few hours, sweetheart. I came here to swim, after all.\u201d She gestured proudly to her swimsuit of choice, and you gaped at her body. For a moment, you forgot all about your plight and the fates of the tiny section patrons, and your entire world became ogling the woman\u2019s curvy, hourglass figured body. She was wearing nothing but a skimpy string bikini top and bottom, that looked more like strands of floss pressing against her smooth bronzed flesh than real clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger giantess rolled her eyes and began rolling out a towel to lie down on. As she did so, you watched a tiny get buried under her heel, and then another hidden beneath the towel. As the girl kneeled on her towel, she stripped off her two-piece and lathered tanning lotion on herself. You couldn\u2019t help but watch, though you felt awful at secretly observing a naked giantess stranger. You justified this staring when you spotted an unfortunate tiny be mashed under the girl\u2019s breast as she lied out on her stomach to begin tanning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken from your staring by thunderous footsteps, you dove to the side as the older woman ran into the ocean with glee. Two more tinies found themselves molded into the sand by the woman\u2019s heel as she ran, and then a cascade of water rained down as the thick giantess splashed into the sea. One tiny was left mangled in her aftermath, but with his head above the sand, so you walked over to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reach him, though, the third giantess, a young brown-haired girl about ten years old, skipped happily up towards you, bucket in hand. Without noticing you at all, she swept her bucket through the sand, and scooped up the poor tiny you were going to save right into her plastic bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling gleefully, the girl trotted several steps away. \u201cThis is gonna be the best sandcastle ever!\u201d She laughed, and then dumped the bucket contents out. You could just barely see the tiny fall into the pile of sand, and you could also make out at least three other tinies caught up in the young child\u2019s building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at the curvaceous giantess in the water, your jaw dropped open at the sight before you. The woman had stood up for a second, the water up to her quite massive buttocks. Her stringy, barely-there thong had shifted a bit, revealing her full butt crack to the world. The woman was in the midst of adjusting her wardrobe when a wave washed a frantically paddling tiny right into her ass. You could only watch as the woman snapped her thong back into her crack, smiled, and swam off, totally oblivious to the passenger she was now carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of the world on your shoulders was crushing. One look far down the beach showed Quinn dragging the drunken sorority sisters off to Brigitte\u2019s office, confirming that she would be of no help to you. Saving the tinies now suffering was the sole job for you, and one that you now had to face with steely resolve. You were a tiny lifeguard, dammit. Time to guard the lives of tinies!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSimple task for day one, Hunter.\u201d Brigitte explained, crossing her powerful arms in front of her chest. \u201cI need you to walk the beach, up and down. It\u2019s a two mile stretch that comprises Sanderson Beach\u2026so it\u2019ll take a while for someone of your size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but were a little confused. \u201cI can do that. Any particular reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrigitte smiled. \u201cOf course, dude. I need you to help anyone who might be in need. Maybe someone is lost? Maybe someone lost someTHING? Maybe a kid wants a friend to play with for an hour? Maybe someone wants a quick lesson in proper swimming postures?\u201d Brigitte shrugged casually. \u201cIt could really be anything. You never know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay. Thanks for the heads up!\u201d You said. You were about to turn and end the conversation when your new boss held up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! One catch first, man.\u201d She sat back down and leaned forward in her chair, steepling her fingers. \u201cI need to hear you tell me exactly who you helped and what you did for them at the end of today\u2019s shift. If you didn\u2019t help out at least one person\u2026\u201d She made a cutting motion with her hand across her throat. \u201c\u2026the deal\u2019s off. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightest bit nervous, you nodded anyway. \u201cO-of course! Got it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then!\u201d Brigitte beamed, then turned her expression on Quinn. \u201cQuinn, girl, go ahead out. Drop Hunter off when you make it to the middle tower. He\u2019s on his own from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn dipped her head almost imperceptibly. \u201cOf course. See you later.\u201d With that, your black-haired roommate turned on her heel and strode out of the door. You clung to her thumb to avoid falling off her palm, especially as the flat pavement gave way to the sandy dunes of Sanderson Beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beating down like crazy today, and the temperature was quite sweltering. Thankfully, you\u2019d lathered up in a bit of sunscreen earlier, and because of your small size, the slightest breeze felt like a storming wind. Thus, you kept cool relatively easily. Still, you were surprised how packed the beach was for still being before noon. Apparently, everyone else was willing to brave the weather for a nice and relaxing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Quinn reached the base of the middle tower, she gently lowered you to the ground. With relief, you found the sand to be just firm enough to hold your weight without you sinking in. It was still an overwhelming experience to look out from the ground all around the beach. It was like a vast desert wonderland\u2026or perhaps wasteland was the better term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up at Quinn, you shielded your eyes from the sun and gave her a thumbs up. Surprisingly, Quinn returned your thumbs up, before sliding on sunglasses and scaling the ladder up to the top of the middle lifeguard tower. You were momentarily distracted (for the third time in less than an hour) by the sight of Quinn\u2019s magnificently shapely butt bounce as she climbed the ladder, and then you began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it wasn\u2019t much more than a speck in the distance, you could make out the right tower. If you had to guess, it was a little less than a mile away. Once reaching that tower, your plan was to double back, pass the middle tower, and then hit the left tower. You would then have completed one and a half laps across the beach, and taking your size into account, it would probably be time to go home by then. Hopefully you would have helped at least one person by then, and maybe even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first five minutes of walking were simple and easy. Because of your size, walking across the sand was more like walking on normal ground, just with a few small hills and valleys every so often. It wasn\u2019t too bad, all things considered, though it was a little disheartening to turn around and see the comparably small distance you\u2019d covered from the middle tower in that time. Still, your whole life had prepared you for this, and you had more than enough stamina and endurance to keep up a good pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first troubling encounter happened after fifteen minutes. You had been walking in the direction of a woman who seemed nervous, and she was glancing around. Inferring that she was in need of a lifeguard such as yourself, you doubled your speed towards the woman, growing closer by the second. However, this single-minded drive to reach the woman had the obvious downside of blinding you to everything else in your peripheral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, you were caught completely off guard when a young girl came sprinting by, laughing and giggling. Like a truck slamming into you, the little girl\u2019s foot crashed down onto you, her petite heel digging into your body. In the blink of an eye, you were crushed flat. The girl\u2019s weight also indented the sand around your body, leaving a curved imprint in the ground. When she took another step and raced off, you were left stuck to the ground by the pressure, though thankfully not too crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was only slightly relieving, as a second later, the girl\u2019s titanic mother strolled above you, her giant feet on either side of you. She was calling out to her daughter in an amused tone, warning her to slow down. While you were still reforming, the mother, never once looking down, rolled her eyes at her daughter\u2019s antics and then unfurled a towel from her bag. She then began to spread the towel out\u2026directly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on by this horrifying sight, you focused all your efforts and popped back into 3D, but you were a millisecond too late. The towel, a large, fluffy thing decorated in flower patterns, descending, falling over all of the ground around you like a veil from above. It touched the sand, forcing you onto your stomach, but thankfully not squishing you. You were still able to crawl along your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, crawl you did. You dashed madly along the coarse sands, scrambling like a demon-possessed crab. You had no idea where you were going in the darkness, but finally a sliver of light revealed itself. Pushing out into the light, you popped out from under the towel, and basked in the sunlight. A moment of reflection revealed that you had lost your shirt, probably when scrambling under the towel. It must\u2019ve ripped off. At least you still had your red swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, you saw the woman who had inadvertently thrown such a wrench into your day settle down onto her towel and pull out a novel to read. Looking away from her, you glumly saw the woman you had been intending to help all along graciously receiving aid from Quinn, of all people. In reality, you were still no more than fifty yards from the middle tower, and so your roommate had taken it upon herself to help out the nervous woman. She had no clue she\u2019d robbed you of your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also had no clue that you were so close, a fact evidenced by how close she came to stomping on you as she walked back towards the tower. You had tried to call out to her, only for your voice to be drowned out by a cawing seagull. As such, you had dove to the side to avoid her powerful stride, and watched as she sauntered on by, presumably off to help someone else in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beginning to dawn on you that perhaps signing on to be a lifeguard was a bad idea, but you were far from ready to throw in the towel yet. You had to prove yourself to Brigitte and Quinn that you were capable of doing this. You had to prove to YOURSELF that you were a strong and dependable tiny that people could rely on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for another thirty minutes, never once giving up on scanning your surroundings for people in need or threats to your safety. Twice more you spotted someone who looked like they could use assistance, but after having to dodge someone stepping on you, found that Quinn had made it to them first. It was beginning to tick you off, but you were angrier at fate for being cruel than your roommate for just doing her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you came upon a group of college-aged girls rounding up enough volunteers to start a volleyball game. None of them looked like they needed help, so you kept walking, but you were quite distracted by just how beautiful the girls were, and how revealing their swimsuits were too. There were seven gorgeous giantesses gathered on the sandy court by the volleyball net, and they seemed to be looking for one more to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you heard pounding footsteps coming from behind you. Eyes widening in panic, you whirled around to face another girl who was running towards you at top speed. She had an excited expression on her face, and her eyes were locked fully on the volleyball group behind you. You realized that she was probably going to join them as their eighth player. You also realized how oblivious this girl was to your existence, and how close her pounding feet were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing up in a panic, you willed yourself to dodge out of the way of her slamming feet and find safety. How successful are you?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, though you only tensed up for a split second, it was exactly that moment of hesitation that cost you. You dove to the side to avoid the girl\u2019s foot, but a bit too late. Her powerful stride carrying her forward at a fast pace, the girl didn\u2019t feel a thing as her big toe slammed into your miniscule body. Already moving to try to avoid her, the impact sent you flying twice as fast and far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around in circles, your limbs flailing, and your cries of shock drowned out by the wind, your bug-sized body sailed through the air with ease. Flying another twenty yards down the beach, a strong breeze carried you an additional distance alongside the oblivious girl\u2019s knockout kick. While she happily joined the other college girls for an exciting game of volleyball, you were quite literally tossed aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you came to a landing, impacting rather roughly onto the plush red towel of some beach goer. The impact flattened your body, but you soon began reforming. Popping back to normal shape, you sat up and took notice of the giantess beside you, who was digging around for something in her bag, her back to you. She looked to be in her thirties, and was quite beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think of speaking up (or before you could decide if you even wanted to speak up, or just keep walking), the woman swore under her breath and turned around. However, her eyes didn\u2019t scan your miniscule body, and were instead behind you. Turning your head, you noted a second bag behind you, and also realized just how large this towel was, spread out to its full length. It was probably accommodating two people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was hardly a pressing concern though, as the woman shuffled over to the second bag, sliding her knees along the towel. Not wanting to be steamrolled by her, you scrambled out of the way, just barely avoiding her. You rolled aside, dodging her knee, but the woman\u2019s foot still slapped into your body, knocking you off balance and onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from that, you vaguely took note of the woman retrieve a pair of sunglasses from the second bag, smile victoriously, and put them on her face. She then shuffled back towards you, but you were far enough away that her legs and feet weren\u2019t close to crushing you. Feeling safe, you rolled onto your back and pushed yourself up to your feet. Clearing your throat in preparation to talk to this woman and ask if she needed help, you paused to catch your breath and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same breath came out in a sputtering gasp, causing you to cough. In the seconds you\u2019d been looking away, the woman had casually undone the straps of her bikini behind her back, and was now lying her top down. She was utterly naked from the waist up, and her gigantic boobs swayed gently as she smiled and stretched. Her perky tits then began to get closer and closer, and some muted part of your brain screamed at you that she was lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat muted part didn\u2019t matter much, and you merely stood there, slack-jawed, as the gorgeous woman laid out on her towel. Her left breast, gargantuan in size, crashed down onto you, smooth pillowy flesh smooshing you flatter than a pancake. The weight crushed you down, molding your miniscule body into a blobby shape beneath her tit. The pain and the pleasure of the situation fought for control over your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain won out, especially as the woman wiggled a bit to get comfortable, her hefty breasts dragging across the soft towel back and forth, copious flesh jiggling substantially. Her left boob ground you to dust beneath her, the weight and pressure easily enough to smear your pathetic little body. In seconds, the woman smudged you into a smear on her flesh, your own body easily sticking to her own, especially with the faint layer of sweat already accumulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you felt the woman stop moving, and knew that she had finally gotten comfortable. By now, your moral and logical senses had returned, but it was far too late now. All you could do was feel immense shame that you\u2019d let yourself be crushed because you were too busy ogling a naked giantess. Of course, you also felt pain and discomfort, but that was to be expected. You were buried entirely beneath her breast, no light or air reaching you. You were just under her nipple, and sticking to her more and more each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate, however, actually decided to throw you some semblance of a bone. At that moment, the woman\u2019s good friend (who you had inferred to exist) returned from the brief errand she\u2019d run off to do. Walking up to the towel, she grinned and waved a modest-sized bottle in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose! I got the suntan oil at the beach shop!\u201d The woman said cheerily. \u201cCan\u2019t believe we forgot our own.\u201d She finally made it to the towel and plopped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of what she had said went unnoticed by you, as the majority of sounds from the outside world were a muffled, muted mess. The woman lying on you, apparently named Rose, had breasts easily heavy and plump enough to bury you so thoroughly that sounds were blocked out. However, you could feel the vibrations of the other woman as she sat, and you were able to hear Rose\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice. Bout time.\u201d Rose replied, sleepily. She yawned. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve needed this day to relax and tan. Stephanie drives me crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman laughed. \u201cReally? I think your daughter is a perfect little angel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose laughed and sighed, the action causing her breasts the vibrate, hot flesh slapping against your body. \u201cYou only say that because your own kid is away at college, Becky. Stephanie can be a monster if she\u2019s throwing a tantrum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman, Becky, smiled, and began shaking the bottle of tanning oil. \u201cIf you say so, Rose. But yes, you\u2019re right. This day will certainly be heavenly for the two of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose, knowing she needed to fully lather up before drifting off to sleep, managed to pull herself back up into a sitting position. Stuck as you were to her tit, all you could see was darkness, but you could once more feel fresh air and the sun on your back. You did have to fight the urge to not vomit though, as the act of Rose sitting up caused her prodigious chest to shake gratuitously, jostling you around as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then! Hit me! Lather me up!\u201d Rose said, spreading her arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky rolled her eyes. \u201cUgh, Rose, what are you? Ten? We\u2019re both adults, and we both know that after I lather you up, you\u2019ll fall asleep before doing me! Don\u2019t you know how hard it is to rub that oil in all the right spots by myself?\u201d Becky, with a faint blush, gestured to her curvy body, comparable in size to Rose\u2019s own hourglass figure. Their developed bodies made sense, as they were both in their thirties, but you couldn\u2019t help but notice how many gorgeous giantesses life kept throwing you at (literally, in this case).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose only grinned, lowered her sunglasses, and winked at Becky. Becky groaned, but knew it was no use arguing with stubborn Rose. Sliding closer to her friend, Becky popped the cap on the tanning oil, but then her eyes zeroed in on you. Rose, having not tanned in a while, had a skin tone that was a shade lighter than your own tanned color. Thus, you stood out, but only as a weird smudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Hold on, Rose. Got something stuck to you. Little sticker, maybe?\u201d Becky suggested, licking her finger for leverage and then jamming it into Rose\u2019s left breast, right above your body. Angling her finger, Becky wedged her fingernail between you and Rose\u2019s hot flesh, and managed to peel you free in one swift movement. Rose bit her lip the whole time, lest she break out into ticklish laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Becky didn\u2019t spare more than a second to flick you off of her finger and down onto the ground. You didn\u2019t drift far, landing by Becky\u2019s leg, but the curvaceous woman had already turned her attention back to Rose. While you lie in a heap on the ground, slowly working on reforming, Becky methodically and tirelessly oiled up all of Rose\u2019s body. The entire process took ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you nearly reformed, Becky finished, and Rose gave her a thumbs up. \u201cThanks, Becky! I\u2019ll be looking sexy in no time!\u201d The woman laughed, and then laid back down on her stomach. Thankfully, you were a far enough distance from her, but the sight of her now oiled-up boobs impacting on the towel still gave you a minor fright. True to Becky\u2019s statement earlier, Rose was totally forcing Becky to do her own oiling, which was a little rude. In moments, Rose was breathing peacefully, seemingly asleep already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026she\u2019s out. Already. Wish <b><i>I</i></b> had some help.\u201d Becky rolled her eyes. Sighing, the giantess unhooked her own bikini top, and then moved to set her top down. As she did so, her eyes finally aligned with your own, and the two of you locked gazes. By this point, you were back on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your frantically prepared speech explaining who you were fell apart because of Becky\u2019s unexpected disrobing. Once more, you found yourself incapable of speech or thought, eyes glued to Becky\u2019s large, perfectly round, and perfectly nude breasts. You fought with every fiber of your being to look Becky in the eye and explain this whole situation, but she beat you to it, opening her mouth to speak.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAw! Are you a little tiny lifeguard? How cute!\u201d Becky gushed, her gorgeous face breaking out into a pleasing smile. Her reaction was not at all what you expected, and it threw you off even more than you already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, trying to stammer out a coherent response. \u201cU-uh\u2026um\u2026y-yes. Yes. That\u2019s me\u2026uh\u2026the t-tiny lifeguard.\u201d You fumbled your reply, earning a giggle from the titanic giantess. Your eyes frantically flicked all over the place, from the towel at your feet, to Becky\u2019s radiant face, to her utterly gigantic bare breasts that jiggled just a bit as she laughed at your embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mister Lifeguard\u2026what\u2019s a cutie like you doing here with me? A bit naughty to spy on a woman naked and ready to suntan.\u201d Becky theatrically pouted, curling her sensual lips into a mock frown, and she tsked at you. Your face burned bright red at the remark, and Becky laughed again. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, poor thing. I\u2019m not angry\u2026I\u2019d actually say I\u2019m flattered, if anything. Been a while since an adorable thing like you paid me any mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was referencing her age, but you found her statement hard to believe. Becky was a vision, even if she was in her thirties. Honestly, maturity had only developed her beauty further. Her reddish-brown locks framed her alluring face, her smooth milky white skin free of any blemish or mark. Her aforementioned curves were truly off-the-scale in terms of roundness and bounciness. Though you weren\u2019t perverted enough to spend your days scouring the internet for porn or explicit content, you did know exactly what term Becky would be described as: a milf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you tried to steady yourself. \u201cY-yes, I was just hired by Sanderson Beach. Today, in fact. My first job was to look around the beach for anyone who might need help, and then aid them if I can.\u201d You gave Becky a thumbs-up, causing the giantess woman to smile warmly. \u201cSo, since I\u2019m here, give me a task and I\u2019ll set right to it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired woman\u2019s eyes widened at your bold claim, then settled into a happy look of contentment. She grinned, her perfect teeth nearly shining. \u201cWell, how generous of you, you little stud. I was just lamenting about how I didn\u2019t have anyone to help me with\u2026this!\u201d She said, reaching behind herself to grab the bottle of tanning lotion. That one simple movement along shook her abundant chest wildly, drawing your gaze right back to her naked breasts. You couldn\u2019t help but gape, and this didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness.\u201d Becky smirked playfully, the faintest hint of pink in her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019d think a tiny like you had never seen a woman before!\u201d She laughed as you feebly attempted to clamp your jaw shut and look you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry\u2026for staring. Being here on the beach is\u2026overwhelming, to be honest.\u201d You admitted. \u201cYou ARE very beautiful, too.\u201d You added, hoping that a compliment would smooth things over. The last thing you wanted was to get fired on your first day for perving on the beach goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was unintended, to say the least. Becky\u2019s smile vanished, replaced instead by an open-mouth expression, and the blush in her cheeks burned brighter. She recovered a moment later, easing back into her warm, alluring smile. She also shifted forward, scooping you up into her palm with warning, while simultaneously lying out on the towel on her back. You bit back your cry of surprise, and let her dangle you then place you on the expansiveness of her lean stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t guessed, you adorable charmer, I need you to help lather me up for my tan.\u201d Becky explained, winking at you. \u201cI\u2019ll drop some tanning lotion onto my tummy, then you can spread it all around my body\u2026and I do mean, everywhere. I wouldn\u2019t want any uneven tan, right?\u201d Becky\u2019s angelic face radiated mischief and a hint of sensuality. \u201cSomething tells me that you won\u2019t mind giving me a rubdown, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sort of reply fumbled out of your mouth after a tease like that, and you merely gave the nude goddess a weak nod. Becky laughed once more, her stomach shaking and nearly tossing you off, before she uncapped the lotion bottle and deposited a hefty glob right beside you. After doing so, she slid some sunglasses onto her face, and propped her head up on a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, little guy. Lather me up!\u201d She grinned, and winked again. \u201cCould even be a reward in it for you if you do a good job. I\u2019ll definitely make sure your boss knows that you\u2019re the best, hottest lifeguard on this beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by the brown-haired woman\u2019s words, you gave another pitiful nod, and then approached the glob of lotion. Knowing the quickest way to finish the job was also the grossest, you slapped your whole body into the veritable mountain of lotion, coating your body in the sticky substance. You then began walking across, rolling across, and rubbing your hands across Becky\u2019s smooth stomach, effortlessly gliding over her skin while effectively covering her in tanning lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, you noted the bemused smile on Becky\u2019s face, and figured that she was no doubt satisfied with your work and surprised by your ingenuity. Truthfully, you\u2019d done this exact same thing to your mother plenty of times in the past, though she always had at least SOME clothes on, and of course never teased you about it. Your experience was coming in handy now, though, but you definitely wouldn\u2019t say that you had expected to lather up a sexy, nude, flirtatious woman your first day on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t too long before Becky\u2019s stomach was all done, including along her sides. Of course, that left only her titanic tits in need of a good lotion lathering. Reapplying an almost armor-like coat of lotion onto yourself, you trekked over to Becky\u2019s breasts, and had to pause to stare at the sheer size of them. Twin peaks, massive yet perfectly rounded, with just the right amount of jiggliness. Their incredible size just about blocked out Becky\u2019s face from the angle you were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScaling them proved to be an entirely different beast, and one that your tiny body almost couldn\u2019t complete. As slick as you were, it was nearly impossible to scrambled up Becky\u2019s right breast. Her skin, perfectly smooth and soft as it was, offered nearly nonexistent grip, and a faint sheen of sweat all across her body certainly didn\u2019t help. You only succeeded by dashing up in a quick, desperate burst, sinking your hands and feet into her plump boobs to balance yourself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Becky\u2019s perspective, this was nothing short of adorable hilariousness, and she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Her breasts swayed and shook as she giggled at your plight, and you stumbled backwards. Flailing your arms to keep from falling back down, you pitched forward, but merely ended up falling on your face instead. Well, you fell on your face, but your entire body also fell right onto Becky\u2019s pink nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky\u2019s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced instead by a playful smirk. \u201cOh? Is the little lifeguard getting a facefull while still on the job? Shame on him. What a horrible tiny perv?\u201d Becky\u2019s expression was one of mock indignation, and a faint blush had returned to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to push yourself back up to your feet, when you were suddenly shoved down hard into Becky\u2019s nipple. It was Becky herself, daintily poking your body with her finger. Though she smiled innocently, anyone could see the glint of mischief and something more in her eyes. Lazily, she traced a circle around her nipple, dragging your body around and around while still squeezing you into her doughy breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was maddening for multiple reasons, both the fact that Becky was interfering with the job, and the fact that this naked woman was massaging you into her nipple. The feeling welling up inside you for the past fifteen minutes finally burst forth despite your honest attempts to stop it, and you felt yourself growing aroused. Of course, your hardening crotch was instantly squished flat by the force Becky was applying on your miniscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it had still been quite clearly felt. Becky\u2019s eyes widened, as did her triumphant grin. \u201cAh, so you ARE enjoying this, huh, cutie? My, my! This really might be the best beach day ever!\u201d Becky laughed melodically, and looked over at her friend, Rose. Rose was still sleeping like a rock, and Becky knew she\u2019d remain that way for hours if left undisturbed. Becky was pleased with the knowledge that she truly had you all to herself. Maybe it wasn't proper, but it was so much fun, conduct be damned. You were just irresistibly cute to her, and your own obvious attraction to her naked glory was icing on the flirtatious cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky released you, finally, but only after you felt the ground beneath you harden and begin to poke into you. It only took you a second to grasp the fact that Becky was being aroused by her teasing and playing with you, and that doubled your panic. This naked woman, to put it bluntly, had total control over you in this intimate of a situation. There was no telling what she\u2019d do if her desire to mess with you kept growing. Even still, you weren\u2019t about to quit this job until you\u2019d lathered her up completely. You weren\u2019t the type to give up, no matter the adversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up and trying (and failing) to hide your erection, you avoided looking Becky in the eye and went back to rubbing lotion across her boobs. Your peripheral still caught the sight of Becky\u2019s sensual gaze and her softly biting her lower lip. That image sent shivers down your spine, and you hoped that ignoring it would keep her \u2018playfulness\u2019 at bay.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Given your tiny size, you'd dodged your fair share of giant feet in your life, though running on sand certainly made it harder. As soon as her shadow passed over your body, you dived forward with everything you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash of her foot hitting the sand right next to you rattled your eardrums, but that's all. With another bounding step she was gone, leaving you watching her bouncing ass as she strode to the volleyball court. Still, the volleyball girls were far too busy to try and talk to, and they didn't seem to need any help. With a sigh, you continued down the beach, keeping an eye out for those in need of assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you came to a giant brunette woman laying on her stomach on a beach towel. She looked about your age. Her bronzed skin contrasted sharply with the hot pink color of her bikini. Her bikini bottoms at least seemed to have their work cut out for them, barely containing her large rump. You walked up in front of her face, though her dark brown eyes seemed distracted by her cell phone at the moment, and she didn't see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello miss, can I be of any assistance?\" You asked, trying to sound more confident than you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked up from her cell phone, surprised by your voice. When she saw your tiny body standing in front of her, hands on your hips, she couldn't help but giggle. \"And who might you be little guy?\" She asked, putting her phone down on the towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Hunter, and I'm a newly hired lifeguard.\" This seemed to be going well so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hunter, my name is Dana, and you caught me at a perfect time. I do have a bit of a situation and I could really use some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Whatever you need!\" You were thrilled that you found someone who needed your help, and couldn't accept fast enough. Your job was on the line after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'm so glad, it's very lucky you came along. You're the perfect size for what I have in mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little caught off guard by that. Your tiny size usually caused problems for you, so it was pretty surprising that she thought it would actually help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? What exactly do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana smiled and reached down and picked you up off the sand, bringing you towards her face. She smiled as she whispered her answer to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"I've got a bunch of sand in my ass and it's driving my crazy, I was hoping you could handle it.\" Dana lays on her stomach and slides you into her bikini bottom, demanding that you clean all the sand out of her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"It's too hot today, I could use a sweat rag for my tits.\" Before you can object, she smushes you flat and uses you to mop the sweat off of her breasts before tossing you aside and returning to tanning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"I'm starving, and I think you'll hit the spot.\" Dana shoves you into her mouth and starts to chew on your gummy body. Will Quinn notice?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(Inspired by and set in the world of A Shrunken College Student - <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2178043-A-Shrunken-College-Student\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2178043-A-Shrunken-Colleg...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Backstory (written by Hectic)</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot has changed in the past 25 years since the great shrinking epidemic swept across the world. In an event that some called a medical mystery and others called an act of god, a type of shrinking virus spread to every corner of the earth, affecting part of the population while leaving another part completely fine. Those who fell victim to this virus rapidly shrunk down to one inch tall, but at the same time gained a strange durability and malleability that has baffled scientists and doctors alike. However, the tiny people were not ones to complain about these newfound characteristics, as they were the only things preventing their lives from being taken by a stray step or anything else of that nature. The third most interesting aspect about this inexplicable shrinking is the fact that only men seem to have suffered from it, with women across the world remaining completely unaffected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the first day of the shrinking event it was expected that society would change drastically, and while it definitely did, surprisingly much of it remained the same. There was no evil women\u2019s takeover or forced servitude of the now smaller men. For the most part, many men who had a job that did not require physical labor of any kind were able to continue living somewhat normal lives. Certain laws were put into place which prevented too much malicious behavior from befalling the tiny men, but these were really only enforced when a woman would purposefully try to kill, kidnap, or otherwise torture them. The vast majority of the time women would get away with any accidents between them and the tiny guys with a small slap on the wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Your Story</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 25 years since the shrinking pandemic, and the world has fallen into a pretty standard cycle once more. People have (more-or-less) adapted to the drastic changes in daily life, and the abnormal has become routine. You were born tiny, and have lived your whole life at the measly size of one inch. Life's been rough sometimes, but you're still alive and kicking. You've just graduated from Wentworth University after four years of college life, and have no idea what to do next. Searching for a cheap apartment online, you found a spacious offering in a suburban community called \"Sanderson\", with a deal to spilt the rent four ways, with three other people. Agreeing to these awesome terms, you got caught up in your excitement and forgot to click the <i>\"Apartments for Tinies Only\"</i> button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Main Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hunter Woods (You)</u> - The main character, and 21 years old. You have tanned skin, and are decently muscular due to how often you find yourself climbing/lifting things. You've got a head of sandy brown hair and similarly brown eyes, and you tend to consider yourself fairly attractive. You're good at a lot of things, but never settled on a specific career path and instead went with a basic degree in Communications (how clich\u00e9). You tend to be pretty outgoing and extroverted, which can get you into trouble from time to time. You aren't sure of what your future holds for you, but you're open to all possibilities. You can also be slightly perverted, but not in a truly creepy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Morgan Sinclair </u>- One of your new roommates, and 22 years old. She has dark tanned skin, long and wavy chocolate brown hair worn straight down, and hazel eyes. She stands at 6'0\", and her presence can be a bit intimidating due to her height and her toned, decently muscular body. This, however, is a complete disservice to her personality. Morgan is energetic, friendly, compassionate, and has a good sense of humor. She's willing to help out anyone in need, at any time. She just so happens to also love exercising and playing sports, which has lent itself to her tanned skin and toned physique. It's hard to ignore her physical charms too, as her sizable, firm curves are incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan has just landed a job as an employee at the local gym, \"Workout World\", where she is assigned to help patrons in need, clean up used equipment and the like, and occasionally teach weekly yoga classes. In her spare time, Morgan exercises constantly, and has joined up with the Sanderson community basketball team that plays matches down at the local park. She makes friends easily, and isn't above teasing those closest to her. People can always turn to her for camaraderie and support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Avery Sinclair </u>- One of your new roommates, and 22 years old. She is Morgan's twin sister, though the similarities mostly stop there. While she has the same dark tanned skin tone, her hair is dyed with streaks of bright pink, and often worn in a ponytail. She's a fair bit shorter, standing at 5'8\", though still miles taller than someone like you. Avery possesses Morgan's positive traits, but dialed up to eleven. She's extremely happy-go-lucky, bouncy, and carefree. Prone to fits of laughter and huge smiles, Avery brightens the day of everyone she comes into contact with. She's blessed with the same bountiful body as Morgan, but due to a little less exercise, her curvy chest and butt are a bit heftier and jigglier than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery recently scored a well-paying gig as a model at a local photo agency, \"Starlight Studios\", which has always been a dream of hers. Smiling for the camera while clad in some of the most scandalous and revealing outfits imaginable is nothing to a girl with so much body positivity. This confidence bleeds over into her social life, as Avery can come off as overly affectionate and flirtatious from time-to-time, along with being a bit of a prankster. On top of this, Avery is frequently teased by Morgan for being scatterbrained and oblivious, often at the worst possible times. Avery doesn't let this get her down (and by extension, doesn't try to fix her airheaded tendencies). Heaven forbid someone gives her any alcohol. She is also openly bi-sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Quinn Wallace </u>- One of your new roommates, and 23 years old. Quinn has paler, smooth and milky skin in comparison to the Sinclair sisters, and her dark black hair is cut in a short bob, bangs covering one of Quinn's piercing blue eyes. Quinn is a tad shorter than Morgan, standing at 5'10\", and her demeanor frequently turns people off from her. Quinn is soft-spoken and reserved, with a seemingly apathetic attitude towards life. When she does speak, it's usually biting sarcasm. In reality, Quinn just doesn't know how to fully open up and express herself, and doesn't mean to push others away. Ironically, Quinn still draws in so many people wanting to know her, and for a reason completely out of her control: her body. Quinn won the genetic lottery, and is a very curvaceous young woman in all respects. She thinks of herself as \"fat\", but most people would call her \"thicc\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn applied for a job on a whim in an attempt to get outside more often, and was actually hired. As such, she's the newest lifeguard working at \"Sanderson Beach\", tasked with looking over the beach and helping any one in need. She hasn't had to actually rescue anyone yet, and always lathers up with veritable buckets of sunscreen to keep her pale skin safe in the heat of the day. It takes her a long time to open up to other people, and she can be standoffish until she fully trusts someone. She shares some of Avery's obliviousness, but half the time it is because nothing really bothers her enough for her to take notice. If it involves tinies, she'll often treat them in a manner akin to \"tough love\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Minor Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To be added in the future!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Quick Rules</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is written in second person (you, your, etc.) Please keep it that way. However, if you want to write a bit from someone else's perspective, third person can work for that when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter cannot die. He can only be squished, squashed, flattened, stretched, and anything else you think of. He will reform in time, given the chance to do so. Keep the story going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry not to write chapters that are exceptionally short. A bridge chapter from time to time is just fine, but too many and the story starts feeling weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, avoid heavily sexual/insertion content and any giant male content. Basically, just don't introduce any other guys into the story, UNLESS they too are tiny. That could be interesting (just make sure Hunter is always the main character). Everything else goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRead, add, and enjoy!</td>",
